                  TIMOTHY
                   TYRRELL
               



            , Esq. sworn. - Q. You are Remembrancer of the City of London
? - A. Yes; the prisoner, Newton, was a servant
 of mine at the time I lost the property, in the capacity of footman
; there had been a number of articles missed before those mentioned in the indictment; they were supposed to have been taken by some workmen. On Sunday, the 18th of November, he was apprehended by Clark, the Marshalfman, and carried to the New Compter. I desired Clark to call upon me in his way back from the Compter, and we would search his boxes, and in his box, which was in his bed-room, this pocket-book was found in my presence by Clark, the Marshalsman, and, among other duplicates in it, were found these two, which led to the property mentioned in the indictment. On the Monday I applied to the pawnbrokers, and desired them to produce the articles, they are here; I know them to be mine by the marks.
Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. How did you get at the key of the box? - A. He said he had not the key about him, but it was in one of his pockets in the bed-room.
Q. And you found it exactly as he had directed you? - A. Yes; I am not sure whether it was a coat or waistcoat pocket.
Q. Were they his clothes? - A. Yes.
Q. You had other servants in your house? - A. Yes.

                   SIMPSON
               



             sworn. - I am servant so a pawnbroker, Mr. Parker, No. 175, Fleet-street, (produces all the articles mentioned in the indictment); they were brought to me by the woman prisoner, in the name of 
               
                  Ann
                   Hawkins
               



            , on the 25th of June last.
Q. Had you ever seen her before? - A. Yes, I knew her person perfectly well, I lent her eighteen shilling and six-pence upon them, and they were pledged in two parcels; she frequently brought things in the name of Mrs. Witts.
Mr. Tyrrell. I know this table-cloth to be mine by the mark TET; I have no doubt but they are all mine.
Mr. Alley. (To Simpson). Q. A person of the name of Hawkins brought these things to your house? - A. Yes.


                  Q. 
               


            And you only say they were brought by a person of that name, because you see the name of Hawkins upon the duplicate? - A. I knew her.


                  Q. 
               


            This was in the month of June last? - A. Yes.
Q. And because it is so written upon this ticket, you suppose it to be her? - A. Yes.
Q. Suppose Mr. Tyrrell had come to you, and asked you if you had any such things, could you, by looking at the articles, without looking at the duplicates, have known that they were brought by her? - A. No.


                  Q. 
               


            Therefore, it is only from that circumstance, that you say they were pledged by 
               
                  Ann
                   Hawkins
               



            ? - A. Yes.
Court. Q. Can you undertake positively to say, that the woman at the bar is the woman that pawned those things? - A. Yes, she is.

             sworn. - On Sunday, the 18th of November, I searched the prisoner's box, I took him into custody; in the box I found a pocket-book, in which were four duplicates, I gave them to Mr. Tyrrell; I unlocked the box with the key which I found in one of his pockets, I cannot say which, of some clothes that were behind the bed.


                  Q. 
               


            (To Mr. Tyrrell.) Do you yourself know any thing of Hawkins? - A. I never saw her till she was taken into custody.
Newlon's defence. I leave my defence to the Court; it is the first offence I ever committed.
Hawkins's defence. This young man came tome where I live, and asked me to do him a favour I went out with him, and he gave me a bundle to pledge; I had used the house four years with my own articles; I did not know what the contents of the bundle were.
For the Prisoner Hawkins.

             sworn. - Hawkins lived with me three years; I had sent her a great many times to pawn things for me at Mr. Parker's.


                  Q. 
               


            Is it not a common thing for one person to desire another to pawn articles for them? - A. Yes. when a payment is wanted to be made; I always found her a very honest girl.
Court. Q. What is your husband? - A. A cap tain.
Court. Q. Did she live with you in July last? - A. Yes; she at first came to me and took a room at half-a-crown a week, and then I took her to do for me, and she was with me till about three weeks ago.

I cannot recollect the man; the woman prisoner brought the parcel first, and I asked her if they were her's; she said, she would fetch the person they belonged to; she went and fetched a man in, I cannot say whether that is the man or not; I asked him if the property was his, and he said, they belonged to a brother-in-law of his that was deceased; there were opened in her presence; there was one handkerchief marked with a name at length.
Q. Do you know if she had that in her hand? - A. Not in my presence, she had not.
Mr. Tyrrell. This is a handkerchief that is marked at full length; I believe they are all mine.
Newton's defence. The crime that I was convicted of before I was innocent of, but this I am guilty of.

            . (Police-constable F 152) Between eight and nine o'clock in the evening on the 6th of August, I was in Castle-street; I saw the prisoner King put his hand into the prosecutor's pocket, and draw out his handkerchief; Nicholls was close to him, and had his arm nearly round his neck - the handkerchief was thrown down by one of them - I laid hold of King.

            . (Police-constable F 35). I was with Tipper; I saw Nicholls throw the handkerchief down; they had been following the prosecutor for some time, and we watched them.(Property produced and sworn to.)
Two witnesses gave Nicholls a good character, and his master engaged to employ him.

            . I am a watchman in the Strand. On Friday morning, the 20th of November, between one and two o'clock, a woman passed me with a bundle, just fastened on her gown. I looked at the woman; what have you got there. A little glass. I said, stop. It seemed bulky and heavy. It was a small trifle, she said; she had passed many watchman, and why should not you let me pass. At the watchhouse, she said a strange man gave her two shillings to hold them while he got a coach. I charged her at the watchhouse, and afterwards found out the prosecutor had lost these glasses.
Prosecutor. The glasses and knee-boot is mine.
Prisoner's Defence. I was walking in the street, a gentleman asked me to have something to drink, being an unfortunate girl. I said, I did not mind. I was taken with the glasses.

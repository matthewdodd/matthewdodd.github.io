MARY FELTS. I am servant to William Elliott - he is a tobacconist
. On the 17th of March the prisoner came into his shop, and asked the price of some tobacco; he was told the price, and while Mr. Elliott turned away, he stole a penknife off the counter, took it out of the shop, and gave it to another boy - I called the Police-officer, and brought the prisoner back; it was a good knife.

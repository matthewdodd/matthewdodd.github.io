1927. 




THOMAS TURNER
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
19th of June, 1 handkerchief, value 4s., the goods of 



William Hentha Paul, from his person; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






WILLIAM HENTHA PAUL
. I was passing over London Bridge at nine or ten o'clock at night on the 19th June—I felt a hand in my pocket—I turned, and the prisoner was close to me—there were two persons behind him, but not so close as him—I seized him, a scuffle ensued, during which I saw the handkerchief on the pavement nearer to him than to any body else—I do not know what became of the other two men—they had not spoken to him in my presence—the handkerchief has not been found.

Prisoner. Q. Did you see it in my hand? A. I did not—I will swear it was mine—I saw your arm come away from my coat as if you had had your hand in my pocket.

Prisoner's Defence. I was passing over the bridge—the gentleman turned, and laid hold of me—he charged me with picking his pocket, and twenty or thirty persons were round—I asked him to go over the bridge to see a policeman—I waited till he came up and gave charge of me.





PHILLIP PARISH
. (City police-constable, No. 45) I produce the certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the man who was tried and convicted.

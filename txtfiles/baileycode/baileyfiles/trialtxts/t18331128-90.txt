, and lives at the corner of Globe-road, Mile-end


. On the 29th of October this shirt was taken from the door; our foreman called out that he had got it, and I pursued the prisoner, who ran up Grove-road; he attempted to turn down Green-street, but was stopped by the policeman - this is the shirt.

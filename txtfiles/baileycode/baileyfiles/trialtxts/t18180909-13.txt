            . I am a merchant, and live in Bloomsbury-square. On the 7th of July, about half-past eleven o'clock in the morning, I was on Ludgate-hill


, and saw the prisoner, in company with two other men, following the Rev. John Austin, who is curate
 of Chevelin, near Tunbridge-the prisoner was about a hundred yards behind him, the others were on each side; the prisoner came up, put his hand into Mr. Ausin's pocket, and pulled out a pocket-book; I laid hold of him, and took the pocketbook from him. The other two went away. I never lost sight of the prisoner. The constable took him.

            . I am a constable. I took the prisoner in charge, and saw Mr. Gough take the pocket-book out of his hand.
Prisoner. I beg for mercy.

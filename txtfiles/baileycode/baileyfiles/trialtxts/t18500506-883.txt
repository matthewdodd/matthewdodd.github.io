883. 




EDWIN EDWARDS



, feloniously uttering a forged order for the delivery of goods, with intent to defraud 



William Bullock; having been before convicted.






WILLIAM BULLOCK
. I am a silk-manufacturer, of Paternoster-row. This order was brought by the prisoner to me on 19th April, and in consequence of it I delivered him two lengths of ruby velvet, six yards, and one yard and a half—these are them; they are my property.

Cross-examined by
MR. ROBINSON. Q. Is it the prisoner's father's signature that is put to this order? A. Yes; I have supplied him with goods—he has been in the habit of sending me orders very similar to this.






HENRY THOMAS EDWARDS
. I am a cabinet-maker. The name at the bottom of this order is not mine (read); it is very like my son's writing—I think it is his, but am not quite positive—he can write two or three hands.

Cross-examined. Q. I believe he has been at sea some time?A. Yes, about four years—I have the means of getting him to sea again.





THOMAS BRADLEY
 (City-policeman,269). I took the prisoner—I said he was charged with obtaining goods by false pretences—he said, "Mr. Bullock's, I suppose?"—I said, "Yes"—I produce a certificate of his former conviction at this Court—(read—Convicted Feb. 1846, confined six months)—he is the person. 



GUILTY. Aged 21.—Recommended to mercy by the Prosecutor.—






Transported for Seven Tears.

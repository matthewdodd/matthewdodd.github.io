            . I live in the Strand


; I have two shops, one a cabinet-maker's, the other in the jewellery way
, within one door of each of other; my sister and a servant live in the jewellery shop. On the 29th of June I was called up between five and six in the morning, the window was cut through of that shop, and some rings and several things taken out; these things mentioned in the indictment I lost, and more. I applied to Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



             on the Monday, to get hand bills dispersed, and on the Tuesday night I was sent for to Sir John's; there was the prisoner and another person, and the things mentioned in the indictment were produced by Wright; (produced in court and deposed to;) here are the private marks of the shop on them.

                  Jones 
               



            . I am an engraver and enameller; Mallet, 
               
                  John 
                  Williams 
               



            , and I, went to the prosecutor's shop, as we had before agreed; Stevens and 
               
                  Charles 
                  White 
               



             helped us, they have not been heard of since; we broke a hole, and took the things out, I believe these things here are the same; then we went in to the Almonry, to one Doleman's, a public-house; Stevens went to bed there, Malletland and I went to the Red Lion in Piccadilly; we got up in the morning, and met Stevens in the Hay-market; he told us, Justice Fielding's people were about with bills; then we went to Doleman's, there we left the boxes and necklaces; Stevens sold some to a Jew; Mallet and I were taken that night in Cranbourn-alley, by 
               
                  Henry 
                  Wright 
               



            , his brother Edward, and one Cornish; they took us to the 
               
                  Brown 
                  Bear 
               



            , and sent for the prosecutor, and these things were taken out of Mallet's pocket.


                  Henry 
                  Wright 
               



            . I, my brother, and Mr. Cornish, who keeps the tap in Tothill fields, Bridewell were coming through Cranbourn-alley; there were Mallet and this evidence, and a woman between them, talking very busy; Mallet had been in custody three or four times before; I catched hold on Mallet's hands, I saw he was going to throw something down upon seeing us; he had a rag in his hand; I felt something in it; I put it in my pocket, and I laid hold of Jones, and took them to the 
               
                  Brown 
                  Bear 
               



             in Bow-street; there I opened the rag and there were thirty four rings in it; there was Mr. Marsden, he sent me to the prosecutor, he came and owned them: the prisoner said before Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            , he found them along with Williams.

             confirmed the account Wright had given.
Prisoner's defence.
I met Williams in Long-acre; he told me he had been about the country, and had got some rings and things to sell; he asked me if I knew where he could sell them; he gave them to me, and I said I would try if I could sell them.

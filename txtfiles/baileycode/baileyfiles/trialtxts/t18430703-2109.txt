CHARLES SHARPE
 was indicted

 for burglariously breaking and entering the dwelling-house of 



George Desvignes, about four o'clock in the night of the 
18th of June, at St. James, Westminster, with intent to steal.






GEORGE DESVIGNES
. I am a diamond merchant, and live at No. 2, Golden-square, in the parish of St. James. On the 19th of June, about four o'clock in the morning, I was awoke by the policeman springing a rattle—I looked out of window—the policeman said something—I west down directly, and found the prisoner lying under the table in my dining-room—I opened the door, let in the policeman, and gave him in charge.





HENRY HICKMAN
. I am Mr. Desvignet's servant. I shut the shutters that night—I do not think I put the black bolt up—I put the bar up—when I came down, after the alarm, I found it open.


Prisoner. Q. Did not you find the bar as you left it at night? A. Yes—there was a long bar which I put up, and found it at I left it—there are two divisions in one shutter—you had opened the top shutter, which I had shut, but I suppose not fastened—I cannot say whether I had fastened it or not—the upper window-sash was not quite up to the top.





JOHN CROSSLEY
 (policeman.) I was in Golden-square on the night in question, and saw two men standing on the outside of the pavement opposite No. 2—I looked at them a little while, and saw the upper sash of the window drum down—I ran up, and saw the prisoner look out of the window—the other two men drew my attention to it—I was on the other side of the square—I alarmed the house, went in, and found the prisoner under the table—he gave no account of himself, but pretended to be drunk—he had got on the top of some rails, pulled down the top sash of the window, and climbed over the lower sash.

Prisoner's Defence. I was in liquor, and as I found the house to, I got in to get out of the policeman's way.




GUILTY
. Aged 26.—


Transported for Fifteen Years.

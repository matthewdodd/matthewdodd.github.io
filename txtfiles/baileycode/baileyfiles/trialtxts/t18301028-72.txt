            . I am a merchant
. I was near the Golden-cross, Charing-cross


, on Sunday evening, at eight o'clock; I felt my handkerchief taken from my pocket; I turned round, and it was given to me by a little boy; the prisoner was walking quietly away - he had been close behind me, and no one could have taken it but him; he turned to the right and crossed the road - I had a friend with me on my left.

            . I was at Charing-cross, and the prisoner was walking away from the gentleman, after taking his handkerchief - the gentleman laid hold of him; he threw it down, and I took it up; no one was near him at the time.
Prisoner. It is quite false - I was passing, and the handkerchief was thrown on me; I threw it down directly - I did not pick the pocket.

            ; he is a glass silverer
. I lost my shirt from No. 4, New-street, Charles-street, Commercial-road


. I had a yard full of linen; I had not room enough; I hung this shirt in the next yard. I saw the prisoner come off the step; I asked him what he had got there. I suspected he had taken something out of the yard.When I saw him come off my shop I store his shirt, and took my husband's shirt from him. This is the shirt; it is mine.

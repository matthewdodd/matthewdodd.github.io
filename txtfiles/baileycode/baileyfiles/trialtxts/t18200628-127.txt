            . I live in the Strand. On the 27th of June, between ten and eleven o'clock at night, I was coming home with my wife, and at the corner of Swan-yard


 the prisoner made a snatch at my watch, the ribbonbroke - he got the seal, keys and ring. I immediately pursued him up Swan-yard, and never lost sight of him till he turned the corner - and was only out of sight for half a minute - the watchman took him. I am sure he is the person. I have not found my property.

            . I am a watchman. I was standing nearly at the top of Swan-yard, heard the cry of Stop thief! and saw the prisoner come hastily through the posts, from Swan-yard, into White Hart-yard. I heard the cry of Stop thief immediately, and supposing him to be the thief, I ran across to take him, but he passed me. The road being up from one end to the other, he stumbled, and I secured him. Mr. Kipling immediately came up and said he was the man. Nobody was between him and the prosecutor.
Prisoner's Defence. I was running, and they took me.

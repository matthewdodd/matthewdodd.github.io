            . I keep a chandler's shop
, 47, Saffron-hill


. On the 29th of November last, about half past six in the evening, from information of my wife; I ran to the door, I saw the prisoner about seven or eight doors off in the street, carrying the candles; I told him he had got my candles, he said, what have I done, I know nothing about it; I told him he had stolen the candles, and they were my property. I led him back to the shop, with the candles in his hand, when he got into the shop, he dropped the candles on the floor. I sent for an officer, and when the officer came, he knew him directly.

            . I was sitting in the back parlour with my husband; I heard a noise, I got up, I saw the prisoner go out of the door, with the candles in his hand, he dropped two on the counter. I told my husband, he went out and brought him back. I am sure he is the same man.

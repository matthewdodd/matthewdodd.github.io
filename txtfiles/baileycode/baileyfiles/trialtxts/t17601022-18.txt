; I lost a piece of sacking out of my counting-house, on the 9th of October.
Q. What are you?
Iselton. I am a warfinger
; I was speaking to Mr. Silverside, and observed: the prisoner come out of my counting-house; with a piece of sacking on his shoulder. I desired Mr. Silverside to keep his eye on him, whilst: I went into the counting-house, to see if he had not got a piece of my sacking. I went and miss'd a piece, then I follow'd him, and took him with the piece on his shoulder ( produced in court, and depos'd to, by the prosecutrix's mark upon it) I observ'd the prisoner was in liquor.
Q. What is he?
Iselton. He is a sailor

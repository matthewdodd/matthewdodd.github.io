FRANCIS MARTIN
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
15th of Nov., pne coat, value 3l. 3s., and one jacket, 1l. 15s.; the goods of 



Henry Bodman, and that he had been before convicted of felony.






HENRY BODMAN
. I am a tailor, and live in the Strand—at half-past eight o'clock, n the 15th of Nov., I was called into my shop, and there saw the prisoner—he was accused of stealing a coat—he first decidedly denied it—when he found I was determined to give him in charge, he said he would speak the truth, and admitted he had taken it, and given it to a man outside—I also missed a fishing-jacket, which had been with the coat the night before.





WILLIAM CLAXTON
. I am the prosecutor's shop-boy—at half-past eight o'clock, on Tuesday morning, I was in the shop—the prisoner came in, and said he came from Mr. Jones, and Mr. Bodman was to be there at ten o'clock that morning—I went up stairs—the servant stopped me, and gave me information—I came down, and missed these things.





ANN COLTON
. I passed Claxton going up stairs—I saw the prisoner take two coats out, and return immediately without them—they have never been found.

Prisoner's Defence. A man outside the door told me to go and get the coat—I did not like it—he then came and told me to take it—the servant came down, and I was stopped.





JOHN STRADLING
 (City police-constable 117.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person.

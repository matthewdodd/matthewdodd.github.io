Charles William Hodges, his master: having been before convicted.






CHARLES WILLIAM HODGES
. I am a shoemaker, at 93, London-road. I have known the prisoner, and took him into my employ the last time, on 7th June—he had no specified time for leaving, but I generally discharged him at eight or nine o'clock in the evening—on 11th June, about four in the afternoon, I went out, leaving my father, my wife, and the prisoner in the shop—there was a pair of shoes and a pair of boots in the shop—I returned in ten minutes, found the prisoner gone, and missed the shoes—I ran after him, returned, and then missed the boots.





WILLIAM HODGES
. I am the last witness's father. On 11th June I was at the shop, and the prisoner also, till half-past three o'clock, when I had nothing for him to do—I saw him looking at a pair of boy's shoes, he put one inside the other, and put them down on the seat, and also a pair of men's boots, and put them in the same place—about twenty minutes after that, I went to my tea, leaving him in the shop—I returned in ten minutes, and be was still at his seat, and then went in to his tea—in eight or nine minutes he came out again, went to the end of his seat, took his hat, went out of the shop, and I did not see him again till he was at the police-court next morning.

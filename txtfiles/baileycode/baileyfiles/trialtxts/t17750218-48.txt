            . I am a brush maker
, on Fish-Street Hill. I have workshops in King's-Head Court


, and three cellars under them. The prisoner was employed in one of the cellars to make boards for the brushes. I keep thirty or forty men. The candles for the men are kept in a large box in another of the cellars. My foreman informed me there were some candles hid in the cellar next the necessary, with a carpenter's apron over them. I told him to let them lie as they were; and I set Coleman to watch who came for them.
- Coleman. I am porter to Mr. Smith. I was set to watch who came for the candles. I went, and stood between the second and third Cellar at the door. In about a quarter of an hour the prisoner came out of that cellar; I laid hold of him, and found the candles upon him.
Prisoner's Defence.
I was very much in liquor. I am innocent of it. I leave myself to the mercy of the court.
The prisoner called seven witnesses, who gave him a good character.

            . My husband's name is Samuel, I keep a publick-house in Gravel lane, Houndsditch



, and having lost several things, went to a pawnbroker's in Petticoat-lane to inquire after them. I told the pawnbroker I had lost the goods mentioned in the indictment, and that I suspected 
               
                  John 
                  Stapeler 
               



            . There I found four pair of stockings and two childrens bed-gowns; and I found the cloak and a coarse apron at another pawnbroker's. I met with Stapeler, brought him into my house, and charged him with taking the goods mentioned. He owned it, and said he had sold the bonnet, an India handkerchief, and two quart pots, to the other prisoner. I got a warrant to take her the same day, but when taken could find nothing upon her [ The goods found at the pawnbrokers produced in court and deposed to.]

            . I am the officer, and was sent for to take the prisoner Stapeler into custody. I went, and the boy owned he had been guilty of the offence, and said he had seen other boys sell things to this woman, and she encouraged him to bring what he could, so he took three quart pots and stamped them together, and sold them to her for a shilling. These goods here produced were at the same time delivered to me, which he owned he stole from the prosecutor. I and Mr. Tvrrent took 
               
                  Esther 
                  Shelson 
               



            , but we found nothing upon her.

            . The boy at the bar brought four pair of stockings and two child's bed-gowns; he pawned them in the name of his mother Beersheba Stapeler, the same that have been here produced, and as to the woman prisoner I never saw her before in my life.
Stapeler's defence.
I was out of work, and these people used to give me a bit of victuals, and 
               
                  Esther 
                  Shelson 
               



             advised me to get something that lay about in Torrent's house and bring to her, and I should not be hurt.

            . I am one of the City police; on the 19th of February, at a quarter after six o'clock in the evening, I was at the corner of Arundel-street, Aldgate


 - I saw the prisoners in company together, and watched them for about five minutes - I saw Jacobs put his right hand into a gentleman's coat pocket, and pull a handkerchief out, and give it to Bryan - they were both within half a yard of each other - Bryan put it into his breast, and I laid hold of him - he directly dropped it at his feet - I stooped to pick it up, and he tried to get away - Jacobs ran away - I took him about twenty minutes afterwards in Gracechurch-street, as I was taking Bryan to the watchhouse - I have seen them both for about a dozen times a-week for the last eighteen months, and knew them well - I called out to the gentleman several times, but could not make him hear - I don't know his name.
Jacob's Defence. I was going up Gracechurch-street, the policeman tapped me on the shoulder, and said, "I want you, my lad, you must come to the watchhouse with me;" and when I got there he said, "I take you for picking a gentleman's pocket, and giving it to the other prisoner;" whom I had never seen before in my life.

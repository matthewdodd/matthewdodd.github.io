            . I am a pawn-broker and live in Maddox-street, Hanover square. Last Saturday night between ten and eleven, the prisoner offered me two table cloths and a towel, I thought the linen seemed to be too good to be her property. I thought it my duty to stop her and the linen. I have had them in my possession ever since. (Produces them.)

            . I live in Adam's Mewse. I am a washerwoman. I was left in care of Mr. Baldwin's house; we had not missed the linen; but when the things were stopt, I knew them to be Mr. Baldwin's; I have washed them, I believe every time they have been washed; I took the prisoner into the house to assist me; she was there about a fortnight.
Q. You did not deliver the sheet to her?
Lawly. No.
Prisoner's Defence.
I must leave it to God Almighty, and the gentlemen.

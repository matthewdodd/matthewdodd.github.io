             was indicted for 


               stealing five hundred pounds weight of iron
            , the property of a person unknown, Dec. 29
. ++


                  William 
                  Poston 
               



            . I was in at the Ship at Bell Wharf, a public-house, on Wednesday night, the 28th of December, about nine o'clock, when the prisoner and 
               
                  Peter 
                  Carty 
               



             came and took me out, and told me I must go on shipboard, at Shadwell-Dock, to tide work. I am a waterman. The prisoner rowed the boat (it was my boat) to Wapping old stairs


, alongside a lighter; he went into the lighter, and he handed out some iron to Carty; I am no judge how much there was then: the prisoner rowed the boat back again to Theobald's Wharf by Stone Stairs. Carty threatened to throw me overboard if I resisted. The next morning I met Mr. Halstead, the clerk at that wharf, and told him of it.


                  John 
                  Williams 
               



            . I was called out of bed about two o'clock by the prisoner and another man, who asked me for a cart. (I am a carman.) I said they could not have one till the afternoon. Then they asked me whether they could put the iron into the stable till I could carry it. Mr. Powell, a waterman, came while we were doing it; and in the afternoon I carried it, as the prisoner and Carty desired, to East-Smithfield. They had left three bars behind.
Q. Where did you deliver the iron?
Williams. I delivered it to a farrier, named Dixon; they would not pay me; the next day the prisoners came and demanded three bars. There was a dispute. Then somebody took up the prisoner with a warrant.


                  John 
                  Powell 
               



            . 
               
                  William 
                  Poston 
               



             and 
               
                  John 
                  Williams 
               



             were handing some iron bars. Poston handed them to Williams, out of a boat, at the time Poston mentioned.


                  William 
                  Holsted 
               



            . I am a clerk to Mr. Theobald. We had been robbed several times of iron. Having information of this, I went to Dixon's in East-Smithfield; they denied they had any. I said, then I would go and get a search-warrant. As I was going, I met Williams, who told me he had brought it to Dixon's. I returned to Dixon's again, and his wife denied receiving any. I went to get a warrant, but the Justice not being in the way, on my return from the Rotation-Office I found the prisoner and Carty had been to claim the iron. I was informed I had a right to take the prisoner where-ever I found him, without a warrant. I took Poston and the prisoner up, and Sir 
               
                  Robert 
                  Darling 
               



             committed them.


                  John 
                  Wooldridge 
               



            . I am a lighterman. My lighter had been robbed several times. The lighter, where the evidence says he had the iron from, was in the ship's care: she is now gone out to sea.
Prisoner's Defence.
Between three and four o'clock that morning I met the man that employed me. He brought me down to Bell-Wharf. His name is M'Carty. I carried it for him. Poston handed it to me. They brought the iron to a stable, and gave me some purl. They said, if I would come and lend them a hand with it into the cart, they would give me a shilling. I did; and when we got it to the smith's shop, they gave me a shilling, and some beer, I went afterwards to demand the other three bars, by M'Carty's order. I have been in the King's service these eight years.
To his Character.
Calcott Chambers. I am a publican, and live in New Gravel Lane. I have known the prisoner about six months. He is a sailor
, and works in the Rope-house, and on board of ships. I never heard any ill of him before this time.


                  Michael 
                  Macanty 
               



            . I have known him about nine months.
Q. What are you?
Macanty. I am a ballast-man. I know nothing of the man but what is honest. He lodged in my house.
Q. Do you know 
               
                  Peter 
                  Carty 
               



            ?
Macanty. I have seen him, but I have no acquaintance with him; he used to go in a sailor's jacket, but I do not know what business he is of.

            . I was a publican. The prisoner used my house. I never knew any thing ill laid to his charge before this.

                  Price 
               



            . I have known him about three years. He is a very honest man; I never heard to the contrary. I have worked many tides with him upon the river.


                  Robert 
                  Smith 
               



            . I have known him about four years. I know nothing but that he behaved himself very right.

                  Bourn 
               



            . I have known him about twenty months. I have heard a good character of him in the parish where he lived.

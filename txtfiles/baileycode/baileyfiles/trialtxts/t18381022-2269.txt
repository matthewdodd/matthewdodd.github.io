GEORGE MARTIN



were indicted, for stealing, on the 
9th of October, 1 handkerchief, value 1s., the goods of 



John Shepherd May field, from his person.






JOHN SHEPHERD MATFIELD
. I live at Ware, in Hertfordshire, and am a builder. About one o'clock in the day, on the 9th of October, I was passing over Blackfriars-bridge—an officer gave me information, and my handkerchief was gone—this is it—(looking at it.)





JOHN PALMER
. I live in West Harding-street. On Tuesday, about one o'clock, I was passing the west side of Blackfriars-bridge, and saw the two prisoners behind the prosecutor—both together—I observed Martin take bold of the prosecutor's pocket, take the handkerchief out, and give it to Chapman, and they both crossed the road together—Mr. Mayfield went on one side and the two prisoners on the other—I gave information to an officer—Smith caught hold of the prisoners, and while he turned his head to call the prosecutor, one of the prisoners threw down the handkerchief—I cannot say which it was.





JOHN SMITH
. I received information, and took the prisoners—I saw the handkerchief on the ground close by where they were.

Martin. A. gentleman passing took up the handkerchief, and gave it him. Witness. Yes, he did.

Martin's Defence. I had' been for work—I met this young man, whom I had known before—in crossing the bridge to speak to him, the gentleman came and took me—I know nothing of the handkerchief—I could not take a handkerchief out with one hand, and my right hand is very bad—my master keeps the King's Arms in Theobald's-road.

CHAPMAN*—

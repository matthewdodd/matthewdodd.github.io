            . My husband lives in Devonshire-street, and is a servant
. I live in Circus-street, New-road


, and take in washing; the prisoner lodged two months with me. On the 13th of December these shirts were in a basket, ready for ironing - I missed them. She left on the 24th - I had supported her, and told her I could do it no longer. She was taken up on another charge, and the duplicates found on her. I had told her they were lost, and she went to the pawnbrokers' to look for them, and said she could not find them.

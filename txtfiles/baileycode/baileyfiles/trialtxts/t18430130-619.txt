PHILIP CHARLES BOREN
. I am a licensed victualler, in Long Acre. I took the prisoner into my service, on the 17th of Jan.—on the 21st, I gave him four sovereigns to exchange for silver—I never saw him after, till he was brought back by the policeman—he then had a new suit of clothes, and new boots, which he had not when he left my house.





WILLIAM POCOCK
 (police-constable F 81.) I took the prisoner into custody—he had a suit of new clothes, a new great coat, and hat.

Prisoner's Defence. I had the same things I have now; I went to Mr. Clark's, the pawnbroker's, to ask for change; he had none to spare, and when I got to another place I found I had lost the money.




GUILTY
. * Aged 18.—


Transported for Seven Years.

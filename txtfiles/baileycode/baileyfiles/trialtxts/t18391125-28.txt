JOHN BOURDELAIN
. I am a merchant. On the afternoon of the 7th of November I was in Lombard-street, at the corner of Gracechurch-street—I had a handkerchief in my pocket—I saw it safe in the shop of Mr. Webster, who lent it me not more than seven or eight minutes before I Went to Lombard-street—while I was there I saw the policeman had two boys in custody, and a handkerchief, which I thought was like the one lent to me—I put my hand into my pocket, and the handkerchief was gone—I had borrowed it, because I had my pocket picked before of my own—I cannot swear to this, but it is very much like the one I borrowed.





WILLIAM BRITTON
 (City police-constable, No. 90.) I was on duty at the corner of Lombard-street. I saw the two prisoners and another boy, who got away behind the prosecutor—all their hands were down together—Bowls took the prosecutor's handkerchief—I caught two of them round the waist, and the handkerchief dropped down—I did not see Shears do any thing—Bowls was in the middle, and a little behind the other two—I had not seen the prisoners speak to each other—Shears said Bowles did not belong to him, he knew nothing about him—they both tried to get away—I got them against a post, and picked the handkerchief up.

Bowls's Defence. Another boy took it, and threw it in my face.

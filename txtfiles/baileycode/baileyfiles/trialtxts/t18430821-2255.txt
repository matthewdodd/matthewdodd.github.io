NATHANIEL BERRY
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
21st of July, 1 handkerchief, value 1s., the goods of 



Nicholas Ward, from his person; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






NICHOLAS WARD
. I live in Queen-street, Portsea. On the 21st of July, between twelve and one in the morning, I was in High-street, St. Giles's—a female spoke to me, and walked by my side talking—I felt my pocket turn back three or four minutes after she came up—I turned and saw the prisoner close behind me passing my handkerchief from his hand to somebody behind—I immediately collared him, and called a policeman several times—no assistance came—I took him under a gas-light and examined him well—I was pushed about by the mob, who threatened me if I did not let him go—he slipped from me—I swear he is the man—he left his coat in my hand, which I gave to the policeman—this is my handkerchief.





WILLIAM BAKER
 (policeman.) I received this coat from the prosecutor—I know it to be the prisoner's—I have seen him wear it daily—I have known him a long time—I did not see him that morning—I apprehended him at half-past three on Sunday morning—I told him what for—he said he was not aware that he had lost his coat.

Prisoner. Q. How can you swear to the coat? A. There is a particular mark on the back where it was sewn up—I have passed him ten or twelve times a day for the last twelve months, and took particular notice of him.





WILLIAM SMITH
 (policeman.) I know the prisoner well, and know this to be the coat he wore on the night of the robbery—I saw him with it on in High-street, and told him to go away.

Prisoner. Q. How do you swear to the coat? A. The right shoulder is sewn up, and some parts are white and the other black.





CHARLES ROBERTS
. I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction in this court (read)—I am certain he is the man.




GUILTY
. Aged 23.—


Transported for Ten Years.



Before Mr. Justice Williams.

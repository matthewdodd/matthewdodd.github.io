SAMUEL HALL. I am a bookseller
. On the 22d. of March. at half-past two o'clock in the morning, I was passing along St. Martin's-le-grand


, and met the prisoner in company with a man - she was a stranger; I had not proceeded a dozen yards, before she came skipping after me, and took hold of my arm, saying,
"My dear, where are you going;" I said home - she said, I had better go with her; I said, she had got a sweetheart; she said, she knew nothing of him - she gave me a push - I felt her hand against me, and said,
"You have taken something out of my pocket;" the watchman came by; I told him - he took hold of her hand, and before it was opened, I said she had two half crowns, eight shillings, and a sixpence - and they found exactly that in her hand - I did not give it to her.

            , I am a watchman. The prosecutor called Watch; I took the prisoner; she had two half-crowns, eight shillings, and a sixpence, in her hand, which he described, before he saw them - he was rather in liquor.

            . I am the watch-house keeper; the prisoner was brought in with her hands shut-tight - I found the money in it - The prosecutor knew perfectly well what he was about.

             (Police-constable S 67). On the morning of the 30th of April, about half-past six o'clock, I saw the prisoner in Pancras-road, carrying this copper and pot in a bag - I asked if he had not got a copper; he said Yes, that he had found these articles in a field, and was going to take them to the station-house; I said he had better go to the station with me - he said he had no objection, but when he had got a few steps, he put them down and said I might take them; I took them, but was forced to put them down once or twice to take hold of him, as he was very obstinate; I went to the Adam and Eve, in Pancras-road, and found the wash-house door had been broken open, and this chisel was there, which exactly corresponded with the marks on the door; the copper was missed, but the bricks had been pulled down, and we could not fit it.

CALVERT BOWYER VAUX. I am a surgeon
. On the 7th of October I was in Laurence Pountney-lane


, about twelve o'clock, and had a snuff-box in my coat pocket; I felt a twitch, turned round, and saw the prisoner and another shuffling my box between them - I saw it distinctly in the prisoner's hand; they were just across the lane, about ten yards from me - the prisoner ran away, the other remained; I followed the prisoner, calling Stop thief! down Cannon-street and Laurence Pountney-hill - the street-keeper joined in the pursuit, and opposite Suffolk-lane I saw the prisoner throw the box out of his hand- I took it up; the street-keeper followed, and very shortly brought him to me.
Prisoner. Q. Did you see me take it? A. I felt my pocket move, and saw it in your hand.

            . I am an officer. I received the prisoner in charge.(Property produced and sworn to)
Prisoner's Defence. I was in Laurence Pountney-lane, and saw the box laying under a window - I took it up, and heard the cry of Stop thief! I ran a little way, and immediately flung it away; I saw an officer following me, and immediately stopped for him to take me.

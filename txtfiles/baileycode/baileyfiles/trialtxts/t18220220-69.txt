            . I am a constable. On the 17th of January, about half-past eight o'clock at night. I was near the Yorkshire Stingo, public-house, New Road


; two of Combe's drays were there; the prisoners stood close to the horses' heads; I knew Byrne before; he took the nose-bags off the fore horse's head, and Johnson took the bag off the shaft-horse. Byrne ran towards Stingo-lane - I followed, and took him with the bag under his arm - Johnson dropped his bag. I picked it up - took Byrne to the watch-house - then went to Johnson's house, in Stingo-lane, and found him under the staircase; the bag contained oats and chaff, mixed.

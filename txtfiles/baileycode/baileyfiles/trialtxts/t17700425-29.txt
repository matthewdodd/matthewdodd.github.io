            . I am wife to George Street; we live in St. John's parish, Southwark



. The prisoner came to our house on the 19th of March, and pretended to be a relation of my husband's from the country. I entertained her all night, and in the morning she said, she had got some clothes come up in a vessel, and she would go and fetch them. I put my things on, and we went together for them. When we were in the parish of St. Paul, Shadwell, going along, she was stopped by a person to whom she had pretended to be related, and had robbed her of a cardinal. Then I desired she might be searched, and three of my tea-spoons were found upon her. She must have taken them while I went to dress myself. It would take up three hours to tell the story she told me. (The spoons produced and deposed to.)

            . I was going over London bridge


 on the 11th of September about ten in the evening; a gentleman came up to me about the middle of the bridge and asked me if I had not lost my handkerchief; I felt in my pocket and missed it; the gentleman took me back a little way and shewed me Westbrook, and said he had it; I went to him and saw him give my handkerchief to Taylor; they were standing whispering together; I seized them both, and saw Taylor throw it on the ground; I took them to the watch house and gave them in charge of the constable, (the handkerchief produced and deposed to.)
Westbrook's Defence.
I am a carman, and work for Mr. Cooper, in Church-lane; I saw the handkerchief on the ground and took it up; Taylor came up to me and asked what I had found; I said a handkerchief; he said it was full of holes, and threw it away.
Taylor's Defence.
What Westbrooke has said, is the truth.

            : on the 9th of December, I missed some gold and some silver, which we had given to the prisoner to melt; the prisoner worked with us about a month; I gave it him on the 9th of December, about thirty penny weights, and he took six; we did not find so much upon him; he was to melt it at the top of the house in the shop; when he came down to go to dinner, we searched him, and a small quantity, two or three grains, was found on the ground, which he acknowledged he dropped, and I picked it up myself close by his feet; there was about a penny-weight of gold; he said it was not our property, it was his own.


                  HENRY
                   DAVIS
               



             sworn.
Having reason to suspect the prisoner, I weighed him about thirty penny weights of gold and silver, and gave it him up stairs, and desired him to weigh it; he put it into the scales, and told me there was an ounce and a half, which is twenty-two penny weights, which was under what I gave him; I made no reply; I desired him to melt it; he did, and I weighed what he had melted, and found it was twenty-two penny weights, that was all gold, the silver was afterwards separate; I weighed it below stairs in the shop; he did not see me weigh it; that was about twelve, or half after; after he had melted that, he melted a quantity of silver, which I was not so particular in weighing; it was fine silver which I gave him to melt; and when I searched him, I found a piece of the same silver about him; he was the last man that went to dinner; I searched him with the constable, whose name is Holmes, and we found some silver, and two or three other little grains of gold, with some other gold of a coarser nature; some of the grains of gold were found on the ground some little time afterwards; we found the main quantity in the lining of his hat, where the button is joined to the outside, and being thin, it was not easy to be found; there were two pieces of gold; I took them out of his hat myself.
Court. I suppose you could not know it was your gold? - Yes, perfectly well, because it was gold that had been made thin.
Can you undertake to swear that these pieces of gold that were found in his hat, and in his pocket, were your property? - Yes.
In the melting, might so much have been lost? - Then it must have been in another state; it was in the state that I gave it him.

             sworn.
I work weekly with Mr. Davis; I was there the 9th of November; I saw him searched, and from his left hand waistcoat pocket, Mr.

                   Davis
               



             took out a piece of standard gold, and a piece of plated gold.

                   HOLMES
               



             sworn.
I am the constable; I assisted in searching the prisoner, about one o'clock, the 9th of this month; upon searching him, we found several pieces of gold, and a piece of plated gold there were two pieces of gold we found on the ground; he said they were his, but not Mr. Davis's; we found some plated gold in his pocket; the value was not much; after giving up searching, Mr. Henry Davis saw his fingers on his hat, and took his hat from him, and searched it, and found the chief of the gold now in question, which is a piece of standard gold, and others; it has been in my possession ever since the last examination; Mr. 
               
                  Thomas

             had it then.

                   Davis
               



            . Mr. Alderman Wright desired me to keep the gold till the next day, I did; it was the same I delivered the next day to the constable. (Produced) They weighed three penny weights each; three or four, I cannot say which; the piece of standard gold was mine; the value about ten shillings.
PRISONER's DEFENCE.
I had that quantity of gold given me; it was near our dinner time; I understand French, and in French, I understood there was a plan laid against me; when this was melted, I had left this out by mistake; this journeyman that is here, has owed me a very great spite, from a very small occasion; he came to work for a guinea a week, and my master told him it would not suit him any longer; but if he would take eighteen shillings for four weeks, he would keep him; I ridiculed him for it; he then talked of buying an umbrella; I said he was too much the fop, so he envied me, and laid a plan to melt this gold; I was going to dinner; if I took the whole quantity of it, I should have thought myself accountable; I have no counsel; my master, Mr.

            , shook hands with me in Guildhall yard, and told me if I would say who my friends were, I should be set at liberty.

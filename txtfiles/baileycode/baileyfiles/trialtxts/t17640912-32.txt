            . On Saturday last but one, coming down Cheapside


, between twelve and one in the day, I was touched on the back by a lady, who pointed to the prisoner, and said, that man that is crossing the way, has picked your pocket of your handkerchief; he was then about five yards from me: I found mine was gone, and I pursued him cross the street, into Wood-street, where I saw him, and cry'd Stop thief: a good many people get about him: I saw him throw a handkerchief into a carpenter's shop and the master of the shop brought it out directly; it was my handkerchief. When before my Lord Mayor, he denied the taking it; but when he was incircled by the mob, he said, he had not had any victuals for two or three days, and did it to save himself from starving.

            . I saw the prisoner throw a handkerchief into a carpenter's shop, and the prosecutor came up and owned it.
Prisoner's Defence.
There were two men ran; one had a blue coat on, the other a short man in a white coat. I heard the word, stop thief; I turned my head about, and the mob took hold of me; they searched me, and found nothing upon me. I never saw that handkerchief till it was brought out of the shop.

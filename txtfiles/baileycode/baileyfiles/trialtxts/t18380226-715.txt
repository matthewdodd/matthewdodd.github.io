About half-past six o'clock on the evening of the 6th of February, I saw the two prisoners in Mary-street, Hampstead-road, nearly half a mile from Mr. Wright's house—they were carrying the stove between them, each having one end of it—I watched them—they took it. to Mr. Sharp, a broker's shop in Brook-street—Williams went into the shop, and Lewsley remained at the door—Williams took the stove in, and afterwards brought it out, and both of them carried it to another broker's, at No. 24, Brook-street—Williams took it in there, and Lewsley remained outside—I then went and made inquiry of Mr. Sharp—I went and took them into custody, with the stove, and found the owner.





THOMAS SHARP
. I keep a broker's shop, in Brook-street. The priWilliams came into my shop with a stove, and asked me to buy it—I asked what she wanted, she said 4s.—my wife beckoned to me, and said, "Don't buy it, it is the person that sold you some stolen chairs some time ago"—Williams heard that—I refused to buy it, and she took it away.





JOHN WRIGHT

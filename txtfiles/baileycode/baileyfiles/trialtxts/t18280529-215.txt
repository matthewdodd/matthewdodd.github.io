WILLIAM WILSON. I keep a rag-shop

. On the 22d of May I saw the prisoner behind my counter - he must have crept in upon his hands and knees; he had taken the till out, and placed it on a bag on the floor; I went to him - he said a person had thrown in his cap, and he came to fetch it; I had left the till safe five minutes before - it contained copper.

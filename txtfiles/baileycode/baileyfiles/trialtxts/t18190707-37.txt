            . On the 6th of July, about ten o'clock at night, I was in Fleet-street; Turner came up, and said he saw the prisoner pick my pocket - I felt, and missed my handkerchief - I secured the prisoner, and took him to the watch-house. The handkerchief was not found.

            . I was standing at my master's door in Fleet-street, and saw the prosecutor pass by, with his handkerchief hanging out; I saw the prisoner and two others following him very close. As soon as the prosecutor passed the shop, I saw the other two go very close to him, and the prisoner put his hand between them, and take the handkerchief out of his pocket. I went to them - when they saw me, one of them took the handkerchief from the prisoner. I secured the prisoner, and the other two ran away. I am certain he is the man who took it. I was within two yards of him.
Prisoner's Defence. I never saw it.

            . I am a broker; 
               
                  John 
                  Norton
               



             lodged with me - this sheet was bleaching. The prisoner was in the habit of doing jobs for me.

            . I am an officer. On the 4th of November, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, I was in the Edgware-road, and saw the prisoner coming along with a bundle under his arm - knowing him, I suspected it did not belong to him. When he came near me I turned round, and looked him full in the face. Immediately he saw me he threw the bundle down, and ran off, but I followed him about a hundred yards and took him. He said he was going to take them to the mangle. I took him to the watch-house, and found they belonged to Norton of the Harrow-road.

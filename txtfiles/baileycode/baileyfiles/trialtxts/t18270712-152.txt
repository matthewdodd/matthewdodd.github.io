ANN CLARKE. I am a widow, and live near Middlesex Hospital


, and am a dyer
. The prisoner is my son; in consequence of his conduct a person was set to watch - I lost the articles stated in the indictment from my shop; he had slept on the bed that night.

            . I am a watchman. I was directed by an officer to watch the prosecutrix's house, and last Sunday morning, about five o'clock, I saw the prisoner bring the bed out of the house, and cross the street. I seized him; another man took the bed - the bolster and sheet were wrapped in it - he was not quite dressed.

            . I am an officer. In consequence of information I set the watchman to watch the house.
ANN CLARK. I believe the property to be mine - the sheet is marked; they were all taken without my consent or knowledge. I was told by a person that they were going, and desired the officer to watch.
Prisoner's Defence. I was not out of the shop at all. I only opened the door for light.
THOMAS CLARK. He had crossed the road about ten yards - he had no coat or waistcoat on; he stopped at a door on the other side of the street; but it was not opened.

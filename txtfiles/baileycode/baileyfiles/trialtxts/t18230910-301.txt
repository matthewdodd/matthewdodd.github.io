            . I am a linen-draper
, and live in Kingsland-road


. These handkerchiefs laid in my window. I missed them, jumped over the counter, and seeing Johnson in the shop, I seized him. Both prisoners were in the shop, but Johnson was nearest the window. I observed him throw the handkerchiefs from him. Clark remained in the shop. They had asked for two black silk laces, and tendered me a 6 d., for which I gave change.

            . I am a constable. On the 8th of September I took charge of the prisoner. I found the laces in Clark's hand. Neither of them had a farthing about them, although the prosecutor had given Clark 3 d.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
JOHNSON'S Defence. I never had them. He searched me, and not finding them, said I had thrown them over the counter.
CLARK'S Defence. I was not with Johnson.

            ; he is a wharfinger
, before you come to Lady Parsons's stairs, called Miller's wharf: I had been shutting up the counting-house windows, between five and six at night, upon the wharf, coming back, with a lanthorn in my hand, I saw the prisoner standingwith a cotton bag; he seeing me, came from the end of the bag, and out of his apron dropped two pieces of cotton; I asked him what he had there; he ran away; (I had shut up the premises half an hour before, but there was a little wicket to come in at) I pursed him with the lanthorn; I never lost sight of him; he was taken in a hundred yards; I saw the bag fifteen minutes before whole; after I shut up the premises the bag was cut; when I took the prisoner there were about four pounds taken out.
(The cotton produced, and compared with a sample.)
Prisoner. I never touched the cotton.

Q. In August, did you lose a coach-glass and frame - A. I did; I value it at about thirty shillings.
Q. Had you ever seen Munday on your premises - A. Yes; he came down to the yard very much in liquor one evening in August, about eight o'clock; he had no business there.

            . On Sunday, the 15th of August, I saw the prisoner in Dean-street, Westminster; he had a bag in his hand, and a coach-glass in it; I knew him; I asked him where he got it; he said, of a man; he gave two or three shillings for it; he thought he should make five or six of it. I took him in custody; he shewed me his room; on the top of the drawers in his room, I saw a coach-glass frame; I took it away. This is it.
Prosecutor. I am certain the frame is mine; and I believe the glass to be mine.

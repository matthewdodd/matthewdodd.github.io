            . I live at Manchester. On Saturnoon afternoon, the 13th of July, I paid 
               
                  Samuel 
                  Stanway
               



            , on account of the prosecutors, one 100 l., two of 50 l., and three of 30 l. Bank post bills.


                  SAMUEL 
                  STANWAY
               



            . I am in the employ of the prosecutors, at Manchester. I received from Mr. Gisborne, at the warehouse, one 100 l., two 50 l., and three 30 l. Bank post bills. I took particular notice of the 100 l. bill, as I had never seen such a large one before. I am fifteen years old. Cole and Co. was written on the back of it; and Cunliffe and Co. was on the back of the two 50 l. notes. The prisoner was a porter at the warehouse, and was at the counting-house door at the time the money was paid. Mr. Hall did not come to the warehouse that night, and so I did not pay him the money. When I received it, the prisoner advised me to put it into my own drawer in the counting-house, which I did, and locked it; and as Mr. Hall did not come, I put the money in the waste-book, and put that into the iron chest, and locked it up. He did not see me put it there. The key of the chest was on the bunch of keys which it was his duty to take to Mr. Hall every night after he locked up the warehouse; he lodged at Mr. Hall's house; the warehouse was shut up at eight o'clock, and before that the prisoner asked where I had put the money; I said into a safe place. On the Monday morning, I saw him at the warehouse door - it was his duty to open it at half past eight o'clock. I went there at that time, and waited till nine; when I saw him, he said Mr. Hall would not trust him with the keys, because he thought he had had them in his coat pocket on the Sunday; but that he had left them in his other coat pocket, at the house; and that Mr. Hall desired I should come for them. I went for them, and the servant gave them to me. I returned to the warehouse, and gave them to him. He opened the front door, and took the books out of the iron safe as usual, and put them on the desk; he remained in the warehouse a few minutes. He usually goes to the Post Office for the letters - I asked if he wanted any money to pay for the letters; he said he had some. He went out as if to go to the Post Office, and never returned.

            . I conduct the business for Messrs.

                  Harrison
               



            . I live in Bedford-street, about a mile from the warehouse. It was the prisoner's duty to bring me home the keys nightly, if I was not there, and take them in the morning. I do not know whether he brought them on Saturday, the 13th of July. I did not miss them till the Monday morning about half-past eight o'clock, as he did not come into my room for them; I found he had been out, and on looking for the keys, I found they were not there. Almost immediately after, he came into the room; he had not slept at home that night; he came into my bedroom with the keys; I asked him where they had been; he said he left them in his old coat pocket on Saturday night; I blamed him for it, and said I would not trust him with them again, and told him to put them down and send the boy for them. Shortly after Stanway came for the keys, and about an hour afterwards I heard the prisoner had absconded - he had lived about eight months with us. I heard of him again in the middle of September, and came to town; I found him in custody; he denied the charge.

            . I am a salesman, and live in Holywell-street, Strand. The prisoner came to my house to buy some clothes the day before I changed that 100 l. Bank post bill. He asked for a travelling cloak, saying he was going to Paris - he bought articles to the amount of 10 l. and tendered me a 50 l. Bank post bill. I went out to see if it was good, and found it was. I returned to him, and found that during my absence, my boy had sold him goods to the whole amount of the bill - he made another purchase to the amount of 45 l., besides the 50 l.; it was a gold watch, seals, pencil, and clothes, and tendered a 100 l. Bank post bill for that. I found it was good, and agreed to take it. I gave him thirty-five sovereigns; rode with him to the Black Horse, inn, with part of the goods, to see if he lodged there; he told the waiter I would not give him his change; I gave him 10 l. more, as the waiter said he knew him - the waiter went home with me, and I gave him the rest. He bought a box with the goods, and had a brass plate put on it, with the name I. H. Holmes on it. Next morning he called in a coach, for the rest of the goods, and asked me if it was all right. I said Yes. He had told me he had a pension in the army of 200 l. per annum, and that he got this money at the death of his mother. He called again on his return from Paris about three weeks after, and wanted to sell me part of the things I had sold him, but I refused. I received the 100 l. Bank bill at the Bank myself. I have since seen it.
JURY. Q. You seemed to want change, why not offer him the 50 l. bill back - A. He said he was going to Paris, and wanted change.

            . I am shopman to Mr. Hart. His account is correct. I saw the prisoner give him both the bills.

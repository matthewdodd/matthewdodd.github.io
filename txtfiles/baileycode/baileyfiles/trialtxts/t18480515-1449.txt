HENRY BARRINGTON FRANCIS.
 I am in partnership with my two sons. Last Saturday evening, at half-past nine o'clock, I came home and went into my shop—the prisoners were brought in—I missed forty-one numbers of the London Journal—they were brought in with the prisoners, and were our property.






THOMAS WEST
 (policeman, M 249.) About nine o'clock last Saturday I saw the prisoners in company in Old Kent-road—I followed them to Mr. Francis's in Alfred-place—Waller passed and repassed the window—I went on, came back, and saw Burdett leave the shop-door, and place these numbers in Waller's apron—I stopped them—Ellis said, "They are ours"—Waller threw them from his apron, and Ellis ran off with them—I pursued and took her—Burdett was brought back—he said he would pay for them.

Burdett's Defence. I went in, and asked the young man if he had got any old numbers; he said, "Yes," I could have them for a shilling.





WILLIAM JENNINGS
 (policeman, M 273.) I produce a certificate of Waller's former conviction—(read—Convicted Dec., 1846, and confined two Months)—he is the man.

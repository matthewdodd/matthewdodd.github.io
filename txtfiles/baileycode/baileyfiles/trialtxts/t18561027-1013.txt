ROBERT M'KENZIE
. I am an inspector of police. On the morning of 9th Sept., about 9 o'clock, I went to the house of the prisoner Clark, he in a marine store dealer, at No. 24, Dudley-street, St. Giles's—I saw Clark in the shop—I told him I wanted to speak to him in private, and asked him into a back room—on getting there I told him I was a police officer, and said, "I came in consequence of receiving information that you have received ft quantity of globes, atlases, and other things, from the shop of Mr. Wyld, No. 457, Strand"—he said, "No, I have not received anything of the wrt"—I said, "Yes, you have had them, and the globes were removed from your house with a horse and cart on Monday week last"—he hesitated some moments, and said, "Well, have you seen the old man that moved them!"—I said, "I want to know who brought them to your house"—he hesitated some minutes, and said, "They were brought by two respectable looking young men," and he said that himself and his wife were ill in consequence of their being in the place—I again asked him who brought them there, and to that he made no reply—I told him he must consider himself in custody on a charge of receiving that property, and on looking round that room I found aeveral articles that were stolen—I said, "These are stolen

also"—he said, "Well, I don't know, I buy a great many things"—I called in Holmes and desired him to search the room that I and Clark were in—he did for a minute or so—he then went upstairs—he had not been up two minutes when he came running down with some parchment deeds in his hand, which had been partly burnt—he said in Clark's hearing, "They are burning the property upstairs"—I desired Buck, another officer, to go to his assistance—I then left Clark in charge of another policeman, and I went upstairs to a front room, occupied by Clark and his wife—I searched that room, and in a drawer in a chest of drawers I found this magnifying glass—Clark was taken to Bow-street station and charged with receiving the property which was then produced, stolen from Mr. Wyld on the morning of the 23rd Aug.—on the charge being read, he said he hoped we should deal as leniently as we could—he said the property had been brought to his house by a young man named Johnson, living at No. 14, Ashley-terrace, City-road—on 23rd Sept I went with Buck and Holmes to Harradine's place, No. 9, Bermondsey-street—he is a marine store dealer—I found Harradine in the back parlour with an elderly female—I asked him bis name—he told me it was Harradine—I told him we were police officers, and that we had come in consequence of his haying received a quantity of globes stolen from Mr. Wyld, No. 457, Strand, on the morning of the 23rd Aug.—he said it was a b—lie, and he endeavoured to take off his coat to show fight—I endeavoured to calm him, and told him to take it coolly and hear what we had to say—I said, "You have been dealing with these globes, you have been identified as being at St. John's Wood with them on the morning of the 15th Sept, and leaving them, directed to Mr. Wyld, at a receiving house for parcels"—he said no, he did not, he did not know St. John's Wood—I said, "The man has identified you"—he said, "I was at home all the morning "of the 15th; I left my house to come to Bermondsey-street; at 9 o'clock in the morning I left Dockhead, and came directly to my house, No. 9, Bermondsey-street, and remained there till 2 o'clock in the day"—I said, "You are in the habit of dealing with a man of the name of Clark"—he said, "Yes, I am, the last deal I had with Clark was for 3l., on the 6th Sept."—I asked him if he had any book or document to show to that effect, and on looking at his file I found I a receipt for rags, 3l.—I did not take it, I left it with him—he asked me I to leave it with him as it might assist his defence.

Cross-examined by
MR. CARTER. Q. You went to Clark's house, in a street which contains a number of marine store shops? A. Yes; that street used to be called Monmouth-street, it is now Dudley-street—I found Clark in his shop, behind the counter—I went in, and called him into the back parlour—I told him I was a police officer, and I had come in consequence of his having receive a quantity of globes, copper plates, and atlases, which had been stolen from Mr. Wyld—I did not ask him whether he had bought any—he said some articles had been removed from his house on the Monday, which had been brought by two respectable men—I was in the back parlour, there were a great number of articles—I selected a great many Articles, and a portion of them will be produced—the room was filled with bags which apparently contained rags—the articles which I selected were lying among the bags—when I called him into the back parlour I did not permit him to go upstairs—his servant and wife came there while I was there—I heard nothing pass between them—I was not in pursuit of title deeds—I found the magnifying glass in a drawer—there were a large quantity of things there—I took Clark's wife—I will not be positive whether

Clark said he hoped I should be lenient with them—his wife was discharged—I have not been to No. 14, Ashley-place.

Cross-examined by
MR. COOPER. Q. When you called on Harradine, you told him he had been identified by a person who followed you in? A. Yas—his name is Cole—we sought him out—I believe there was a reward of 50l. offered for the discovery of the person who committed the robbery.





WALTER HOLMES
. (police sergeant, F 50). I went with the last witness to Dudley-street, on the morning of 9th Sept.—when we got to the home, M'Kenzie went with Clark into the back parlour—after they were there a short time, he called me in to him—I heard him ask Clark who brought the globes there—he hesitated some time—he then said two well dressed men—M'Kenzie asked him again who they were, and what their names were—he stood hesitating for some time, but refused to give their names—I was requested to search the place, and I found a great quantity of carriage cushion covers—I stepped outside the parlour, and going upstairs I heard people waning upstairs—I ran up too; I went into the third floor front room, where I found Clark's wife bringing in her hand from the fire a quantity of parchments, all on fire; she ran behind the bed, and put them into a tub of water—at the time she ran behind the bed she said, "I am not dressed"—I went to the fire, and seeing a great quantity of parchments which were not burned, I took them, and put them into the water also—Clark's wife was dressed—she then feinted away, and I went into the back room on the same floor, and the fire there was also packed up with parchments—I went up into the cockloft, by a trap door, Buck lifted me up—I found there rolled up in a coat some atlases; and also, in another coat, some carriage cushion covers—these are the coats.

Cross-examined by
MR. CARTER. Q. You did not hear what was said by the inspector in the early part of the interview with Clark? A. No—some hours afterwards, at the station, dark said that a man named Johnson was the man he had them of—I have not been to Ashley-place—the first I heard was the question, "Who brought the globes?" and Clark said, "Two well dressed men"—I do not think he said anything more—after he had stood some time, he said he should decline saying any more—some of the cushion covers were in the back room, and some upstairs—there were a great many rags and other things in the shop and parlour—there were several coats—I do not remember any trowsers—Clark said he bought a good many things in the way of trade—the woman was taking these deeds out of the fire and putting them in the water, in such a position that I should not see.





THOMAS PARROCK
. I am superintendent of Mr. James Wyld's business, at the branch, at Charing-cross. On the night of 22nd Aug., I was on the premises, and left at 10 minutes or a quarter past 8 o'clock; I left the premises securely locked—I returned about 10 minutes past 9 o'cfock the following morning—I found the porter there—I missed a great many globes, and atlases, and maps; two pairs of compasses, two magnifying glasses, some books, and two coats, and three copper plates—I can identify this property produced—I recollect some articles by peculiar marks—here are several spots on the cover of this book, which were made soon after the book was bound—I can swear to this as being the property of Mr. Wyld—this is one of three maps that were stolen—this is one large map of the world—this is one of the magnifying glasses that Were stolen that night—this coat I do not know—this other coat was mine—I had given it to the porter some time before.

Cross-examined by
MR. CARTER. Q. Were you last in charge of the premises that night? A. Yes; the porter, the clerk, and myself, all came

out together—the clerk locked the door—I tried it afterwards—I missed atlasses, globes, maps, and some postage stamps—I gave a faithful list of the articles at the time—I know this magnifying glass to be the property of our draughtsman, by the peculiar manner in which it is framed or mounted—it was framed by the draughtsman—it was not for sale, but for use—we had only three maps of this kind on the premises at that time—we never have above three or four in the shop—they were all taken—we frequently sell a portion of a map, and we had sold a portion of this one; and on this occasion we were out of the same kind of cloth for the maps, and this one is a different cloth.

Cross-examined by
MR. RIBTON. Q. Mr. Wyld offered a reward? A. Yes—I do not know who is to get that—if there is a conviction, I suppose it will be paid to somebody.

GEOBGE HARVEY

I was in Dudley-street between 2 and 4 o'clock in the afternoon—I saw a cart opposite Clark's door—I observed on the cart the name of William Harradine, Bermondsey-street—I saw some globes and stands brought out of Clark's, and put in the cart—the biggest were put in first, and the small ones afterwards—it was a very small cart, there was scarcely room for them, there was some difficulty in getting them in—I observed the stands had three legs, and they were round at top—the cart went towards Broad-street, towards Holborn—I saw the prisoner Harradine and another man with the cart—they brought the things out and placed them in the cart; and when they got then out they went off—if he had any conversation with Clark, it was inside.

On 15th Sept., two men came to my shop—Harradine was one of them—he brought a bag and the other man a large box—they asked me whether Brooks, the carrier, had been—I said no, but I expected him soon—Harradine said, "Had I better bring the box in?" I said "No, it was too large"—he said, "I had better bring the bag in"—I said, "You can, and put it under the window"—I did not notice the direction on the box, but there was one on the bag—it was directed to Mr. Wyld—this is the bag and the direction (Read: Mr. Wyld, Map-seller, West Strand)—I delivered the box fend the bag to Mr. Brooks in a quarter of an hour afterwards—this is the box—I believe Harradine is the man, to the best of my belief, but I could not swear to him.

JOHN DOYLK
. I am a scale maker, and live at No. 24, King-street, Southward. I have known the prisoner Harradine seven or eight years—I have regulated his scales within the last four years—I remember Monday, 15th Sept, I called on him that day at his residence at Dockhead between half past 9 o'clock and a quarter before 10 o'clock in the morning—I called for the payment of a little account he owed me—I did not receive it—I stopped not more than five or ten minutes—I have never seen him wear a fustian jacket—he was dressed that morning in a brown cloth coat, with pockets at the sides and buttoned up—why J noticed his coat was, because he has always been in the habit of wearing a black one, and I

noticed he had a brown one on that morning, which was unusual—he accounted for it afterwards by saying his black coat was gone to be mended—I never knew him to keep a horse and cart, or a donkey and cart—I hare heard that he once had a horse.

Cross-examined by
MR. MACENTEER. Q. How often hare you seen him? A. Sometimes not once in a month—when he has wanted anything done in my way, I have done it for him for the last three or four years—we hare done it constantly—I have never missed him out of his place—I have never heard that he has been in prison—if he has it is more than I am aware of—I never heard that he has been charged with any crime—on that morning when I observed his coat, I had business to do at Shad Thames, and I thought I would call on him and see if he could pay me my little account—he could not pay me—he said he expected some one to call on him to pay him some money—what made me remember his coat was what I heard afterwards about his wearing a jacket—I think it was himself said that to me—he said he had never worn a jacket—I said, "On that morning you had a coat on, and buttoned up"—I cannot recollect how he introduced the subject—he did not come to me on that occasion—I think it was when he was taken into custody, but I am not sure; it might have been a day or two after he was taken—stop a bit, I rather think it was his attorney—I do not think it was the prisoner came to me at all—when his attorney came, he wanted me to give evidence to say whether I saw Harradine on that Monday—I suppose it might have been a week after when the attorney came to me; I did not take any note of it—the attorney told me he wanted me to give evidence, and he mentioned about the jacket—I told him that he had not a jacket—I do not think there was anything more passed, for after that I left him; I had to go to Mr. Tucker's office—I stated all I knew—the statement about the jacket was made when I was at Harradine's house a day or two after he was taken; the attorney's clerk called at my house and left a message for me to go to Harradine's house—I think it was there I first heard about the jacket—he said the parties had said thai he had a jacket on, and I said he had a coat on.





ALFRED HUGHES
. I am manager of the business for Mr. Snelling, a clothier at Dockhead. I know Harradine—I remember seeing him on Monday, 15th Sept—I recollect the day, because I was going into the City for some goods, and that was the day the Chartists went out—I saw them in Cheapside—I saw Harradine that day put his things out at his shop at Dockhead, Bermondsey—we were talking about ten minutes—when my employer came that morning he sent me into the City, and I overtook Harradine in Thornton-street—it was a quarter past 10 o'clock—he had a person with him—I think it was William Smith—I have known Harradine about twelve months—I have never seen him with a donkey and cart, or horse and cart, or a black and white dog—he had a brown coat on that morning, and when he left to go to his business he had a black coat on, which he generally wears.

Cross-examined. Q. Who first applied to you to give evidence? A. After Harradine was out on bail, Mr. Lawrence, the attorney's clerk, came to my employer's warehouse—he came before I could recollect the circamstance as to the day, but I afterwards looked at my invoices and found the invoice which I got that day; this is it—Mr. Lawrence did not say what he wanted, but he asked if I had seen Mr. Harradine on 15th Sept—I said I did not hardly know, but I called it afterwards to my mind; I recollected the circumstance—I told my employer, and he told me that he came to town that morning and sent me into the City—when the attorney's clerk

first called, I could not give him any answer; but when I recollected it, Mr. Harradine being a neighbour next door, and knowing I was with him that morning, I could do nothing less—I went to him and told him I had called the circumstance to my mind, that I was with him that very morning—I told him I would act as a witness.

I am a lighterman, and live at No. 32, Thornton-street I know Harradine—I met him with the last witness on Monday morning, 15th Sept—I am positive it was on that day, because I had to go to receive rents, and I put it down in the book—I saw him that morning in Thornton-street; I stopped him, and went on with him—I could not tell what coat he had on; I did not take notice—I know he had a coat on—I stopped and talked to him; he was going towards Bermondsey-street—I did not stand and see him out of the street—I never knew him to keep a horse and cart, or a donkey and cart—I never knew him to have a black and white dog.

About 500 yards—I am not in the habit of meeting him frequently—I know he has two brothers; his brother William had a pony and cart, but it was sold three months ago—I heard of it—I met him, and I said, "Where is your cart?" and he said, "I have sold it"—that is as near three months ago as I can recollect—when he said, "I have sold it," I said, "You have found a market for it"—he said, "Yes."





WILLIAM PICKARD
. I am a hair dresser. I reside at Bermondsey—I know Harradine—I recollect when Frost came in; it was on Monday, 15th Sept—on that morning I saw Harradine in his shop in Bermondsey-street; that is about six miles and a half from St. John's Wood—Dockhead is three quarters of a mile from Bermondsey-street—I purchased two glasses of him that morning, and I paid him about a quarter of an hour afterwards—I have no recollection of how he was dressed—I think he wan in his shirt sleeves—he is generally in his long over coat—I never knew him have a horse and cart.

Cross-examined. Q. What hour was it you saw him? A. About 11 o'clock—I was not asked to come here; I was asked to give the affidavit—I called at Mrs. Spleen's, who keeps a beer-shop, to have a glass of beer, and she told me about what Harradine was charged with—she knew it was the day she went to the Crystal Palace, and my mother went with her, and I knew it was the day of the Chartist meeting, for I saw them pass at the time.

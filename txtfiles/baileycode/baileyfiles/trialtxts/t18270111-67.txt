            . I am a constable of St. Martin's-court. I was there about seven o'clock in the evening of the 2d of January - I saw the two prisoners in company: Smith took up an umbrella at a shop, but a person came into the shop, and he put it down again - they went away, and I saw them attempt several other shops; they then came to Mr. Dutton's - I went ten yards off, and watched them - I saw Smith go into the shop and return; he then pressed Austin forward into the shop; they came away very quick; I ran round another way to meet them, and stopped them - I found the boots on Smith, but I believe Austin took them; I took them into the public-house, and secured them - Austin was running so fast, that he ran against Smith, when I stopped him.

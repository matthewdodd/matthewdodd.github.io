FRANCIS BAYMAN
 I am a French polisher, and live in old Gravel-lane, I work for Ebenezer Groffman, a cabinet-maker, in Cannon-street-road—on the 12th of February, I finished a mahogany child's chair, the property of Mr. Groffman—I afterwards heard a noise in the front shop—I went into the shop and missed the chair—I went outside, and could not see any one—I turned into the Commercial-road, and about twenty yards down the road I saw the prisoner carrying it—I brought him back, and he said a man was going to give 3d., to carry the chair—I ran out directly I heard the noise—I stopped him twelve or fourteen doors round the corner—the chair had been inside the shop.





EBENEZER GROFFMAN
 I am a cabinet-maker, and live in Cannon-street-road. This chair is my property—I bought it of a man—Bayman only polished it for me on my premises—the prisoner told me he was to have 3d. for carrying it—it was just within the shop.

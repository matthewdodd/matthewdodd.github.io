EDWARD HATTON
 was indicted

 for burglariously breaking and entering the dwelling-house of 




John Dorrell, about the hour of five o'clock in the night, on the 
31st of January, at 
St. Saviour, Southwark, with intent to steal.






JOHN DORRELL
. I am a dealer in marine-stores, living in Redcross-street, in the parish of St. Saviour, Southwark—I have purchased things of the prisoner. Last Monday night I shut up at ten o'clock all safe—my wife and daughter and myself sleep in the house—my son and a friend sat up to watch—I came down about five o'clock on Tuesday morning—I thought it was six—I told my son it was six, and he might leave—he said it was only five—I went to bed again—I had not gone five minutes be. fore this happened—it was a quarter-past five—I had lost money before this, and could not account how it had gone.





RICHARD BROWN
. I am a warehouseman, living in Cross-lane—I sat up two or three nights at this house. Between five and six o'clock on Tuesday morning, I saw the prisoner get over the wall, which is ten feet high, and lower himself down into the back-yard—he then moved a tub which covered a grating, and lifted up the grating, and dropped himself down into the cellar—a friend, who was with me, let the grating down—we took a light and found the prisoner—he had gone from the back-cellar to the front-cellar, and had got his shoes off ready to come up Stairs—there is a way up from there.





FREDERICK LONG
 (police-constable M 100.) I took the prisoner.
(William Hatton, a labourer, gave the prisoner a good character.)




GUILTY
. Aged 24.—


Transported for Ten Years.

            . I keep a public house
 in Russel Court


; the prisoner lived servant
 with me about a month: on the 7th of November I was upon the jury at Westminster; when I came home, my wife told me, she believed we had lost our maid; she had been gone out about an hour; and about three, the boy ran away. The next morning a person called with a bill; I went up to my room, and out of a drawer I missed ten guineas and a moidore; neither the door nor drawer were locked: I began to think the robbery was betwixt them: while I was getting a warrant for the boy, my wife recollected the prisoner had lived at the Bull in Milford Lane: I went there with Mr. Thomas and Mr. Asbridge; I was informed she was in bed at a house over the way; I went, and she was getting out of bed; I said I was glad to see her; she said I could not hang her; I asked her if she had any of the money left? she gave me two guineas and the moidore, and said, that was all she had left; and delivered me a box with aprons, shifts, and things in it, which she said she had bought with the rest of the money.

The prisoner said nothing in her defence.

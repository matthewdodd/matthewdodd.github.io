            . I am a hat-maker
. On the 9th of April, between twelve and one o'clock at night, I met the prisoner in Holborn


; she asked me for some gin, and took hold of my arm. She pulled me up a court, and drew my money out - I saw her put it in her bosom. I asked her to give it to me - She said she had not taken it. I secured her, and called the watchman - He found it in her bosom. I was quite sober.

FREDERICK CHILDS HANCOCK
 was again indicted

 for stealing, on the 
11th of February, 1 watch, value 10l. 10s., the goods of 



Edward Watson, his master.






EDWARD WATSON
. I am a watch-maker, and live in King-street, Cheapside. I have lost a gold watch of the value of 10l. 10s., and have never recovered it—the prisoner absconded on the 11th of February, and that day I missed the watch—I saw the foreman give him one—I have lost a considerable quantity of more property.





CHARLES WILLIAMSON
. On the 11th of February I saw the prisoner, and gave him a double-backed, gold-dial ladies' watch, to go to the Joint Stock Bank to wind and set the clocks by, expecting him to return in a few minutes—he did not return, nor send the watch.

Prisoner. Q. What time did you give it me? A. At nine o'clock—it was the last thing I did—you went to set the clock.




GUILTY
. Aged 33.—


Transported for Seven Years more.

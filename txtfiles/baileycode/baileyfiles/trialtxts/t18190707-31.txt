. On the 2d of June, about twelve o'clock at night, I was returning home - I had rang at the bell. The prisoner came up, and wished to force herself into conversation with me; I desired her to walk on. She stood there looking up and down - I rang the bell a second time, and while my hand was up to pull the bell I felt something at my trowsers-pocket; before I could get my hand down she snatched her hand out; I found all my silver gone - there were 17 s. in my pocket before. I immediately charged her with robbing me, and endeavoured to secure her hand, which had my money in it. I took hold of her arm; she asked me what I wanted? I called the watch; she kept struggling, and pulled me three or four doors on. She stood on an area; when the watchman came she let the money fall; part of it went down the area. I only found 8 s.

            . I was constable of the night; the prisoner was brought to the watch-house. I went with the prosecutor to search the area, and found two half crowns and three shillings, at the corner of Arundel-street.

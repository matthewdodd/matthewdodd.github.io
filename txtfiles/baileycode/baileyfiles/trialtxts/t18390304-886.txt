RICHARD EMLEY
. I am a spice broker. My counting-house is in

St. Martin's-lane, but I reside at Brixton. On Saturday afternoon, the 23rd of February, I was in Whitechapel, near Alderman Johnson's gateway, I felt something move at my pocket—I put my hand there, and my handkerchief was gone—I instantly turned round, and saw the prisoner and another—the one nearest me was passing my handkerchief to the prisoner—I seized him with it in his hand, and kept him till the policeman came—the other tried to raise a mob, and escaped—this is my handkerchief—(looking at it.)





THOMAS FISHER
 (City police-constable, No. 464.) I received the prisoner into custody, and the handkerchief from the prosecutor.




GUILTY
.* Aged 21.—


Transported for Ten Years.

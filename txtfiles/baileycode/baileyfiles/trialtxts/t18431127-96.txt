WILLIAM THOMPSON
, cabinet-maker, Circus-street, Marylebone. The prisoner lodged in my house for six weeks—on the 27th of October I went into the room, and missed a swing looking-glass, which was let to her with the room—I asked where it was—she said the plate was broken, and it was gone to have a new plate—I also missed some sheets, blankets, and the bed-tick was cut, and the feathers gone—I shut the prisoner in the room, and went for an officer—these are the things—they are mine—this is the glass—the plate is not broken.





THOMAS AYRES
, apprentice to Mr. Gideon, pawnbroker, Stockton-street, Lisson-grove. I took this swing glass in pledge of the prisoner—I can swear to her—I have a blanket and two pillows, one of them pawned by the prisoner—I cannot swear who pawned the others.





JOHN GRANGER
 (police-sergeant D 21.) On the morning of the 28th of Oct. I was fetched by the prosecutor from the station-house—I saw the prisoner there—I had some conversation with her; in consequence of which, she produced these eleven duplicates.

ISAAC PLATTS

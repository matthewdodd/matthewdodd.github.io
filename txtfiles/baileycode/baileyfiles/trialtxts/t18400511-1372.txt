PETER ALEXANDER YOUNG
. I reside in Great Russell-street, and am a merchant. On the afternoon of the 13th of April, about five o'clock, I was in Regent-street—I had two shillings in a purse in my coat-pocket—I had not seen my purse for some time, but I felt it safe—I felt something at my pocket—I turned round and collared the prisoner—I said, "You are picking my pocket"—he said, "It is not me "—a gentleman who was standing by took up the purse about two yards from him and gave it me.





WILLIAM HILLARY
. I am errand-boy to Alexander Gordon. I was a in Regent-street—I saw the prisoner behind the prosecutor—he had his hand in his pocket—I saw the purse come out, and he threw it on the ground when the gentleman laid hold of him.


Cross-examined by
MR. DOANE. Q. What time was this? A. A quarter-past five o'clock—I think I had seen the prisoner before—I had had no quarrel with him.





MATTHEW TEAL
 (police-constable C 107.) I took the prisoner, and have the purse.





WILLIAM ELLIS
 (police-constable C 91.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got at Mr. Clark's office—(read)—he is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 19.—


Transported for Ten Years.

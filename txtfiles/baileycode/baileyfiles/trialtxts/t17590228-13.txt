                  Thomas 
                  Wale 
               



             I am a Carpenter
: I was at work at a building in Queen Anne's-street, near Marybone












; I locked up my tools in my chest, on the 20th of January at night, being a Saturday night in that house, and on Monday the 22d when I went to work in the morning, I found my chest had been brook open, and my two saws were taken away.
Q. What time did you go there in the morning?
Wale. About six o'clock.
Q. How was it broke?
Wale. The lid was chopped with an ax, I suppose; I went to Mr. Fielding and had them advertised in his paper; on the Tuesday night I went again, and there saw my saws, and the two prisoners at the bar.
Q. Did you hear them examined?
Wale. I can't recollect what was said to them: I never spoke to either of them. The two saws produced in court and deposed to.


                  Robert 
                  Alexander 
               



            . On Monday the 22d of January, about noon the prisoner Wilson came to my shop.
Q. What shop do you keep?
Alexander. I am a Pawn-broker, and live by the side of the Fleet-market; he brought a saw to pawn.
Q. Did he come alone?
Alexander. He was alone: I asked him his name; he told me his name was Pollard, and that his name was engraved on the saw, there I saw that name engraved; I asked him where he lived, he said he lived with Mr. Jones: I lent him 2 s. upon it; the next morning I was reading the Public Advertiser, I saw this saw expressed particularly, and mentioned to have been stolen; I went to Mr. Fielding's as the advertisement directed, and there was the next evidence John Spence with another saw, and by Mr. Fielding's desire, I went with two men to a house at Marybone, where this Wilson did use, in order to take him, but could not find him; we heard where his lodgings were, and went there, but neither he nor the woman at the bar were at home; the Constable was sent for; he broke their lodging-room door open, and several saws were taken thereout; the woman was coming up stairs, and we took her; then we heard that Wilson was in the Gatehouse, upon which Mr. Fielding sent a detainer there, and afterwards sent for him to be brought to be examined.
Q. to prosecutor. Was the name Pollard on your saw when you lost it?
Prosecutor. It was.


                  John 
                  Spence 
               



            . (he produc'd a saw) I took this saw in of the woman at the bar.
Q. Where do you live?
Spence. I live at the corner of Crane-court, and am a pawnbroker.
Q. Where is Crane-court?
Spence. It is by St. Ann's church.
Q. When did she bring it to you?
Spence. She brought it on the 22d of January; I observed in the Advertiser several saws were advertised, and this amongst the rest; so I went in order to find out the woman; she said she lodg'd in Hog-lane, at a breeches maker's; I found a breeches maker, and he told me there was such a woman came there, but did not lodge there; and that there was a little girl there that us'd to come with her. I insisted on the girl's shewing me the woman's lodgings; we went to her lodgings, but she was out; I went again in the evening, and we broke the door open, in order to find some tools that were given an account of before the Justice; as we had just done, the woman came home, and we secured her.
Wilson's Defence.
I am entirely innocent of it; as to 
               
                  Mary 
                  Harris 
               



            , I did not live with her at that time. I had those saws of one Thomas Parker, he told me he was going to sea, and he ow'd me money, and he let me have them for my debt.
For Harris's character.

                  Mary 
                  Harris 
               



             seven or eight years, she behaved with industry 'till this other prisoner seduc'd her; and now she is near her time by him: I am really persuaded it is by his influence that she has been drawn into this.

               stealing one copper tea-kettle, value 6 d. one linnen sheet, value 1 s. one diaper table-cloth, and one brass candlestick, the property of

            . January 21

                  Drew 
               



            . I live in broad St Giles's












, the prisoner was a lodger in my house; these things mentioned in the indictment were taken from out of her lodgings about the 21st of January.
Q. Did you or your wife let her the lodgings?
Drew. My wife did.
Q. Was you by at the time?
Drew. No, I was not.
Q. Was you at home when she came to take possession of the lodging-room?
Drew. I was.

Q. Did any body come along with her?
Drew. No, she came by herself; I had not then seen the man that was tried with her just now; she brought some things with her and proposed to come at six, but she came at five o'clock; so that I had not time to go to enquire about her character.
Q. Did Wilson come to lodge with her, for the indictment mentions his having taken the lodging.
Drew. He came that same night, and lodg'd with her 'till they were taken up.
Q. How long had they lodg'd there?
Drew. About two months.
Q. Did they pass for man and wife?
Drew. They did; the other prosecutors came to search the lodging-room, the prisoner and Wilson not being at home, the door was lock'd; I gave them liberty to break open the door; the prisoner came home, they took her, they ask'd her where Wilson was; she at last said he was in the Gatehouse Westminster; then I look'd about and miss'd the things mentioned in the indictment out of the room.
Q. Were they part of the furniture of that room?
Drew. They were.
Q. Did you ever find them again?
Drew. She told me they were at Mr. Fell's a pawnbroker, where I went and found them, and carried them to Mr Fielding's; Mr Fell being there, he took them back again, in order to produce here.
Q. How did the woman behave?
Drew. She always behaved herself well, but I belive she has been us'd very ill by the fellow that is just gone from the bar. She once had pawn'd the tea-kettle before, and brought it back again, and I believe, if she had not been taken up when she was, she would have brought the things all again.


                  Thomas 
                  Harrison 
               



            . I live with Mr Fell a pawnbroker: he produced a tea-kettle, a sheet, a table-cloth, and a candlestick: I took in of the prisoner at the bar such things as these.
Q. When?
Harrison. On the 4th of January.
Q. Did any body come with her?
Harrison. There came a little girl I believe with her sometimes; Mr. Drew fetch'd them away and carry'd them to Mr Fielding's, and then Mr. Fielding ordered them again into my custody; so I can't be positive as to the identity of them.
Q. Were the same things that Mr Drew fetch'd away the same things which the prisoner pledg'd with you?
Harrison. They were the very same.
Q. to prosecutor. Were the goods which you took from the pawnbroker, the very same that were deliver'd back to the pawnbroker at Mr Fielding's again?
Prosecutor. The very same; and these produced are them, they are my property.
Q. Where is your wife, for she let the room?
Prosecutor. She could not come here.

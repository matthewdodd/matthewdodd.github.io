STEPHEN POWELL
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
28th of February, 1 bridle, value 15s.; the goods of 



Edward West; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






THOMAS BRUNT
. I am a policeman. About eight o'clock on the 28th of February, I and another officer were at Leighton, in Essex—I saw the prisoner pass me with something bulky in his pocket—I asked what he had got—he said, what was that to me—I desired the other officer to search him, and he found this bridle in his pocket—(producing it)—he said he bought it of a man for 3s.—I found the owner, Mr. West, of Church-street, Hackney.





EDWARD WEST
. I live in Church-street, Hackney. This bridle is mine—it was taken from my stable at the back of my house.





JAMES LAVER
. I know this bridle belongs to my master—it was in the stable—I had locked it in—the stable was broken open about five o'clock that evening, and the bridle taken.

Prisoner. I was going home, and a man by Hackney gate offered the bridle for sale for 3s.—I gave him that for it—he said he was a harness-maker, and lived at Hackney—I was going through Leighton, and called at a public-house—I had half-a-pint of beer, and then the policeman stopped me.





THOMAS POCOCK
 (police-sergeant F 13.) I produce a certificate of the

prisoner's former conviction, from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person who was tried.




GUILTY
. Aged 40.—


Transported for Fourteen Years.

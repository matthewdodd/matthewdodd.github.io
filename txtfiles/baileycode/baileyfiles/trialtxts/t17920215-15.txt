             sworn.
The things mentioned in the indictment were hanging up to dry in an adjoiningroom; the prisoners are both strangers; the door was locked; I went in about half an hour, and the things were gone; it was between twelve and one o'clock in the day; when I went to unlock the door, I found it unlocked; I have got the things back; I advertised; I went to Litchfield-street, and saw them there.

             sworn.
On Thursday the 2d, I was going along Brownlow-street; I saw the prisoner in company with another, and two women; I suspected they had robbed my neighbour; I followed them to Bowl-yard, St. Giles's; the prisoner went into a house, No. 7; the man prisoner came out, and conducted the women in; I went and fetched Peters, and the prisoner came out first; I catched hold of him; I caught hold of this woman, and she had a bundle in her left-hand; the man at the bar was cutting away at Mr. Ashfield; this caught my attention; the bundle contained a gown and petticoat, and white apron; I did not see the bundle dropped; I saw it afterwards at the office; I am sure it is the same bundle I saw in the street; I stopped the woman, and afterwards carried her to Short's-gardens; there he was surrounded by thirty or forty people, I mean Ashfield.
Prisoner Abrahams. Whether I had any company when you saw me go through Bowl-yard? - I am sure he is the man who first came out of the house.

                   ASHFIELD
               



             sworn.
I am a boot-maker; I was called to Bowl-yard, and saw the two prisoners, and two others, in the shop; they came out nearly together; I got hold of Abrahams; he twisted himself away; I got him again; he drew a knife, and I was cut, but I do not chuse to swear that the prisoner cut me; it was with great difficulty I could get him to the justice's; I searched him, and found a long pair of scissars in his pocket.

I keep a coal-shed; I saw that man take them, and that is all I know.

Prisoner Abrahams. I have nothing to say in my defence; there was nothing found on me.
Prisoner Patten. I was going into an iron-shop to buy a padlock, and this man asked me what I had got in my apron; I said, nothing; and he immediately took me to the office, and said I was in company.

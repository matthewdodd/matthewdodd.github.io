             , of St. Botolph Aldgate


, was indicted for 


               feloniously stealing four half hundred Iron Weights
            , the Property of our Sovereign Lord

                  Price 
               



            , depos'd, That the Prisoner brought to him four half hundred Weights to sell , at several times, telling him he was a Night-Man, and had found them in an House of Office, that he had bought two, and his Son coming to see him, who belonged to one of the King's-Yards, he seeing the Weights said, what do you do with these Weights? They are the King's, here is the broad R upon them; that the Prisoner bringing him the two last, he suspecting him before, had refus'd to pay him, till he brought sufficient Witness how he came by them, and he coming to demand his Money, or the Weights, he seiz'd him, and sent word to the Custom-House, to Mr. Parsons, who own'd them to be the King's Weights, as he also depos'd in Court; the Fact being plain, the Jury found the Prisoner 

               guilty
             of the Indictment.

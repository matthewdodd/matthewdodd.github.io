            , a shoemaker
, in Carey-place, Vauxhall-bridge-road. I was in Regent-street


 one Saturday, a few days before I went to the Magistrate's - I was taking a bundle to go to the mangler's; I saw the prisoner - he came, took the shawl from the bundle, and threw the other things down - I saw him again the next morning, and pointed him out to the officer.
JOHN TUBB. I am a Police-constable. I suspected the prisoner, from the description this boy gave, and I took him - I asked what he had done with the shawl; he said he had not seen it.

            .
JAMES CRANSTON. I am a coach proprietor
. On Monday, the 3d of January, I lost a saddle, a bridle, and a martingale, out of the hind boot of my coach. I came from Walton and Usher. I had seen them safe in the boot at Brentford


, about half-past six o'clock - I missed them on this side of Sloane-street


; some person hallooed to me that my hind boot was open. I found the things in the possession of the officers at Marlborough-street, on Thursday, the 6th of January. I had not seen the prisoner, nor a gig near my coach. I missed the things about half-past eight o'clock in the evening.

            . I am a conductor of the patrol. On Monday evening, about half-past nine o'clock, I was going down Piccadilly, near Down-street, an officer came and told me something - we stopped a one-horse chaise, and found the prisoner in it; Mobbs, the officer, got in and searched the chaise, and found the saddle, bridle, and martingale. I found on the prisoner a key, which opened the boot door of Cranston's coach.

            . I was with Lincoln, and took the property from the gig.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

 for stealing 1 tame fowl, price 2s., the property of 



Thomas Holley; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






JAMES CLOUTING
 (police-constable D 156.) At a little before six o'clock in the evening, on the 9th of Oct., I was in Middlesex-place, New-road—I saw the prisoner with this basket under his arm—I knew him, and stopped him—I asked what he had got in the basket—he said, "A live fowl"—I asked where he got it—he said, "Out of the area at No. 21, Steven-street"—I took him to the station—he had this fowl.

Prisoner. I told him I had a chicken I was going to take to the station—I was going towards the station. Witness. No, he had got past the station—he said, "If I could find an owner for it."





WILLIAM COLLINS COOPER
. I work for Mr. Holley, of No. 8, Grove-mews—he keeps fowls there. On the morning of the 9th of Oct., at half-past six o'clock, I fed the fowls—they were all safe then—there were twelve of them—I afterwards missed one—this is it—it is Mr. Thomas Holley's.

Prisoner's Defence. I was in Steven-street at half-past five o'clock; the landlady of No. 20 and 21, said to me, "Go down that area and fetch that chicken out, and take it to the station."





JAMES CLOUTING

re-examined. He told me he brought it from No. 21, Steven-street—I went and inquired—I found it was lost from Grove-mews, Lisson-grove—he was past the street that leads down to the station—he could not have gone to any station the way he was going.

JURY. Q. How far was he from the prosecutor's house? A. 600 or 700 yards—I have been to No. 21, Steven-street—it is a brothel—they denied the statement altogether.





THOMAS HAZELDINE
 (police-constable D 104.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction—(read—Convicted 6th Jan., 1846, and confined six months)—the prisoner is the person—he is a very bad character, and goes about with thieves.




GUILTY

 for stealing, on the

JOHN WRIGHT.
On the 23rd of May I saw the prisoner, a little after five o'clock in the morning, take a barrow from Mr. Wilshen's fore-court, at Camberwell—he wheeled it a little way, then turned, and went on to Deptford—my brother and I followed him—my brother spoke to a policeman, and the prisoner was taken with the barrow.





JOHN GOLDFINCH
(police-constable R59.) Wright's brother spoke to me—the prisoner had a wheelbarrow, and I asked him if it was his—he said, "No, " he borrowed it of a brush-maker—I let him go—the barrow was sold afterwards, and found by an officer of our division.





JOSEPH WILSHEN.
I live in Canterbury-place, Camberwell—I lost this barrow—I had seen it safe the evening before—there is a gateway to the yard where it was taken from, and the gates were shut.

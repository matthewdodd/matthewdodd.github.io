            . I am a green-grocer
. The prisoner was in my employ, and had been so for a month; he was to receive money and bring it to me immediately - he never brought me 13s. from Smith.
SOPHIA SMITH. I paid the prisoner on the 14th of April, 13s. for his master, about half-past five o'clock in the afternoon, at my master's house - there was no bill; I gave him a sovereign to give change - he gave me 7s.
JACOB FULFORD. He never brought me that money; he had run away from me on the day before, with a basket of potatoes, for which he received 3s., at Mr. Hamilton's; he knew that Smith owed me this money - I had sent him there with potatoes; I had not discharged him.

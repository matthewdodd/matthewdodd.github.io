            . I live with my grandfather, Benjamin Timbrell - he is a constable
; his wife keeps a shop, and sells shoes - I saw the prisoner come and take the shoes, and give them to another one behind him, who ran away; my grandmother seized the prisoner, and said "Your companion is gone, but I will take good care you shall not go" - he said, "If you don't let me go I will murder you;" he got out of her hands, went up a barber's passage, and got over the wall into the next yard - the Police-officer came and found him in the privy; I did not see him found, but I am quite sure he is the person.
CHARLES BURWOOD. I am a Police-officer. On the 16th of January I was on duty in St. Ann's-street, Westminster, a few minutes before nine o'clock, and heard Stop thief! called; I ran, and Speed told me his grandmother had been robbed of a pair of shoes, that one of the men had gone into the barber's passage, and if I went through the George and Blue Boar, I should find him - I went, and found him in the privy; his hand and wrist were cut, as I suppose, with the glass bottles on the wall.

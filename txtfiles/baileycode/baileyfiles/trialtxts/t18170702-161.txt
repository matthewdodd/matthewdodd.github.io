WILLIAM BURROWS. I live on Chelsea Common


. On the 1st of June, about five o'clock in the morning, I was alarmed, and missed four ducks and one goose, which I had fastened up in my cellar under the shop-it was not locked. I saw them again about a quarter of an hour after-the prisoner was in custody. He lived in the neighbourhood.

            . I am a watchman. On the 1st of June, about five o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner and another man near Burrows's; each of them had a bag - I watched them. They were driving poultry, and going into people's yards-they saw me. I went home, altered my dress, and went out again. I found the prisoner near Burrows's door, giving the poultry corn - I concealed myself, and saw both of them together again. I got assistance, and secured the prisoner, and found the poultry in a bag on his shoulder. He said, if I did not let him go, he would butcher me. He knocked me down - I kept fast hold of him, and found four ducks and one goose in the bag, dead, but quite warm.
JAMES BETTEL. I heard the alarm - I live on the Common. I saw the watchman knocked down, and the prisoner over him - I secured him. He said the bags were his property.

HENRY BARBER
 was indicted

 for stealing 1 umbrella, value 7s. 6d., the goods of 



Robert Linwood; and that he had been before convicted of felony,






SAMUEL SMITH
. I am apprentice to Mr. Robert Linwood, a pawnbroker—he lives in Clerkenwell. At half-past ten o'clock on Saturday night, the 5th of Oct., I saw this umbrella hanging at the door—I saw it move—I ran out, and saw the prisoner jump off the gate, with the umbrella in his hand—I said I wanted him—he dropped it, and ran off—I ran and caught him—he struggled, but I kept him.

Prisoner. I never ran away at all; I was going up St. John-street, and an umbrella dropped; a gentleman passed me, and I was going to

give it him; this man came and said I stole it Witness. He had only just turned out of the gate, not a yard from the door, when I first saw him—no one else was near that could have dropped it.





EDWARD HARDING
 (City police-constable, No. 274.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person, and he had been convicted of felony before that.




GUILTY
. Aged 17.—


Transported for Seven Years.

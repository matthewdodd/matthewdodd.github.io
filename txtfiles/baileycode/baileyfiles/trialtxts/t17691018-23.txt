            . I live facing Southampton-street, in Holborn


. I let the prisoner a ready-furnished lodging in my fore-garret. My wife told me I was robbed of things in the prisoner's room. I went and looked, and missed the things mentioned in the indictment. I went to the pawnbroker, where I understood he used, and found some of the things. When the prisoner came home, I took him up: he acknowledged he pawned the sheets for 8 s. and that he sold the bed curtains out-right; and that he had pawned the blanket and rug.

I was going into business, and the next week I should have taken them all out of pawn again.

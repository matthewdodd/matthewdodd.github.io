ELIZABETH M'LAREN
 was again indicted

 for stealing, on the 
26th of December, 1 table-cloth, value 3s.; and 1 blanket, value 4s.; the goods of 



Joseph Jacobs, her master.


MARIA JACOBS. I am the wife of Joseph Jacobs. The prisoner was in our service in December last, and when she was gone I missed a table-cloth, a blanket, and several other things—these are my articles—(looking at them)—I have no doubt of them at all—my name is on the table-cloth.





JAMES HENRY WILLIAMSON
. I am a pawnbroker. I have produced a table-cloth and blanket—the prisoner pawned the table-cloth on the 27th of December—I cannot say who pawned the blanket.





JOHN STARLING
. I took the prisoner, and on her found the duplicate of the table-cloth.

Prisoner's Defence. These things are mine—I bought them of a woman that was going to Scotland.




GUILTY
. Aged 24.—


Transported for Seven Years.

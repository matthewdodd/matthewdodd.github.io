1699. 




JAMES PARKER
 was indicted

 for stealing 1 cloak, value 10s.; and 1 shawl, 5s.; the goods of 



Thomas Webb.—2nd COUNT, stating them to be the goods of 



James Webb; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






GEORGE FARDELL
. I live with Mr. Webb, a livery-stable keeper, in Redlion-street, Whitechapel. On the 13th of May I heard a horse coming down the yard, and saw the prisoner leaving a chaise belonging to Mr. James Webb, of Plaistow—I asked the prisoner what he wanted—he made no answer—I asked him again, and he ran out—I went after him, and, in Colchester-street, he said, if I followed him he would punch my head—he ran on till he came to a policeman, who took him.

Cross-examined by
MR. PAYNE. Q. Who is James Webb? A. I do not know—my master is Thomas Webb—the chaise was under my master's care, standing in the yard to bait.





WILLIAM STEVENS
. I was in the yard, and saw the prisoner standing at the chaise with a cloak and shawl in his hand—when he heard the step of my horse he threw the things into another chaise and ran away.






WILLIAM BROCK
 (police-constable H 65.) I saw the prisoner running—I said "What is all this about?"—he said "It is only a lark"—I stopped him hearing a cry of "Stop thief,"

Cross-examined. Q. How far was it from the yard? A. About two hundred yards—he had ran through two streets into the Tenter-ground—when I got back to the yard the cloak and shawl were lying at the bottom of the chaise.





CHARLES WEBBER
 (police-constable C 122.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 24.—


Transported for Seven Years.

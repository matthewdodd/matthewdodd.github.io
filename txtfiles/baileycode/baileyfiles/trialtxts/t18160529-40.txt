            . I was in Newgate-street


, on the 18th of May, at about twelve o'clock in the forenoon; I was coming from the West End of the Town to the City, and felt a crowd pressing on me; I turned round, and saw my handkerchief drop from the prisoner Myers, upon which the little boy picked it up, and concealed it under his coat. I took them both, and gave them in charge to an officer.

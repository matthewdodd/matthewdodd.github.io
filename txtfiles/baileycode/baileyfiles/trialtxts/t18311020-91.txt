JAMES SIMEON. I am a shop-lad
, at a sale-shop in Holywell-street. On Friday night, the 7th of October, I was in Holborn


, at half-past eleven o'clock, I took out my handkerchief, and wiped my face - while I was doing so the prisoner came up, and asked what was the matter; before I could answer he snatched my handkerchief out of my hand, and ran up Leather-lane - I called out Stop thief! a gentleman brought back my handkerchief, and I knew it to be mine - the prisoner is the person who took it.

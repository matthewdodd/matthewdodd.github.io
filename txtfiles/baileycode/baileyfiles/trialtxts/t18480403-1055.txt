GEORGE JACKSON



, feloniously assaulting 



Ellen Baylis, being armed with a stick, with intent to rob her.






ELLEN BAYLIS.
 I am single, and live with my uncle, James Pearce, On 27th March I was crossing Witham-common, and heard some one running behind me—the prisoner came up—I had never seen him before—I he asked me to give him some money—I said I had not got any—he said he would not believe it, and tried to put his hand into my pocket—I prevented him, and he pushed me backwards into a ditch—he swore a great deal, and hit me two or three times with a stick—I screamed out, and he ran away—it was a public path—he did not appear in liquor.





THOMAS FRANCIS.
 I was going through the fields with Stevens, heard a female's cry, and saw Baylis waling along, crying—she complained to me—we went with her to the place—Stevens picked up a glove, which she owned.





JOHN STEVENS.
 I was with Francis, and heard a female cry out two or three times—we went to the place, and found Baylis—she told us what had happened—we went back with her—she showed me the place—I found her glove there.





WILLIAM BURRIDGE
 (policeman.) I took the prisoner at Feltham, and said it was for feloniously assaulting a woman, with intent to rob her—he denied all knowledge of it—I asked where he was on Monday—he said he was looking for work, round by Twickenham—this is Mr. Conant's signature to these depositions—(read)—The prisoner says, "It was Saturday, and not Monday, when I met the young woman; I did not want to rob her, I only asked her if she would help a young fellow on the road; I did not push her into the ditch."

Prisoner's Defence. I did not intend to rob her; I only caught hold of her shawl, and pushed her into th editch.




GUILTY. Aged 19.—


Transported for Seven Years.


Before Mr. Justice Erle.

            . I was in Mr. Leake's kitchen, and saw the Prisoner come down stairs, and go out with one of my mistress's gowns under her cloak (I did not see her come in or take them) I went after her, and she dropped the two gowns from under her cloak; she went to strike me in order to get away, but a man came up with a wooden leg, and stopped her.

            . I was sent for, and when I came home, I asked the Prisoner how she came to do it, she said she was weary of her life, and wanted to be transported; and thought she could live better abroad than here, and gave me a slap on the face.

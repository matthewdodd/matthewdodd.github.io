            . I am the wife of 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Barrow
               



            , who lives in Middleton-street, Spitalfields


. On the 9th of September, the prisoner came and took a furnished bedroom at 3 s. per week. He slept there that night, and did not come again until the Tuesday following; he then said he had been into the country to see his father, who was dangerously ill - he went out about half-past six o'clock next morning. As soon as he was gone, I went up stairs, and missed these things, which I am certain were in the room when he went to bed the overnight. I have never found them.

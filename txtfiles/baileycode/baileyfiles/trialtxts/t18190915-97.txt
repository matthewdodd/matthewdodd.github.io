JEREMIAH HARRIGE. I live in Camomile-street. On the 3d of September, about five o'clock in the afternoon, I was in Smithfield, opposite Saunders's show in the fair

            . I am a constable. I was standing in the fair close behind the prosecutor; Jones told me to watch the prisoner, who was close behind me. I kept my eye on him, and saw him take something out of the prosecutor's pocket, and put it into his trowsers. I laid hold of the prisoner by the right arm - Hull informed the prosecutor. The prisoner drew his hand from his trowsers, and the handkerchief was in it - he dropped it, and I picked it up. He said,
"Distress drove me to it."

            . I am an officer. I was with Carlisle; Jones told me to notice the prisoner. I saw him go close behind Harrige, and saw him take something from his pocket - he was secured, and I informed the prosecutor.

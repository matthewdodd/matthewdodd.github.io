             and 
               
                  
                     JOHN

             were indicted for 


               stealing, on the 18th of January
, twelve sets of drawing instruments, value 36 s.
            , the goods of 
               
                  
                     Thomas 
                     Blunt
                  



               
             and 
               
                  
                     Edward 
                     Blunt

            . I am shopman to Thomas and 
               
                  Edward 
                  Blunt
               



            . On the 18th January, between nine and ten o'clock in the morning the prisoner's came into the shop, Grandy asked for a black lead pencil - I shewed him some at 6 d., he offered 4 d. for one; Roberts touched him on the shoulder, and said two or three times,
"Make haste, give him 6 d.," he (Roberts) immediatelyran out of the shop. The errand-boy pursued, and a young gentleman brought in twelve sets of instruments which had been on our counter a quarter of an hour before; Grandy remained in the shop, and was detained, and Roberts secured.

            . I am servant to the prosecutor. I went after Roberts, because I saw him take the instruments off the counter, and put them under his great coat. I followed, he dropped them on the pavement - I did not see them picked up - they were taken into the shop while I was pursuing them.

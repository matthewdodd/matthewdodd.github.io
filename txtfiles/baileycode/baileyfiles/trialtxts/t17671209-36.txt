            . I keep a haberdasher's shop
 at Mile-end


. On the 24th of November they came into my shop about twelve o'clock in the day, they wanted to see some handkerchiefs; my mother handed them down some; I was writing, they did not see me; I observed Cordall draw some out that lay underneath, and he got to shoving it down into Doil's pocket; there happened to be two handkerchiefs, and they could not get them in; my mother saw them, and said, you rogues, what are you doing, you are come to steal; I said, you need not have spoke so soon, I saw them, and was coming to them.

            . I stood about three yards from the prisoners; I was out of the shop, and saw Cordall draw the handkerchiefs from the counter, and was putting them into Doil's pocket.
The prisoners both denied the charge, and said they were both but 16 years of age.

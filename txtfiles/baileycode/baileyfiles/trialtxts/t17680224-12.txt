            . About five minutes before eight o'clock on the 27th of January, I saw the prisoner and another young man standing by Mr. Kelly's window; the sash was thrown up, the prisoner went in at the window without a great coat, and came out with one; I ran and stopped him with this coat on his left shoulder, and took him into Mr. Kelly's house.
Prisoner's defence.
I was going by with a young lad, he chucked my hat in at the window; I went in to get it, and that man laid hold of me, thinking I was going to rob the house; I never saw the great coat.

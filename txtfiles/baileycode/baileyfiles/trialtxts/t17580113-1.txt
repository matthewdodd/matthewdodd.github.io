            . I am butler to my lord Gower. The prisoner is a soldier
; he came to see me, and was with me in the pantry, where much plate was, from about four in the afternoon till seven on the 27th of December last. On the next day Mr Fell, a pawnbroker, came and brought me a silver spoon, which I know to be my lord's property.

            . The prisoner came to me on the 27th of December, brought the bowl of a silver spoon, and offer'd it to me to sale; but I suspecting it to have been stolen, sent my boy for a constable. Then I asked the prisoner where the handle was, who said he had it not. I charged the constable with him, ordered him to search him, and this handle was found upon him. (Producing the two pieces, deposed to as the property of lord Gower.

I found the spoon as I was coming out of the pantry.

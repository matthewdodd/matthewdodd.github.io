ROBERT ADAMSON. I was in Wych-street


, about three o'clock in the afternoon; I observed the prisoner and some others pressing close to me. I put my hand to my pocket, and immediately raised my handkerchief. A young man gave me some information, and pointed to the two persons who had passed me, of whom the prisoner was one; I laid hold of the prisoner, as I was told he was the receiver, and on searching him, I found my handkerchief; the other made his escape.

            . I saw the other man who was with the prisoner make an attempt at the prosecutor's handkerchief; and in a second attempt he succeeded in taking it, and gave it to the prisoner, who put it into his bosom, and rushed with considerable force past the prosecutor. I immediately gave the prosecutor information, and he secared the prisoner, and he was taken to Bow-street.

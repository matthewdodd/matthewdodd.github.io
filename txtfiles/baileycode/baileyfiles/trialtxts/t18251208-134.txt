            . I was in Holborn, and saw Skurray, and the two prisoners following him. Garraquez took the handkerchief, and gave it to Alcock. I got the prosecutor's address, and then crossed over and took Alcock in Hatton-garden - they were taken to the office. I had seen them following Mr. Skurrey about one hundred yards.

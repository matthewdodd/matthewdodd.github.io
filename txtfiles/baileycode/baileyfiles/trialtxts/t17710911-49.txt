            . I was servant
 to some sugar bakers in Ratcliffe High-way; I had been on board a ship on the 19th of July; I met with a friend when I came on shore; I went a drinking and lost my way; I met the prisoner and enquired my way to St. Giles's, he said, he would shew me; we went into a public house with a woman we picked up; I fell asleep, I felt the prisoner's hand in my pocket, the woman upon discovering I was awake ran away; the prisoner resisted; I dragged him to the door, there was only a girl in the house: she shut the door upon us; I endeavoured to take him to the watch house; he broke from me in Catharine-lane, a gentleman came by who stopt him; he jumped over the hatch, and had like to have got away; they searched him but found nothing upon him.
Q. Was you sober?
Ryland. I was a little merry, but sober enough to know what passed.
Prisoner's Defence.
I am innocent; I made no attempt to escape.

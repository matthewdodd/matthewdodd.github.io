            . On the 23d of February, about eleven o'clock at night, I was in Newgate-street


, going towards Cheapside. At the top of Warwick-lane


 I felt a pull at my pocket, turned round, and saw four men runing. Two ran down Warwick-lane, one up, and the other down Newgate-street. I followed the two down Warwick-lane, suspecting one of them had picked my pocket. I had not followed them above fifty yards, before I saw a handkerchief in one of their hands. I called out Stop thief! and at the entrance of Warwick-square he was stopped by the watchman - it was the prisoner. He said he had not got it, nor did he pick my pocket, and I might search him. I said he must have thrown it down very near that place; I went back a few yards, and found it on the ground. I never lost sight of him after I saw it in his hand.

            . I am a watchman. I heard the cry, saw the prisoner running towards me, and stopped him, he asked me what I wanted; the prosecutor came up, and asked him for his handkerchief? he said he had not gotit, nor did he know any thing about it. The prosecutor found it just by.

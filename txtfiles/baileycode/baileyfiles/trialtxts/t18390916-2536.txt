2536. 




MARY GALE
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
20th of July, 10 pairs of boots, value 36s., the goods of 



John Gould.






JOHN GOULD
. I am a shoe manufacturer, and live in Leader-street. On the 24th of July the prisoner bought some trifling articles which, I think, came to 5d.—as she was going out I followed, brought her back, and found three pairs of boots on her arm under her shawl—I gave to into custody.





THOMAS ANDERSON
 (police-constable T 84.) I took the prisoner—she told me she had pledged some other property.





JOHN LLOYD
. I am a pawnbroker. I produce five pairs of boots—I took in four pairs of the prisoner in the name of Williams.

MR. GOULD. These are all mine—there are ten pairs found in all—I cannot say when they were taken.
(Mrs. Waylett, the wife of a floor-cloth painter at Camberwell, gave the prisoner a good character.)




GUILTY
. Aged 17.—


Transported for Seven Years.
(There was another indictment against her.)

             , the 17th of September
 last.
It appear'd by the Evidence, That Robert Stader being a Covenant Servant
 to the Prosecutor, took the opportunity of carrying away Bobbins of Silk a Nights when he went from Work; and having got the Silk wound off, did bring back the empty Bobbins in the Morning to make up the Number of Bobbins delivered out to him to throw; and that the Prosecutor finding a Bale of Silk fall short, and suspecting the Prisoner, search'd his Father's House, where he found three full Bobbins in a Box, of which 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Stader 
               



            , the Father, had the Key; the Fact being plainly prov'd, the Jury found them 


               Guilty to the value of 4s. 10d.

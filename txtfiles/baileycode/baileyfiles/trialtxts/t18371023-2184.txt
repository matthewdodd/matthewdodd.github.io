WILLIAM CLARK
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
29th of September, 60 curtain rings, value 26s., the goods of 



William Smee and others.






GEORGE GARDENER
. I am in the employ of William Smee and Sons, Little Moorfields. We have been missing brass-work for some time—directed my son to conceal himself in a cupboard in the warehouse where the brass-work was kept—in consequence of what he said to me when he came out of the cupboard, I went after the prisoner, who had gone out.





GEORGE GARDENER, JUN
. I was put into the cupboard, and at two o'clock in the afternoon I saw the prisoner through" a hole in the cupboard come into the warehouse, take the brass rings off the floor, and put some (into his hat—I came out and told my father when the prisoner came out.





ALEXANDER ROBERTSON
. The prisoner was in the service of a man who does iron work for Messrs. Smee, and was in the habit of coming to the warehouse—I saw him go towards the warehouse on this day with a bag on his shoulder, and he came out afterwards,





THOMAS RYDER
. I live in Compton-street, Clerkenwell. The prisoner sometimes called at my house—on Friday, the 29th of September, be left a bag with me, and in consequence of what I heard, the bag was Inclined on the next day, and I found some papers of brass rings in it, which I delivered to the officer.





HENRY RAWSON
. I am a policeman. I produce five papers of brass rings which I got from Ryder.





GEORGE GARDENER, SEN.
, re-examined. We had parcels like these in the warehouse—I have examined them, and know them by the manner they are done up—they contain such rings as we lost—the prisoner had no business in the warehouse that day—he was there the day before, and we lost seven dozen—they are worth 4s. a packet,
(Hannah Barber of Garden-row, Brick-lane, and Thomas Corley, of Norman's-buildings, gave the prisoner a good character.)

            . I am the prosecutor's wife. I received five soverereigns and a half, two half-crowns, and five shillings, which I put into a small box, and placed on the kitchen mantel-piece, in the prisoner's presence; he wrote a receipt for it for me, and I left him in the kitchen, writing a letter for himself; I returned in about ten minutes - he was gone; the box was in its place, but the money gone from it; we could hear nothing of the prisoner.

            . I am a Policeman. On the 9th of August I was in New North-road; the prisoner came to me - he said he had committed a robbery, and wished to be taken into custody, for he had been at Bristol, and he could get nothing to do, and would rather be transported than remain in England - he said he was sorry for what he had done; that he had robbed Mr. Harding - he told me the amount, and when he had done it.

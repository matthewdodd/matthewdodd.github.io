            . I am collector of the Chelsea Water-works. On the 19th of March, about seven o'clock at night, I was in Oxford-street


, and saw five or six lads near Carter's shop. I suspected them to be pick-pockets, and felt to see if my pocket was secure - two of them fell back, the prisoner was one of them. I turned round to see if they were near me, and saw the prisoner coming out of the shop, tucking something under his jacket. I said
"You have been stealing something" - he said,
"Me, Sir;" I said
"Yes; what have you here," he threw the stays down - I secured him, part of his cuff gave way and I collared him.

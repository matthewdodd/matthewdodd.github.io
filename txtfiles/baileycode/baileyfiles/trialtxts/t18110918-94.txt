            . I am in the service of the prosecutor. He is a merchant
, 23, Compton-street


. On the 24th of August, about half after eight in the morning, I saw the prisoner come out of the parlour; I asked him what business he had there; he asked me if the captain was at home; I told him he did not want the captain; he then ran away; he was pursued; he threw the spoons away before he was taken. These are the spoons, they are my masters.
Prisoner's Defence. I was passing Mr. Lucas's house, and seeing the servant in the passage, I enquired if she knew captain Simmons; I found she did not, and when I was passing the street I heard the cry of stop thief, I was stopped and secured.

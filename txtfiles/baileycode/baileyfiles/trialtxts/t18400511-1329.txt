ARTHUR EDWARD SOMERSET
, Esq. I am a barrister—my chambers are in Pump-court, Temple—I left them on the 30th of April, about four o'clock, and left my note book there with a 10l. note in it, which I had received from Messrs. Hoare's, my bankers, two days before—I returned next morning about half-past twelve o'clock—the book was there, but the note gone—I sent to the Bank of England as soon as I got the number—I did not know the prisoner.

Cross-examined by
MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You have a laundress. A. Yes—she is no connexion of the prisoner's that I am aware of—I believe she employs a child who is the prisoner's daughter, and that child had access to my chambers—she is about thirteen or fourteen—I have not been in my chambers long—my landlord, Mr. Dickenson, employed the laundress—when I came the next day I found the door just as I had left it.

JURY. Q. Did you lock your chambers? A. No; the boy generally locks them—there were other people about.





ANN MASKELL
. I am a friend of Mr. Finch, who keeps a wine-vaults in Middle-row, Holborn—the prisoner came with a 10l. note for a bottle of white wine—I served him—I gave him the note and a pen and ink to write the name and address on it—this is the note—(looking at one)—I gave it to our young man to take it to the Bank and get changed.

Cross-examined. Q. It was the prisoner that wrote on it? A. Yes.





THOMS PHILLIPS
. I am a clerk in the Bank. This note was paid at the bank on the 1st of May.





JOHN CLUTTEBUCK
. I am a clerk in the house of Hoare and Co. I paid that note to Mr. Somerset himself.
(James White, a broker, in Clement's-lane, gave the prisoner a good character.)




GUILTY
. Aged 39.—


Transported for Seven Years.

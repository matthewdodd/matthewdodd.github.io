                  GOSDEN
               



            . I am an errand-boy. On the 29th of April, about six o'clock in the evening, I was coming through Brick-court, Temple


, and saw the prisoner with another person; I looked at them: they said, "What do you want?" I presently saw another person come out of No. 3, Brick-court: he went in again, and I heard one of them say, "It is all right, the door is open;" I then saw them come out from the hall staircase, and one in a hairy cap gave the cloak and umbrella to the prisoner. I told the officer, and the prisoner was taken in Devereux-court, with them - the others got away.

                  BURNS
               



            . I am a porter of the Temple. In consequence of what Gosden told me I pursued the prisoner and his companions - I took him with the property.
RICHARD ALEXANDER PRICE, ESQ.
 I am a special pleader
. I left this property safe in my chamber, in Brick-court, on the night before. On the morning of the robbery I was awoke about seven o'clock, and told of it.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I met two boys, who asked me where I was going - I said to the Strand; they said,
"Wait for us;" one of them went into a house, and brought out the cloak and umbrella; he told me to carry them for him a little way.

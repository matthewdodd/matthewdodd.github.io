ROBERT CLAYARDS
. I am a stable-keeper, and live in White Bear-yard, Lisle-street, Leicester-square—I know the prisoner. On Tuesday evening, the 24th of Sept., about half-past six o'clock, I went with some friends to the Crown, in Cranbourne-passage—I went in the front of the house into a little bar where they serve from—the prisoner was not there then—I saw him about half an hour after I went in—I was sitting down on the seat, and he commenced bullying me, stating something about a quarrel which I had with a friend of his on the previous Saturday—he said if I served him as I had his friend he would punch my head—I said, "In what way?"—he said, "By calling me the names you called him, or saying any words to insult me"—I laughed at him, and said, "What words would insult you?"—I called him some name, I cannot exactly say what it was, but it was something to try to irritate him, and he directly struck me—I got up, and struck him again—a scuffle ensued—I got him in the corner of the bar, and he put his finger and thumb into my mouth, and tried to gouge my eye out—he tore my mouth—it bled very much—I said, "If you don't take your fingers out of my mouth I will bite them"—he kept them still in, and I believe I did bite them—after this

scuffle we went into the parlour—I went in first, and the prisoner followed me—we took our seats in different parts of the parlour—we were sitting there an hour or an hour and a half after the scuffle—during that time the prisoner came over to me, and said why did I kick his hat—I said, "Don't let us annoy the company any more, don't let us bother, "and I moved to another part of the room, and he to the other part—no words ensued between us after that—about half an hour after, the prisoner quitted the room—before he left he said to a person sitting alongside of him, "You are not going to leave the room just yet, are you?"—he said "No"—he said, "Then you will give an eye to my coat"—he left his coat on the settle, and went out of the room—he returned in about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, went and sat down in the seat he had left, and drank out of a glass of gin and water which he had left—he then picked up a bit of cigar, and walked to the fire-place, which was within six feet of me—he had been sitting seventeen or eighteen feet from me—when he came up to the fire I said to him, "Myers, don't let us bear any animosity, let us shake hands"—I was sitting in a chair at the time—he said something—whether I said, "With all my heart," or whether he did, I do not know, but the words were used—he walked towards me—I extended my right hand—he held it with his left, and shook hands with me with his left hand—he put his right hand behind him, and scuffled with his coat—I could not see what he was doing—presently he drew a large knife out, saying, "You b—, I will have your b—heart," and stabbed me just above my left breast, right in the collar-bone—I felt myself struck with the point of the knife, and got up out of the chair—he made a second thrust at my left side, but I screwed myself round from him, put out my hand, and caught the knife in my hand—it was done so momentarily that I can hardly tell whether it was a violent blow—he then drew back—the persons in the room halloed out, "Do you know what you have done? why you have murdered the man"—he said nothing, but walked backwards towards the door, and stood at the door about a minute with the knife in his hand—all the people ran after him—there were twelve or fourteen—I saw no more of him till he was in custody—the knife was picked up in the passage—my hand bled very much—I walked to Mr. Morgan's, the surgeon, and saw Mr. M'Greal, who dressed the wounds—I was under him about a fortnight—I have the use of the hand now—I cannot get it up properly—I can use it very well, but not quite the same as before.

Cross-examined by
MR. CLARKSON. Q. You have known the prisoner for some years, have you not? A. I was never very much acquainted with him—I let horses and gigs—the prisoner has hired about two of me I think—I do not recollect any fighting men being at this house on the night in question—I should say not one was there that night—I have not been in the habit of associating with those sort of men—I am often in their company—the prisoner had been drinking, but was not drunk—I had not spoken to him before he came into the house—it was not a minute after he came in that he said if I called him such a name as I had called his friend he would punch my head—I did not commence it with him—I might have said to him, "No person wants to think what you are, for everybody knows that you are the biggest b—afloat"—I dare say I did say so—that was after his calling on me, exciting ing me to something, when he talked about his friend—I had not on the previous night poured some water and saw-dust on some mutton chops which he and his friend were having dressed—I poured some barley water on the fire, not on the chops—it was not saw-dust or water—I did not know they were his mutton chops—it was quite accidental, by laying hold of the saucepan which stood on the hob—I swear I did not do it on purpose—on the

evening in question I beat him at the bar till he admitted he could contend with me no longer—I struck him in the face—I did not give him a black eye—I struck him in the mouth, and fetched blood—he did not cry for quarter and say he could not fight with me—I may be twice as his as him—he went in to the parlour—I was not chaffing him—he kept talking to me in the parlour—I tried to make peace more than anything else—I did not see his new bat—I had kicked his hat in the bar—I did not know where it was then—I kicked his hat after he had kicked me in the groin—I stamped on it so spitefully, because I did not want to strike him—I do not know that I crushed it to pieces—I never saw it afterwards—I went into the parlour first, and he came in after—there were very ill names used after we went into the parlour, which made me say to him, "Come, let us have no more of this"—I do not know what words they were—I am in the habit of using vile terms—I dare say words did ensue between us—he said he would have me out of my yard, I should not stop in my yard long, he would do for me—I did not challenge him to fight, and have it out with me, nor did I offer to come and fetch him in a chaise next day, and take him five miles out of town that we might have it out then—I made use of no such words, or any such proposition—I was not drunk, or anything like drunk—I was sober—I cannot say quite sober, perhaps, because I am always perhaps, because I am always drinking—I do not know whether I am scarcely ever sober—I am sober now—I am frequently drunk, but not every day of my life, or anything near it—I did not go up to him, and pretend to hold out my hand to be friends with him—I was not near him—the crushing of the hat was in the bar in the first instance.

MR. CHARNOCK. Q. The first blow was given to you by the prisoner when you were in the bar? A. Yes—he struck me in the mouth first, and after he had kicked me in the groin I kicked his hat—upwards of half an hour elapsed after the bad words were used before he left the room—I had not spoken to him after he returned to the room—the first and only words I said to him were, "Let us have no animosity," and on that the blow was given.

COURT. Q. How long had he been sitting there after he returned before you shook hands with him, and he struck you? A. I should say not more than a minute—he directly sat down, and took his glass of gin and water, then took the cigar and walked up the room.





JOHN ACTON
. I am waiter, at the Crown, in Cranbourne-passage. On Tuesday evening, the 24th of Sept., about eight or nine o'clock I was in the parlour, and saw the prisoner with a large butcher's knife in his hand—to the best of my belief this now produced is it—he was standing in the middle of the room looking at everybody about the rooms, after he had struck Mr. Clayard he stood there about half a minute—I went behind him, and was in the act of laying hold of him, when my master who was on the other side of the room shook his head at me not to touch him—the prisoner turned round and walked out of the room—I followed him, and going along the passage he dropped the knife—he walked as far as the beer engine in the bar, and then commenced running—at the bottom of the passage I threw him down, and gave him into custody—we had no such knife as this in our house—it does not belong to our premises—I had seen the prisoner leave about twenty-five minutes to nine, which was about ten minutes before this occurred—I saw him return—I was standing at the top of the court talking to a lad who lives opposite, and saw him coming down the court shuffling something in his left coat pocket with his right hand—I was not present when the blows were given—I heard the screaming and noise.

Cross-examined. Q. Was Clayards drunk? A. No—he had been drinking—the

prisoner was not tipsy that I saw—he had been drinking, but I saw no tipsy action in him—he did not tumble down, or walk crooked, or anything of that sort—I am servant to Mr. Banks—he formerly kept a public-house in the Rookery, St. Giles's—it was after the blow was struck that I came into the room—the prisoner was then standing with his hand out, staring wildly round him—I did not notice whether he was in a violent frenzy or rage, I was so frightened seeing such a knife in his hand.

COURT. Q. Do you know the prisoner? A. Yes—I do not know what he is.





ROBERT CLAYARDS

re-examined. I do not krow what the prisoner is—I believe he keeps an open house in North-alley—I believe he did keep some wine rooms in Windmill-street, but he keeps a house of ill fame.





JOSEPH BANKS
. I keep the Crown, in Cranbourne-passage. On Tuesday evening the 24th, about seven o'clock I was in the bar parlour when Clayards came in—my attention was called by my daughter saying there was a fight with Clayards and Myers in front of the bar—I did not see who gave the first blow—Clayards afterwards went into the parlour, and Myers followed him some time after—I was in and out of the parlour several times—when I first saw them I think they were not far from each other, but Clayards left and went to the other end of the room, which was seventeen or eighteen feet from where Myers was sitting—that was at a subsequent part of the evening—I recollect Myers saying to a person, "Give an eye to my coat," and he went out of the house—on his return I was in the parlour—I should say it was half-past eight when he went out—it was an hour or better after the commencement—on his return he said, "I suppose there has been a good deal said about Abey Myers"—he resumed his seat which was about seventeen feet from where Clayards was sitting—he drank and sat down—in a minute or so he went to the fire to light his cigar, and Clayards wished to make friends—I believe he said, "Let us be friendly again," or something of that sort—Clayards was at that time sitting in a chair—he held out his hand-Myers went to him to shake hands—I was sitting by the side—he put his hand behind him, and I really do not recollect seeing what he pulled from it, but in the course of a second or so Clayards was stabbed—he put hit right hand behind him, and that is all I recollect till Clayards rose and said, "I am stabbed"—I saw the knife in Myers's hand after he drew back—I hear that he struck at him twice, but it was so quick I did not see how the blow was averted at the second strike, I was so close to him—I saw him put his hand out, but I was so alarmed—I saw Clayards hand and thumb bleeding, and he was sent to the doctor's—when Myers put his hand behind him I was so frightened that I cannot say what was said—he drew himself backwards to the door, and stood—my boy came in, hearing the noise—he says I shook my head for him not to touch Myers, but I do not recollect it—I got on a seat—Myers turned round, and opened the door, and we then all ran after him—when we got to the end of the court the boy had overtaken him—I had been in the parlour about half an hour before Myers went away—during that half hour I do not think there were any words of irritation on the part of Clayards towards Myers—I think Myers was fresh in liquor, and everybody more avoided him than to enter into any debate particularly.

Cross-examined. Q. Was he fresh in liquor before he went out? A. When he came in first I should say he was fresh in liquor, when the row commenced—he only had fourpenny worth of gin and water in my house in the space of two hours, and he left nearly all that when he left the house—he did not get more drunk in my house—I should say he was more than three parts drunk when he came—I should say Clayards was sober, for he avoided having anything to do with Myers all the way through, seeing him so excited—I

saw him stamp the hat to pieces in the bar—I did not see him strike him, because they were in the scuffle—he was not knocked down at all—he was struck in the mouth, I believe—I did not see the whole of it—I was called out in the scuffle—I saw Myers kick Clayards, and I said to him, "If my leg was well, I would knock you down for kicking so unmanly" (I had the gout at the time), and then Clayards broke the hat—I do not recollect the circumstance of the mutton-chops—I was not in the room at the time—I have kept this house eleven months—I lived at the Rookery, in St. Giles's, ten years—I do not mind going into rows—I can take my own part—I am "the Mr. Banks that went to the theatre."

MR. CHARNOCK. Q. Was it after Myers had kicked Clayards in the unmanly way you describe, that he kicked Myers's hat? A. Yes.





LOUIS BOUROGEAUX
. I am a tailor, and live in Broad-street, Bloomsbury, I was at the Crown on the 24th of Sept.—I saw nothing of the scuffle at the bar—I found all the parties in the parlour—when I went in Banks shook hands with me, and Myers came to me, shook hands with me, and asked me how I was—I found all sitting except Myers, who was standing by the fire—I sat down, and he came and sat by my side—I saw he had a swollen lip, and said to him, "Halloo, what is the matter with you, have you been fighting?"—he said, "Yes, I have been having a row, and they are all against me here, landlord and all"—Banks said to him, "You had better leave the landlord alone, for he does not want to have anything to do with you"—nothing was said or done by Clayards—I did not know him—I was in the parlour from a quarter of an hour to twenty minutes before Myers left—during that time nothing was done by Clayards to irritate or aggravate him, not in the least—they were sitting apart, and separate from each other, quite at opposite ends of the room—before Myers went out, he said to me, "Are you going just yet?"—I said, "No"—he said, "Then will you please to give an eye to my coat?"—I said, "Certainly"—on his coming back he resumed the same scat—he got up again instantly, and was going to light his cigar—during the time he was reaching a paper off the mantel-piece to get a light, Clayards said to him, "There should be no animosity between us, come, come, let us shake hands and be friends "—he held out his right hand, Myers gave his left, and when Clayards said, "Here is my hand, and heart with it, "Myers said, "And here is my hand"—he kept his hand behind his back, and made a plunge at him, and as he was making the plunge, he said, "I will have your b—heart"—I saw this knife in his hand—he made the plunge towards Clayards—I do not know whether it went into his abdomen or his breast—I did not see any second thrust or attempt—he drew himself back—as he was going away, a man cried out, "Good God, you have stabbed the man! "—he looked at him, and said, "That is the way to serve such a b—as him."

Cross-examined. Q. You were not before the Magistrate? A. No—I carry on my business at No. 41, Broad-street, Bloomsbury—I have private apartments there—I was subpoenaed last Saturday—that was the first time I was called on about it.

MR. CHARNOCK. Q. I believe you are not the friend of Clayards? A. I never knew him before—I am no acquaintance of Myers—I have met him.





THOMAS MC GREAL
. I am assistant to Mr. Morgan, a surgeon, in St. Martin's-lane. On the night in question the prosecutor came to our house—I found two wounds on him, one on the left side of his chest, and the other on his right thumb—the wound on the chest was about an inch and a half long—a superficial wound—it was just over the second rib, extending obliquely over it—I dressed it—the other was also a simple wound, inflicted with some sharp instrument—I think this knife might inflict such a wound—he

was under my care about ten days or a fortnight—the wound on the chest was not, as it was, a dangerous wound, it merely divided the skin—it did not go to the bone.

Cross-examined. Q. And the other was quite a superficial wound? A. It was a little deeper, but a simple wound, nothing to place him in any jeopardy.





JAMES AMOS FISHER
 (policeman). I have produced the knife—the prisoner was taken into custody by another constable.

I saw the prisoner and another lad following several gentlemen, I followed them for a quarter of an hour, and in Argyle-street, Mr. Willan passed with two females, they both went up to him - I saw the prisoner come away with a handkerchief, wiping his eye with it. I seized him, took it from him, and shewed it to Mr. Willan.

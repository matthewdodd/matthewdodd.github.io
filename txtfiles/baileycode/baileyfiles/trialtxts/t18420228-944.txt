WILLIAM TOOKE
. I have chambers at No. 39, Bedford-row—my servant sleeps there—it is in the parish of St. Andrew, Holborn. About half-past twelve o'clock, on the 4th of February, I left my room, and left my watch, chain, and seals, on the mantel-piece—I returned in about twelve minutes, and they were gone—these produced are mine.





WILLIAM HAMMOND
. I was at No. 39, Bedford-row, at half-past twelve o'clock that day—the prisoner called, and asked for Mr. Tooke—I directed him into Mr. Took's room, where he had the opportunity of seeing his watch, if it were there.





BENJAMIN AVILA
. I am a pawnbroker. I produce the watch, which was pledged by the prisoner on the 5th of February.





GEORGE STEVENS
. I produce a seal—the prisoner pawned it, on the 4th of February.

Prisoner's Defence. A person named Crawden gave them me to pawn.





BARNABAS FLACK
 (police-constable C 28.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(real)—the prisoner is the man who was then convicted.




GUILTY
. Aged 46.—


Transported for Ten Years.

Elizabeth Simmons; having been before convicted.






ELIZABETH SIMMONS
 I am the wife of Richard Simmons. On the 14th April, about five in the afternoon, I was in the Waterloo-road with Ann Simmons—I heard a halfpenny fall—I turned round to look, and felt a man pull his hand out of my pocket—I missed my purse containing two sovereigns—to the best of my belief it was the prisoner.





ANN SIMMONS
 I was with my cousin, and saw the prisoner at her pocket—he ran down Grove-lane—a halfpenny fell, I picked it up.

Prisoner Q. Did you see my hand in her pocket? A. No, but I saw you at her side, and nobody else was there, and I bad noticed you before, it happened standing at the corner of St. Andrew's-terrace—I am sure of you, I picked you out from others—I only saw your side face.





JOHN SMITH
 I saw the prisoner run down a lane—I knew him before—it was about five o'clock.





WILLIAM ROMAINE
 (policeman, L 38). I took the prisoner.

Prisoner Q. Were not you talking to the waiter at a public-house the evening before you took me? A. Yes; if I had seen you then I should have taken you.





JAMES BURTON
 (policeman, M 272). I produce a certificate of the prisoner's conviction—(read—Convicted April, 1845, confined six months. and whipped)—he is the person.




GUILTY

Transported for Seven Years

Before Edward Bullock, Esq.

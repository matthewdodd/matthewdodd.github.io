            . I am a carpenter
, and live in Bermondsey-street on the other side of the water. My saw was taken away when I was not at home, last Wednesday was seven-night.

            . Last Wednesday seven-night I saw the prisoner going along Fifth-street; he went by the Old-Change, and into a building, and come out again, and bring a saw out from the prosecutor's work. I ran and catched hold of him before he got into St. Paul's church-yard. He said, Pray, sir, forgive me, for I never did such a thing before: he had the saw under his coat. (Produced and deposed to.)

He never saw me take the saw at all.




               Guilty 10 d.

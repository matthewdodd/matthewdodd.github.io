                  , from his person
            .
ROBERT ROGERS. On the 20th of March I was near the corner of Chancery-lane


, about twelve o'clock; I felt something go from my pocket - I turned, and the prisoner and two others were going off - I ran and seized the prisoner in the road, and said he had got my handkerchief; he said he had not - and called God to witness that he had not; but I opened his clothes, and found it between his waistcoast and shirt - he then begged my pardon.

            . I am an officer. I took the prisoner, and have the handkerchief.
Prisoner's Defence. The gentleman gave me in charge, and I asked him if he would get me into the Refuge, as I have no father, and my mother only takes in washing.

MR. ROGERS. He did so, and I promised to try if I could; but I have since heard his character.

            . I live in Hare-street, Piccadilly


, and am a victualler
; the prisoner lodged in my house; he came about six or seven weeks ago, he was a stranger to me; he said he was a printer, and lately came from Ireland, and his father kept a public-house there; he said he lodged last at Mr. Fraizer's, in Rupert-street; I said, if you'll go there I will enquire your character; we went there; Mr. Fraizer told me he had been thereabout 5 or 6 weeks, and that the prisoner had an uncle in Pall-mall had passed his word for his lodging, but finding him extravagant he stopped his hand; I asked the prisoner what he intended to do, in case he came to lodge with me, for the room was half a crown a week; he said, he had 80 l. a year in Ireland, and he was going to draw upon his father, and he would soon go to his father; I said, if you chuse to go to work, I will recommend you to a printer; I spoke to Mr. Towers, a printer; he came, but the prisoner said he could live without it, he would not work at all; he paid my wife half a crown before-hand: I was after that taken ill; he asked my wife leave to come up stairs to ask me how I did, on Monday the 28th of April; my watch was hanging under a looking-glass by my bed-side; I missed my watch on the Thursday following; then I had wrote a letter, and wanted to seal it; I was going up for my watch to seal it with my seal; the prisoner said, you need not fetch your seal, I can seal it; he took and sealed it with his finger; I said it was done in a slovenly manner; I went up for my watch and it was gone; I enquired, and found neither my wife nor my servant knew of it; then I said, there is a thief in the house; my wife gave me a tap on the shoulder, I went with her into another room; she told me he had run up a score of 7 s. and that he had been seen to change a guinea in Piccadilly; then I took the prisoner into the parlour, and insisted upon his telling me where he got that guinea he had changed at the Robin Hood in Piccadilly; he said, he would tell me directly, and desired me to go with him to Westminster, and he would shew me the person that gave it him; I went with him; he shewed me a house, but no person could we find; we came home, and he went to bed; I called him up early next morning, and desired him to go again and clear up this guinea; he took an opportunity and popped out of the house, that gave me a stronger suspicion; I ran out, and met with him at the bottom of the Hay-market; I said, you are certainly the man that robbed me of my watch, I insist on your going with me to Sir

            's; when we came to Covent-garden, he confessed he had robbed me of my watch on the Monday, when he came to see me in bed, and he had pawned it for a guinea and a half, in Holywell-street, near Temple-bar, to one Graygoose; I went with him there, and told the pawnbroker I came for a silver watch that that young man pledged last Monday; the pawnbroker produced it; it was pawned in the name of Conway; then I took the prisoner before Sir

            , and he sent for Mr. Fraizer, but he would not deposit any thing for him; then I went to his uncle in Pall-mall, and he would not do any thing for him.

            . I am servant to Mr. Graygoose, a pawnbroker: I took in this watch of the prisoner, (produced and deposed to) he told me he lived in St. James's-market; I lent him a guinea and a half upon it.
Prisoner's defence.
The prosecutor used to send for me to give him barley-water; this watch was lying on the floor, I took it, and no one asked me for it: I was short of money, and I went and pawned it for a guinea and a half; when he said he had lost his watch I owned to it, and said I had pawned it; then he brought me to the pawnbroker's, and got it again; then he took me before the Justice.
To his character.

Q. Where did you know him first?
Fagan. In Ireland; his father is a taylor: he came over six months ago.

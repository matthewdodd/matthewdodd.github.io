WILLIAM JOHNSON
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the

JOHN DOWMAN
. I live in Windsor-street, Uxbridge, and am a slopseller. I bad a pair of shoes in my window on the 23rd of April—I saw them safe about twelve o'clock, and missed them when the policeman brought them about eight—these are them.





RICHARD ROADNIGHT
 (police-sergeant T 11.) I saw the prisoner at the shop about eight o'clock that night—he walked away—I followed him—he put something on the ground—I took him and brought him back to the spot, and found these shoes there—I took them and him to the shop.





SAMUEL PERKINS
. I am an inspector of police. I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction at Aylesbury—(read)—the prisoner is the man.




GUILTY
. Aged 24.—


Transported for Seven Years.

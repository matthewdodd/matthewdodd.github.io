            . I am a victualler
, in George-street, Bethnal green



. On the 16th of November I made all fast before I went to bed. I was called up on the 17th a little before 7, and told my cellar window was broke open; I came down and found the bolt and staple were wrenched off; I found the tap-room door between that and the cellar broke open also; I found the tea chest removed from the dresser to the counter, where I serve my liquor, open, and the 5 spoons, strainer and tongs were taken out. My daughter looked round and missed several pair of stockings; I missed halfpence and farthings to the amount, I believe, of 3 or 4 l. but I can safely say there were 50 s. worth missing. I found two burners in the cellar which they had taken from some lamps. I advertised the things on the 18th, and the same evening Mr. Clark came to my house, and asked me what I had lost; I told him, and that the spoons were marked C, R, W. Said he I have got four of the spoons, and had not an opportunity of reading the paper in the morning as usual, so had not stopped the person that brought them, but should know the person if he saw her, and that he had been after her but could not find her, she not living at the place she had told him: he took her on the 20th, and brought her to me; it was the prisoner English. I asked her several questions; she answered me but few: I said tell me how I may come at these persons that have used me in this manner. At last she said he will come about noon to her house. Mr. Clark, Mr. Chapman the headborough, and I, waited the opportunity, and the prisoner, Pritchard, came much about that time; but I having English in my care, I was not at the taking him: he and Hughes were both brought together to me at the Black Horse in George-street, near my house. I asked them several questions; Pritchard told me he was in my house. I desired him to tell me where my tongs and strainer were; he said he could not tell, but 
               
                  Mary 
                  English 
               



             could: I said to her, why do not you let me know where my things are: said she, I do not know; Pritchard said to her, you do know, and with some persuasions she confessed she had carried and sold them to Mr. Barlow, in Whitechapel, where I found them. Hughes acknowledged he was in my house with Pritchard, but did not know where the things were sold; before the Justice, he asked them if they were in the house, Pritchard said yes. There Hughes said the same. They were examined how they got in; they said they got in at the cellar window, and afterwards broke the door, and got up into the tap-room.
Q. Was any thing said how they forced the staple?

White. I cannot say there was. The Justice examined 
               
                  Mary 
                  English 
               



            , to know whether she was in with them; she said she was not, and said when she took them, she did not know that they were dishonestly come by; she said, Pritchard brought them to her under an excuse, that they belonged to a mate of a ship, who wanted to make a little money, and he desired her to take and pledge them. The pewter tea pot and two pair of stockings were found at Pritchard's mother's lodgings, (where he also lodges) by my daughter. Pritchard owned before the justice, he had 25 shillings worth of my halfpence (the two tin burners produced in court.)

            . I am a pawnbroker, and live in George-yard, Whitechapel. On the 18th of November, in the forenoon, 
               
                  Mary 
                  English 
               



             came and pledged four silver tea spoons with me, and said they were her own property, to pay her rent and taxes, and that she lived at the corner of Fashion-street. A little after I read the Advertiser, and I found by the description, they were stolen. I went in search of her, and found she had given me a wrong account. I went the same night to the prosecutor. We found the place of her residence. Next morning I went up into her room and took her; she denied knowing any thing of the robbery; she said Pritchard gave them her, and said they were honestly come by; that she said, why here is C for Charles, and W for White upon them. I asked her if she knew Mrs. White's christian name, she said Rachel; I said, then you must know that they are Mrs. White's spoons; she said the could not read. I asked her how she came to know the C and W; she said she knew them two letters; then I took her to Mr. White, then she described Pritchard, and said that he was to come to her house about 12; we thought proper to watch till he came. He sent for an officer to assist; he staid with 
               
                  Mary 
                  English 
               



            , the officer and I went two different ways to her house, and he brought the two men at the bar to me, and we carried them to Mr. White. Pritchard declared he gave 
               
                  Mary 
                  English 
               



             the spoons, and challenged her with knowing where she had made away with the tongs and strainer; she denied it, but before she went out of the house confessed it. We went before the Justice. Pritchard there confessed he had been in the house; and after that, Hughes owned he was there. 
               
                  Mary 
                  English 
               



             confessed at the same time, that she had sold the tongs and strainer to Mr. Barlow.

            . I am a goldsmith, and live in Aldgate High-street. I bought these tongs and strainer (producing them) of the prisoner, English, for 9 s. 6 d. on the 18th of October; she said they were her own, and that she had given 10 s. for the tongs ( deposed to by prosecutor.)
Pritchard's defence.
I was going along to my lodgings about 4 in the morning, and Hughes was going to Woolwich, to see if he could get a ship. We saw two men spring out of this house, and heard things fall; we picked them up, and put them into our pockets.
Hughes's defence the same.
English's defence.
Pritchard came up stairs, and asked me if I could pawn these things; he said they were very honestly come by from on board a ship; that they belonged to a mate that wanted money.

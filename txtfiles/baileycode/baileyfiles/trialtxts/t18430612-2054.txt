CHRISTOPHER VITTY
. I am a retailer of beer, and live in Lower-marsh, St. Mary, Lambeth. On Sunday night, the 14th of May, I went to bed at a quarter to twelve o'clock—I could not unlock my bedroom door without force—I

put a bit of wood in the handle, pressed the lock back, and opened the door—when I got in the first long drawer was open, and my box of money gone from it—I had seen it safe, and counted the money at a quarter to eight, ready to pay the brewer on Monday—there was 15l. in silver, a 5l. note, four sovereigns, and four half-sovereigns—the box and all was gone—I informed the police at the station-house, Tower-street—I know all the prisoners by sight—I had seen them at my house on two different occasions—Hatton, Hill and Williams were in company together, and Thompson sat behind the door on the night before the robbery, and they were all four in company together there on the Saturday week before—on the evening before the robbery the four prisoners and two more were there—there were three of them in company, and Knight, who is indicted as Thompson, was behind the door by himself—on the Sunday night several persons had come to my bar to get beer, but nobody passed my bar that evening but the prisoners—before that there was nobody but my wife, myself, and children—I had opened the house at eight that night, being Sunday—I was in the bar the whole evening, except when I served the prisoners up stairs—if anybody had gone up besides the four prisoners I must have seen them—they must go through the bar—there are two public rooms up stairs—about nine o'clock Hatton and Williams came together and said, "Have you anybody up stairs?"—I said, "No, it is a wet evening, but you can go up as you were here last night"—they said, "We expect a gentleman here directly, will you send him up stairs?"—said, "Yes"—they went up, and called for a pint of ale—in about five minutes Hill came in, and asked if anybody was up stairs—I said, "Yes, two gentlemen have gone up"—he went up, and called for a glass of ale—when I took it I heard him talking with the others, but did not attend to the conversation—a few minutes after Knight came in—he stood at the bar, and called for a glass of ale—I said it was a wet evening, would he walk up stairs—he kept me in conversation about half an hour—he then went up stairs, as I asked him to go—I followed him up with a glass of ale in his hand—when he entered the room, he said to the others, "Good evening, gentlemen, it is a wet evening"—I did not stop there half a minute—he gave me the glass of ale to fill again—I took it up stairs, and he was then talking to the other three prisoners—they were all talking together—they remained there an hour and a half from their first coming—Hill came down first alone—in about a minute afterwards Williams, then Hatton, and at last Knight—about a minute and a half elapsed between each of them coming down—I opened the door for Williams—I am quite positive no other person but the four prisoners passed up stairs that evening—every body who goes up must pass me at the bar—the lid was off the box which contained the money, and it remains in the drawer now—the drawer was locked, but there was no lock to the box—the bedroom is one floor higher than the room they sat in—when I left the bedrcom at eight o'clock I left my wife there putting the children to bed—she came down at half-past eight—the children were in the room all the while, one five years old in bed, and one six months old in a cradle—I saw my wife come down at half-past eight after seeing them asleep, and she gave me the key of the room—I unlocked the door with it myself at a quarter to twelve, by putting the wood in the handle of the key—my wife had gone up two or three times to listen if the children were asleep, but did not have the key—if they had cried she would have heard them, and asked me for the key.

Cross-examined by
MR. PAYNE. Q. I believe you had not seen Hatton, except on the two occasions? A. No—they had been on two or three other occasions, but I did not much notice them before the Saturday—I took up one Harrison—he was let out on bail for a week—there was not sufficient

evidence to prove he was there on the Saturday before—he was not there on Sunday—he proved he was dining somewhere—Mr. Goodyear was not taken up—he walked to the station with the policeman, but he was not detained.

Q. How came he to go there? A. The policeman took Harrison and Hatton—I said, "Where is the tall person?" as I did not know where Hatton was—Goodyear bounced out of the room, and said, "Do you mean me?"—I said, "Yes, that is one"—he was about Hatton's size, and I took him for Hatton in the dark—when he got to the station I said he was not the man—he was not charged—it was his own fault going—Hatton had gone on before, but I did not know it—it was half-past eleven at night.

Cross-examined by
MR. WILKINS. Q. When did you first notice the men at your house to identify them? A. On the Saturday night before the robbery—three of them were then sitting together—Knight was behind the door on the night before the robbery—the bed-room is on the second floor—there is a small yard to the house which joins a timber-yard, which has a very high will—none of the men at that yard use my house, but I do not know as I never give credit—the eldest child goes to bed at eight o'clock, and we do not hear anything of it till twelve—I do not know what Knight and I talked about—he spoke to me first, and said it was a bad evening—I was busy at the bar, serving out-door customers who brought their jugs—my wife was with me, taking the money while I drew the beer.

Cross-examined by
MR. HORRY. Q. You have had an action brought against you by Goodyear? A. No; by Harrison, for false imprisonment—he was in my house on Saturday evening, not on Sunday—I gave him into custody on suspicion of being concerned—I am quite certain he was not there on Sunday, and that I did not lose my money on Saturday—I am quite certain I never said Hatton came down stairs first—the box was about four inches wide and six inches long—I am quite certain only four persons passed up that night—nobody went even to the yard—I was very slack of customers.

Cross-examined by
MR. WILDE. Q. Do you carry on business wholly on your own account? A. Yes; nobody has any interest in it—I will swear the prisoners were all there on the Saturday from nine o'clock to twelve—I was very busy then—the room was full—it was after Knight came in, and was talking to us on Sunday, that my wife was receiving money for the jug trade—I saw them all up stairs in the room on Saturday week night, when I gave change for a 10l. note; and on Saturday, the 13th, Hill said to me, "Keep the door open for air"—I do not know that I ever gave credit to the prisoners, but I have seen them on two or three occasions—they, and nobody else, passed my bar on the night of the robbery.

MR. E. PLATT. Q. Harrison was one of the six in the room? A. Yet, on the Saturday—it was on Saturday night that Thompson was behind the door—I did not see him mixing with the others that night—he was there about an hour and a half, conversing with Bacon.





FREDERICK BACON
. I am a chocolate maker, and live in Isabella-street, Lambeth. I was at the prosecutor's house on Saturday night, the 13th of May, from a few minutes before ten o'clock till a few minutes to eleven—I had some ale up stairs—I saw all the prisoners up stairs—Williams and Hill were talking together—Thompson was sitting behind the door, and Hatton at the corner, nearest the window—you could not see a person behind the door as you came in, when the door was open—I was talking with Thompson and Williams—I left a few minutes to eleven—Thompson went first, and I followed him, leaving the others in the room with four or five more—I have known Thompson between ten and eleven years, and am certain of him.

Cross-examined by
MR. PATHS. Q. Had you seen Hatton before? A. Not to my knowledge.


Cross-examined by
MR. HORRY. Q. It was the first time you had seen Williams? A. Yes, or Hill.





JOHN MARKS
. I am warehouseman to Mr. Green, of Princes-street, Lambeth—I know Knight—on Saturday night, the 13th, I saw him standing at Vitty's bar, about half-past nine o'clock, and on Wednesday, the 24th, at two o'clock, I saw him pass in Princes-street, where I am employed; he, Williams and Hill passed together—they crossed over towards our gate—I am quite confident of them.

Cross-examined by
MR. WILKINS. Q. Did you know them before? A. Only Thompson—I was going to work on Wednesday, or I should have followed them.





JOHN COYTE
. I am a shoemaker, and live in Brad-street, Cornwall-road, Lambeth—I was at Vitty's house on Sunday, the 14th, from a quarter to ten o'clock till a quarter to eleven—I stood in front of the bar, and saw four men come from behind the bar, it was about the middle of the time I was there, a little after half-past ten—they followed each other quickly; about hall a minute elapsed between each—I am perfectly satisfied Hatton and Hill are two of the men—while there, I did not see anybody besides those four go in or come out—I must have seen if they had.

Cross-examined by
MR. PAYNE. Q. What was you about? A. Standing there, drinking ale the whole hour, and talking—I do not think I sat down at all.

Cross-examined by
MR. WILDE. Q. Had you been drinking before you went there? A. No; I never saw either of the prisoners before—I stood directly facing the wicket which they came through, at the end of the bar—it is not a large room—it was light enough to read small print where I stood.





JOSEPH ALSTON
. I am a chairmaker, and live in James-street. I was at Vitty's house on Sunday evening, the 14th, from half-past eight o'clock till about a quarter to ten, and saw Knight standing at the bar, smoking a cigar—I am certain of him.





JAMES BURGESS
. I am barman at the Black Horse, Tottenham-court-road—I have seen Hill and Hatton together in company at our house—the last time may be three or four months ago—I am certain of it.





JOHN CARPENTER
 (police-constable R 84.) I know Hill, Williams, and Thompson—I have seen them together at various public houses, on several occasions, talking together—I knew Thompson as Joe knight, and Williams as Bob Stone.

Cross-examined by
MR. HOBBY. Q. Who called Williams, Stone in your hearing? A. Thompson did, and I knew him by that name.





HENRY LUPTON
 (police-constable L 7.) On the 27th of May I apprehended Hill, Williams, and Thompson, in company with each other—I first saw them in Blackfriars-road—they turned into Wellington-street—I took hold of Williams, and said, "I want you"—he said "What for?"—I said, "On suspicion of robbing Mr. Vitty's beer-shop in the New Cut"—he said, "You know I do not do any thing in that way"—I searched him at the station, and found 9s. 8d., two common keys, and a knife on him—I found at his lodging a skeleton key and picklock key, between his bed and mattress—I also found about thirty duplicates.

Cross-examined by
MR. HORRY. Q. Where are his lodgings? A. In John-street, Holland-street—he did not give me that address.





WILLIAM GUEST
 (police-constable L 62.) I apprehended Thompson on the 27th of May—I was with Lupton—on the way to the station I observed him put his hand into his pocket several times—he was very uneasy, and in a minute or two I saw him take from his pocket a small parcel tied up in a rag, and drop it down by his side—I took it up, and found it contained this portable

crow-bar, which is in two parts—it screws together—I have compared the end of the crow-bar with four marks on the drawers in Mr. Vitty's bedroom—they exactly corresponded with it, and fitted exactly I am quite certain.

Cross-examined by
MR. WILKINS. Q. Was Brook with you at the time? Yes—there was no difference of opinion between us as to the impressions.





JAMES BROOK
 (police-constable L 118.) I took Hatton at the John o'Groat, Grey-street, Webber-street, Blackfriars, on Monday, the 15th of May—I found on him four sovereigns and 11s. 6d.—Vitty charged him with robbing him in my presence—he said he knew nothing of it—I assisted in taking the other prisoners—I found two picklock keys on Thompsons, besides what Lupton has produced, and four other keys—I fitted one of the keys to Vitty's drawer—it opened it.

Cross-examined by
MR. PAYNE. Q. Was not Hatton allowed by the Magistrate to go away on his own recognizance? A. Yes, for a week, I think—he appeared, and was bailed again—I think he attended six times before he was committed.

Cross-examined by
MR. WILKINS. Q. Have you been to Thompson's lodgings? A. No, he refused to give his address—I saw the crow-bar fitted to the drawers—my impression was always that it was done with that instrument—I never expressed a doubt of it—I have been in the police above thirteen years—I never said the marks on the drawer were very slight, and not made by this—(looking at his deposition)—I did not state before the Magistrate about the crow-bar fitting the drawer—this statement was read over to me, and I signed it as correct.

Cross-examined by
MR. HORRY. Q. Were not two boys brought to the station when Thompson and Hill were there? A. Yes—I did not ask them if they were the men who were at the prosecutor's, nor hear them asked—the boys walked on in company with Guest—I did not hear anything said to them.

Witnesses for the Defence.






ELIZA GOODWIN
. I am servant to Mr. Benton, who keeps, the John o'Groat, Grey-street, Blackfriars-road. Last Sunday evening five weeks, (14th May) I saw Hatton at the house—he came to the best of my recollection about half-past six o'clock—I remember seeing him from that time up to just before ten.

MR. BALLANTINE. Q. Are you the only servant? A. Except the man servant—I wait in the tap-room, and on Sundays in the parlour—the man was out—I had seen Hatton before—not very often—I never aaw any of the other prisoners—I was summoned to Union Hall about this, about three weeks ago, but was not wanted—I did not know what I was wanted about till I was told at Union Hall—Hatton came when he was out on bail, and asked if I remembered his being there on the Sunday of the robbery—I was called down to him at the bar—I knew nothing of the robbery till I saw him taken out of our parlour—I knew the Sunday the robbery was done, from the people in the tap-room—mistress said it was for the robbery that was done, and he was taken up for it, and I could say I saw him that night—no one told me what night it was—he came to ask me this, a week after the Sunday—I believe he was taken the next night, and came to me the Saturday following—mistress was present when he asked me—I said I recollected it—he said, "That is all I want"—he did not say a word about the time—he asked if I recollected seeing him on the Sunday—he did not say at what time—I first learned the time at Union Hall—I never heard the time was between eight and ten o'clock—I did not know what time I was to come to speak to—I have said before now that I saw him from half-past six till a little before ten o'clock—Hatton did not tell me the times I was to speak to, nor did anybody

—I never heard the time at which I was to account for his presence till to-day—I will swear that—I noticed him from half-past six till ten—I was not in the room all the time, but every time the bell rung—I do not know how many times I was in and out—there were a good many people there—I should say more than twenty persons went into the room between half-past six and ten o'clock—they were drinking and smoking—I observed Hatton on every occasino that I went in—I never spoke to him—he called forporter when he first went in—not directly, it might have been a quarter of an hour after—I took it him in, and he paid for it—he did not pay for anything else that evening—I noticed the regular customers in the room besides him—I know some of their names—those that use the house regularly—I do not know whether they knew Hatton—I believe one or two of them are here—there was one young man there named King—I am not aware that he is a friend of Hatton's—he was in the tap-room before six o'clock—I do not know what time he left, because I was not in the room after just before ten o'clock—I saw him in the room then—a young man named Reeves was also there—I cannot tell at what time he came—I saw him till I left off waiting in the tap-room, which was just before ten—I do not know where the prosecutor's house is.

MR. PAYNE. Q. Could he have been away from your house two hours without your knowing it? A. No—I knew before I came here at what time I saw him, and came to tell, if I was asked, what time he came and went away.





HENRY REEVES
. I am a carpenter, and live at No. 35, Broadwall, near Blackfriars-road. On Sunday, the 14th of May, I was at the John o'Groat public-house from a few minutes before half-past six o'clock till half-past eleven—I know Hatton—I saw him there that night—he sat right facing me in the same box—I am no friend or acquaintance of his—I knew him by sight—he came in a very few minutes after me, and went away about half-past ten—he could not have been absent during that time for five minutes without my knowing it.

MR. BALLANTINE. Q. When did you know you were to give evidence? A. I was subpœnaed—the lawyer, or solicitor, came to me last Wednesday—that was not the first I knew about it—I was there at the time the prisoner was taken—I was at Union Hall—I did not know I had to give evidence on the trial till I was subpœnaed—I have seen Hatton twenty times and Conversed with him—I do not know any of the other prisoners—I never saw any of them in company with Hatton—I have been in the habit of seeing Hatton at the John o'Groat—not mostly on a Sunday, any day of the week, the same as most working people—I have seen him two or three times on a Sunday—I have seen him twice since, while he has been out on his own bail, the week after I attended at Union Hall—he came to the John o'Groat—my work sometimes lays there—I was there accidentally, I did not expect to see him—I had very little conversation with him then—nothing at all about this matter—I knew at that time that he had been charged with committing this offence at this particular time—it did not occur to me to tell him that I could quite clear him of it—I never told him so—he never told me any thing about it—his wife spoke to me the morning after he was taken—I did not talk to him about it when I saw him afterwards, and he never said a word to me about it—I know Goodwin—I never talked to her about it—that I swear—she was in and out the room all that evening, as the general waiter was out—she probably served the prisoner with something once or twice, or perhaps more—once I will swear to—I will not swear to twice—it was once or twice—once, that was before nine o'clock—he left my box at nine, and sat in the next box till half-past ten—a gentleman there asked him to drink, and I asked him to drink—he was reading the newspaper—it might have been for

half an hour—that was perhaps about eight o'clock—he had a pint of porter to drink about eight—I saw him drink out of a quart pot, a person sitting in the next box handed it over—I am not a friend of Hatton's—I have never been in any trouble—I was once charged with drunkenness and for an assault, five years ago—I will swear I have not been charged with any offence within these six weeks—nor ever under examination for anything—that I swear.

. I am in the employ of Mr. Rutland, the Sheriff's officer, of Great Charlotte-street, Blackfriars-road, and live at No. 53, Wootton-street. I know Hatton by sight—I am no friend or acquaintance of his—on Sunday, the 14th of May, I went to the John o'Groat about half-past five or six o'clock, and staid there till nearly twelve—Hatton came in between six and seven, and went away between ten and eleven—he could not have been away for an hour or two without my knowing it.

MR. BALLANTINE. Q. You saw him all the time? A. Not all the time, because I went out once myself for about two minutes, with that exception I saw him all the time—I do not know who he was drinking with—he was sitting in company—he sat in the same box as Reeve—I was sitting on the opposite side of the room—I saw him served with beer—I cannot say whether it was once or twice—the servant came in and served him in the course of the evening—she was in and out of the room occasionally during the evening, as often as the bell rang—I do not remember her coming in except when the bell rang—I was served with a subpoena last Tuesday week—I think by Mrs. Hatton—I did not know her before they came and asked me the question—I only knew her by seeing her at the public-house with Mr. Hatton—she was called Mrs. Hatton—she was the first person that mentioned that I should be wanted—I saw Hatton on the Monday after the robbery, as he was going down on his bail, in Windmill-street, New-cut—Reeves' brother was with me—he is now working for Mr. Seal, I believe—I have known him for some time—I know the witness Reeve well—we met Hatton accidentally—he was alone—he said he was going to Union Hall—we had no conversation about this matter—I have seen Reeve since, almost every day, when I have been at home—I have seen Goodwin since, when I have been at home from being out, of possession, in fact I use the house generally every Sunday—I have not been talking to Goodwin about this matter—I have not spoken to her on the subject since it occurred, nor with Reeve—I might have broached the subject, but I was not aware I was coming up—I never had any conversation with Reeve about the time Hatton was at the John o'Groat—I have not spoken to any one respecting this business—I have not talked it over with Mrs. Hatton—I have never told any one what I could prove—I told the attorney for the defence what I knew, last Tuesday week when he served me with a subpoena—I told him what I knew with respect to seeing Hatton—I do not know how he came to come to me—I did not go to Union Hall—I did not, know the time the robbery was supposed to have been committed—I know it was supposed to have been committed last Sunday five weeks—I know that by my being away in possession once or twice, and knowing the time I was away—when I was at the John o'Groat on the following Monday night Hatton was taken into custody there—Mr. Benton, the landlord, told me next day that the robbery was committed on the Sunday previous—he did not say a word about the time of day at which it was committed.

MR. PAYNE. Q. Was what Mr. Benton told you, that the robbery had been committed on the Sunday before the Monday that Hatton was taken into custody? A. Yes, that caused me to remember that upon that Sunday evening I was with him.






ELLEN ANDERSON

WILLIAM GOULSTON
. I am foreman to Mr. Priest, of Water-street, Blackfriars, and live in John-street, Holland-street, Blackfriars-road.

Q. When had you first any notion of what you were to speak to? A. I think it was one day last week—I did not hear when the robbery was committed, nor do I know now—I never inquired.

Q. How do you know it was this particular Sunday? A. I asked Mr. Williams, (at least he went by the name of Young at my house,) and the other lodgers down to have a pipe—I never knew him by any other name—that was not the only Sunday that I asked him down to have a pipe-Harvey, who rents my second floor, and his wife, were there—Harvey is still lodging with me—he is not here—he is a printer—I supposed Young to be a copper-plate engraver—he was seldom home later than ten at night—here is Young's account-book, in which is entered, "Cash, 14th May, 2s. 6d.," which I lent him—I put that down on the 14th, on the evening when we were having the pipe—here is 6d. entered to him on the 26th of May—that was lent his wife when they were in distress through this.

MR. HORRY. Q. The first intimation you received of this was from Mrs. Young? A. It was—I never knew him by the name of Stone, or as Williams, till after this affair—Mrs. Young spoke to me about this, long before I received the subpoena.

MR. BALLANTINE. Q. You have heard Goulston's evidence? A. Yes—I did not listen particularly—I was in the gallery—I saw him produce this book—I did not see him enter the 2s. 6d., as I was not in the kitchen the whole time—I did not know I should be wanted here till Goulston asked me—he told me it was to prove Young was innocent of the robbery, by proving he was at home—I did not hear from him what time the robbery was committed—I said I would come and swear he was at home at this hour—the hour had not been mentioned to me, but he was accused of the robbery—Goulston and his wife told me so—Goulston told me in the course of the week, that it was about nine o'clock—I have not stated my evidence to anybody—Mrs. Young still lodges in the house.

MR. HORRY. Q. You have come without a subpoena? A. Yes—I went out about eight, and met Mr. Young and his eldest daughter coming home—I returned before nine, and Young was there then—Mrs. Young spoke to me about this, the day her husband was taken.

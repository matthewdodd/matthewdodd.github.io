            . I am a baker
: I was sitting in my parlour about ten o'clock (I had just before that changed some money for a customer, and had put about six shillings into the till with some halfpence ) I heard a noise afterwards in the shop; I went out and found the prisoner in the shop; he said he came for a loaf; the door was not open; he must have got over the hatch; I looked into my till, and missed all the silver out of it; I searched the prisoner's pocket and found six shillings or six and six-pence; then he said two other boys had lifted him into the shop.
The constable, who was present when the prisoner was searched, confirmed the evidence of the prosecutor.
The prisoner said nothing in his defence.

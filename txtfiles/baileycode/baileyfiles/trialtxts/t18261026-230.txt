SAMUEL CLIFT. I lost a pair of stockings and a frock from my boat on the 24th of August, at four o'clock in the morning; the boat was then in the canal of Aston, near Birmingham


. I came to Paddington, and on a second journey to Paddington I apprehended the prisoner at Brentford, on the 22d of October, with the frock and stockings on - he had been my servant
, and absconded on the 23d of August - I then missed the property; he said they were mine, and that he had pawned more of my things at Birmingham.
Prisoner. Q. Did I not pay you 8s., and was to pay 3s. a week for them? A. No - he never did.

            . I am an officer. I took the psoner, wearing these things; he said, "These are yours, and the others I pawned at Birmingham;" he said nothing about paying 8s.

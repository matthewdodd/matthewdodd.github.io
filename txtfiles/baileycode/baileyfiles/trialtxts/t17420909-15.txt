The Prisoner broke into my House and took the Things mentioned in the Indictment; she confessed the taking of them, and that she sold them to one Byrom , in Catherine-wheel-Alley in White-Chappel. Mrs Byrom own'd she bought them of her: Mrs Byrom's Husband brought them to me, I live in Spital street; I never saw the Girl before - I do not know how she got in.

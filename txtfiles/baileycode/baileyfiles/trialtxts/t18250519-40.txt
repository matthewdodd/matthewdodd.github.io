. The prisoner came to my house one Thursday in April - she asked if I went out washing
; I said Yes: she came next day again, and said her mother would want me one day in the following week; I said I could come Tuesday or Wednesday: she came again on the Monday, and asked if I could wash a frill; I said Yes, but I never saw her again till she was taken into custody. I did not miss the articles till the Wednesday following, but the prisoner confessed that she had taken them on the Monday.

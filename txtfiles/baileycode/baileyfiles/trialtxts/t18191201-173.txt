            . I live in Middlesex-street, Somers'-town. I let the prisoner a furnished lodging, at 6 s. a week; he was there near a quarter, I received no money of him. He said he had money coming from an estate in Scotland, and when that was sold he would pay me. He left, and I found every thing was gone, except a bedstead, two chairs, and a table - the articles stated in the indictment were taken away, which were let with the lodging.

            . I know all the things were in the room when the prisoner took it. I have only found the curtains and sheets.

            , of the Trinity Minories


, was indicted for 


               breaking the Dwelling-House of 
                     
                        
                           George

                  , in the Night-time, and stealing a Gold Watch, Chain, &c. value 30 l. and 19 Guineas
            , the 29th of September
 last.
The Prosecutor depos'd, That his House was broken, and the Watch stolen; but he did not suspect the Prisoner, who was his Journeyman
, and had been his Apprentice; 'till a Goldsmith, who was his Neighbour, and having bought his Gold Seal, and hearing he had been robb'd, gave him Notice of it; and that it was brought to him by a Boy belonging to an Alehouse, at the Three Kings in the Minories; that being inform'd by the Boy that the Prisoner had sent him, he search'd the Prisoner's Lodging, but could not find the Watch; and that the Prisoner being examin'd, pretended he found the Seal in a Field going to Limehouse.
The Boy depos'd, He receiv'd the Seal from the Prisoner, who sent him while he was drinking in his Master's House, in his Master's Name, to sell it; and that he did, and he gave the Money to the Prisoner.

             depos'd, That going again to search the Prisoner's Lodging and pressing him to declare the Truth, he did afterwards take the Watch from behind the Bed's-head, and deliver'd it to him; the Constable likewise confirm'd this, and that he did at last own the taking of the Watch and 19 Guineas, and said that he lost 11 of them in going Home, he having miss'd his Fob, and put them beside, into his Breeches. However, the Prisoner at the Bar deny'd the Fact, and insisted upon it that he found them, and call'd several Witnesses to prove he was elsewhere all that Night, and so could not possibly commit the Fact; which tho' they came pretty near, did not amount to a satisfactory Proof: He also call'd several Persons to his Character, who gave him a good one; as also did his Master himself, the Prosecutor: But the Fact being so clearly prov'd, the Jury found him 


               guilty to the Value of 39 s.

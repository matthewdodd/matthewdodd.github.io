             sworn. - I am a merchant
, and contractor with government: On Tuesday the 25th of November, from twelve to one in the middle of the day, I was in the long room, at the Custom-house, making an entry, in the mean time, a person touched me on the right arm, and informed me that a man in a brown coat had picked my pocket; I put my hand into my great-coat pocket, being a wet day, I then put my hands under my great-coat into my other coat pocket, that I might be certain my handkerchief was gone; I missed it from my right-hand great-coat pocket; I then called out, stop that man in the brown coat, who was making his way to the door in the long room; I pursued him, and there were two or three more; he got out at the door, and upon the second step, he dropped it; I saw him drop it, I picked it up; I know it to be my handkerchief, there is a little R in the corner.
- DYER sworn. - I saw the prisoner take the handkerchief from the pocket of Mr. Ramsden.
Prisoner's defence. My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury, I acknowledge that I have been guilty; I was a distressed man, with seven children, and no wife to take care of them; I hope, my Lord, that you will shew me mercy.

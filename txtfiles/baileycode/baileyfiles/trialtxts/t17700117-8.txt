. Mr. Green brought me two parcels of pins, and asked me if they were mine? and said he was afraid I had been robbed. I found my marks upon them. He described the man that brought them to him, which I suspected to be the prisoner, who had left me the Saturday before. There were 11000 of them.
Thomas Green. I am a pin-maker. The prisoner brought these papers of pins to my shop to fell them. He said he found them on Saturday night, on London-bridge. I did not know whose they were; I seeing the haberdasher's mark upon them, carried them to Mr. Sibley, and asked how he marked such pins? He told me the letters which are here upon them. Then I produced them to him, and said, I supposed he was robbed. (The pins produced in court.)

THURSTON WORTS. I am a baker
. On the 24th of May, the prisoner came into my shop, and asked for a 2lb. loaf about two o'clock - my wife went to weigh the loaf, and when she went back she saw these articles, which are my property, in the prisoner's basket - she offered great resistance to my wife - I shut the door and had her secured - she threw herself on her knees, and offered us all she had to let her go - the other property was found in her basket.

HENRY WALTHAM
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
18th of July, 3 sovereigns, 1 half-sovereign, 2 half-crowns, 1 groat, and 1 half-penny, the monies of 



George Tickell, his master.







GEORGE TICKELL
. I am a cheesemonger, and live in Broad-street, Groevenor-square. The prisoner was errand-boy to me for about ten days—I sent him, on the 18th of July, to the collector of the assessed taxes at Charing-cross—I gave him three sovereigns, one half-sovereign, two half-crowns, a groat, and a halfpenny, to pay on my account—he went out, and never returned—I was looking for him till November, when he was taken on another charge—he was taken on this charge from Clerkenwell prison, on the 24th of February.

Prisoner. You say I was in your employ on the 18th of July, that is false; I never was in your employ in July, it was June; and I never was trusted with the money either. Witness. I will swear I gave you the money, and at that time.





BARTHOLOMEW ROSSELLOTY
. I am the collector of taxes. The prisoner never paid me any money—I received the money from the prosecutor, on the 20th of July.

Prisoner's Defence. In November last, I was convicted from here, and had three months, and Mr. Tickell said he should have his wish now, and if his own charge was not enough, my former conviction would assist him; I wrote to him to know if he had any charge against me, and he said that was his business, not mine.




GUILTY.* Aged 18.—


Transported for Seven Years.

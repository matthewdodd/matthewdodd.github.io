            . I am servant to William Crawshay and Co. of Paul's-wharf


. On the 15th of December, about half-past three o'clock in the afternoon, I caught the prisoner on the wharf on a pile of shot, with one in his hand; I collared him, he begged my pardon, and hoped I would not take him - when I got him into the street, I found two more concealed about his person.

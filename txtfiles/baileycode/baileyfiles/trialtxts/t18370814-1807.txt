WILLIAM WERE
, (a blind man.) I lodge at No. 9, George-yard, Whitechapel. I was in bed on the 9th of July—I heard somebody come into my room—I asked who was there—the prisoner said, "Mary Ann Sullivan"—she said she was going to lie down—I had this money in my pocket—in a few minutes I heard the money rattle, and then heard her going out of the room—I called to my boy to see if she had robbed me—my money was all gone, and I sent for a policeman—I am sure it was her voice—she had lodged there some time.





MICHAEL. DEVINE
. I am employed by the prosecutor. I put him to bed—it was in the morning—I heard him halloo, and came up stairs—he told me the woman had taken the money out of his pocket—I know there was 3s. 6d. in halfpence in his waistcoat pocket—I had taken it out of his breeches pocket 'and put it into his waistcoat pocket—I and the officer found the prisoner drinking in a public-house.





CORNELIUS O'DONOGHUE
 (police-constable H 180.) I found the prisoner in company with another woman, in a public-house, drinking part of a pot of beer—I found only 4 1/2 d. on her.

Prisoner. I had only been there two days that time.

            . I am a salesman
, and live at Bethnal-green


. On the 31st of January, some boys' dresses hung at my door; and in five minutes I was told they were gone. I ran into Brick-lane, Whitechapel; a boy pointed the prisoner out. I went up to him, and said
"Give me what you have got in your hands;" he said
"I shan't," and tried to throw something out of his apron over a wall; but I seized him - and this dress fell out of his apron.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

I am a buckle-maker
, I belong to the haberdasher's company as a tackle porter besides; I had three bales to be shipped off from Porter's-key, I believe on the 21st of July, about twelve, and about one we found one of the bales cut open, and some sail cloth cut out.

             sworn.
About half after eight on the 21st of July, I was coming through the new alley near St. George's Church, and I heard some people say that them two chaps before had offered that sail cloth to sell; I followed them, and came up with one, and asked him if he would sell it, he said yes; he asked eighteen shillings, says I, that is too much, I will give you fourteen shillings, they seemed agreeable to take it; the other had it on his shoulder: says I, can you give me change for a guinea, no says they, then come into the public house: when we came in there, says I to one of them, why you have stole this sail cloth; yes, says he, you know that, or else the price would not be so: I stopped them, they endeavoured to get away; I went for an officer. This is the canvas.
(Produced and deposed to.)
PRISONER COX's DEFENCE.
I found the canvas in a narrow alley.
Court. What way of life are you in? - I served a little time to a shoe-maker, I have no friends here.
PRISONER SMITH's DEFENCE.
I met this boy with a bolt of canvas, which I saw him pick up at the corner of Foul-lane in the Borough, I spoke to him, and he said he was going to sell it, and says I, you will be taken up and put into Newgate; no, says he, I will not, for you saw me find it; so we went and met this man, and he asked us to sell it, he brought us into an alehouse, and called for a pot of beer, and then he wanted to turn us out of the house, and we would not go without our property.

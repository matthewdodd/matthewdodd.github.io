            . I live in St. Paul's Church-yard. On the evening of the 3d of October this handkerchief was stolen from my pocket; it was safe half an hour before. I know it to be mine, by the pattern and its appearance.

            . I am an officer. On the 3d of October I was in Fleet-street, and saw Mr. Pallister and two gentlemen just beyond Fleet-market


; the prisoner and another were following them. Mr. Pallister stopped just before he got to Old Change


: I went up and asked if he had lost anything - he missed his handkerchief. I went and took them both, and while I was searching the other man at the Compter I saw the handkerchief at the prisoner's feet; I had not seen him take it for as they saw me; I kept behind, and pretended to be drunk.
Prisoner's Defence. I was returning from Limehouse; they searched me in the Church-yard, and found nothing, but at the Compter the officer saw the handkerchief under the table.

WILLIAM FREE
. I am under-ostler at the Castle Inn at Woodford. On the 15th of February, I had my breeches, jacket, stockings, and handkerchief safe in my bed-room over the loft—I missed them that evening—the prisoner lived in that neighbourhood, but I did not know him—he had no right to have my things—I saw him on the 17th, and he had a jacket, a pair of breeches, a pair of stockings, and a handkerchief on, which are mine—these are them—(looking at them)—the rest of the things I have lost.





JOSEPH CRICKS
 (police-constable K 331.) I took the prisoner with this property on him in Tottenham-court-road.

Prisoner's Defence. I bought the things on the Sunday morning between eight and nine o'clock.




GUILTY
. Aged 19.—


Transported for Seven Years.
(There was another indictment against the prisoner.)

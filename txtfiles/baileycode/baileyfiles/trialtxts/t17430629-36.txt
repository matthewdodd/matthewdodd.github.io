            . On the 28th of this Instant, I lost a Shirt, and a Silver Clasp, out of my Room in Mrs Harvey's House, which were found upon the Prisoner in her House, Mr Barnes the Constable delivered it to me; he said, he took it out of the Prisoner's Breeches. - I am sure I left them in the Room that Day.

                  Cotterel 
               



            . The Prisoner was searched by Mr Barnes in my Presence; there were 9 Pieces of my Hair taked from him, about a Pound Weight. - I cannot exactly tell the Quantity, but I know it to be my Hair, because I bought it and paid for it; I left it in a Hat Case almost that very Moment that he took it; this is my Hair
Prisoner. That is a very hard Oath, the Hair is not marked; it is impossible for any Body to swear to that Hair.
Cotterel. I cannot justly tell the Value of it.

            . I lodge in Mrs Harvey's House; I found 2 Pair of Stockings and a Neckcloth of mine upon the Prisoner in Mrs Harvey's Kitchen; they were in my Table Drawer at 2 o'Clock that Afternoon.

                  Harvey 
               



            . I was going into my Bed-Chamber accidentally, on the 28th of this Month, between 6 and 7 o'Clock in the Evening, and found the Prisoner hid behind the Curtain; I asked him twice what he did there, and I think he made me no Answer; I called, and some of my own People came to my Assistance; I pulled too the Door, to keep him in the Room, and laid hold of his Collar, but he over-pulled me, and pulled me down Stairs; a Constable was sent for, and they remmaged him: This Tea-Spoon and this Lace, which is mine, was found upon him; there was a blue and white Handkerchief, &c. left upon my Bed upon his Hat; I suppose he was frightened and had not Time to take them away.
Q. Did you ask him how he came there?
Harvey. Yes, but he made me no Answer, and did not tell me how he came by these Things.


                  Mary 
                  Pointer 
               



            . I am Servant to Mrs Harvey, she keeps a publick House; I lost a laced Cap, a half Handkerchief, and an old Muslin Apron out of my Box, on the 28th of this Month, and was by when they were taken from the Prisoner.


                  Henry 
                  Barnes 
               



            . Last Tuesday, about 6 o'Clock in the Afternoon, this little Girl (Pointer) came to me and said, Mr Barnes, there is a Boy in our House, and he has hid himself behind the Curtain; I went to Mrs Harvey's, and found him in the Kitchen; I put my Hand into his Pocket and pulled out this Hair; said I, Let us see whether you have got any Thing else, and I found all these Things upon him; he took hold of my Hand, and begged of me to perswade her to make it up, and begged of Mrs Harvey to make it up; he said it was the first Fact. He had this Bunch of Keys in his Pocket; there are 7 Keys, one of them opens Mrs Harvey's Drawers, and one of them opens mine - He said, These are my Keys: This Common Prayer-Book was found him, but this no Body owns.
Prisoner. I never saw these Keys in my Life before, nor any of these Things; as to that rough Hair no Body can swear to it.

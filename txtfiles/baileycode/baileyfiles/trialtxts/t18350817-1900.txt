JAMES BRANCH
 and 



THOMAS STEVENSON



were indicted
for stealing, on the 
24th of July, 1 purse, value 1d.; and 2 shilling; goods and minies of 



James Scudder, from the person of 



Kitty Scudder.







KITTY SCUDDER
. I was at Lee races on the 24th of July, at five o'clock I felt in my pocket, and my purse was safe—soon afterwards I put my hand in my pooket again, and missed it—it contained two shilling and some bills—I saw it again in the officer's hands—he had taken the prisoner—my husband's name is James—he is a labourer.





RICHARD TOZER
 (police-constable R 140.) I was on duty, in plair clothes. I saw the two prisoners with three others, and watched them—they were for two hours putting their hands to pockets—mostly to females—about five o'clock I saw Branch put his hand into the prosecutrix's pocket, and take the purse out—I took hold of him—he made great resistance—I called to the prosecutor—the next morning Stevens came to see Branch—I knew him directly, and took him.

Branch. Q.. Did you see me take the purse? A. Yes; I was close behind you—I found three sovereigns on you.

Steven's Defence. I never was there—I heard that a man was taken from the races—I went to see him, and this officer took me, and said I was one of them.

Branch's Defence. I saw this purse on the ground—I saw two boys chuck it down—I took it up, and was going to give it it the lady, when the officer took me.

BRANCH—


GUILTY
. Aged 18.—


Transported for Seven Years.

STEVENSON—


NOT GUILTY

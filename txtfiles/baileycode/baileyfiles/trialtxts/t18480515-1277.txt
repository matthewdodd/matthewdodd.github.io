JOHN QUIGLEY
 and 




ROBERT MARTIN



, breaking and entering the dwelling house of 



Catherine Forster, and stealing therein 1 knife and 1 button-hook, value 1s. 6d.; her goods; Quigley having been before convicted.






CATHERINE FORSTER.
 I am a widow, and keep a jeweller's shop, in High-street, Marylebone—it is my dwelling-house. On Saturday night, 8th May, about nine o'clock, Buckley told me something—I found my window broken, it was safe at five—I missed some pen-knives from a tray which was close to the glass—the policeman brought them to me—these are them (produced).





JOHN BUCKLEY.
 I take down and put up the shutters for Mrs. forster—I was passing the shop about half-past eight o'clock, and saw the glass safe; I went by again about nine, and saw the prisoners and another doing something

to the window—I said, "You have cut the glass"—they ran away—I told a policeman, and saw them taken—I am sure they are two of them.





THOMAS SKINNER
 (policeman, D 192.) About nine o'clock on Saturday night, Buckley gave me information; I pursued the prisoners—I saw them run from the window, and am sure of them—I caught Martin in Manchester square, 150 yards off—I heard something fall, and picked up a broken knife at his feet—I took it to the shop—I got over the enclosure where Quigley was taken, and found this button-hook—the hole in the window was large enough to get three fingers through.





JAMES REGAN
 (policeman.) I heard a cry of "Stop thief!" saw the prisoners and another, and caught Quigley in Manchester-square—he three something into the enclosure; it jingled against a rail—I afterwards went back and found this knife.





THOMAS HILL
 (policeman.) I produce a certificate of Quigley's conviction—(read—Convicted, January, 1848, and confined Three Months.) I was present—he is the person.

QUIGLEY—


GUILTY. Aged 19.—


Transported for Seven Years.


MARTIN



GUILTY. Aged 15.—

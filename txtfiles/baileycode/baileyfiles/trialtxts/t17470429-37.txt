                     Elizabeth 
                     Clements 
                  



                
             were indicted for 


               stealing forty-three Pounds Weight of Iron
            , the Goods of 
               
                  William 
                  Hall 
               




             , March 22
.
William Hall. I keep a Coach-house
, upon that Occasion I have a good deal of Room for Hay and Corn; this Iron was in my Corn-loft. I had an Account from 
               
                  Richard 
                  Hays 
               



            , a little Boy, that this Woman Prisoner had been seen in the Stable. These Losts are so situated, that when you get into the Stable, you can go from one to the other.


                  Richard 
                  Hays 
               



            . I saw the Prisoner, Cape, unbolt the Stable-door, he had a Cloth under his Arm, and I saw 
               
                  Mary 
                  Clements 
               



             put the Iron into the Cloth, and wrap it up; I ran a-cross the Way to fetch Mr Hall, when I came back, this Boy, the Prisoner, was standing to see who was in the Yard; as we came up, we heard the Iron rattle in falling from her.


                  Thomas 
                  Odell 
               



             confirms the other's Evidence, that he heard the Iron fall from the Prisoner upon the Stones.


                  John 
                  Good 
               



            . The Woman at the Bar worked for me two Years, and behaved justly and honestly; she worked upon Things much more portable than Iron, and I never knew her wrong me in her Life.


                  Catharine 
                  Greenfield 
               



            . I was Servant to a Gentlewoman, during the Time she worked for my Mistress, and she would never have employed her, had she not been honest.
A Relation in Court gave an Account, that the Place where Clements was then in, was at an Iron-shop, and that her Mistress had actually sent her with this Boy to fetch this Iron. The Woman Prisoner had a good Character given her by her Friends.


                  Joseph 
                  Cape 
               



             and 
               
                  Elizabeth 
                  Clements 
               





               guilty
            .
[In Consideration of 
               
                  Elizabeth 
                  Clements 
               



            's good Character, and hoping it was the first Fact, and that she may take Warning by it, the Court only ordered her for corporal Punishment.]

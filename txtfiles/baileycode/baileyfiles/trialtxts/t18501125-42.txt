JOHN BRADING
 was again indicted

for stealing 2 gowns, 1 tablecloth, 1 shift, and other articles, value 18s. 6d.; the goods of 



Emily Peake; having been before convicted.






EMILY PEAKE
. I am single, and live at Sussex-place, Islington. These towels, tablecloth, dresses, and other things are mine—on Tuesday evening, 29th Oct., they had been washed, and I assisted to hang them out to dry in the garden, and missed them next morning—a policeman afterwards called at my house.





SAMUEL CRISP
 (policeman, N 226). On 30th Oct., I was on duty on Kingsland-bridge, and saw the prisoner walking by the side of the canal, coming towards the bridge with a bundle—I called to him; he made some reply, and walked on—I went to the other side to meet him, and then saw the bundle in the canal—I stopped him—the things produced were in the bundle. (Henry William Dubois produced the certificate, as in the last case.)




GUILTY
. Aged 20.—


Transported for Seven Years.

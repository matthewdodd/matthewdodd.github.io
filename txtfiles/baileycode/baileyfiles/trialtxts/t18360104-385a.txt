ROBERT TROTT
. I keep the Camden Head public-house, in Church-lane, Limehouse. On the 4th of January, about half-past two o'clock, I and my wife were in the tap-room—my wife heard the halfpence rattle in the till in the bar—she went out, and stopped the prisoner in the passage—he was quite a stranger—I went out, and told her to look into the till, which she did, and missed 1s. 6d. in silver, which was all the silver there had been in it—I accused him of taking it—he said he had not taken any, and he had not got any money—I was taking him to the station-house, and when be got about two hundred yards, he opened his hand, and gave me 1s. 6d. out of it.

Prisoner's Defence. I was passing, and saw a boy taking the money out of the till—I went in to get something to drink, and this gentleman came and said I had stolen 1s.6d. from the till—I said I had not, but there was 1s. 6d. on the counter, and I gave it him—he knocked me on the head three times.





ROBERT TROTT
. There is not a word of truth in it.




GUILTY
. Aged 16.—

THOMAS JEFFERSON HOLT
. I am a confectioner, and live in St. Paul's churchyard On the 13th of March the prisoner came to my shop—I did not bow him before—be called for a plate of ox-tail soup which was supplied to him by my servant—my attention was called to him—he was there about half an hour—I had lost spoons before, and when he left, I went up into the loop room and missed the spoon—I followed him—he ran to near Paternoster-row—I came up to him and said, "Young man give me my property"—he said, "It is in my coat pocket"—he drew it from his pocket, and put it into my hand—I said, "This is the second time I have been served this trick," and took him to the watch-house.





GEORGE JOHN RESTIEAUX

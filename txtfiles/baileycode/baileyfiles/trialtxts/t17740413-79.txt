             deposed that he went into the George alehouse in Monmouth-street


, on the 12th of March, at half after ten at night; that the prisoner followed him in and sat in the same box; that he had half a guinea, some silver and halfpence, and two receipts in his pocket; that he put the half guinea into his fob, and being tired, laid his head on the table; that as he was almost asleep he felt the prisoner's hand go out of his pocket; that she slipped away before he could lay hold of her; that he searched his pockets and missed his money and receipts; that he knew Scully before because she plied at the corner of Monmouth-street; that he told one Brown, a watchman, that Scully had robbed him, who afterwards took her.

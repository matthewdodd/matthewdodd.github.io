                  , from his person
            .
JABEZ TROTMAN. I am porter
 at a lamp manufactory, in Long-acre. On the 10th of August, about nine o'clock in the evening, I was going home, and met the prisoner just by Ely-place, in Holborn


. I drew my watch out to see the time by the gas-light, and before I could replace it the prisoner snatched it from me-hekept walking by me, looking at it - He gave a sudden jerk, and it was gone instantly, but I could not see who he handed it to. He ran up Leather-lane, and was not out of my sight till I secured him, and took him to the watch-house, with assistance. I am positive he is the man. I have not recovered my watch.
Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. I was sober; there were several people about; he did not try to escape before he got to Leather-lane. He struggled to get away.
JOSEPH MIETT. I am the watch-house keeper; the prisoner was brought to the watch-house. I found nothing on him.

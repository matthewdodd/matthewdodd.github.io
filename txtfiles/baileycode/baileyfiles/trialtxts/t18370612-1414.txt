JOHN LLOYD
 and 




CHARLES KENNEY
 were indicted for

 stealing, on the 
5th of June, 1 handkerchief, value 2s., the goods of 



John Andrew Belsham, from his person; and that Lloyd had been before convicted of felony.







JOHN ANDREW BELSHAM
. I live in Little Pulteney-street, Westminster. On the 5th of June I was at a picture shop at the corner of Cursitor-street, Chancery-lane—I felt a tug at my pocket, turned round, and saw the two prisoners—I seized them both, and said, "Which of you has picked my pocket?"—I cast my eyes on the ground, and there was handkerchief—Lloyd was standing over it—I had a gentleman with me—we each took one, and took them to Fleet-street, and delivered them to an officer—this is my handkerchief—Lloyd was nearest to me—they were both behind me, and no other person near me—they disclaimed any acquaintance with each other.

Lloyd. Three lads followed us down, and said they did not see us touch his handkerchief—he said he worked at the chambers in Chancery lane. Witness. A lad followed them to the watch-house, but no one was near them at the time.





THOMAS HASBERUY
. I was with Mr. Belsham—he turned round, and I seized the two after he spoke to them—I took hold of Lloyd—the handkerchief was under Lloyd's feet.





THOMAS LIOHTFOOT
. I am a policeman. The prisoners were brought to me, and I took them and the handkerchief.

Lloyd's Defence. I was returning from my brother-in-law's, and stood at the side of this gentleman—when I turned he had this other lad by the collar—I never saw him before.

Kermey's Defence. The gentleman turned and caught hold of me—the handkerchief was lying down, and some boy ran away.





WILLIAM POCOCK
. I produce a certificate of Lloyd's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office (read)—the prisoner is the person.

LLOYD—


GUILTY
 Aged 19.

KENNEY—


GUILTY
 Aged 17.




Transported for Seven Years.

            . On the 2d of November, just as I got through Temple-bar


, I saw the prisoner draw my handkerchief out of my pocket - he put it either into his own pocket, or somewhere about him. I seized him; he struggled sometime till Mr. Weaver came to my assistance. I charged the prisoner with it - he said he was surprised at me, pulled off his hat, shewed me a handkerchief, and said that was the only one he had. A gentleman came up and said,
"You are not up to the old soldier
"and found my handkerchief concealed between his coat and waistcoat. I gave him in charge.

            . I was behind the prosecutor, and saw him seize the prisoner - a scuffle took place, and I collaredhim. We placed him against a wall, a gentleman came up, and took the handkerchief from under his waistcoat.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

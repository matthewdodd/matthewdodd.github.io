            . I am an officer. I was by Sadler's Wells


, and saw the prisoners, and three more together. They went one on each side of a servant, who was carrying a child, one put his hand to the child's neck; they saw me, drew back, then went up again. Morris made a snatch at the child's neck, and took the necklace off; they crossed the road; I followed and saw it drop between them.

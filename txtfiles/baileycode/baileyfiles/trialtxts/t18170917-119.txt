. On the 9th of September, the prisoner called at our house - I delivered a silver tankard to him to take to his masters, Messrs. Jackson and Donne, to be engraved, between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning - He never returned it. I am certain he is the man.

            . I am an engraver. The prisoner was my servant, and used to go round to the customers to collect work. Messrs. Goodbehere and Co. were our customers. He went out on the 9th of September, as usual, and never returned-he never brought the tankard. I could not find the prisoner till last Thursday, when he said - He got drunk, and did not know what had become of it, some person took it from him. He had been six months with us.
Prisoner. I have nothing to say.

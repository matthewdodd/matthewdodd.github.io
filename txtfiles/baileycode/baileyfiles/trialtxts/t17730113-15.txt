            . I keep a stable-yard at Paddington, adjoining to the Green Man. Mr. Ewer is a farmer
: my teem was in his stable-yard. His man informed me that some of his master's hay had been stolen; I went out and met the prisoner; suspecting him I told him I was going to search for a thief; I asked him to go with me; he said he would; I followed him home to his house, and I found the hay in his stable; upon charging him with the stealing it, he acknowledged it, and asked my pardon.

             confirmed this evidence.
The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.

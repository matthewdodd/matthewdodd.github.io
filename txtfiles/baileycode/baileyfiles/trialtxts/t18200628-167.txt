            . I am a gentleman's servant
, and live in Paddington-street. On the 30th of June my seal and rings were fast to my watch-ribbon, when I was near the bottom of Half-moon-street, near Curzon-street


, between eight and nine o'clock at night in a crowd, as the Queen was expected to come down there, the prisoner came and cut my ribbon, and got my seal and rings. I felt a tug at my watch, I put my hand down, caught his hand with them in, and took them out of his hand.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

            . I am a labourer. I was in the crowd with Brannan, the prisoner came before us and stopped. I suspected what he was after, and saw him cut the ribbon - the prosecutor seized him, and took the seals from him.
Prisoner's Defence. I picked them off the ground.

            . I was standing with Mrs. Floyd's Coach in Great Earl-Street


, the 24th of December, and saw the Prisoner behind the Coach, picking out the great Nails. I stood still, and saw him pick out five or six. And in the Space of 10 Minutes, he had got out 17 Nails, and had taken off this Brass Top, from one of the Corners of the Coach. This Nail, and this Top, I found in his Pocket, and I am sure they are Mrs. Floyd's, and belong to her Coach; the rest he slung away when I laid hold of him, and at the same Time, he cut me across this Hand with his Knife, in such a Manner, that I thought I should never more have had the Use of it.

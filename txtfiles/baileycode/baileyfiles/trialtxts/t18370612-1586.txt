PATRICK PETER MACNOLTY
. I live in Houlton-street. On the 28th of May I met the prisoner, and went home with her to bed—I pulled off my clothes—my coat and waistcoat—I had three or four shillings, a handkerchief, and a snuff box—it was early in the morning—I was rather sleepy—I rather think I was not drunk—it appears she left me in bed—I do not recollect whether she was in bed—she was found to be the occupier of the room at the time—I was not perfectly sober—I will swear this is my coat—there is no name about it—this portion of the lining was a little mutilated, and I got it repaired.





JOSEPH CLEMENTS
 (police-constable E 103.) I was on duty on Sunday morning, about half past seven o'clock—I met Marshall and another female coming out of a lodging-house in Church-lane—the prisoner had this basket in her hand—they saw me, and turned back—the prisoner went back to the stair-case, and threw the basket out of her hand—I said "What have you got there?"—she said, the other women knew nothing of it—I found this coat and the other things, in the basket, and one of the shoes on the prisoner's foot—I went and searched the rooms, and found the prosecutor fast asleep—I awoke him, and he. said they were his property.

Prisoner. I was coming down to take these things to the man—he was very much in liquor, and I took these things to a person's house to take care of—I was coming down to go to my own room where the man was.





GEORGE THORNTON
 (police-constable E 91.) I searched the prisoner at the station, and found this snuff box in her pocket.

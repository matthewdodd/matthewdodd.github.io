ROBERT SNELL. I live in Red Lion-street, Holborn. On the 18th of August, about one o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner about Holborn-bars


; she followed me from there to the end of Bedford-row


, and immediately after she left me, I missed my watch - she had been talking to me, but I went no where with her; I am certain she is the woman - I had spent the evening with a relation in the City.
ROBERT WOOD. I am an officer of St. Martin, Lndgate. On the 18th of August, about three o'clock in the morning, the prisoner was brought into my custody on another charge, and the watch was found on her; I asked who it belonged to; she said herself; that she had had it about three years and a-half, and it had belonged to her brother, who was dead.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
The prisoner put it in a written Defence, stating that a young man who had gone with her into a stable, had left his watch with her till the morning.

            . Upon my oath, I went to no stable with her, nor did I give her the watch for any purpose.

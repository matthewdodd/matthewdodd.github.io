THOMAS GREEN
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
3rd of June, 7 shillings and 2 halfpence, the monies of 



James Lee, from his person; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






JAMES LEE
. I live in Dudley-street, Paddington. About twelve o'clock at night of the 3rd of June I was in the Harrow-road, leaning against the pilings, dozing, as I was tired—I had 7s. and a few halfpence in my pocket—the prisoner came up and stood by me—I took no notice of him—he put his hand into my pocket, and I felt it coming out—a person on the opposite side told me if I had any money in my pocket that person had taken it—I felt, and missed my money—the prisoner was just leaving me—I followed him, and called out "Police, take this man in charge; that is the man who robbed at, and he should not have robbed me, a poor hard working man"—he said, "I did not take it, another man gave it me"—I did not see any other man.





PATRICK CONNOLLY
 (police-sergeant D 6.) About twelve o'clock that night I was in the Harrow-road—I saw the prisoner running—just at I came up to him his hand went down, and I heard some money jink—I took him, and picked up 1s. and two halfpence—a person who came up picked up 2s., and gave them to me—the prisoner said, "It is only a lark, let me go"—I said, "I shall keep you till the person comes up who is calling 'Stop thief"—the prosecutor came, and said, "That is the man, keep him"—I searched the prisoner, but found nothing on him.

Prisoner's Defence. I had not been able to work for some weeks; some men knew it, and gave me 3s.; and had some halfpence; before I heard the cry of "Stop thief" there was a mob running, and I ran too.





RICHARD ROADNIGHT
 (police-sergeant T 11.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY

Transported for Ten Years.

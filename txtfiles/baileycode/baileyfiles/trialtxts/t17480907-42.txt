             was my servant
, and when my wife and I went into the country I left her in charge of the house; when I came home a great many things were missing, and Cath. Winepress said she had been in a great deal of trouble , and had made use of them and pawned them.
Q. Did she tell you what things?
Havard. I desired her to tell her story to my wife; for I did not interfere in those matters.
Q. Has 
               
                  Catherine 
                  Winepress 
               



             said any thing since about them?
Havard. She said she carried them to other places.
Q. What have you to say against 
               
                  Ann 
                  Nicholson 
               



            ?
Havard . She was in the house with 
               
                  Catherine 
                  Winepress 
               



            , for when I came to town I found her in the house with her.
Q. Was it by your consent?
Havard. No.
Q. What are the value of these goods?
Havard. They are worth about 40 l.


                  Elizabeth 
                  Havard 
               



            . I was out of town , and when I came home I miss'd eight pair of Holland sheets , eight damask and two diaper Table-cloths, a green silk gown, a yellow damask gown , and I lost several other things which were not in the indictment.
Q. What reason have you to accuse the prisoner at the bar ?
Havard. She said she had made use of them, and that Nicholson was in the house to help her, and Winepress said she had pawned the sheets in Hart-street, and Nicholson own'd she had pawn'd the China handled knives and forks in Stanhope-street .
Prisoner Winepress. I was indebted, and the people threatened to arrest me, and I pawn'd these things to make them easy .
Both 

               Guilty
             .
[Tho' these goods were of the value of 40 l. the prosecutor was so generous in laying the indictment, as not to value them at above 26 s .]

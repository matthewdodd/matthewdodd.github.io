JOHN SIMPKINS
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
23rd of Dec., 1 pair of stays, value 1s. 6d., the goods of 



Elizabeth Byfield; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






ELIZABETH BYFIELD
. I live in Great Smith-street, Westminster. On the night of the 23rd of Dec., I was sitting behind my counter—the prisoner came in, and asked if I sold shirt-buttons—I said no—he turned round, caught up the stays, and ran away with them.

Prisoner. I never was near the shop. Witness. I have not the least doubt of him—he has got a mark on his cheek, and he had a red handkerchief round his neck—I had a full view of him while he was asking where he could get the buttons—I could swear to the handkerchief on his neck, and the mark in his face.






EDWARD THORN
. I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Westminster—(read)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 17.—


Transported for Seven Years.

(There was another indictment against the prisoner.)

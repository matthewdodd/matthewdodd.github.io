            . Oa the 17th of August I was coming along the Strand


 about twelve o'clock, and opposite Northumberland House, I passed three gentlemen, and I saw the prisoner following them; I saw him put his hand into the pocket of one of the gentleman and take out his handkerchief. He was in the act of putting it into his bosom when I seized him. I called the gentleman; he returned back, and wanted me to give him his handkerchief; I told him I could not do that, but if he was a gentleman, he would come back with me to the office, and prosecute the prisoner; he said that was impossible, as he was going to Scotland.

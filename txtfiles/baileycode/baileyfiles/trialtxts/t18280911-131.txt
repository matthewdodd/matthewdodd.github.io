            . My brother William is a linen-draper
, and lives in Chiswell-street. On the 5th of July, the prisoner came to the shop, and asked to look at ribbons, which I shewed her; she bought two yards, and paid for them; my brother fetched her back.

            . I was in my brother's shop - my sister was serving the prisoner; I was serving other customers - I cast my eye aside, and saw the prisoner's arm over the drawer; she put her hand into the drawer, then put it down between the counter and herself, and put something into her pocket - she then asked to look at some ribbons, she did the same to that drawer, and walked out; I pursued and brought her back, and found the ribbons on her.
Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you find it at the first search? A. Yes - I asked her for it - she pulled it out, and laid it on the floor, up stairs; it was not what she had bought.(Property produced and sworn to.)

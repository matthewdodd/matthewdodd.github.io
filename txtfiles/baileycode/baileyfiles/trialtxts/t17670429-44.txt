            . On the 18th of this month, the things mentioned in the indictment were lost out of Mr. Chambers's building, where I was at work. My man, named William Hall, owned one of the saws; he catched the prisoner, who had taken an opportunity to go in while I was at dinner; the other things are my property.
William Hall. I was in the street; I saw the prisoner come up the area from the building, with a glue-pot and saws; I went and laid hold of him, and said, you villain, you have got some of our things; he went on his knees, and begged I would let him go.
Prisoner. I did take the things.

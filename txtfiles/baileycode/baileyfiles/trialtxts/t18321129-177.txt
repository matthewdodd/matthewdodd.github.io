            . I am porter to Mr. William Leuchars, a dressing-case maker
, in Piccadilly


. On the 24th of October, about a quarter before ten o'clock, I was cleaning the brass work outside, and I saw the prisone walk out at the private door, with my master's great coat on his back - he was a stranger; he walked as far as the corner of Sackville-street, and then looked back, which caused me to have suspicion - he instantly ran up Sackville-street; I followed, and took him with it; the servant had been cleaning the steps, and the door was open.

             (Police-constable C 135.) I took the prisoner, and have the coat - I found this skeleton-key on him, and 3d.
The prisoner pleaded poverty.

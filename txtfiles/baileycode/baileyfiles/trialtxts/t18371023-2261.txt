he is a smith—I saw him that night in the guard-room—(I had not seen him before)—he was taken, with the things upon him, by the corporal.





MARTIN HAYWARD
. I am a private in the same regiment. I had a handkerchief in my box—this is it.





PETER SPROTT

STEPHEN TAYLOR
 (police-constable S 9.) I was called in, and took the prisoner, and found this handkerchief in his hat.





EDWARD PIERCY
. I am a corporal in the 2nd regiment At half-past seven o'clock that night the prisoner was stopped by the sentinel with a bundle—I took him into the guard-room—he said he had got the things from the canteen, and they were some dirty linen—I inspected the bundle, and I found these things—I saw taken from his pocket a pair of regimental boots, also a regimental shirt from his back, and a regimental Bible from his hat.

. On the 19th of April I lost this money - I had taken the money out of my till all but two sixpences - I and my wife went to dinner, and the prisoner came into the shop; my wife went and served him with a halfpenny-worth of apples - I heard her ask him why he came into the shop without rapping, this induced me to go into the shop; I looked into the till and missed the two sixpences - no other person had been in the shop - I followed the prisoner, who had got about a hundred yards - I took him and brought him back, and accused him of taking the two sixpences - he denied having anything but a shilling, which he had been in my shop before to get changed - I saw a policeman going by - I called him in, and the two sixpences fell from the bottom of the prisoner's trousers.

             (police-constable, N. 75). I was called in - the prisoner denied having any sixpences about him - I began to search him, and these sixpences fell from him.

             (police-sergeant, G. 8). I have a certificate here (which I got from Mr. Clark's office) of the conviction of the prisoner in May last year - I was here and know the prisoner is the person.

            . I live with 
               
                  John 
                  Knight
               



            , a shoe maker
, in Orchard-street


. On the 5th of February, about half-past six o'clock in the evening, I was in the shop - a pane of glass had been broken before. I saw the prisoner put his hand through, and take a boot - I ran out and seized him, he forced himself away, and escaped; another boy came up, took the boot from him and ran off - I have never seen it since. I informed the watchman, and knew him again when I saw him; I am sure he is the boy.
Prisoner. Q. You have played with me since it happened - A. I have not; I know him by seeing him about; he is a cripple.

            . I am a watchman. Robinson described the prisoner to me; I had met him and another a few minutes before, and saw them passing across the road - they knew me; this was about half-past six in the evening; I could not find him for ten days, and then took him.
Prisoner's Defence. Every thing they have said is false.

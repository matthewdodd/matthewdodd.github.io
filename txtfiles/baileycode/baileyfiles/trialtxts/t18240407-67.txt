, and live in New-street, Fetter-lane


. On Tuesday morning, the 16th of March, when I got up, I found my yard overflowed with water; the pipe and ball-cock were gone from the water-but; I found them at Guildhall a week afterwards, and matched them with the place, they corresponded. It might have been stolen on the evening of the 15th.

            . On the 15th of March, about a quarter to nine o'clock in the evening, the prisoner brought this pipe and ball-cock to me to sell; I asked where he got it, he said he had been at work putting down new pipe and taking the old; it being wet I detained him, and gave him in charge; and next day Wild sent for me to put new pipe to his place, and I found that this matched it.

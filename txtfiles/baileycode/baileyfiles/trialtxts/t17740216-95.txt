             was indicted for 


               wilful and corrupt perjury in an affidavit sworn before the signer of bills for Middlesex, charging

            . I sign the bills for Middlesex; this affidavit (producing it) was sworn before me by Price the defendant.
Mr. Allingham. I have seen the defendant write a hundred times I suppose; (the affidavit shown him); that is his writing. (The affidavit read).
Mr. Frith produced the process from the sheriff of Middlesex's office.

                   Bristow
               



            . The prisoner never had any dealings with me; I never contracted any debt with him for diet, lodging or any thing in my life; I never owed him any thing in my life; I have had him in my custody for picking pockets; Sir 
               
                  John
                   Fielding
               



             has sent proper persons to suppress pickpockets at the play-house; I am one of Sir John's men .

             . Price asked me to go to a public house to drink with him the night before the arrest, and he and several other young people were talking about one 
               
                  Mary
                   Stevens
               



             going to Sir 
               
                  John
                   Fielding
               



            's and bringing people to prevent their getting money at the playhouse, and said they would stop her going there for the future, and were consulting how to do it; they proposed taking out a writ for 100 l. the prisoner and several of them besides said they would be a quarter of a guinea a piece towards it; they said they might as well pat four in the writ as one; they said it would not do to arrest Heley, for he could get bail; they would put farting Phill in; that is a nick name they give Bristow; they said he was a busy fellow and they would prevent him doing any thing more; they were to go and arrest Phill in the morning ; Price was taken up that morning for behaving disorderly at the play-house, and put in gaol.


                  John
                   Clarke
               



            . I know the prisoner Price and 
               
                  Philip
                   Bristow
               



            ; Bristow attends Sir John Fielding's office; he was arrested at the suit of 
               
                  James
                   Price
               



            ; I do not know whether the defendant is the man; he arrested him and he was in great distress; Price was not present the next morning; he was brought before Sir 
               
                  John
                   Fielding
               



             for picking pockets. On his examination I told Sir John he had arrested Bristow for 100 l. Sir John asked him what it was for; he told Sir John he knew what it was for; I was bail for him.
The defendant said nothing in his defence.
For the prisoner.


                  Mary
                   Stevens
               



            . I was in the writ with Bristow; Bristow told me not to make myself uneasy, he would get me out and endeavour to prove Price perjured, and that he would clear the debts; I owed Price the money for clothes, and money lent; I told Bristow so; I often denied owing him any money when I was in custody, in hopes of getting out.
Q. Did you ever say you would swear any thing before the prisoner should be hurt?
Stevens . No.
Mr. Williams . When I went to give the last witness the subpoena , she would not take it; but said she would keep out of the way and not appear.
The prisoner said Allingham was sent to him in Newgate from Mr. Bristow to make a proposal to make it up.
Allingham and Bristow both denied it.

- Ryley the officer deposed, that before Sir 
               
                  John
                   Fielding
               



             Stevens declared that she did not owe Price any thing.

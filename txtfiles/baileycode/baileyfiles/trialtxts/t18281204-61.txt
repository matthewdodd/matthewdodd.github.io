            . I am an attorney
, and live in Devonshire-street, Trinity-square. On the 4th of November, about six o'clock in the evening, I was going to my chambers in the Temple, and recollect my handkerchief being safe at the bottom of Fleet-street - I was stopped about the middle of Fleet-street


 by Roe, who asked if my pocket had been picked; I felt, and my handkerchief was gone; he had hold of the prisoner, and produced it; I had not seen him near me.

            . I am a constable of the City. On the 4th of November, about six o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner with a person following the prosecutor in Fleet-street; I saw him attempting his pocket, and get the handkerchief out a little way just before I came to the Bolt-in-Tun; I followed him about fifty yards further, when he got it quite out; I went up and seized the prisoner, and took the handkerchief from him - the other went away while I was struggling to get the handkerchief from the prisoner; I took him directly after, but he was discharged, as I had not seen him do any thing - he was in company with the prisoner, and touched him over the elbows.(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner. I humbly throw myself on the mercy of the Court.



               GUILTY

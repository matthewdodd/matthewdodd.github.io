MOSES PACKER. I live in High-street, Shadwell


, and am a shoemaker

            . I am fourteen years old. I came by the prosecutor's shop about nine o'clock in the evening, and saw the prisoner Callaghan go in and take the boots from inside the shop; they were both in company - Freeman remained outside; they went away together - I followed them, but could not see which way they went; I saw them in custody in about a quarter of an hour - I live in Dock-street; my father is a shoemaker - they both ran away together; Freeman said he would hit me if I did not go away.

            . I am a Policeman. I apprehended the prisoners about nine o'clock that night, both in company; Callaghan denied taking the boots, but said another boy had got them - I had information, and took them within ten minutes of the robbery; I found five dots on each of their hands, which signifies that they belong to the Forty Thieves.

- WARNE sworn. - I work for Mr. Gaimes; I went there with some work, the constable was sent for, but he was a long while coming; and I said, I would search him; I asked him, if he had not got something belonging to Mr. Gaimes about him, and he said, no; I searched his pocket, and could not find any thing; I then felt about his breeches, and, at the bottom of his breeches, underneath, near the knee, I felt them; I told him to unbutton his knees, and he tried to shove them under his stockings, but I would not let him; I took them from him, and gave them to the officer, these are the same.
Mr. Gaintes. These are my property.

Mr. Gaimes. These are all my property.

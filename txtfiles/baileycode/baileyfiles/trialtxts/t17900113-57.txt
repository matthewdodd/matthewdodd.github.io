             sworn.
I am a drayman, servant to Sampson Ambrey: I had been delivering some beer, and we missed this rope, while we went to drink; we had pinned it on curiously.

             sworn.
I am a master lighterman. I was at the bottom of Fox's-lane, about six; I saw the prisoner with a rope on his shoulder; I followed him, and felt it was smooth; I stopped him; he said, he had it from the ship Nancy, at Shadwell-dock; I knew there was no such ship there; he said, he was going to carry it to his father; I said, you shall go to my father, making free with the magistrate; and I took him.
(The rope produced and deposed to by Goodman to be the property of Messrs. Ambrey and

I am sure it is a rope belonging to the brewhouse; and the mark of the brew-house I. O. T.

I keep the Barley Mow, on Hanwell Heath, about half past seven on Sunday morning, the 14th of November, the prisoner came in and called for a pint of beer, and said he had found something, between the Old Hats and London, he produced a piece of ribbon out of his pocket, about a dozen or fourteen yards, my maid offered him eighteen pence for it, but I said it was worth more, my wife gave him four shillings for it, and he said he would spend a shilling for the good of the company, and had two glasses of gin, in the mean time this parcel lay on the kitchen dresser, badly wrapped up, I went and opened it, and found it contained ladies gloves, and several pieces of linen, and one pound of Hyson tea, then I sent for the headborough, and took him into custody, then he said he had them from his sister, who lived in Spital-fields, who kept a glovers shop, and told several different stories.
(The things deposed to.)

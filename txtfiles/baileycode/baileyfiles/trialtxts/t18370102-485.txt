MARY CLARKE
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
5th of December, 2 sheets, value 10s.; 3 blankets, value 5s.; and 1 table-cloth, value 15s.; the goods of 



Andrew Coxhead.






HARRIET COXHEAD
. I am the wife of Andrew Coxhead, of Royal-street. The prisoner was servant to my lodger, and lived in the house for about a fortnight—her mistress left my lodgings, and the duplicates of these things were left in the room—I do not know who left them, I found them there—this is my property.





THOMAS ADAMS
. I am servant to Mr. Atcherly, a pawnbroker. I produce this property, which was pawned by the prisoner at different times.

Prisoner's Defence. The Magistrate said he could not commit me, be-cause I did not take the lodgings, but it has been laid to me.





HARRIET COXHEAD

re-examined. The lodger was a young woman, and came to me as a captain's widow—she did not pay any thing—the prisoner was her servant, and came with her—she came an hour after—she was not present when the lodgings were hired—the lodger went away without giving me notice, and left the key under the mat—I found six duplicates on the looking-glass—the prisoner did not go away—she was

left behind, and went away in the evening as the lodger left in the morning.




GUILTY
.* Aged 60.—


Transported for Seven Years.

Before Mr. Recorder

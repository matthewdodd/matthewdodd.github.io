            . I am a broker
; I live in Norris street, St. James's


; I lost the copper on the 19th of January, at five o'clock in the evening. I put it out in the morning on the second step of the door, tied with a rope; as I was sitting in my shop about five o'clock I heard the rattle of the pot, on turning my head to see, it was gone; on my running to the corner of the street, I saw the prisoner with it on his arm; I brought him back and sent for an officer. The rope I fastened the pot to the door was cut.
The property produced and identified.
Prisoner's Defence. When I was coming home from work, a man came by St. James's market and gave me that copper to carry; he said he would give me sixpence; that man went on before a little way when he took me.

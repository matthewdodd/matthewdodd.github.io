            . I live in the Minories


 and keep a sale shop
, on Friday the 16th of Nov. about 3 in the afternoon Mr. Steed called out; 
               
                  Ann 
                  White 
               



            , who looks after the shop, asked what was the matter; he made answer, had not you a hanger in the window? she answered, yes sir, and it is in the window still. I believe, said he, a man has run away with it: upon which I run out, and Mr. Steed and several others went in pursuit. I overtook the prisoner in Rosemary-branch Alley, I took him by the collar and asked him where the hanger was. I saw it in his bosom and took it out, produced in court and deposed to.

            , on the 16th of Nov. about 3 in the afternoon, I met the prisoner at the bar, near the prosecutor's shop, and two other men with him. The prisoner stopped and look'd into the shop, I was about 6 yards off at that time, I saw him take a hanger out of the window and turned at the corner, and there husled it under his coat: he walked along till he overtook one of his companions, then I run to the prosecutor's shop, and call'd, &c. We went after him and took the prisoner with the hanger upon him.

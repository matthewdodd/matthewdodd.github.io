EDWARD GATES, I am a policeman. On the 16th of May, at three o'clock in the morning, I was in Regent-street or Mortimer-street, Caver dish-square—on passing round some new buildings I saw some new places, and saw the prisoner crouch under the pales—I asked him what he was doing—he said he was doing nothing—I saw him with several tools—I got over, and took him—I asked him what made him do it—he said, distress, and nothing else.





STEPHEN RELFE
. I am a carpenter. I was at work at this new house for Mr. Tresser, the builder—I left the tools on the night previous in the drawing-room, which was locked the night before, and I took the key with me—the next morning I found the door forced open, the tools gone, and the rest of my shopmates' tools also—I know some of these tools to be mine—(looking at them.)




GUILTY
. Aged 21.—


Transported for Seven Years.
(There were two other indictments against the prisoner.)

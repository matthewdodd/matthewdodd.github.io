            . I live in Hounsditch


, and keep a publick house.
Q. Have you a husband?
R. Groom. I have; his name is William Groom. The prisoner came into our house on the 5th of November, and call'd for a pennyworth of beer. I gave it into her hand in a pewter pint pot.
Q. Did you see the pot afterwards?
R. Groom. No, I never did. After that a young man came to me, and said, have you lost a pot? I looked, and missed a gallon pewter pot. He said, a woman had taken one. I sent after the prisoner, and she was brought back, and the gallon pot with her, and also another pewter wine measure pint. She had them both in a bag. ( Produced in court.)
Q. Look at these, do you know them?
R. Groom. These are both my property.

            . On the 5th of November I went to the prosecutor's house, to get a pint of beer for my dinner, where sat the prisoner drinking a pennyworth of beer. She sat a considerable while. After she was gone, a shop keeper's lad came from over the way, and said, that woman is gone out with a gallon pot in her lap. Mrs. Groom desired I'd go after her, so I and the maid ran, and found her, and made her come back. She had the pot, and flung it down; so I took it up, and brought it back with her.
Prisoner's Defence.
I know nothing of the pots. I never took them.

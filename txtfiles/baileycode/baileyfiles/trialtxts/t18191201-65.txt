            . I am a hosier and draper
, and live in Ratcliff Highway


. On the 27th of November, about eight o'clock at night, we missed a piece of flannel from about two yards inside the glass, when we were very busy.

            . I am beadle of St. George's. On the 27th of November, about seven o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner with the flannel under his arm. I suspected him, stopped him, and asked him where he bought it? He said at a shop in the Commercial-road - he could not tell me what shop. I took him to the watch-house, and he there said he bought it of a man in the road for 14 s., and said he did not know how many yards there were for he bought it in the lump. I found it belonged to Mr. Minton.

            . I am a widow, and live in Hospital-row, Chelsea


, the prisoner was my servant
, she lived six weeks with me-the things were in a drawer in my bed-room. On the 20th of July, I found eight duplicates concealed between the bed and the sacking. There was no person in the house but her. I redeemed the table-cloth, two sheets, and a shirt, they were pledged at Thompson's. I got an officer, and charged her with the robbery - She begged for mercy.

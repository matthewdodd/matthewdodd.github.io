TERESA PEART. I rent a shop and parlour, in Charlton-street, Somers-town


. The prisoner visited a lodger on the second floor - I had missed goods from time to time: in consequence of which, on Sunday, the 2d of January, I tied a string across my door, inside the shop, to ascertain if any one went in, while I was out; it is an inner-door - I went out at three o'clock, returned before five, and found the string removed, a pair of boots, and four pairs of shoes gone - I had seen the prisoner in the kitchen that afternoon.

            . I am a Bow-street patrol. On Sunday I was desired to watch this house - I placed myself in a house opposite, and saw the prisoner let in about eleven o'clock in the forenoon, by somebody - next morning about nine, I saw him come out, and followed him into a shop in Cromer-street - I went in; he was talking to a woman - I found a pair of women's boots in one of his pockets, and two pairs of shoes in the other, another pair in his hat, and a key in his coat-pocket, which opens Peart's parlour-door, which leads to the shop.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
The prisoner pleaded distress.

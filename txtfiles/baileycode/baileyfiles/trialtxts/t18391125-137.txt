ELIZABETH MARY CORK
. I am single, and live in Jamaica-level, Bermondsey—I keep a stall in Covent-garden. On the 9th of November I had this basket and its contents—I put it under the bench in my stand—I saw it safe between four and five o'clock in the morning—the porter brought it to me again in about half an hour—this property is mine—(looking at it.)





GEORGE CLARKE
. I am a porter at Covent-garden. I was standing in James-street, and saw the prisoner with this basket—I watched him, and saw him hide it behind a stable-door—I took the basket—there was a book in it, with the name of the owner—I left the basket at the public-house, in care of the bar-man—I took the book out, and went to Mrs. Cork's with the prisoner—and while I was at her stand he got behind, and tried to run off—1 pursued, and gave him into custody.

Prisoner. I am not the boy you took it from. Witness Yes, I saw you plain enough.





RICHARD MOORE
. I am an officer. I took the prisoner.

Prisoner's Defence. I was going along, and the witness said, "You are the boy that stole the basket"—he did not see me put it down—he took me to the woman, and then I was going away, and he gave me into custody.




GUILTY
.* Aged 15.—


Transported for Seven Years—Convict Ship. (The prisoner had only been discharged from the House of Correction two days for stealing candlesticks.)

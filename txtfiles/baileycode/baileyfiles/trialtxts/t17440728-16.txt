             . May 19, the Prisoner came into the drying yard, and after she was gone I missed two aprons. I went into the town with the constable, and found her in a place called the Lynch with the linen apron upon her, and the other she said she had hid.

            . Mrs. Mastin came to me, and said, she had lost two aprons, and described the person she thought took them. I heard there was such a person about town, I took her with the apron upon her, and she had hid the other among some grass upon the ground covered; she went directly to the apron herself.
Prisoner. I was walking about there, it is true I did own it at first being frightened. A young woman that was going a little way gave them to me to keep till she came back. I never offered to sell them.

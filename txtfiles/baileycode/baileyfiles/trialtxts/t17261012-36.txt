                  John 
                  Langstone 
               



             thus depos'd. On Sunday Night, I came home to my Master's House in Wood-street about 10 a-clock, and found I was shut out; upon which I took a walk for an Hour or two; at last I set down upon the Bench within two Doors of my Masters, and fell asleep. I awaked about 5 in the Morning, and mist my Hat and Wig.

             thus depos'd. The Prisoner and I going along Wood-street, and seeing Langstone asleep, they consulted to steal his hat and wig. Butler took them both off, and gave the Hat to me, and the wig to Wheeler, who at the time it was taken was gone aside to ease himself. We sold the Hat at Highgate for half a Crown and a full Pot and Wheeler Sold the Wig for Six Shillings to one of the Prisoners in Newgate. A great many appeared to the Reputation of the Prisoners, and gave them the Character of very Sober, honest Boys till the Committing this Fact. The Jury Found them 


               guilty to the value of 10 d each
            .

JAMES TURNER
. I live in Cross-street, Hatton-garden. On Thursday, the 31st of May, at one o'clock in the day, I stopped the prisoner in my massage with the bundle—I desired to examine it, and he ran away—I overtook him with the bundle under his arm, and asked what it was——he said it was dirty linen cravats, and threw it down—I took it up—it ontained two shawls and a scarf, which are mine, and had been in a Irawer in the bed-room on the first floor—I had seen them there ten minutes before.

Prisoner's Defence (through an interpreter.) I went to St. Katharine's Docks to see the large vessel which was about to start for America—I met a Frenchman who had a bundle in his hand—he told me to take it while he went a short distance, and he would return, and we should go and dine. together—I stopped at the prosecutor's house about a quarter of an hour vent into the passage, and the gentleman came and questioned me.

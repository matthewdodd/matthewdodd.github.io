. The Prosecutor and Evidences depos'd, that the Prisoners came to his Shop pretending to buy a Yard of Ribbon; and that being suspected of having taken something, and being told they should be search'd, Judith Smith was seen privately to lay down one Piece, and Alice Haley had four conceal'd under her Riding-Hood. The Fact being plainly prov'd, the Jury found them both 


               guilty to the Value of 10 d. each.

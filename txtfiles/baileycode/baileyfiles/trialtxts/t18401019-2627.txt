for embezzlement.


MR. BALLANTINE
conducted the Prosecution.






ALFRED WILLIAM OTTER
. I am an attorney, in partnership with Mr. Henry Maltby—we live in Old Broad-street—the prisoner was our clerk, and bad been so about four months. On the 17th of October I delivered him a cheque for 200l.—I told him to take it to Bosanquet's to get eight 5l. notes, ten 10l. notes, and I think 60l. in gold—this is the cheque I drew—(looking at it)—he did not return—I never saw him till the Friday morning following, when he was in custody—it was his duty to return and bring the change.





JOHN FRYER
. I am a cashier at Messrs. Bosanquet's, bankers, in Lombard street. I received this cheque of the prisoner on the 17th of October—I had seen him before several times, and knew him—he asked me for 198 sovereigns, two half-sovereigns, and 1l. in silver—I saw there was put down on the back of the cheque "some 10l. and 5l. notes"—I asked him why he wanted it in gold—he said Mr. Outer wanted to pay sums under 5l.—I paid him in gold as he requested.





JOHN STOWELL
. I am constable of the Southampton railway. I received charge of the prisoner on Friday evening last, October the 23rd, about twelve o'clock, in the waiting-room at the railway. I found on him ninety-seven sovereigns in this bag, and three sovereigns and some other money, this gold watch, a brace of pistols loaded, his old-coat, waistcoat, and trowsers, and a variety of new wearing apparel in this carpet bag—he had come up by the last train from Southampton.




GUILTY
. Aged 21.—


Transported for Seven Years.

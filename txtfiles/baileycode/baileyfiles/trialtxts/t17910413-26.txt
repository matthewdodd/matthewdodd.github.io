             sworn.
I live at No. 3, Star-court


; the prisoner lodged with me; I let him the lodgings the last day of February; he lodged there six nights, and then was missing two nights, Friday and Saturday; on Sunday night he came in and lodged again, and told me that he would settle in the morning; in the morning I missed the sheets, in consequence of an information from a fellow-lodger; they were linen sheets.
Did he ever return to his lodgings again? - No: I went to Phoenix-alley, where he had told me he had lodged for four years, and I saw him go by just at the end of the alley, with the sheets in his hand, just at seven o'clock in the morning; I seized him, and he was taken down to Sir Sampson's.
(The sheets produced, and deposed to.)
What trade is he? - He told me he was a painter.

FRANCIS KEYS
. I am an officer of Bow-street. I saw the prisoners together on the 19th of October, by Well-street—I suspected and watched them from street to street—Lilley went into several houses, and came out—they went on to Mrs. Brown's, in Upper Charlton-street—Lilley walked in without any bundle, and, in about five or seven minutes, he came out with this bundle under his arm—he walked down the street—the other stood opposite the prosecutor's door some time—when Lilley came out they went on, and turned a corner—I lost sight of them, and then they turned, and I caught sight of them again, and then Bushell had this bundle—I went up and seized them both—I sent a man back to the house, and he brought the prosecutrix down to the office—I tied the prisoners together, and Bushell said, "I wonder where he is"—I said, "Who do you mean?" he said, "The man that gave it us to hold. "

Lilley. Q. Was I in company with Bushell before I gave him the bundle? A. Yes.





GEORGE PARSONS
. I was spoken to by Keys—I watched the prisoners, and saw Lilley go into Mrs. Brown's house, and Bushell was on the opposite side—when Lilley came out he had this bundle under his arm—Keys pursued and captured them in Cleveland-street.





ELIZABETH BROWN
. I live at No. 8, Upper Charlton-street, and am a widow. This gown is mine, and was taken from my front parlour—the street-door was open—I know nothing of the prisoners.

Lilley's Defence. I was proceeding along Cleveland-street, and met this prisoner, with the bundle under his arm, which he said some man had given him to hold—I took my handkerchief out, and gave it him to wrap round it and then the officer took us.

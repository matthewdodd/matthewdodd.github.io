: on the 25th of May, a soldier quartered with me brought the prisoner to lie with him: he went out in the morning to his exercise, and about ten the prisoner came down stairs, and went out: seeing a strange man, we went up, and miss'd a sheet. I went after him, and stop'd him, and in searching him, found my sheet round his body: then he said he had pawned his coat for his reckoning, where he had been drinking, and he took the sheet to pawn, in order to get his coat.

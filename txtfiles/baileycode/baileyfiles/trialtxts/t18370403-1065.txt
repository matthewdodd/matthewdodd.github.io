ELIJAH BATLEY
. I am an officer of the Customs, and live in Crownplace, Mile-end-road. I was in the Commercial-road on the afternoon of the 21st of March, and felt a twitch behind me—I turned round, and caught the prisoner about a yard from me, in the act of putting my handkerchief into his trowsers pocket—I secured him.

Prisoner. Two boys took it and I ran up to the gentleman, and tapped him on the shoulder. Witness. He did not—I took it out of his pocket—there was only one person passing at the time, and no boys near him.





GEORGE HOGSDEN
 (police-sergeant K 122.) The prisoner was given in my charge by the prosecutor for stealing his handkerchief—he denied it—

but in going to the office he told me he had taken it, and if I would let him go he would never do it again.

Prisoner. It is false—I said I did not do it—it is a thing I was not brought up to—two boys threw it down, I took it up, and said, "Here is your handkerchief"—I only asked him to go to my parents. Witness. He did not, he wished me to go and inform his parents, and When I went to them they disowned him—I did not find them by his directions.




GUILTY
.* Aged 18.—


Transported for Seven Years.

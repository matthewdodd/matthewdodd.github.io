            . I took the prisoner on Saffron-hill, on the Sunday, with these tools on his shoulder - he said they were his own, and he had brought them from Hornsey.
Prisoner's Defence. On the Sunday morning I met a young man, who asked me if I knew any body who wanted to purchase these things - he said he would sell them for 10s., and I bought them.

CHARLES CUNNINGHAM. I am a mercer
, and live in Bernard-street, Russell-square. On the 7th of December, I was in Lothbury


, about five o'clock in the evening, and had a handkerchief in my coat pocket; I felt some one turn up my pocket; I turned round and saw the prisoner very near me: he passed me as I put my hand at my pocket: I examined my hat to see if it was there: - I then went and said to the prisoner, "Have you by chance found my handkerchief?" I saw it in his hand - he said Yes. I said I know where you found it, and detained him.

            . I am a constable. I took him in charge, with the handkerchief - he said he had picked it up, but it was a rainy dirty evening, and the handkerchief was quite clean.
Prisoner's Defence. I saw it laying in a door-way - a gentleman saw me pick it up, but I have not had time to send for him.

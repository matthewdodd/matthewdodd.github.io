            . I live in St. Catharine's. My wife lost a gown and apron; the next day I charged the prisoner with taking them: she acknowledged she had, and had pawned them for 6 s. I asked her what she had done with the money; she said it was spent and d - d. We went as she directed, and got them out; the gown was for 4 s. and apron 2 s. (Produced and deposed to by Anne his wife.)
Prisoner's defence.
I fetched the apron cut, and the prosecutor's wife made a debt of it, and said she would not hurt a hair of my head; she wore the apron some days after.

            . It was not fetched out till this day. She paid me no money, neither did I make it a debt.

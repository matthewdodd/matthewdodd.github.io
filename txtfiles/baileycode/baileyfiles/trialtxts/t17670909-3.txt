; this day se'nnight, between six and seven in the evening, I heard a glass-case move, which stood on the counter; it was not locked; I ran towards it, and saw the prisoner going out of my shop; I was within a yard of him; he ran in at the next door, a public-house; I missed three pair of silk stockings; I was standing by the door, in about two minutes the prisoner was coming out; I laid hold of him, and charged him with stealing my stockings; I went into the public-house, the Star and Garter, and asked if that man had left any thing; they said he had been backward to the necessary; we went and looked down the vault, and there were my stockings, (produced and deposed to.)

            . The prisoner came to our house, the Star and Garter, and asked for one Johnson; we knew no such person; then he went backwards to the vault, and soon came back, and went out; after which, the prosecutor came; we went and found these stockings there.
Prisoner's defence.
I went there to ask for an acquaintance, and went to the vault, but know nothing of the stockings. I am a journeyman gun-stock-maker

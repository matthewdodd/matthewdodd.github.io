            . I am a bootmaker
. On the 4th of August, I lost my handkerchief. I was in the Strand


. I was returning from the park about eight o'clock in the evening. I felt an unusual pressure behind me; it induced me to turn round. I saw then the prisoner was behind me with my handkerchief in his hand. I accused him of picking my pocket; he said he had not; he picked it up, and was going to give it me. I told him I was not satisfied. He said he was well known in the neighbourhood; I said, where? he said, the landlord of the Swan Public-house knew him. I went with him; the landlord said he had seen him, he did not know anything about him. I took him before the magistrate. This is my handkerchief that I lost from my pocket; the prisoner gave it me.

            . I took the prisoner into custody at the Swan public-house. I searched him, and found two handkerchiefs upon him, one in his hat and one in his breeches.

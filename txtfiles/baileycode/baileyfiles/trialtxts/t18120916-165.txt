Q. What was the prisoner - A. I know nothing of her. I lost my shirts on the 10th of September; they were in my front parlour wrapped up in a cloth, on a chair. I missed them about three o'clock in the afternoon. I desired my lodger to go to Mr. Bannister the pawnbroker; she went and found one of them. I lost four shirts.

            . I was a-bed and asleep when Mrs. Longhurst came into my place; my sister's little girl came up and awoke me. The shirts were left in my place when I was asleep; that is all I know.
MR. BANNISTER. I had information that four shirts were lost from Ratcliffe-square. The prisoner came and offered one to pledge; that is all I know; and the other three were found at Mrs. Rapp's house.

            . The prisoner was brought to me by Mr. Bannister. The prisoner told me the other shirts were at Mrs. Rapp's; I went and found them there.
Q. to Mrs. Rapp. You say these shirts were brought to you by the prisoner - A. They were. She appeared to take one from, as if to pawn it.
Prisoner's Defence. This woman asked me to pawn this shirt. I have known her for years. I said, Mrs. Rapp, is it your own; she said, what do you ask for; do you think I stole it.
Prosecutrix. Mrs. Longhurst has lived with an inmate of mine formerly.

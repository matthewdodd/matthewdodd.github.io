Prisoner. This woman sent for me to move her goods, I came to her, she sent me first to a broker woman, in Little George-street, and that broker and she could not agree, and then she sent for Mr. Clarke, and he and her did agree; and he asked me to help him away with the goods, says she, I must have all the things out of my house immediately, because my house is indicted as a disorderly house, and I went and helped Mr. Clarke, and she said likewise that the house was over big of rent for her; she left these other things for me to take away, and she would have me to take them to any place I pleased.
Court to Prosecutor. Did you deliver him any goods that Clarke had bought of you? - Yes, but he was discharged by four o'clock in the afternoon; his landlord found the first sheet between his bed and sacking;

Woodward. About half after nine last Thursday this woman came to me, and asked me if Clarke lived along with me? I did not know him by the name of Clarke, but I said, if she had lost any thing I would break open the door; I searched the premises, and I found nothing then; while we were talking at the end of the lane about this sheet, the prisoner at the bar comes along with the box in his arms, says she, that is my box; says I, how hashe got that box, says she I cannot tell, for I have got the key in my pocket, she said there were seven stockings in it, and a sheet, &c. after this I went to see if my own things were safe, and I turned up the bed, and between the sacking and tick, I found the first sheet, that I have produced, and I have had them in my custody ever since.

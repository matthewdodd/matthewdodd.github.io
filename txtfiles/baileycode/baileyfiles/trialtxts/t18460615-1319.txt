GEORGE JONES, alias
 George Wiscox

, was indicted

for stealing 5 spoons, value 7s. 6d.; 1 mustard-pot, 2l. 10s.; 1 milk-pot, 2l.; and 1 pepper-castor top, 2s. 6d.; the goods of 



Harriet Dowling, in her dwelling-house, at 
St. George's, Hanover-square; and that he had been previously convicted of felony.






WILLIAM HBNRY DOWLING
. I live with my mother, Harriet Dowling, at Stafford-row, Buckingham-gate—it is her dwelling-house. These articles produced are hers, and are worth 5l.—I saw the mustard-pot on the suppertable, and two of the salt spoons, the salt-cellar, and the mustard-spoon, about eleven o'clock the evening before they were lost—the other things would be placed upon the breakfast table.





BENJAMIN BYRNE
 (police-constable B 160.) On the 17th of June, about eight o'clock in the morning, I was on duty in Stafford-row, Pimlico, and saw the prisoner on the sill of the parlour window of Mrs. Dowlings house—I saw him step from the sill on to the top of the railing, and then jump on to the stones, and run off—I pursued him—he ran against a milkman, who stopped him—I searched him, and in the side of the skirt of his coat I found this milk-jug, and the top of the pepper-castor—I took him to the station.

Prisoner. Q. If you saw me get out of the window, why not take me? A. I was not near enough to you.

Prisoner's Defence. A young gentleman gave me the mug, and told me to make haste and run away; he ran into Elliot's brewery.





SAMUEL POMMBLL
. I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, at Clerkenwell—(read—Convicted 5th July, 1845; and confined six months)—I was present at the trial—he is the person.

            . I am a furrier
, and live in Wilderness-row, Goswell-street. On the 27th of June, about a quarter to nine o'clock in the morning, I went out, leaving this watch and appendages hanging on a nail - I returned at ten, and it was gone; I had left Charles Wells in the house - he was convicted last Session of the robbery; after his conviction he gave me information, and I went to the prisoner's house in Field-lane; I saw him and said, "Are you a pieman?" he said Yes; I said, "Are you the man who bought a gold watch and two gold seals?" he said,"No, I am a poor man; how could I buy such property? I have not 3s. in my pocket" - I said, "If you are the man, to avoid the trouble of prosecution I would rather give you the money which you gave for the watch;" he said he knew nothing of it; I went home, and in about two days I saw him again in Holborn -

                  Wells
               



            , my servant's brother, was with me, and in consequence of what he said, I said to the prisoner, "Will you tell me were the watch is? or I'll call an officer;" he said he knew nothing of it - I again said if he did not tell me I would have him taken up - he said, "Well, come home with me, and I will speak with you;" I did not go with him, for there was a row in the street - the people began to push me about; I called an officer, and gave him in charge - I have never seen the watch in his possession,
Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. I believe he was takenbefore Alderman Scholey? A. He was taken before an Alderman; he was bailed - I do not know that he was discharged; he came forward voluntarily a fortnight afterwards, when he was told - he was only out of custody once- the Magistrate offered to bail him.

            . I shall be fourteen years old at Christmas. I knew Charles Wells, (who was convicted here) when in Mr. Toth's service; I saw him on Monday morning, the 7th of June, between nine and ten o'clock; he came to my mother's, in St. John's-square-passage, about five minutes' walk from Toth's - he asked me to sell a gold watch for him; I saw it - it had two seals, a key, a guard, a ring, and a green ribbon to it; he carried them in his own pocket - he showed them to me when he came into Benjamin-street; I went with him to Field-lane, and saw the prisoner at his lodgings there - I knew him before; he got his living by buying stolen property, but sold pies up and down Holborn - I took Wells there, and asked the prisoner to buy a gold watch; he asked us to let him see it - Wells showed it to him; he said he did not think it was gold, but he would go and see if it was - he took the watch with him; I followed him to the shop of Mr. Reeves, a pawnbroker - he was asked 3l. for it before he took it there; Wells had said he would ask 2l. - I said, "Don't ask 2l., ask 3l.;" I believed it was gold from what Wells said - I saw the prisoner go into Reeves'; Wells was with me - neither of us went in; he came out and met us at the top of old Fleet-market, gave us 1s., and asked if we were not going to stand something to drink; I never saw the watch after it went into his hands - we went to the first public-house on the righthand side of old Fleet-market from Holborn, and had a quartern of liquor, and a 2d. cake, which came to 6d. - Wells paid for it out of the shilling; the prisoner then went away - Wells and I called in about two hours; he was at home, and gave Wells 8s. 6d. - we asked if he could not give us some more; he said nothing to that, and we came away - we both called again in the evening, and he gave 30s. into Wells' hand; I called alone two days after, and told him that 
               
                  Charles 
                  Wells
               



             was caught - he said, "Never mind, he is sure to get off;" I asked if he could not give me something to take to Wells, and he gave me 7s. 6d. - we went up to where his stall stood, and I tossed him for pies; I won twelve pies for 8d., and then I stood a pint of ale in Fetter-lane - that took 1s. out of the 7s. 6d.; I bought some more things, and took them to Wells - I did not see the prisoner again.
Q. When did you first tell any body of this? was it before or after Wells was tried? A. After Wells told of the prisoner, and I told Sir Peter Laurie at Guildhall - it was about eleven weeks after he bought the watch; I had been taken up then.
Cross-examined. Q. Wells was an acquaintance of yours? A. Yes - I had known him about three years; I have made no agreement with Wells' mother about what I was to say here - I have seen her several times since; I have been in custody, but had no conversation about what I was to say - I told Sir 
               
                  Peter 
                  Laurie
               



             the same, the whole of it; I took Wells in about 6s. worth of things - I kept 1s. 6d. of the money; I did not steal it - I have come from my mother's to-day; I was in the House of Correction for a month; I was never there before, nor in this Court - I was in custody twice; I was eight weeks at Clerkenwell - I have not been in any other place, nor in custody more than twice, except when I was taken up about Wells, but was not in prison; I was never taken into custody for picking pockets - I am to have nothing if the prisoner is convicted; I do not expect to be tried myself if he is not convicted - Wells told of me being one of the party who disposed of the watch; I was in the House of Correction at that time - it was about a fortnight after Wells was convicted; Wells said the prisoner was the person, and I said so too; I did not give information about it till I was accused - I do not know whether the prisoner had the watch in his hand when he went to Reeves; I did not see him take it out of the house, nor did I see him with it at the pawnbroker's - I did not hear Sir 
               
                  Peter 
                  Laurie
               



             say he would not believe a word I said; he offered to bail the prisoner - I went to the prisoner's house about a quarter of an hour after Wells came to me; Wells stopped and looked at it in Benjamin-street, and I saw what was attached to it - one seal was a white stone, and the other a red one; I told the Magistrate so; I do not recollect the colour of the guard.

            . I am shopman to Mr. Reeve. On the 7th of June the prisoner came to our shop alone - I think it was between two and three o'clock in the afternoon; he came with a gold seal and gold ring, and asked 15s. on them, which I lent him - he pawned them in the name of 
               
                  John 
                  Britton
               



            , Field lane; I have known him six years - on the 8th of June 
               
                  James 
                  Lock
               



             came to look at the seal; he paid the interest on it - I gave him a fresh duplicate; he produced the first one to me - I never saw the prisoner afterwards; on the 11th of June Lock pawned another seal for 12s., and redeemed them both the same day.
Cross-examined. Q. For what was the interest paid? A. One day - I am sure of that; Reeves has another shopman - I cannot state what kind of seals they were.


                  JAMES 
                  LOCK
               



            . I am a waiter at Mr. Low's wine-vaults, Holborn-hill. I have known the prisoner about three years - he offered to sell me the duplicate of a seal and ring for 3s., in pledge at Reeves; I bought it, and took the duplicate to Reeves'; they were shown to me by Ivey- I paid 4d. interest, and had a duplicate in my own name; a few days after, the prisoner brought me another gold seal - I gave him 18s. for it, and pawned it at Reeves' for 12s.; I redeemed them the same day, and delivered them back to the prisoner - he gave me the same for them as I had paid him; he lived in Field-lane - I have not seen them since; I cannot recollect what sort of seals they were - I asked how he came by them; he said he had found them, but did not say where - I saw him several times afterwards, but had no conversation about them; after he had been taken I asked him if there was any fear of my being taken, as I had bought the seals of him - he said No, I had no occasion to come forward to say any thing, for he should appear when his time was up, and he had no doubt he should get through it.
Cross-examined. Q. You cannot state on what day you received them from him? A. No, whether it was June or July exactly; I once pawned my watch atReeves' before, but nothing else; that had common seals to it, not worth 6d. each.
Q. The prisoner said he should get through it - did he not also say he was innocent? A. He did.
COURT. Q. Did he tell you what charge had been made against him? A. Yes, buying a gold watch and seals.

            . I am a journeyman dyer, and live at No. 131, St. John-street. I only know the prisoner by going to him about the watch which my brother had stolen; I went to him when my brother was in Newgate for stealing the watch, after he had been tried - I did not see the prisoner at all; my mother went to him - I was not present; I never heard him say any thing about the watch- I was examined before Sir Peter Laurie, and signed my name to the deposition; I did not take notice whether it was read over to me - I was sworn, and gave an account of what I knew; I never saw the prisoner, or heard him say any thing about it.


                  BENJAMIN 
                  CADMAN
               



            . I am an officer. I apprehended the prisoner on a Sunday afternoon in August - the prosecutor was with me; he was told he had received a watch and appendages - he denied it; he was liberated on his own recognizances - he appeared according to promise, and at the last hearing Sir Peter Laurie desired me to see if I could find any of the property; I went to the pawnbroker's, and found these seals had been pawned.
Cross-examined. Q. What time in August did you take him? A. I think it was on the 3rd; I believe he was allowed a day or two to see if he could find bail.

            . Q. I believe you offered this man 6l. to find the watch, and said you would take no proceedings? A. No, I offered him 3l. - he said he knew nothing about it.

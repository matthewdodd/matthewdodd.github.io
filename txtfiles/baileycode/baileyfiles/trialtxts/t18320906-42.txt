            . I am a blacking manufacturer
, and live in Aldermanbury. On the 25th of July I was near Windmill-street


, and felt somebody at my pocket - I turned on my heels, felt my pocket, and missed my silver snuff-box; I saw a boy running, about a hundred yards off - I afterwards saw a boy, who I suspected was the same; I walked after him - when I got near to him he ran, and I pursued - he threw my box into a shop; a friend, who was with me, took him - he was the prisoner.

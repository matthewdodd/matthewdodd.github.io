HENRY THORN
. I was a publican at the time in question—on 14th April, about twenty minutes to twelve o'clock, I was walking in Whitechapel road with my wife—she stepped back three or four yards to look at some thing in a window—I turned to see if she was coming, and saw the prisoner in the act of putting my handkerchief into his breeches-pocket—it had been in my right hand coat-pocket—I laid hold of him, and took it out of him pocket—he asked for forgiveness—my wife asked him what he did it for—he said because he wanted bread, and that it was the first time he had been guilty of such a thing.

Prisoner's Defence. I am very sorry for it.

            . I was coming up Cheapside


 on the 22d of April, a coachman jumped off his box and informed me I was robbed of my handkerchief, and told me, the prisoner who was before me, had it in a blue apron that was tied before him; the prisoner ran down Gutter-lane, I followed him, he was never out of my sight, I caught him; he took the handkerchief out; I saw it in his hand; it was afterwards found in a cellar within two doors of where I took him; I did not see him throw it down.
The handkerchief produced in court and deposed to by the prosecutor.
Wm Bowen. I am a coachman, I was sitting on my box in the afternoon, opposite the Half Moon Tavern, Cheapside: I saw the prisoner take the handkerchief out of the prosecutor's pocket; I jumped down and informed the prosecutor of it; I did not go to see what became of him.
Wm Roberts. I live in Gutter-lane, I found the handkerchief down my cellar window.
Prisoner's Defence.
I was going up Cheapside just by this gentleman, I heard a cry of Stop Thief, I ran as others might, they happened to lay hold of me and searched me, but found nothing upon me.

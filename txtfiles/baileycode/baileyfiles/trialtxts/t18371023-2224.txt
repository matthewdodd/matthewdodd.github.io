FREDERICK CHILDS HANCOCK
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
29th of November, 1 watch, value 20s., the goods of 



Edward Watson, his master.






EDWARD WATSON
. I am a watch-maker, and live in King-street The prisoner was in my service as a watch repairer and finisher—he left on the 11th of February—I bad missed considerable property—I have advertised him, bat could not find him—I missed this silver watch—it is mine—the prisoner was in my service at the time it was taken.

Prisoner. That watch I considered that you gave me, and I was in the habit of wearing it. Witness. It is false.

Prisoner. Q. Did pot you, some time after, ask me about it, and I told you I had left it in the country? A. No, you did not—I may have lent you the watch to regulate some clocks by, but never gave it you, I am certain.





JAMES HITCHCOCK
. I am shopman to Mr. Townsend, of Little Russell-street, a pawnbroker. This watch was pledged on the 29th of November last, to the best of my belief, by the prisoner, in the name of John Hancock, for 22s.





HENRY JEBBIT
 (City police-constable I.) I brought the prisoner from Burton-on-Trent on Monday—he went by the name of Roberts there





CHARLES WILLIAMSON
. I am foreman to Mr. Watson. I am certain this was not given to the prisoner—I was in the shop when it was sent by the prisoner to Mr. Bugden's to regulate the clock, on the 24th of October—it is entered.




GUILTY
. Aged 33.—


Transported for Seven Years.

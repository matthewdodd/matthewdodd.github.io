            . I am a waiter. I was going up stairs, and saw the prisoner leave the passage of the upper rooms with a large bundle in her apron, and another in her hand; I followed her out of the house to the corner of Park-place, then stopped and asked her what she had been doing in the house? she said she had been to get some washing from Mr. Charles. I said,
"You have got a blanket and counterpane, where did you get them?" she said from the top of the street, and she was going to take them to be washed. I brought her back.

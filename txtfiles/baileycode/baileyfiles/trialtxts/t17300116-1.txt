             thus depos'd, I was in my own House on the 9th of December, my Wife was at the Door, and seeing the Prisoner loitering about, called me, and I saw the Prisoner get upon the Groove of the Shutters, and take something; I pursued the Prisoner, saw him drop something, seized him, and bid him take up what he had drop'd, but he would not take it up.

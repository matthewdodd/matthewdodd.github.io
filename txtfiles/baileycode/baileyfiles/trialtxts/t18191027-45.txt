            . I live in Birchin-lane. On the 13th of October, about a quarter before twelve o'clock at noon, I was in Coleman-street


, walking very fast. I came to a crowd before a picture shop, which resisted my progress; I fell, and a person came close against me - my attention was directed to him, and I saw my handkerchief pass from him. I saw the prisoner attempting to conceal it behind him, and saw it drop from him. I immediately seized him, and he said it was not him - I saw another boy near him. I took him to Guildhall myself; he persisted in his innocence till he got halfway to Guildhall, then began crying, and said I had no business to take him. He was very insolent indeed.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

            . I took the prisoner in charge.
Prisoner's Defence. Two boys were behind him, who took the handkerchief from his pocket. It passed me, and he collared me.

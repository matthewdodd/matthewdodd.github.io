            . I live in Water Lane, Fleet-street


; Mrs. Chatham is my partner; we keep a chandler's shop

; I lost the watch, on the 27th of May, out of the kitchen; the watch belonged to us both; I did not miss it till eleven at night; it hung in the kitchen upon a hook; there was no other person in the kitchen from half past six till nine. 
               
                  Ann
                   Lawson
               



             was our servant; 
               
                  Sarah
                   Hirst
               



             came to see her; she came in at half past six, and staid to drink tea with my servant; she was there till after seven o'clock. 
               
                  Sarah
                   Hirst
               



             pawned the watch to Mr. Davison the same evening; I found it the 29th of last month; he lives in Fleet-street. I saw the watch at half past six; Lawson said she took the watch from a hook and laid it down for Hirst to take away; when I missed the watch my partner was out; she brought some friends to sup with her; I went to wind the watches up at eleven o'clock; I missed it; I asked the maid about it; my partner said she had not had it; I told her I had a suspicion that it was the young woman that had been to see her; she said if the watch was gone it must be in de good. I told her I would go with her the next morning to 
               
                  Sarah
                   Hirst
               



            ; we went with one of our friends and she was gone out. She then came to our house about eleven o'clock; when they came I was in the kitchen; I told her this was an affair that happened the last night. I accused her with it; she denied it for an hour and a half; we got her into Guildhall; she confessed it of her own accord, and that she had pawned it for a guinea. At Guildhall, Lawson owned she gave her the watch, and she was to give her some cloaths for the money.
Q. Was you and Mrs. Chatham partners in this watch?
Wilkins. Yes.
Q. Who bought the watch?
Wilkins. Mrs. Chatham bought the watch.
Q. How came it to be between you?
Wilkins. When we became partners every thing came in with it.

            . Mrs. Chatham and I, with my wife, had been at Peckham; we went to Mrs. Chatham's to supper; when we came home the girl came and asked if we had not played the rogue with a silver watch that was in their kitchen; I was going in the morning to enquire about it; they said there had been a young woman to see the girl; we went to Carnaby Market to see for this young woman; she was gone over the water to see for her husband; we went in to the Borought she was there; she pleaded innocent; she declared she never saw the watch while she was there; she came to Mrs. Chatham's, where we sent for the watch-maker; she denied it; she asked what made me suspect her more than our girl; we charged a constable with her, and she owned at Guild-hall the pawning of the watch. Lawson said Hirst asked her what she had for her to pawn; as she wanted something she laid down the watch on the drawers and told me to take that.

            . I am a pawnbroker in Fleet-street; (the watch produced.) I received this watch on the 27th of May, for a guinea, of 
               
                  Sarah
                   Hirst
               



            ; it was about eight o'clock; she said it was her husband's watch; that she lived in Water-lane. I asked her if one 
               
                  William
                   Hirst
               



            , in Water-lane, was her husband, who was a customer of mine; she said he was.

            . On the 28th of May Mrs. Chatham came and told me she had lost the watch; I gave her an account of the same and number; in about an hour and she sent for me, and had got the person that had the watch; when I talked to them a while none of them would confess; I went into another room with Hirst and she said 
               
                  Ann
                   Lawson
               



             had given it her. I told Mrs. Chatham that I thought they were both concerned; at last she confessed she took the watch from the hook and laid it down, and 
               
                  Sarah
                   Hirst
               



             took it with her; we then desired her to confess and tell us where the watch was, that it might be replaced; she would not tell till we got to Guildhall.
Lawson's Defence.
I lived fellow servant
 with her husband; I knew Mrs. Hirst by her coming backwards and forwards. I asked her to let me leave my box in her room, and she let me; I got a place in Water-lane. I did not send for my box for above a week; two or three days after she called to see me; when I sent for my box she came to see if I had got my cloaths; I was drinking tea; I asked her to drink some with me; if she took it, it must be while I was out of the shop. I know nothing of it. When we were in Wood-street Compter she changed a guinea; but where it came from I know not.

            . She lived with me better than a year and an half; she behaved always very well; I never knew any thing but that she was an honest good servant; she went from me about the middle of March last.

            's Defence.
I leave it to my counsel.
For Hirst's character.

            . I live in the Old Change. I have known Mrs. Hirst from her birth: her husband is a hackney coachman; she did live in Compton-street, Soho; I never heard any thing amiss of her character before this affair; we were next door neighbours in Oxfordshire. I saw her in London last summer.

            . I live in Crucifix-lane. I have known her eighteen years. I knew her in the country. I have known nothing of her these last four years.

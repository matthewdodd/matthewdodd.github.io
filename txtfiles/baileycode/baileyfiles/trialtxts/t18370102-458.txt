ANN FRANCIS
. I am the daughter of George Francis, a baker in Cleve Imi-street, Fitzroy-square. About eight o'clock in the evening of the 4th of January I was in the parlour, and heard a noise in the shop—I ran out—the prisoner was behind the counter—the till was drawn out and on the floor—he was then taking the money out—1s. 6d. in silver and some half-pence were gone—I sent for a policeman.





HENRY COLEMAN
. I was there talking to Ann Francis—I ran into the shop, and found the prisoner with 1s. 6d. in his hand and one penny—he threw it on the pavement, and it bounced into the road—I brought tin back into the shop, and sent for an officer.

CHARLOTTE MANTIN
. I am the wife of John Mantin, a pork-butcher, in Great Suffolk-street, Borough. The prisoner was my servant for four-teen days—on the 7th of November I missed a half-crown from a drawer in my bed-room—there was one more half-crown, a sovereign, and some shillings there—on the Saturday after, I went to the prisoner's mother, and stated the case—her mother came home with me, and asked her if she had a pocket—she said yes—her mother took up her clothes, and said she had some money in it—there were two shillings found in it—the prisoner then said she found it in the bed-room—I said, "You must have taken the half-crown from the drawer"—she said she had not—her mother went, and fetched the policeman, and at last she said she took it from the drawer.





JEMIMA TOMLINSON
. I am the mother of the prisoner. My husband is a wheelwright—what has been stated is true.




GUILTY
. Aged 13.—


Transported for Seven Years.

GEORGE PETER PHILLIPS. I was in Little Bath-street


 on the 22d of March, about three o'clock, I was passing a shop where some persons were collected; I felt something at my pocket; I turned round, and saw the prisoner within two or three feet of me - a person asked if I had lost any thing - I said, Yes, my handkerchief; I turned to look for him, but he had got round the corner - he was pursued and taken. The officer gave me the handkerchief.

            . I am a constable. I was coming up Coppice-row, and heard the cry of Stop thief! I looked round, and saw the prisoner throw the handkerchief away - he was then about thirty yards from me, and two young men were following him; I picked it up - he was brought back to me.(Property produced and sworn to.)

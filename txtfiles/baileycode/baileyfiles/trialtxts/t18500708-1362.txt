JOHN BENSON MARTIN
. I am a lighterman. On the Saturday morning I was in the Borough-market—some one spoke to me, and I missed my handkerchief, which was safe two or three minutes before—the prisoner was pointed out to me, and I gave him into custody.





HENRY COOPER
. I am employed in the market. I saw the prisoner put his hand into Mr. Martin's pocket, take something out like a handkerchief, and put it into his breast, and run away—I pointed him out, and afterwards saw him in custody—I am quite sure he is the same boy—I knew him before by sight.





ALFRED AYLETT

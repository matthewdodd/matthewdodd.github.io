JOSEPH SKINNER. I am a carpenter
. I lost my plane, but did not miss it till a person came and asked if Mr. Wicks worked there; I said, No - they then produced the plane, and I knew it to be mine: it had been in my workshop, in Frederick-place, Hampstead-road - I knew the prisoner, but he did not work there; he has assisted the men, but I suspected him, and gave the men orders not to admit him - I have lost many tools.
WILLIAM HOLT. On the 21st of November, at a quarter past five o'clock I met the prisoner in the street; I asked what he had got, he said a plane which he was going to pawn - I asked what he was to have for it; he said 2s., and it was his father's.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

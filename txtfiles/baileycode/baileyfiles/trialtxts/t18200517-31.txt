            . I am servant to the Hon.

                  Bosville
               



            . On the 16th of April I was going down Welbeck-street


 on the General's carriage with four horses; Mr. Hall's trunk and my master's portmanteau were behind the carriage - Mr. Hall's trunk was covered with canvas. We passed through the end of Marylebone-street, and saw three men running behind the carriage - I really think the prisoners are two of the men; they are the same in appearance. We got to Welbeck-street about eight o'clock, the trunk and portmanteau were then stolen. We had come from Waltham-cross.

            . I live with Lady Lambert, in Manchester-square. On the 16th of April, about eight o'clock, or a little after, I was in Welbeck-street, and saw a carriage and four horses drive along, two persons were on the box. I observed two men going along behind, and in an instant I saw a man go away with a portmanteau, and another followed with a trunk - one of them was covered, I think it was the largest; the men rested them on the steps of a door for a moment. A man passed me - I said,
"Those men have cut these trunks from behind that carriage;" he said it was not the trunks but that it was a coat. He ran over to them directly, and all three went together from the door along Welbeck-street, turned round the corner of Great Marylebone-street, and while I was speaking to two coachmen at the stand, the man I spoke to before came and abused me; he said,
"D - n your eyes! who are you, and what do you want?" - he went away directly, and I mentioned it to the landlord of the public-house, and in consequence of what was said to me, I looked at a coach and saw the coachman was on the box with the man who had abused me. The prisoners have every appearance of being the men who cut the trunks away.
Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Was the carriage going fast - A. At a middling rate. I followed the men, and lost sight of the carriage.

            . I drive the coach No. 690. On the 16th of April, about eight o'clock in the evening, my coach was fourth on the stand in Marylebone-street. I had just got out of the house, and before I got to the horses' heads, two trunks or portmanteaus were thrown into my coach - I found three men putting them in as I came out - they were both covered with white cloth. The prisoners are the men I am sure. One of them told me to drive to the corner of Hopkins-street, Carnaby-market - one of the prisoners got behind the coach, another inside, and the other on the box with me, who took the reins out of my hand. They hurried me along, and would not let me wait for my great-coat. I drove by the end of Marylebone-street to the corner of Hopkins-street, Broad-street. Smith gave me 5 s., he was inside - he said,
"D - n you, if you tell it shall be worse for you!"
Q. Did they ask your fare - A. No, the fare was 18 d. The trunks were taken out of the coach almost before I could get off the box; they went up Hopkins-street with them. I am sure the prisoners are two of the men.
Cross-examined. Q. How long have you drove the coach - A. Four years. I was never charged with any offence - I was put in the watch-house about this. I have seen Bohan in the street before, driving for his father. The man drove all the way.

             re-examined. Q. Did you see them take the coach - A. Yes, it was near the top - there were twelve or more on the stand.

            . I am an officer of Bow-street. On the 19th of April I searched Smith's lodgings, which was on the second floor of No. 53, Charles-street, Drury-lane. I found him in bed with a woman of the town. I found this neckcloth in a trunk in the room - the woman said it was the skirt of her child's frock and that she had the body. There is a mark on it, part of which is picked out. I apprehended Boham the same morning.
Cross-examined. Q. No person claimed the trunk - A. No, I knew it to be Smith's, as I had seen it before at his former lodgings.

            , ESQ. I was travelling on the day in question with General 
               Bosville
            , my trunk was behind the carriage, covered with canvas - there were some neckcloths in it - the one produced is mine, I have no doubt of it; it is marked in the middle with the number I have of the kind, 1 H 6, which appears to be the number picked out here. I have another in my pocket, I compare them - they appear of the same quality and size, and are marked with red silk. I had a great deal of wearing apparel and papers of consequence in my trunk. I saw the trunk safe when we were at Portland-place, and hit a man off the carriage. We went to No. 76, Welbeck-street.

            . I was travelling in the coach. There was a quantity of old plate and books in my portmanteau.

             re-examined. The portmanteau was heavy, but a man might carry it. There were fifty or sixty ounces of plate in it.
SMITH'S Defence. The coachman said they were both covered with canvas.
BOHAM'S Defence. I could not carry the trunks.

             re-examined. Q. Did you see Boham with both trunks - A. No, I said all three helped them in. I know one was covered with canvas. They were both thrown in before I got up. They put the trunks in on the off-side.

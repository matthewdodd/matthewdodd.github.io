                  BARRATT
               



            . On the 7th of June, about ten minutes before ten o'clock at night, I was coming down Liquorpond-street


; there were three young men in company before me; one of them came alongside of me and shoved me on the curb, and the prisoner came up and snatched my watch, and ran away. I ran down Crown-court after him, through Sparrow's-rents, into Portpool-lane. He cried Stop thief! he stopped, turned round, and came towards me - I caught hold of him; he said,
"It is not me, Sir." I am positive of him; he threw my watch away; he had three or four companions.

            . I live in Liquorpond-street. I saw the prisoner rob Mr. Barratt, and am sure he is the boy.

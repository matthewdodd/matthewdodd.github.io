             sworn.
Here are three pieces of callico I found under the prisoner's coat, at a fire that happened at Mr. Gillibrand's on Ludgate-hill, on the 7th of May; the prisoner and another man offered to assist at the fire, and were very handy in helping move people's goods, and appeared to be very assiduous; when we had done at Mr. Gillebrand's, he went to Mr. Shuttleworth's; I saw him with a box, he said, here are some loose papers, I may as well put them in the box; he did so, and upon stooping to put the papers in the box, I saw the callico buttoned up under his coat; instead of taking the box where he had taken the other things, he went up Ave Maria-lane; there I pursued him and took him.

             sworn.
I asked him if he had any thing more; he said, no, he had not; upon searching him, I found a waistcoat in his breeches, and a neck handkerchief in his pocket, and a hat upon his head over his own hat.
(The things produced: the hat deposed to.)



               GUILTY

To be 


               transported for seven years
            .
The prisoner called two witnesses to his character.
Tried by the London Jury before Mr. RECORDER.

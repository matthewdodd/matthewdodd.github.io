EDWARD WILLIAMS,
 I live with Evan Thomas, a linen-draper, in Pickett-street, Strand—on the 22d of May, the prisoner and another man came together—to look at some black silk handkerchief—one of then bought one—the prisoner took a lace veil from the counter, and put it into his flap—I said nothing then, but put the handkerchief up—I got paid for it, and they went out—I want after them—the prisoner ran and fell down—I caught him before he fell down—he took part of the veil out—I took it from him—I had not time to speak to him before he got out of the shop.

Prisoner. When he ran alter me, I had not the veil on me—he was running after the other boy—I fell down—he took me back to the shop, and he had the veil back, but I had not it. Witness. Yes; he had it on him when I took him.





RICHARD GABB
 (police-constable, F 75.) I was on duty in Pickett-street—I took the prisoner and the veil.

            . I live with my father who is a muffin-baker, in Hanway-street


. On the 6th of June my father told me something, and I went to the door, and saw the two prisoners following a gentleman; Reason took a handkerchief out of his pocket at the corner of the street, and put it into his bosom - they were close together at the time it was taken, and went away together; I told my father, who followed them on to St. Giles'-church - but before he got to them, Reason gave it to the other; I did not know the gentleman.

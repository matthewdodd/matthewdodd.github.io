             I saw the prisoner go out of the prosecutor's house last wednesday, with the trunk in her apron; I saw one end of it, I was then in my room facing the prosecutor's house; I knew her by sight; we enquir'd of a lodger of mine, who knew her, who directed us to her lodgings; we went and found the things; the prisoner said, a woman gave her them in Drury Lane.
Prisoner's Defence. A woman ask'd me to let the things be in my room, which I did; these people came and tax'd me about them, I told them they need not break open my room, for the things were there.

THOMAS CHARLES LEONARD. I am a tobacconist
, and live in Church-street, Bethnal-green


. I lost this till on the 13th of April - I was not at home at the time.

            . I am a cordwainer, and live in Bethnal-green. I saw the prisoner, whom I knew perfectly well, go down the street, in company with another man - he had this till in his hand; I went in, and put my boots on, and when I came out again I saw him put it down; I pursued him, and saw him throw some silver and copper away: I seized him, and gave him to Glover. I then pursued the other, but did not catch him.

            . I was with Gibbs and saw the prisoner pursued; he threw some copper and silver out of his apron as he ran; I picked up some of it, and put it into my hat, but some persons kicked it over afterwards.

            . I am servant to Mr. Leonard. On the 13th of April I went into the parlour, which joins the shop - the till was then in its place, with 8 s. or 9 s. in copper and silver in it; when I went into the shop again it was gone: it was brought in by Gibbs the same evening.

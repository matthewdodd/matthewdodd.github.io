            . On Saturday the 25th of February, between seven and eight o'clock in the morning. I came home and went into my room; I found my box open, it seemed as if it had been picked open; I did not miss my coat then, I missed it the next day when I went to clean myself.
Q. When you found your box open why did not you examine it - A. I had no suspicion then. On Monday I saw the coat at Hatton-garden office.
Q. Did the prisoner lodge in the same room - A. Yes.

            . Q. You keep the Coach and Horses, Hatton-garden - A. Yes. On Saturday evening the 25th of February, between six and seven o'clock, Davis came down stairs with a bundle in his hand. On Sunday morning Kirk went up stairs to clean himself; he returned upon the stairs again and said he missed the coat; he told my mistress; I got an officer.

                  RAMSEY
               



            . I live with Mr. Page, pawnbroker, Liquorpond-street. This coat was pledged on Saturday the 25th of February for eighteen shillings, in the name of 
               
                  John 
                  Davis
               



            , by a man with the same kind of clothes on as the prisoner has on now. I cannot say the prisoner is the man.
JAMES HANCOCK. On Sunday the 26th of February I took the prisoner in custody; I found four of five duplicates on him - one of them for the coat pledged in the name of 
               
                  John 
                  Davis
               



            .
Ramsey. This is the duplicate I gave to the person that pawned the coat.
The property produced and identified.
Prisoner's Defence. I got up early on Sunday morning; going out of the back room door I saw this ticket, it laid on the stair case; I looked at it, and said this ticket is not mine. I came in and had my breakfast, I intended to make it known to Mr. Neale, but the taproom being full I did not; I went to Bethnal-green for my clean linen, and when I came back a young man and I had two pots of beer; I had not an opportunity of telling the landlord; the young man did not go away so soon as I expected. Mr. Neale went out for theconstable; I did not like to deliver the ticket up, as the tap-room was so full of people; I was ashamed to take it out to give it him.

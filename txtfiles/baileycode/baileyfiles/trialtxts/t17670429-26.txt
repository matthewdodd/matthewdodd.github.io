            . I live at Hockley in the Hole


. I lost a cock and three hens between the 18th and 19th of March, they were taken out of the hen-roost. I heard a noise, and we got out of our beds in our shirts, and took the prisoner with them upon him; they are all here in a bag alive.

Prisoner's defence.
I had been drinking at the White Hart White-cross-street; coming home, two or three men laid hold of me, and took me to a place I did not know; when it was morning, I found myself in Clerkenwell Bridewell. I am as innocent as the child unborn.

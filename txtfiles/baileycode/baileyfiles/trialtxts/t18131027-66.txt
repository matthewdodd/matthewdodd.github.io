            . Q. You live in Bell-square, St. Martin's-le-grand - A. Yes.
Q. On the 11th of October last, did a man of the name of Faint lodge there - A. Yes; he was a porter to Messrs. Morgan's, Ludgate-hill


, and the prisoner was a carman
 there. On the day stated in the indictment the prisoner came into my lodgings; he brought a bag upon his shoulders; he asked for a light; he left the paper there. He said, Charles has got a bill of parcels; he knows where to take it to. He carried them up stairs in a bag to Faint's apartment, and left them there. I took particular notice of the bag. I saw one of the bundles was a ream of paper. I saw at the time there was a ream of paper in the bag. I could not see what the other was. I then sent for Mr. Whitehorn, of Foster-lane, to come and look at the parcel.

            . I am a publican. On the 11th of October, from the information of the last witness, I went to Faint's lodgings; the last witness shewed me a bag; it contained a large quantity of paper. Mr. Thompson, one of Messrs. Morgan's clerks, saw the paper afterwards.

            . I am a clerk to 
               
                  John 
                  Morgan
               



            , 
               
                  John 
                  Minter Morgan
               



            , and 
               
                  George 
                  Meadow Morgan
               



            , No. 39, Ludgate-hill. On the 11th of October, between seven and eight at night, I went to Faint's lodging; I there saw a bag which contained two reams of paper. That paper was the prosecutor's property, I have not the least doubt of it. The paper is worth about thirty-six shillings. Faint absconded that evening.
- KIMBER. I am an officer. I apprehended the prisoner on the 11th of October, after the clock had struck nine. The prisoner said he was innocent; he should not have done it if it had not been for Faint; he had put it in the waggon, and he took it to Faint's lodging. In Faint's lodging I found the paper, in this bag. I believe the bag belongs to Mr. Morgan.

               Transported for Seven Years

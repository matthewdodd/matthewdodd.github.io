             sworn. - I am groom to Mr. Oliver: I was inside of the chaise about twenty minutes past ten at night, the prisoner got up behind the chaise the corner of Hart-street


: he unbuckled the check brace, and took it off; I put down the other blind; I was upon the watch for him, and he began to take the other off; I jumped out and caught hold of him; he dropped the brace, and I took it up; I produce it; I am sure the brace is my master's property.
Prisoner's defence. My business is in the china painting line; we always work by day and burn our china in the evening; my master ordered me at nine o'clock to get my supper, and to return at ten; being rather late I got up behind this carriage; as soon as I got up behind the carriage, the man jumped out, at the corner of Great Russel-square, and said I had taken the brace from behind the carriage; I endeavoured to vindicate myself; he said that he was certain that I had; and he had lost one or two more, and I should pay for the rest.
Lee. There was nobody behind the carriage that night till I took this man.

            . I am the wife of 
               
                  John 
                  Frost
               



            , we live in Crawford-street, Manchester-square


. On the 16th of August I let the prisoner a front garret, furnished, at 8 s. a week. Next morning I took her some water - every thing was then safe. Between that time and four o'clock, she carried away these things - she went out several times. I went up stairs and missed the curtains, ran out, overtook her in John-street, and gave her in charge.

            . I saw the prosecutrix stop the prisoner in John-street. She had a basket, in which I found several of the prosecutrix's things; she said she was going to take them to her lodgings in Edgware-road, and that she had sold the furniture in Paddington-street; I went and found it there.

, about half an hour past one in the day; Mr. Maul came to me and said, Sir, you are robbed of your handkerchief; I felt, and perceived it was gone; I saw two boys running on the other side the way; we ran, when we came to Bishopsgate we lost them, presently we saw them running in the runs in Wormwood-street; we went and looked about there and found the prisoner, and upon: among some cask, fear where we found him. we found my handkerchief.

I saw the prisoner take the handkerchief out of the prosecutor's pocket he had made an attempt before and missed it. another boy with him; I informed Mr. Crew we pursued and found the prisoner had some sugar casks, and the handkerchief but  way from him; the prisoner says he is but years of age. (The handkerchief produced and desposed to.)

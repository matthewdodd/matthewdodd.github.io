WILLIAM TUCK
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
4th of October, 1 loaf of bread, value 8d., the goods of 



William Gold; and that he had been before convicted of felony.


EMANUELGOLD. I live with my grandfather, William Gold, who is a baker at Norwood. On the morning of the 4th of October I saw the prisoner against our street door—I went away, leaving him there—when I came back the door was open, and I missed a loaf from the bakehouse—I told

the officer, and he brought the prisoner with some of the loaf, which was my grandfather's.





GEORGE CADDUCK
 (police-constable T 164.) I went after the prisoner—he was stopped, and I took him with this loaf—I took him to the shop.





RICHARD ROADNIGHT
 (police-sergeant T 11.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 21.—


Transported for Seven Years.
(The prisoner has been three times previously convicted.)





ADJOURNED TO MONDAY, NOVEMBER
 28TH, 1842.

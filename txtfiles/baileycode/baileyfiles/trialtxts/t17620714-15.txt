            . I lost a gown, a black callimanco petticoat, and shift out of my own room.
Q. Have you a husband?
Gadsby. I have had a husband, but know not whether he is alive or no, he having left me some time. I went out to work; when I came back they were gone. She lodged with me; we slept in the same bed. She confessed that she took them to a gentlewoman in the house, and before Mr. Fielding, and that she sold my gown in Rag Fair, she could not tell to who, and that she pawned the petticoat and shift.

She said, she had sold the gown in Rag Fair for seven shillings: she said, she believed she had pawned the petticoat for five shillings; and that she had taken the shift, and that it was at Mr. Freer's.

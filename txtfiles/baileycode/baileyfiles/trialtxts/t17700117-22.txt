            . On Saturday the 17th of December, crossing the top of Fleet-market


, to go up Holborn, about half an hour after ten o'clock at night, the prisoner followed me pretty smartly; I looked him in the face; I suspected he was going to pick my pocket. In a little time, I felt my handkerchief go out of my pocket; I took hold of him; I saw it in his hand; he gave it a sling over his head, and it was gone; there were two or three following him. I called out, Watch! and the watch came directly; and he was taken to the watch-house. It was a linen one.

            , a cheesemonger
, of Wigmore-street. This 2lbs. of butter was taken from my basket, last Wednesday, at a quarter before nine o'clock in the morning; I was in Wyndham-place


 serving a customer, and I saw the prisoner at the basket -I ran and pursued; he ran into Crawford-street, and he went off, I cried "Stop thief!" and did not lose sight of him but in turning the corner - there was one more person running after him with me. I am sure he is the person I saw at the basket; he had thrown the butter over the rails of an area, which he had passed.

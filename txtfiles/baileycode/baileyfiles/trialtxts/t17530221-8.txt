            . I had used this copper funnel on Saturday the 20th, and left it in the shop window at night, and on the 22d the prisoner and the funnel were brought to my shop. It is my brother Thomas's and my property.

             . I am a chimney-sweeper. I was at the White Hind alehouse in Bishopsgate-street last Monday morning was a month, there were the prisoner and two others, who had a sack with this funnel in it. I wanted to see what was in the sack. As they were swearing and making a dispute, saying, they would go and sell the funnel, I asked him what he had in the sack; he said nothing but bread and cheese. I saw the prisoner take it out and hide it under the bench; I took it up and secured him. He first said he would give it me if I would let him go; then he went with me and shewed me the prosecutor's house, and said he took it from thence. I never saw the prisoner before as I remember.
Prisoner's Defence.
He said if I would tell him where I had it he'd let me go; I said I knew nothing of it ; a man in the street said he had seen me in Fore Street, so he took me there.

William Giles. I am a brass-founder, and sell it finish'd and unfinish'd
: The prisoner work'd with me between five and six years.

             brought a parcel of brass, some old some new cast, to me, which he bought of the prisoner. It was produced in court, and all the new depos'd to by the prosecutor. I believe the other to be mine, but will not swear that.

            . I have bought several parcels of old brass of the prisoner at the bar, I believe about fourscore pound weight within these five months : I never suspected him before, but amongst this parcel seeing some new cast I suspected him, so I would not pay him for it; then I watched him to his lodgings, and by that means came to know who he work'd for, so the next morning I acquainted the prosecutor.




               Guilty 10 d

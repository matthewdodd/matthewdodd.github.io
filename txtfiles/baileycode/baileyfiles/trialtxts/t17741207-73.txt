: that Mr. Jenningham lodges in his first floor: that the prisoner came to live servant
 with him, on the 25th of October: and that on, or about the 28th he missed several things out of the shop; that having some reasons to suspect the prisoner; and upon an application to her, to see the contents of her trunk, she said, she had lost the key; but observing she concealed something in her hand, they opened her hand, and found the key of her trunk; that searching her trunk, they found a shirt, marked with the initials of Mr. Jenningham's name, a pair of his laced ruffles, nine guineas, and near twenty shillings in silver, and the rest of the articles mentioned in the indictment; some of which had his private shop mark on them.
The prisoner in her defence, denied the charge, and called several witnesses to prove that she had ten or fifteen pounds in money, when she went into Mr. Clowes service.

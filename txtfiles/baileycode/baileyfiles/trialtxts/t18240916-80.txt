            . I am a fruiterer at Covent-garden market
. I was in James-street


 on the 10th of August, about one o'clock, and saw the prisoner, and two others with him. I felt a snatch at my fob, and the watch was gone. I turned to the left, and the prisoner was within reach of me; I seized and kept him till the watchman came up, and gave him in charge. He swore at me, and said he had not got it.
Prisoner. When the witness gave me in charge, he said I was not the man. - Witness. I did not - I said
"If he has not got it, I dare say he gave it to a man that was running down the street." I had no person near me - I was quite sober.

            . I am a watchman of St. Martin's. As I was crying one o'clock I heard the prosecutor say
"I have lost my watch;" he held the prisoner by the arm. I took him to the watch-house - there was no other person near him but the prosecutor, and two others who ran away. Hose was quite sober.
Prisoner's Defence. As I was returning home up James-street, I saw the witness fighting a girl of the town, she ran away, and then he took hold of me as I was standing a little way from him.

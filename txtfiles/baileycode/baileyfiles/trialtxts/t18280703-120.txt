, of Crown-street, Finsbury. On the 10th of June, about nine o'clock in the morning, I missed a cheese; I went out, and followed the prisoner about fifty yards - I took him with this cheese under his jacket; he dropped it, and said, "D-n you let me go - you have got the cheese;" he then knocked me down, and kicked me violently in the back; I got up - he knocked me down again, struck me, and knelt upon me; I still kept hold of him - he was taken back to the shop.
Prisoner. He knocked me down first. Witness. He tried to slip out of his jacket.

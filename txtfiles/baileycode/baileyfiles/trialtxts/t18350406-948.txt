JOHN THOMAS
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
12th of March, 1 glazed window-sash, value 1l. 1s., the goods of 



Francis Parkyn.






WILLIAM PARTRIDGE
. I am foreman to Mr. Francis Parkyn, a builder. He had a glazed sash, which I saw on the 12th of March, from ten to twelve yards from his gateway, at the bottom of the stairs leading to his shop, and at a quarter after six o'clock I saw it close to the gate.

Cross-examined by
MR. MAHON. Q. Was it not for sale? A. Yes—we have other persons in our employ.





JEREMIAH MURFORD
. I work for the prosecutor. I was down his gateway that evening—I saw the prisoner remove this sash from where it had stood, to the entrance of the gateway—I went and took him there—he removed it ten or twelve yards—I have seen his face a good many times, and knew him by sight.

Cross-examined. Q. He was looking at the sash, was not that all? A. He was looking at it when I saw him—I had known the prisoner before—he

did not ask me for a person named Lloyd—he had the sash in his hand—he did not say he was looking at it, thinking it was for sale—he did not take it off the premises—I did not move it myself—there were a good many working there—they might remove it for what I know—when I took the prisoner, he dropped this sash down—it was dark where it had stood, and the place he took it to was lighter.

Prisoner's Defence. There was a person lodged with me named George Lloyd—he said he was going to work in a carpenter's shop, in Eagle-street—I went into the prosecutor's and asked for him—I took up this sash merely to look at the workmanship, being a glazier.




GUILTY
.* Aged 21.—


Transported for Seven Years.

Fifth Jury, before Mr. Common Sergeant.

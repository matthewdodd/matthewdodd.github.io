JOHN BALDIE.
I live with my father, William Baldie, a baker, in Frith-street, Soho. On the 30th of December I was in the yard, and saw a man in the shop, but as I knew my sister was in the parlour, I did not interfere—I then saw the prisoner walking out with a basket of biscuit and two loaves, which were my father's—I followed, and as I got outside I saw two young men with the prisoner—they covered the basket over with a dirty cloth, and the prisoner put it down—I took hold of him, and he said, "What do you lay hold of me for? "—I told him I knew what for, and I took him to the shop—I called my sister to take care of the biscuits—I am sure he is the person who took them out.

Prisoner's Defence. I was walking by, and he came and said I took the biscuits.

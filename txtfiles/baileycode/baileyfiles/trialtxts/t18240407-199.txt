            , who is a linen-draper
. On the 3d of March I was in the area, and could see into the street. I saw the prisoner looking at the window - I went up and watched him - he walked backwards and forwards. I at last saw him take this print, and pull it from the door - it was full a yard inside the door. He rolled it up in his apron, and ran away. I pursued, and overtook him with it.

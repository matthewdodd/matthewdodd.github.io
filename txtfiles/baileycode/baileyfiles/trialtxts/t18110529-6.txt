ELIZABETH WHITE. Q. Where do you live - A. At Hesson


, about a mile from Hounslow.
Q. Did any thing happen to you on the night of the 17th of April, or to your house - A. I heard a noise about twelve or one o'clock in the night before I went to bed, which alarmed me. I was up very late at work, and between the hours of twelve and two I went to bed.
Q. Before you went to bed did you lock up your house - A. Yes, it was all fastened, doors and windows. I then went to bed and went to sleep; I was awaked in the morning by Knowles. I immediately came down, he told me my window was open; this was between four and five; it was light; my doors were all fast; as I left them; there was a piece cut out of the shutter of the window of the foreroom that communicated with the street. The sash was propped up with the piece of wood that was cut out of the sash. I missed all the linen that was in the room, all the linen that is now produced in the bundle. It was quite light when I got up.


                  JOHN 
                  FINAL COOK
               



            . I am a constable of Isleworth. I was called up by the prosecutrix, I immediately went to her house, it was between four and five o'clock; I saw that the window had been cut. I returned to Hounslow and wrote a letter to Mr. Smith the police officer, desiring him to come immediately; Smith came about two or three o'clock, and in consequence of suspicion, I went to Newton's house with Smith. Newton lives in the town, on Isleworth side, better than a mile from the prosecutrix, We apprehended Simmonds and Andrews in the street, about five or six hundred yards from Newton's house. I apprehended Andrews, he ran away from Smith; Smith laid hold of him by the collar, he struck Smith, Smith catched the bundle off his shoulder, and he ran away; I catched him, and Smith searched him, and took a pistol out of Andrews pocket; the pistol was loaded with powder and shots; he likewise took a powder flask from his pocket, and a little bag whichcontained some slugs, and likewise a knife, and there was a crape found. I did not see Simmonds apprehended, I saw him searched.
Q. Was there any bundle found upon him - A. I saw them both with their bundles before we apprehended either Simmonds or Andrews. On Simmonds was found a large crooked knife, and a crape. After that we went to Newton's house; Smith I believe told him that we were come to search his house; he changed very white and trembled; I stood over him while Smith searched the house, he found several articles in the house that had been stolen from Mrs. White's house. We took Newton in custody, and at Bow-street they were examined and committed. The The first that Smith laid hold of in Newton's house, he asked me if I knew any thing of them. I said, yes, they are my boys stockings.


                  WILLIAM 
                  SMITH
               



            . I am an officer of Bow-street office. In consequence of application by the last witness on the 18th of April I went down to Hounslow; I got there about half past three or near four o'clock, I went to Newton's house, I saw Andrews open the door, and Simmonds I saw just behind him; I went over the way and told Cook that I had some suspicion. Cook sent Mortimer over the way to watch the house, in about five minutes Mortimer came back and called Cook; I was standing at the public-house door when he came back about fifty yards off; I looked on the opposite side of the way, I saw two men going down with bundles, I did not see where they came from.
Q. Who were the two men - A. Andrews and Simmonds, the same men which I had seen in the house. Upon my seeing them, I instantly ran of the opposite side of the way, and Mr. Cook along with me, crossed over and met them; I catched hold of Andrews at first by the collar; I conceived I had got him, but the moment I had got hold of him he hit me with his fist on the face; he gave me a second blow, and knocked me up against the wall, and ran away; he was then apprehended by Cook; I never let go the bundle that Andrews had; this is it. Simmonds likewise had a bundle, this was Simmonds's bundle. We then took them into a public-house; upon Andrews I found this pistol, it was loaded then; this is the charge that was in it; there was powder and slugs in it; I took from him a powder horn, a knife, and some crape, and a pair of pincers, in a small bag of square slugs. On Simmonds I found a small gardeners knife, and a gimblet, and this crape was in the lining of his hat.
Q. Had you gone down in the course of the day to the prosecutrix's house - A. I did, I saw the breaking, this knife might have done it; it appeared to have been cut with a knife. Immediately I had secured Simmonds and Andrews I went to Newton's house, Cook went with me. Newton was sitting in the front room when I went in, I told him I was come to search his house, the first things that I took up was a child's pair of trowsers; they were in the front room, and several other things that Mr. Cook knew to be his property. I then went into the back room, Newton's wife was there, she went up against a window; I asked her what she was at, she said, nothing. I took two handkerchiefs from her hand, they belong to Mrs. White; under some straw I found two flat irons belonging to Mrs. White; the things have been in my custody ever since.
JOHN MORTIMER. I am a constable of Hesson. By the orders of Mr. Cook I watched Newton's house, I saw Andrews come out first, and look about him; he went in again, and in about five minutes Andrews and Simmonds both came out with bundles upon their shoulders. Andrews was taken by Mr. Cook. I apprehended Simmonds, I saw them searched afterwards, and the things found.
Prosecutrix. All these things were in my house. I have seen them all. I never made any estimate of their value.
Andrews' Defence. I know myself innocent of stealing the property. I went to Hesson fair; I was coming home, we lit of these things in a ditch.
Simmond's Defence. The same.
Newton's Defence. They were left at my house while I was out with my fish.

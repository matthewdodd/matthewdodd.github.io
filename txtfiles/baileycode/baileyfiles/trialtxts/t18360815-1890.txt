CLAUDE NICHOLAS OLIVIER
. I am an accountant. On Saturday, 18th of August, I was passing through St. James's-square about a quarter past one o'clock, towards Pall-Mall, on the south side—I felt something pull at my pocket—my handkerchief was in my pocket, and a newspaper folded upon the handkerchief—feeling the pull at my pocket, I turned round and saw the prisoner about a pace or two from me, just turning and going—I immediately turned and went after him—I overtook him a few yards further on and secured him, and he immediately produced my handkerchief—I took it from him—he said he had done nothing; I said, "Why you have taken my handkerchief out of my pocket"—he said he had never seen my handkerchief, and had never given it to me—he hung by the rails and would not move—I sent for a policeman, and gave him in charge—there was nobody else near me.

Prisoner. Q. Was not your handkerchief laying down by the rails? A. No—the newspaper did not come out—it was the obstruction made me feel the handkerchief taken.




GUILTY
. Aged 16.—


Transported For Fourteen Years.

            . Joanna and 
               
                  Mary 
                  Jewers 
               



             broke into my house the 10th of February about ten o'clock at night, and stole all the things mentioned in the indictment - they broke in at the chamber window.
Q. Did you see any marks of force?
Witherden. Yes, there were water tubs set upon one another, and so they got up to the window. - I was not at home then, but 
               
                  Joanna 
                  Jewers 
               



             confessed that her sister broke in at the chamber window before ten at night, and handed the things out to her. - There were some little things taken upon her, and she was questioned about it, and so she confessed it. - She confessed she handed out a piece of diaper, but did not say how much there was of it, some silk gowns, a pair of Holland sheets, some aprons and caps, some cambrick handkerchiefs, and some cotton handkerchiefs, she said some they sold and some they pawned. - I have some of the things again that were pawned at Mrs. Ravens's.


                  Mary 
                  Ravens

                  Joanna 
                  Jewers 
               



             brought one shirt, two aprons and three handkerchiefs . February 15 , Mrs. Sanders came and brought me this sheet, and asked her daughter Jewers - she called her daughter.

Sanders. She is my own daughter. I have had a latter husband.
Ravens. She asked her daughter 
               
                  Joanna 
                  Jewers 
               



             in what name she had pledged the things. And she said, in the name of Jewers . Then she said, she would not have them in the name of Jewers; she would have them in her own name, and she said her name was 
               
                  Margaret 
                  Barnes 
               



             , and the rest of the things were brought in that name. A stranger brought the piece of diaper, who told me, I should not deliver any thing to 
               
                  Mary 
                  Jewers 
               



            , but only to Joanna.


                  Hester 
                  Witherden 
               



            . Elizabeth Green gave me a cap, which she said she had of the Prisoner, which was my cap, and the lace was pawned to Mrs. Ravens : this is the lace.
Ravens. Sanders pawned this lace to me.


                  Joanna 
                  Hunter 
               



            . I gave 
               
                  Joanna 
                  Jewers 
               



             half a crown for this handkerchief one Sunday morning - I keep a chandler's shop.


                  Jacob 
                  Dias 
               



            . I went with a search warrant to Mrs. Raven's, and Mr. Witherden found some things there which he owned.


                  Joanna 
                  Jewers 
               



            . I was going with my mother into the Minories, and met my sister, and she desired my mother to pawn a sheet for her; which my mother did , and pawned it in the name of 
               
                  Margaret 
                  Barnes 
               



            ; and gave my sister the seven shillings, and she is run away.


                  Sarah 
                  Sanders 
               



            . I had the sheet of my daughter, and pawned it for her; she said she was going to see a friend, and wanted a little money.


                  Sarah 
                  Harrel 
               



            . I live in Warwick Lane. 
               
                  Joanna 
                  Jewers 
               



             lived with me, and behaved herself in a very pretty manner. I never knew any dishonestly by her.


                  Sarah 
                  Cooper 
               



            . The old gentlewoman (Sanders) was unfortunately persuaded to keep a publick house over against Alderman Parson's, and run out her fortune; and I really believe sometimes is out of her senses, partly on the account of the behaviour of these children - I believe it has so far turned her brain, that sometimes she cannot distinguish between good and evil; sometimes she acts very insensibly, and very imprudently, with regard to passion. Her youngest daughter lived with me some time; and when I have been without a servant, I have entrusted them in my house with my keys. I have been a housekeeper seventeen years. I believe 
               
                  Mary 
                  Jewers

                  Elizabeth 
                  Andrews 
               



            . I have known Sanders about twenty-two years. I lived in one of her houses of ten pound a year. She always had a good character.


                  Elizabeth

             Neil. I am

            's own sister. I never heard any thing amiss of her before this. My mother has been too indulgent a parent.


                  Henry 
                  Clarke 
               



            , and 
               
                  John 
                  Hamilton 
               



            , gave them good characters . Hamilton said, they had all three worked for him three quarters of a year in the slop way, and always brought their work home honestly.

            , was a second time indicted for 


               stealing a mahogany tea chest, a pair of tea tongs and strainer, two holland shirts, two ells of linnen cloth, and a silk handkerchief, the goods of

JOHN FLEETWOOD FALLSHAW. On the 19th of June, about a quarter past twelve o'clock at night, I saw the prisoner near Turnstile, in Holborn


, and went with her to the Bull and Gate - we went to a room up stairs, and while we were on the sofa together I found her hand in my pocket; she took out my money, and put the sovereign into her mouth - I got from her, and she ran down stairs; I followed to the door, took hold of her, and gave her in charge. On the road to the watch-house she gave the sovereign to the watchman.
Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you pay for the room? A. Yes, and had given her 4 s. I had had one pint of porter to drink, but no spirits; I had been in no other house. When she was before the Magistrate she said I had given her the sovereign for a shilling.

            . I am an officer. The prisoner was given into my charge at the Bull and Gate. On the way to the watch-house she pressed my hand to her side, and whispered,
"I have got the sovereign, will you take it?" I said Yes: I took it, and gave it to the constable of the night - she had some silver in her hand; I should think not more than 2 s. or 3 s., which she said he had given to her.

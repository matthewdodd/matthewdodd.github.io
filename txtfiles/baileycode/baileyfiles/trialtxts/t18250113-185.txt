            . On the 18th of December, I was dusting in the shop, and moved the prisoner's desk; it came open accidentally; some silver thimbles and pencil-cases fell out. I told my husband the prisoner was out; he came home, and slept in the house, and left in the morning, and never returned; he was taken on the Tuesday.

            . I am shopman to Mr. Harrison, a pawnbroker; I have three seals, a key, and two rings, pawned by the prisoner on the 23d of November.
Cross-examined. Q. They seem to be quite new? A. Yes, we do not take such things in unless they give a proper account of them - he had brought things before.

            . Last Monday was a week, I was coming up by the Fleet Market


, between eight and nine in the evening, and felt the Prisoner's hand in my pocket; I turned round and took hold of him, and saw him put my handkerchief under another man's coat.
Q. Did you see him put it under the other man's coat?
Bailey. I saw him do it, but I did not see the other take it; the other was in custody, but the bill is not found.
Prisoner. As soon as he charged me with taking the handkerchief, I bid him search me, for I had no such thing about me. 

               Guilty

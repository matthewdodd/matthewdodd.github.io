            . I am a constable. About half-past three o'clock in the afternoon, I was going up Wentworth-street, I saw the prisoner, and another man, run out of a court in Essex-street, and cross by me; knowing the prisoner before. I stopped him, and saw him put something under his jacket; I asked him what it was? he said he had picked them up at a door in Essex-street. It was the pair of breeches.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

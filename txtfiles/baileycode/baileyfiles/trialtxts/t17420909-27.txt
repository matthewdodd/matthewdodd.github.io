            . I lost the Ring out of my Box last Friday Morning. The Box was locked, and the Key was in my Pocket. It was pawned at the Golden Ball, in Hart-street, and I found it there.

            . I live in Hart-street, Covent-Garden. The Prisoner came to our Shop with a Gold Ring, she pledged it for 15 s. I have taken in several Rings of her before, and took her to be a very honest Woman, for she dealt very fairly.

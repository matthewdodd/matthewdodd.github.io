(Before this trial came on, the Prosecutor informed the Court, that one of the runners, whose name was Blacketer, had contrived to send home the prosecutor's apprentice, and told him that his master wanted him to go home for some beef-steakes, in order that he might be out of the way while the trial was on; he being a material witness, the Baron ordered the prosecutor to take an officer, and go in search of Blacketer, and fetch him into court.)


                  JAMES
                   BURLEIGH
               



             sworn.
I am a butcher
 in Newport market


; on Sunday, the 9th of April, in the afternoon, I went into my shop to take out a book; I saw my meat hanging as usual; I went to my dwelling-house, which is over the way; all was safe at four that afternoon.


                  JOHN
                   SADLER
               



             sworn.
I am the prosecutor's son-in-law. Our apprentice and I had been in the Strand; it was about eight when we left the Strand, and as we just came home together, says I to the apprentice, may be the door is not locked; he went to see, and he said, no; I got a candle, and went into the shop, and I saw two men lay down, one with his head in the sawdust-hole, and the other with his head over his back; then one of them jumped up, and knocked the candle out of my hand, and knocked me down, and run away, and our apprentice run after him.


                  JOHN
                   BENNETT
               



             sworn.
The door was hasped, it was not open; and the prisoner Kirby came out of the shop, and knocked the lad down, and run out of the shop; I pursued, I never lost sight of him; I took him about twenty yards out of Cranbourn-alley, in Leicester Fields; I am sure he was not out of my sight from the time he came out of the shop.
JOHN CROUCH sworn.
I was going through Newport market about half after eight; I heard a noise in the prosecutor's shop, and presently the apprentice and the lad came up, and the lad said, let us see if the door is fast; he got a candle, and the instant he went into the shop, he hallooed out; and one of them knocked him down, and blew out the candle; he ran out, and I ran after him, and lost sight of him as he turned the corner in Litchfield-street, and I came in sight of him again; he was running; he was the same man that I was pursuing; I knew his face the instant he came out of the shop.


                  JAMES
                   HAYLOCK
               



             sworn.
I am a runner; I heard the cry of stop thief! I run out, and saw two or three people running; I run out, and caught hold of the prisoner Carr; he was not in a run, he was in a kind of walking; just by the Cock door, one of the lads came up, and said he was the man; but I do not know, he was about fifty yards from the corner of the street.
Perhaps he is some friend of your's? - No; I never saw the man in my life before.
Crouch. I am sure he was running when the runner laid hold of him.
Haylock. I belong to Litchfield-street office; if he had run, I could not have caught him, for I have a bad leg.
Prosecutor. This man said, when the prisoner was taken, says he, blast my eyes! he run right into my arms.
Court. Do not let that man go, that Haylock.
Court to Prosecutor. When did you see the meat? - When I went into the shop, the meat was hanging on the hooks; when the child was alarmed, I immediately ran out; I saw the prisoner Carr in Market-street; I was in the market-house; I saw him about twenty yards from my shop; he was running, and the other after him.

Are you sure he is the man that was running? - I will not take upon oath to say that he was; I should have caught him, but there was a barrow, and I fell over it; I cannot say it was the prisoner; I do not think he had a great coat on at the time. When the prisoners were brought back in the shop, there was beef and veal, and mutton, in different pieces, in this bag, which was taken off a hook, and it lay in the same place where the boy told me he saw the prisoners lay; I came back along with Carr; I did not see him taken.
Had you turned the corner before he was taken? - I was not nigh him till after he was taken.
PRISONER KIRBY'S DEFENCE.
Coming from Knightsbridge, through Leicester Fields, I saw a parcel of boys crying stop thief! and they took hold of me.

                   BURNETT
               



             sworn.
I am a bedstead-maker; I have known 
               
                  Kirby
               


             these three years; he is a labourer, I have employed him; I never heard any thing of his dishonesty.


                  PETER
                   SMITH
               



             sworn.
That gentleman worked for me; I have known him six years; about three months ago he white-washed my room; I do not know where he lives.
PRISONER CARR'S DEFENCE.
Coming along, there was a cry of stop thief! and they laid hold of me, and said I was the person that went out of the shop; I am in the green grocery way; in about an hour after this gentleman put me into confinement, my wife went to the prosecutor, and the prosecutor told my wife if I could raise twenty shillings, he would get me off.


                  JOHN
               


             M'GREGOR sworn.
I have known the prisoner Carr twelve or thirteen years; he deals in greens and fish; I never knew any thing to the contrary, but what he was an honest man.

                   WRIGH
               



             sworn.
I have known Carr almost two years; I live at No. 15, Little Windmill street.
What character does he bear? - A very good one.


                  ELIZABETH
                   NORTH
               



             sworn.
I live in Berwick-street; I have known him ever since he was born; I never knew any thing dishonest by him.
Court to Burleigh. When these people were taken before a Magistrate, did you make any offer to make it up? - They begged they might not be committed, but afterwards they were committed; I told one of their wives, if any thing was to be done for her, I would have no objection.
Did you propose to her, that if she could raise twenty shillings, you would throw every thing out of Court? - On the night he was apprehended, when this prisoner was taken to the watch-house, one gentleman in particular said he knew Carr, he called him by his name; he says, what have you been at? he said nothing; and I told him.
Court to Carr. Who was that gentleman? - I do not know.
Haylock. I wish to speak to your Lordship before the Jury deliver their verdict; I only wish to shew you, my Lord, whether I can run. (Shews his leg.)

                   BLACKETER
               



             sworn.
Sir, Haylock was in the public house, over at the Pitt's Head; he said, here is Burleigh's man over the way, playing at marbles; says he, I will go and send him for a beef-steak; says I, why do not you? I went up with him, and he told the boy to go for some beef-steaks; says the boy, it is very right, I forgot the bag; says I, then, you rogue, run as fast as you can, they have no dinner.
Court. I rather believe that circumstance is a mistake; but I am not satisfied about the other; and if the Court will take upon themselves to be at the expence of a prosecution for perjury against Haylock, I will commit him.
Haylock. I hope not.
Blacketer. I ordered a shoulder of mutton for my own dinner.
Court. Then, Haylock, unless you give very good bail, you will be committed for perjury; let him be taken into custody, and the expences of it will be borne by the city.

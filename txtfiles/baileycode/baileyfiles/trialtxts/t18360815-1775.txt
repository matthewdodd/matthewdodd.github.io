ELIZABETH COLE
. I am the wife of William Cole, of Beaumont's-building, Aldersgate-street. About seven o'clock in the evening of the 12th of July I met the prisoner coming out of my cellar—he had no business there—I opened the cellar door, and asked what he wanted—he said he had been down in the cellar, as he was taken bad in his bowels—I asked why he did not go to a public-house—while I was talking to him I saw he had something round his waist—I asked what it was—he said his tools—I took hold of him, and said I would not let him go, and he threw down several pieces of lead in the passage.





JOSEPH SHAW
. (police-constable G 3.) I was called, and the lead was given to me—I compared it with the leaden pipe on the premises—this part was over the cistern—I searched the cellar, and found this knife in the copper, were there where some suds.

Prisoner. This officer found more of the lead, he says, at a marinestore-shop. Witness. He threw this piece away in Bartholomew-close, a boy picked it up, and sold it at a marine store-shop.





WILLIAM DREW
. (police-constable 88.) I produce the certificate of the prisoner's former conviction (read)—he is the man.

Prisoner's Defence. I was taken very bad, I never saw the lead, nor had any thing on my person.





ELIZABETH COLE
. I saw him throw it down—he had left some on the sairs.





JAMES SIMMS
. It is my house, I let it to Mr. Cole.




GUILTY

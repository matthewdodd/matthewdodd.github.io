FREDERICK SHARMAN. I am a shoe factor
, and live in Cammomile-street. On the 9th of November, between eleven and twelve o'clock, I was on the east side of St. Paul's church-yard


, and saw two young men handing a handkerchief one to the other, which induced me to feel my pocket; I missed my handkerchief, the prisoner is the one who received it - I seized him, he was within two yards of me, the other went away. I asked him to let me see the handkerchief which was in his pocket, he said he had none about him - I found my handkerchief up his back, and gave him in charge.

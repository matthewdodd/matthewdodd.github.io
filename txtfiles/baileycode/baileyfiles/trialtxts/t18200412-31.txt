            . I am clerk
 to Messrs. Doriens bankers. On the 8th of March, about half-past twelve o'clock, I was at Guildhall


 at the election - the hall was much crowded. I felt somebody at my pocket, put my hand down, and missed my handkerchief, turned round, seized the prisoner and charged him with stealing it - he denied it. I took a handkerchief out of his waistcoat which was not mine, and returned it. An officer came up, and found my handkerchief in his bosom.

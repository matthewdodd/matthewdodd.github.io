; the prisoner came last Monday, and call'd for a porringer of soop, and after that another, and so on, till he had four; he took an opportunity to take a silver spoon; he slip'd out; the maids had an eye upon him, followed and brought him back; he denied having it, and swore he gave it to one of the maids: he was searched, and the spoon was found tucked under his garter, between his stocking and thigh.

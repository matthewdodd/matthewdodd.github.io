            . I am a soap-boiler. On the 7th of June, the prisoner brought the fowls to me, and offered to sell them. He said he had bred them himself, and had had them six months. I told him he had stolen them, as I knew them to be the prosecutor's (who is my master) the moment I saw them.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

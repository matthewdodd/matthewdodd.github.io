             (police-constable S 160). I was in Chapel-street, Somer's-town, on the 9th of April - I met the prisoner crossing the road, with this pair of shoes under his arm - I stopped him, and asked where he was taking them to? - he said to his brother, who lived in Judd-street, and he had brought them from his uncle in Mill-place, where they had been repairing - I took him there, but he did not seem inclined to point out where his uncle lived - I then asked him again where he got them? - he said, "Did not I tell you I had them from my brother?" - I took him to the station-house, and then found the prosecutor.

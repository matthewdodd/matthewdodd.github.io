WILLIAM BLANCHARD
 and 



JOHN HAYES



, stealing 1 copper scoop, value 8s.; the goods of 




Henry William Burton: Hayes having been before convicted.






ALFRED TAYLOR
 (policeman, B 86). On 23rd Jan., about half-past five o'clock I saw the prisoners in the Vauxhall Bridge-road—I knew them before—they turned down Wheeler-street—I stopped at the corner—they made a pause at the coal-shop, a little way down, and Blanchard reached something from inside the shop—it was bright copper—Hayes was by his side—they ran away, and I saw Blanchard pass something to Hayes—I caught Blanchard, told him what I took him for, and he said I was wrong, but he would go with me—we went back to the shop, and found the scoop was gone—I took Hayes about a week after, and told him what for—he said he was at work at the gas factory on the day in question.





HENRY WILLIAM BURTON
. I am a coal and potato-dealer, in Vauxhall-road. In consequence of what Taylor told me, I went into the shop, and missed a copper scoop, which we use to weigh potatoes—I had seen it safe, I think, about an hour and a half before.





WILLIAM MILLERMAN
 (policeman, B 95). I produce a certificate—(read—John Haynes, convicted April, 1848—confined three months)—I was present at the trial—Hayes is the person.

THOMAS MAYNARD. I am an ironmonger
, and live in Grove-street, Camden-town. On the 29th of March, about eight o'clock at night, I was opposite St. James's chapel, Pancras


; my pocket had been picked about five minutes before, by a child, whom I took the handkerchief from, and put it in my pocket; I perceived somebody walking close behind me: he turned back suddenly; I then felt and missed my handkerchief, and immediately laid hold of the prisoner, who was about three yards from me, putting the handkerchief into his trowsers; he slipped from me as I had gloves on, and ran over to the burying ground, and threw something over there, and was stopped about three hundred yards off with my handkerchief in his hand, he escaped next day, and was retaken, three weeks ago, but I was in Devonshire, and could not prosecute him.

            . I am an officer. Mr. Maynard delivered the handkerchief and prisoner to me - he escaped from me next day, with his handcuffs on, and was taken three weeks ago.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

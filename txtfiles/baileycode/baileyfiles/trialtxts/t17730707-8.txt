            . I am a pawnbroker
, and live in Manor-row, Tower-hill


. On the 31st of May I lost five pair of crystal and paste silver sleeve buttons; I had put them in the window just before; 
               
                  Thomas
                   Serjeant
               



            , who lives opposite me, brought the prisoner to my shop, and the buttons.

            . I am a cordwainer, and live near Mr. Morgan. On the 31st of May, about half after twelve at noon, I saw the prisoner and another lad about his window for half an hour together; I suspected them, and kept my eye upon them; at last I saw them close together doing something to the window; I believe they cut the glass; the prisoner took a card of buttons out and made off; I pursued him, and I saw him drop the buttons down a cellar. (The buttons produced and deposed to by the prosecutor.)
Prisoner's Defence.
I was going along and heard somebody call stop thief! I stopt to see what it was, and this young man laid hold of me; I did not steal the buttons. I never was near the window.

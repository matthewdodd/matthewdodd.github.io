, the 7th of May
 last.

The Prosecutor depos'd, That she going out on Whit-Sunday, at her coming Home, found the Door of the Room seemingly fast, but could not open it; but calling the Prisoner Skagg, she at last did with some Difficulty open it; that the Prisoner Smith having been her Lodger for some time, and Skagg her Neighbour and Acquaintance, and frequently at her House, she had no Suspicion of them for the present; but afterwards having some Reason to suspect them, got a Search Warrant, and upon searching of Skagg's House, found some of her Linen, and was carried by the Prisoners to Places where part of the Linen was pawned, and both of them owned the Fact; and that they had got a false Key, by which they had opened the Lock, took the Goods, and confess'd where they had sold the Plate; that they laid the Fault upon one another, one charging the other with putting them on the Commission of the Fact, and express'd a great deal of Sorrow that they had so ill used the Prosecutor. The Prosecutor's Evidence was confirm'd as to the finding of the Linen in Skagg's House, and other Circumstances; and their owning the Fact was confirmed by the Constable, and other Evidence; the Fact being plainly proved, the Jury found them both 


               Guilty to the Value of 4 s. 10 d.

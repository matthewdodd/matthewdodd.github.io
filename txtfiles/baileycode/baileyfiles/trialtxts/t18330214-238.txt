             . I am a coachsmith
 . On the 27th of January I was in Boyd's-place , Shoreditch, at half-past two o'clock in the morning ; I had been spending the evening at a friend's at Hoxton, and as I was going by the end of Church-street, Shoreditch


, the prisoner accosted me; she told me a young man who was standing there was after no good - I proceeded on to the next turning, and then she came and wanted me to go home with her, which I refused; she then put her hand into my waistcoat pocket and took out my money - she went off; the officer was going by the top of the turning - he asked what I had lost; I told him, and he ran and took her with the money in her month .

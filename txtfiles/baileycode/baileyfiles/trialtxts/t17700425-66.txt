            . I am a grocer
, and live in Bishopsgate-street


; the prisoner had lived with me about seven weeks. On the 23d of March, my md went to make his bed, and came down stairs, and said, she perceived something to rattle in his pocket as his clothes hung up. I went up, and she and 
               
                  Robert
                   Hasledine
               



             with me, and found twenty-one nutmegs in his pocket. We smelling pepper, searched in a foul clothes-bag under his bed; there we found the quantity of ground-pepper, as mentioned in the indictment.

             deposed he took the nutmegs out of the prisoner's pocket, and saw the pepper found; that when the prisoner was charged with taking them, he owned he did take them, to make a medicine for his cold.
Prisoner's Defence.
How they came there I know not; I am as innocent as the child unborn. My fellow-servants conveyed them there, in order to get rid of me.

EDMUND WOODLAND
. I live at Richmond, in Surrey. I was in Long-lane, Smithfield, on the 28th of Aug.—I felt a twitch at my pocket—I put my hand round, and took my handkerchief from the prisoner's hand—he ran away—I followed him round Smithfield-market—I caught him, and held him till the policeman came—this is my handkerchief.





GEORGE WHITE
 (City police-constable, No. 24.) I took the prisoner, and have the handkerchief.





WILLIAM CONSTABLE
 (police-constable G 81.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction at this Court, by the name of Thomas Jones—(read—Convicted 19th August, 1844, having been before convicted of felony;—confined one year)—the prisoner is the person.

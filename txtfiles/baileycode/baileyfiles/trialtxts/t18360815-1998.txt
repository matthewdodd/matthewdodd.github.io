GEORGE WEBB BROMIFIELD
. I am a brush-maker, and live in black-friars-road. the prisoner's son lived with me as shop-boy—I very frequently saw his father about the door of a morning and evening, but never in the shop—on the 5th of July I was sent for before eight o'clock in the morning by a policeman, who showed me some bristles which I knew to be mine—they were in a bag—I had seen them in my room the day before—I went to my room, and missed a large quantity—I swear they are mine.





JOHN GRAVESTOCK
. I am a policeman. In consequence of information, I was watching the house from the 1st of July until the 5th—seeing the prisoner come every morning in company with his son to the next street to the prosecutors's house—then the boy left the prisoner and went and opened the shop, and the prisoner went away; but on the 5th of July the prisoner passed the house once, he then came again and went in empty-handed, and came out in two or three minutes with a bag on his back—I went after him and asked what he had on his back—he said, "Hair"—I asked him where he was going with it—he said, "To take it to Lambeth"—I said he must go back with me—he wanted to know what I had to do with it—I showed him my authority—I took him back to the shop, and the prosecutor came down.

Prisoner Q. What distance were you from the shop? A. About twenty yards.

Prisoner Defence I never went into the shop, but merely stepped into the door and picked up the bag which was laying on the floor, and walked away with it—I was in distress.

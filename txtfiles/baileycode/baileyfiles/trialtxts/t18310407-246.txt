            . I am a Police-constable. At half-past nine o'clock on the night of the 24th of February I saw the prisoner near Shadwell-market, by a door in an alley; he had his jacket and waistcoat off, and his shirt-sleeves turned up - I asked what he was doing; he said he was a sailor, and was going to sleep down there - I found his jacket and waistcoat were over this piece of cotton; when he took the waistcoat up to put it on I saw the cotton - I found the prosecutor's shop about three hundred yards from the place.

            . I am in the employ of Mr. Edward Hill - he is a linen-draper
, of High-street, Shadwell


. This cotton is his property - it has two marks on it, in my own hand-writing; I had seen it safe about six o'clock in the evening, and it was brought to the shop between nine and ten o'clock.

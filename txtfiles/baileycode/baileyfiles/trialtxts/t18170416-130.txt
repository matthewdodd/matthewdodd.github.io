            . I am a slop-seller, and live in East Smithfield. On the 26th of February, about six o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came to my shop with the ticking, and asked me to buy it. I told him it would not suit me-knowing him before, I suspected him. He turned towards Nathan's house - I followed him. As he passed Nathan's, I called him out, and we followed the prisoner till he got to the middle of Rosemary-lane - He then saw us, and we secured him. He said, it was of no use, as we should never find out where he got it.

            . I am a headborough. Moses called on me - We followed the prisoner some distance, and secured him in Rosemaay-lane, with the ticking under his arm. I at last found that it belonged to Mr. Blakeley.

            . Q. Are you a servant at the prosecutor's house - A. Yes.
Q. Do you remember when the prosecutor lost the time piece - A. Yes. On Saturday the 31st of August I left the house door open for the purpose of fetching a jug to get some milk, before I could return I heard a footstep over my head. I missed afterwards a time piece out of the front parlour. I had seen the time piece a few minutes before seven. The prisoner was brought to me, and the time-piece.

            . On the 31st of August I was at Mr. Mills's door, about three or four yards from Mr. Northcote's house; I saw the prisoner go into the house, and immediately he came out again with something in a handkerchief; I went to the girl and asked her whether she had seen any body go into the house; I then pursued the prisoner, and took him, he had the time piece wrapped up in his handkerchief He said he deserved every thing that he should meet with; I gave the time piece to Mr. Northcote.

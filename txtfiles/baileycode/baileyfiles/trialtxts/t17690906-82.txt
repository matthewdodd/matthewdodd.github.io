            . I am a merchant
, and live in Brown's-buildings, St. Mary Ax


. The prisoner was my servant
 from the last day of March to, I think, about the 24th of July. In looking over some goods I missed a large quantity of hair shag, to the amount of 300 l. I had no reason at that time to suspect any person in particular, so I went to Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            , and he advised me to advertise them. On the Saturday following, the constable, named Simons, applied to me with a piece of shag, that he had taken from one 
               
                  Jacob 
                  Isaac 
               



            , and I found it to be my property. He had taken the person in custody, and carried him to the Compter. He confessed he had the goods of the prisoner at the bar. I sent one of my clerks down to fetch the prisoner up. She confessed to have taken to the amount of fourteen pieces, and said she had taken but 12 l. in money. She was taken before Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            , there she confessed the fact fully, and that she had delivered several pieces to this Isaac, and to 
               
                  Rachel 
                  Solomon 
               



            .
Hen. Simons. I am the constable. I received a piece of hair shag of one 
               
                  Henry 
                  Lion 
               



            ; he said he had it of two women.


                  Jacob 
                  Isaacs 
               



            . I follow all kinds of business, and deal in watches, rings, or any thing
. The prisoner came to me, and asked me if I would buy some velvets. I said I had not money to buy such a thing; she shewed me the patterns. I said I could not buy it without I went to 
               
                  Henry 
                  Lion 
               



            . I went and told him of it, but said, I do not know whether it was come by honestly or not. He said, Do not mind that; if it is worth the money, buy it. He gave me fifteen guineas to buy it. I took these two pieces of the prisoner at the bar. She said she came in one Mr. Renage's name. I bought them, and brought them to 
               
                  Henry 
                  Lion 
               



            . They were blue coloured.
Prisoner's Defence.
I know nothing of it. I was frighted into what I said. Mr. Renage brought me two pieces, and I carried them to that man.




               Guilty of stealing only

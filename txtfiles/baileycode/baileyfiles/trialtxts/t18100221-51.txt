            . Q. You are the wife of Edmund Sinclair. - A. I am. We lived at 172, Whitecross-street, St. Lukes.
Q. On the 13th of January, was your house broken open. - A. Yes; my husband and me went to bed together about a quarter before two; we were the last persons up belonging to the family, and to the best of my knowledge we left every thing safe and secure. In the morning, at six o'clock, we were alarmed by an exciseman; that was before it was day light. We went into the shop (my husband keeps a shop for boots and shoes, and we deal in clothes besides); the shop was quite distressed; the things were taken away chiefly.
Q. Did these things consist of boots, shoes, gowns. - A. Yes, and a variety of articles; there was also between twenty or thirty yards of printed cotton, and about three pound's-worth of halfpence.
Q. Have you seen produced to you since any property that you knew to be part of the property that was taken from your house. - A. I have seen some; but I cannot take upon me to swear to them.
Court. - These things will be produced to you; recollect you are upon your oath; you must speak the whole truth, whether it is for or against the person accused.


                  JOHN 
                  BALLAD
               



            . Q. You know Mr. Wheeler, the prisoner. - A. Yes; I did not know him before the Sunday he purchased the things.
Q. Do you know How and Lander. - A. Yes, them are the two men. I have known How and Lander about five weeks before the house was broken open. On Saturday night, the 13th of July, I was in company with How and Lander at the Gold-house, Golden-lane. I went there after I had done my work, it might be near nine o'clock at night; they were in the house. I sat and drank with other company that were there, and I might drink with them, but I did not go into their company before it got late. I sat there till the house was shutting up about twelve o'clock. I, Lander, and How, agreed to go to Mr. Sinclair's house, with intention to do this robbery. We went there between two and three o'clock in the morning. When we got there, Lander and How lifted me upon Mr. Sinclair's back wall; there was a yard between the wall and the house. When I was put upon the wall, Lander followed me; he got upon the wall too; me and Lander then went to the staircase window, leaving How on the outside; one of us lifted the staircase window up, I am not sure which; it was not fastened; I got into the house, and went down stairs. Lander waited at the window. I could not get in at the parlour window, it was fast; I opened the back-door, got into the yard, and opened the yard door that adjoins to the court. We all three men came in the yard; we got the shutter down, chucked up the parlour window, I got in the window, and went into the shop. Lander and How were waiting at the window. I brought out a quantity of boots, shoes, and linen; I handed them out to How and Lander, a quantity of articles, a good many halfpence, and sheets, shirts, shifts, frocks, handkerchiefs, and printed cotton. I handed them over to them in the yard. We then went away with the articles that I have mentioned to Mrs. Jenning's, in Red Lion market, in the same street. Lander and How went in to Mrs. Jennings; I did not; they left the things that we took; they came out; we went to Mr. Sinclair's house again for more property; I got in to the window again, and handed the same kind of articles out that we had each of us as much as we could carry. They were taken to the same place; we went in, and saw Mr. and Mrs Jennings; they refused keeping them; we took all the things to a house in Bridgewater-gardens; I cannot tell the people's names; I saw a woman there; we left them, and went to Sinclair's again, and when he had got a quantity of things, each of us, we came away; that was the third and last time. We went to this woman's in Bridgewater-gardens with these things. She then said that she did not deal in them kind of things; she would not have them there. Lander went out to see for a place to put them in; he did not return for some time; I went after him, and met him; then me, Lander, and a man called Banbury, went toLong-lane; How was left in the house at Bridgewater gardens.
Q. Whose house was it in Long-lane - A. I do'nt know; it was up a gateway; we could not get admittance; Lander got admittance at Stanton's, in Providence-place, Bridgewater-gardens; we then went to the house, where How was left with the things, and brought them all away to Stanton's. How was upon the look out; Stanton gave leave to let them be for a little while up in the pigeon loft; we went up into the pigeon loft with three bundles, and left them at Stanton's. We overhauled them, kept some of the things for his own use, and two or three things, such as clouts, were given to Stanton's wife for his children. Lander and I went away; we saw How at the Catherine Wheel; it was then about half past nine in the morning; then I and Banbury went down to Mr. Wheeler's in Long-lane, No. 31, I believe; I saw Mr. Wheeler there, about ten o'clock on Sunday morning; we told him that we had got a quantity of things, if he would come and look at them; we told him where; he said he had not had his breakfast, he would come in half an hour; we went back to the Catherine Wheel, to Lander and How; Wheeler came in a little more than half an hour to the Catherine Wheel; me and Lander went to Stanton's and shewed him the goods in the loft; Wheeler looked at them; Lander asked him nine pound for them; he wanted some time to consider about it; he was to come in two hours; he did not come; Lander, How, and myself went down to Wheeler's house in Long-lane, he was not at home. We went to a public house over the way and waited for him; about three o'clock we saw him, and then he offered five pound, and at last agreed to give five pound ten shillings, and a crown to be spent.
Q. Were you present - A. No; I did not see Wheeler till the evening; we went with the things on the same Sunday, at dusk; we took all these things to Wheeler's in a coach; we then saw Wheeler, between five and six o'clock; what passed between Lander and him I cannot say.
Q. Did you see Wheeler when the goods were delivered in the house - A. Yes. We put the goods in the house, and then Wheeler paid three pound; I am not certain whether he paid it to Lander or How; I had my share, one pound, and each of them a pound a piece.
Q. Now you are sure that Wheeler is the person that you left these things with, and from whom you received that three pound - A. I am.


                  JAMES 
                  STANTON
               



            . I live at No. 9, Providence-place, Bridgewater-gardens.
Q. Do you know How and Lander - A. I know Lander very well; he worked for me; I have seen How two or three times. I never saw Ballad before the Sunday morning.
Q. On Sunday morning, the 14th, about what time did you see Lander - A. I was in bed; Lander knocked at my door, near to eight o'clock, he asked me to get up; I did; he said he wanted to leave a little bundle for a little while; I gave him leave; knowing him, I had no suspicion of any thing of the kind; he had nothing with him then; it was light. He went down stairs, and instead of a little bundle he brought a large one up stairs; he went and brought another, and Ballad came up after him with another bundle as large as them; there were three bundles in all. As soon as he brought them up stairs, I said, James, I don't think they are your own; I will not have them here; he said they were all his own; he would not leave them there long, and he would come and take them away; Lander and Ballad took them up into my pigeon loft, and before they went away they made two bundles of them, and said they would come directly and take them away; then they went away. About ten o'clock they brought a man up; I have every reason to believe the prisoner is the man; he was rather pock marked in the face; I was at the other end of my loft, feeding my pigeons. I do really believe he is the man; he came along with Lander and Ballad; I don't know what for; I heard no conversation pass between them. As soon as Wheeler came into the loft he stooped and looked at the property, and went down directly; they all three went away; I heard the prisoner talking with them, but what it was I don't know. I began to be frightened; I went down stairs; I asked a person, and I went to the 
               
                  Catherine 
                  Wheel
               



            ; I saw Lander, How, and Ballad there; Wheeler was not there; I asked them to take them away, I did not like to have them in my place. How and Lander came and took them away in sheets between five and six o'clock in the evening. I do not know whether they had a cart or a coach; I was up stairs, and very glad they took them away.
MRS. STANTON. Q. Are you the wife of the last witness - A. Yes. I live in Bridgewater-gardens, with my husband.
Q. Do you know How and Lander - A. Yes; them are the men.
Q. Do you know Ballad - the man that has been examined - A. Yes; that is Ballad.
Q. Do you know the person of the prisoner at the bar - A. Yes; that is the gentleman; he came to my house the day after the robbery, on the Sunday, with How and Ballad, between eleven and twelve o'clock in the morning; they all went up into the pigeon loft; they hardly staid a minute there, and then they came down again and went away. About five o'clock in the evening How and Lander came to our house and took away two bundles.
COURT. Do you know how they took these bundles away - A. I think I heard Lander say there was a coach. We live up an alley; we could not hear the coach.
Q. Did you see Lander come there in the morning - A. Yes; I heard him; I was in bed; I covered my head over in the bed. I knew Lander before; he had worked for my husband; I knew him by his voice.
Q. And the next time that Lander and Ballad came was the time that Wheeler came - A. Yes.
Q. Do you remember at the time that Lander and Ballad came first, whether they brought any thing with them - A. Yes; they took them up in the pigeon loft. I heard them go from one room to the other.

                  ANN HALL
               



            . I am servant to Mr. Stanton.
Q. Look round and tell me whether you know the prisoner - A. I do not. I know How and Lander. On the Sunday morning after the robbery, Lander and Ballad came, at eight o'clock; I was in the back room when they came and knocked at the door; my master got up; and then I saw 
               
                  James 
                  Lander
               



             and 
               
                  John 
                  Ballad
               



            ; they took three bags up into the pigeon loft and went away.
Q. How soon did you see Lander again - A. Abouteleven o'clock. I was gone out of an errand, and when I came back I saw Lander, Ballad, and another gentleman. come down the ladder from the pigeon loft, and went away; and about five o'clock in the evening, just before we went to tea, I saw Lander and How come and take two bundles away in two sheets. I never saw them afterwards.

                  CARTWRIGHT
               



            . I am one of the marshalmen of the city of London. On Wednesday, the 17th of January, I, in company with Mr. Armstrong, and other officers, went to Wheeler's house; he keeps a green-stall, No. 31, Long-lane; Mr. Sinclair was with us; Wheeler was at home. We went through the shop into the back parlour; Armstrong was before me; Mrs. Wheeler had a pair of boots and was going to get up, Armstrong made to her; he said, them are what I want; he took the boots out of her hand and gave them to Mason. We told Wheeler what we had come for, and shewed him the warrant; we read the warrant to him; he said nothing; he seemed very much flurried. I put a pair of handcuffs on him; we took him with us to every part of the house that we searched. In the room below we found a quantity of dirty linen, and as Mr. Sinclair could not speak to it we left it and went up stairs. We perceived Wheeler to have a new pair of shoes on, we told him to take them off; he took them off, and Mr. Sinclair said, they are my shoes, they have my stamp upon them; Wheeler said he had bought them and given a crown for them. We gave him another pair of old shoes, he put them on These boots were found in the presence of Sinclair; he said they were his boots, in the prisoner's hearing; he gave no account how he came by them. Sinclair claimed them by the stamp; they are new boots. We found another pair of shoes on a landing place in a box; Mr. Sinclair claimed them by the stamp. We went into the back parlour again; Mrs. Sinclair was fetched, and among the linen she picked out two sheets and a shift; she said, these are mine; Mrs. Wheeler said they were her's, and Mrs. Sinclair said, that is wrong, that is mine. I can swear to them. I brought them away.


                  JOHN 
                  ARMSTRONG
               



            . I was with Cartwright. I saw the things that were found, and I heard the expressions that were made. The house was pointed out to us by Ballad, on the Monday night, and so was Stanton's, before we had the search warrant.
Q. Whereabouts is the amount of all the property taken by this burglary - A. Forty or fifty pounds, I believe.
COURT to Mrs. Sinclair. Your husband is not here - A. No.
Q. You went to the house of Wheeler, you were shewn some linen there - A. Yes. Mr. Cartwright drawed them all out from among a fold of linen, and laid them upon the table.
Q. By your directions, woman - Upon your oath did not you point them out to him. It is of great consequence that you should speak the truth here; if you dare to exceed the truth, as against the man, you will most certainly be punished; if you speak less than the truth you are liable to be punished. Your oath is, to speak the truth, the whose truth, and nothing but the truth and neither more or less and that you appeal to God to do; by the solemn oath you have taken, and by your appeal to God, and you draw out the linen that was in Wheeler's house, or did Cartwright draw them out by your direction - A. I could not draw them out; I said then I believed them to be mine. The sheets that we found the mark is off; it had my hand writing in the middle with common ink, the selling price; I turned the sides of one of them into the middle; there is no mark on them now.
Q. Have you any doubt that is your property - A. I have not any doubt that I had it in my shop.
Q. Do not you believe it was part of the property that was stolen - A. I cannot say that it was.
Q. You are quite sure that you mended it - A. Yes; and this shift, I have not a doubt it is one that I have had.
Q. Do not you believe that was one of the sheets that your house was robbed off - A. I cannot say it was or it was not.
Q. Did not you pick that sheet out and deliver it to the officer - A. I said I knew the sheet; I had seen the sheet.
Q. Did not you understand the reason of the officers taking you to Wheeler's house - A. Yes.
Q. Did you then truly state to them that you believed that was one of the sheets you lost - A. I have no doubt of that. I should be sorry to say it was if I thought it was not
Mr. Knapp. Take these shoes into your hand and tell me whether you know them - A. I know that there is my husband's stamp upon them.
Q. Look at the new shoes - A. There is the stamp of a man that did work for us upon them; and the boots have a stamp I do not know
Q. Do you mean to swear that at the time you was sent for to look at the sheets they had a mark upon them - A. No; if they had then they must now; I think there was a mark; I know I owned one of them; I know I have had the sheets in my shop.
Q. Have you any doubt that that is the same sheet that the officers shewed you at Wheeler's house - A. No; that is the same sheet.
COURT. When was you examined before the justice - A. I don't know what day it was.
Armstrong. It was the 18th of January.
COURT. Was your husband examined at the same time - A. Yes.
Q. Can you tell me where he is - A. No; I have not seen him since Tuesday night; I dare say he is gone into his own country, into Norfolk, to the best of my knowledge.
Prisoner's Defence. The sheets and shifts I had in my possession a long while; the shift is worked by my own little girl at school, and the other is my wife's work; and there is two others at home to match with it, and I can bring the school mistress.

JOSEPH FRYER
 (police-serjeant G 13.) On the 18th of December I went to Well-and-Bucket-court, Old-street—I went to a room on the ground floor—the street door was partly open—the room door was shut—I lifted the latch, went in, and saw the female prisoner sitting on the bedstead, blowing the fire—the man was in bed with two children—I seized the female prisoner—she gave a loud shriek, and wanted to know what I wanted there—I gave her to Reynolds, another officer, who followed me in—I then commenced searching a cupboard, and took from it two bags, one containing Roman cement, and the other plaster-of-Paris—I gave them to Reynolds—I found a tobacco-pipe with some white metal in it—I saw Duke find some gets—I then went to another cupboard, and at that moment the female prisoner swung across the bed—Reynolds took hold of her, and pulled her back, and stopped her from coming any further—she had come to where I was standing—she said, "I cannot help what my husband will do—Oh my poor babies, what will become of your father and mother!"—I then took from the wall a bag, which was hanging up, full of old rags—I chucked it on the bed, and told Reynolds to search it—in that bag was another smaller one, and in that this mould—in a butter flat, under the bed, I found twenty-seven counterfeit shillings, and twelve counterfeit sixpences, which I have here—I saw Ash take from the same flat two good shillings, and a good half-crown.

Cross-examined by
MR. DOANE. Q. At the time this woman made that exclamation, there were two or three officers in the room? A. Yes, there were five of us—two of them had handcuffed the man in bed—he is not a very large man, but these things are destroyed in a moment—I know two men named Davis—one of them keeps a public-house, the other is a constable of Clerkenwell parish—I am not aware that I know any other person of that name—I might have seen them the Davis' before I went to the prisoners, but I will swear I had no conversation with them respecting this man—I know Harris, a publican—I have not seen him for six or seven months—I do not know any other person of that name—I was directed by the officers of the Mint to go to the prisoner's place.





WILLIAM REYNOLDS
. I am a constable. I went to the prisoner's house—I followed Fryer into the room—I saw him lay hold of the female prisoner, and he delivered her over to me—I kept her on one side of the room for a few minutes, when she flew away from my side across the

bed, at the time Fryer was searching on the other side of the room at a cupboard by the side of the bed—I pulled her back, and gave her to Hall; and Fryer pulled down this bag, and threw it on the bed—I found in it a small bag, containing a plaster-of-Paris mould—the female prisoner said, "Oh, my poor children, you will never see your father and mother any more;" and that she could not help what her husband had done—I then received from Duke, who was searching the cupboard, a small pipkin, and a pipe containing some white metal, and a bag of plaster-of-Paris—here is a small piece of tin found in the cupboard by Ashton; and another bag, with some cement in it—on the mantel-piece, under an image was a counterfeit half-crown, which I delivered to Ashton—the male prisoner said, "You have no occasion to look at it; cannot you tell whether it is bad or good?"

Cross-examined. Q. When did you first receive directions to go to that place? A. The same morning—it was about nine o'clock when we went there.





WILLIAM BAKER ASHTON
 (police-serjeant G 11.) I went with the other officers—I searched the butter-flat, and found a tin box, containing two good shillings and one good half-crown—I saw this half-crown found on the mantel-piece by Reynolds—I saw Duke take a little bowl from the cupboard—after the prisoners had been taken to the station-house, I returned to the premises, about eleven o'clock, with Reynolds—I made a further search, and, under the stairs, under a deal of rubbish, I found these pieces of plaster-of-Paris.

Cross-examined. Q. Some time had elapsed before you went back? A. Yes; I should think an hour and a half, or more—the other officers called on me that morning, and told me they were ready to go.





ROBERT DUKE
. I am an officer of Hatton-garden. I accompanied the other officers—I saw the woman in custody of Reynolds and Hall—the man was lying in bed—in a moment or two he jumped but of the bed, and attempted to come near where I was standing; near a cupboard, in one corner of the room—I immediately handcuffed him, and put him to the other side of the room—I searched the cupboard, and found in one corner some pieces of white metal, which are called gets, in a cocoa-nut shell—in another corner I found a pipkin, with some metal in it—I handed it to Reynolds to take care of—I took Russell in charge.

Cross-examined. Q. The other officers were there when you were? A. Yes; they saw what transpired—the man jumped up, and while he was up I handcuffed him—it is not true that I handcuffed him in bed—there were five of us there—each of us brought something—it was not particularly to give us something to do—the outer door was open when I got there, and the inner door on the latch—I saw a man named Davis at our office yesterday—he is a constable—I had not seen him the day I went to the prisoner's, nor the day before—I had no conversation with any man named Davis about this matter either before nor since—I do not know any man named Harris, and have had no conversation with any man of that name—I went by desire of Hall, my brother officer, who spoke to me that morning, between seven and eight o'clock.





WILLIAM HALL
. I am an officer. I went with the other officers—I saw Fryer take down a bag and throw it on the bed—Reynolds took this little bag out of it, and in it was this mould—I took charge of the female prisoner—I saw the other officers search the place—I took this mould from

Reynolds—this file was found in a little box on a table with some tape and thread in it.

Cross-examined. Q. You gave direction to Reynolds and Ashton? A. Yes, I received directions on the Monday, and I think we went on the Thursday—I know a constable named Davis—I do not recollect that I had seen him that Monday, he is called "Harlequin Davis"—there is another Davis, a publican, on Saffron-hill—I had no talk with either of them about this matter—I had no conversation with a man named Harris—I received instructions from the officers of the Mint, on Monday, and acted upon them.





JOHN STANLEY
. I am an oil-man, and live in Mile-end-road. The house, No. 6, Well-and-Bucket-court, is mine—the female prisoner hired part of it of my daughter, a year and ten months ago—I received two shillings a week rent from her—the last I received, was the week before this happened—they both lived there, to the best of my knowledge, but she has paid—he was represented to me as being in the watch business.

Cross-examined. Q. Did you ever see the man there? A. Certainly, in the same apartment.





JOHN FIELD
. I am inspector of counterfeit coin to the Mint. This is a plaster-of-Faris mould, for the purpose of casting sixpences—there are upon it the impressions of three sixpences—both the obverse and reverse sides of them—it is a mould in which sixpences may be cast, and I think has been used for casting them—by closing one on the other, they will form three sixpences—there is a channel down which the metal is poured in a state of fusion—the metal is easily melted in a pipkin like this, and laded out with a pipe—this pipe has some metal in the tube of it now—it is a mixture of tin and antimony—these twelve sixpences are all counterfeit, and I believe have been cast in this mould—this file is used to remove the small spray from the coins when made—these pieces of metal are called gets, they came out of the mould produced—I have tried them to it, and they fit exactly—they are removed with a pair of scissors or a file—this Roman cement is not used in coining, that I am aware of—here are twenty-seven counterfeit shillings, and two good ones, which appear to me to have been used to make a mould, in which the bad shillings have been made—this half-crown is counterfeit, the other is good.

Isaac Russell's Defence. When they came, they seized hold of me, and put the handcuffs on me, in bed—they asked me to get up, and took me to the other side of the room, placed me against the window, and ransacked my place all over—the night before, about seven o'clock, or half-past seven, my wife went to get something for supper, and two young men named, Harris and Davis, called and asked me if they could leave these two bags there? I said, "Yes"—I went to the yard to wash myself, and when I came in, I put on my coat and handkerchief, and said I was going out—they said, "Put these bags away"—I said they could put them away—they put them in the cupboard—I left them there—I went down White Cross-street, and saw no more of them.

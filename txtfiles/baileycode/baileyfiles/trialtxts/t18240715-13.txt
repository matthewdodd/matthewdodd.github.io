            . I keep a public-house
 in Norton-street, Fitzroy-square


. On the 17th of June, at four o'clock in the afternoon I went out, leaving my watch hanging over the mantle-piece in the bar. I returned about seven, and it was gone.

            . I am an officer of Marlborough-street. On the 17th of June, about twelve o'clock at night, I was at the end of Cavendish-street, and saw the prisoner coming towards me; I suspected him, having received information - he ran away; I followed and took him in Norton-street, and before I said anything to him he said,
"I will tell you where it is; I pawned it in Drury-lane;" he could not say at what house. I took him to the prosecutor, and asked what he had pawned; he said the watch which he had stolen out of the bar. I found the duplicate of a pair of breeches upon him, which he said he had bought at the shop where he had pawned it, by which means I traced it to Hedges.

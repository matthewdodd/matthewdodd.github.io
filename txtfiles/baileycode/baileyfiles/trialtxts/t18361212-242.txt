JOHN WILLIAMS
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
10th of December, 2 sheets, value 4s., the goods of 



William Radburn.






WILLIAM RADBURN
. I live in Broad-street, Ratcliffe-highway. The prisoner came for a lodging on the 9th of December—he said he had rode from Bristol all day and all the night before—I said, "We do not take in strangers"—he said he had got a reference to the place where he was to go to work—I said he might come there, but he must be in by ten o'clock at night—he agreed to pay 15s. a week for board and lodging—he went to bed at ten o'clock that night, and the next morning when he got up. I saw he looked big—my wife went up and missed the sheets, and I asked him about them—he said he had not got them—I insisted upon searching him, and found them in the waistband of his trowsers, wrapped round him—these are them.





JOHN JAMES
 (police-sergeant, 256.) I was called, and took the prisoner, and have the sheets.




GUILTY
. Aged 19.—


Transported for Seven Years.

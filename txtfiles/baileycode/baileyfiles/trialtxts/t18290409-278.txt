            . I am the wife of William Kemp Hodges, linen-daper
, of the Minories


. The prisoner came to our shop, on the 6th of March, and asked to look at some prints - I shewed her some; she looked at about three, then took a piece of cotton from the counter, and ran away with it; I gave an alarm, she was pursued, and brought back with it.

            . I heard a cry of Stop thief! and took the prisoner, who was standing still, about one hundred yards from the shop - she had this print hanging on her arm.


                  WILLIAM

             I saw the prisoner in my shop on the 6th of March; I was in the counting-house; Mrs. Hodges made an alarm, and the prisoner was brought back - the print has my mark on it.

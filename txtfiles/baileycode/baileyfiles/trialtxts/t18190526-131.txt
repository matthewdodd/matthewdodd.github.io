                  WILLIAM 
                  ALLEN
               



            . I am a horse-dealer
, and live in Colchester-street, Whitechapel


; the prisoners lived behind my yard. On the 28th of May I lost about three quarters of oats out of my stable.

            . I am an officer. The prisoners were brought to the watch-house about four o'clock in the morningof the 28th of May, with three sacks of oats. I found three keys on 
               
                  John 
                  Wells
               



            , one of which opened Allen's front gate - on 
               
                  George 
                  Wells
               



             I found a key, which opened the loft where the oats were kept.
JOHN DANGATE. I am a watchman. On Friday, the 28th of May, at half-past two o'clock in the morning, Dorkin called me to his assistance - I went into the prosecutor's lower yard, found nobody there, and returned to the upper yard. I got on the roof of an outhouse, then on the gutter-spout of Allen's stable, and found the prisoner, 
               
                  George 
                  Wells
               



            , who was in the act of throwing a sack of oats over. I called to Dorkin that I had found one. He went round by the end of the stable, where I saw 
               
                  John 
                  Wells
               



             in the act of drawing one of the sacks into the stable - we took them to the watch-house.
Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. It was quite light.


                  EPHRAIM 
                  DORKIN
               



            . I was informed that somebody was in the prosecutor's stable, and called Dangate; he took 
               
                  George 
                  Wells
               



             on the roof. I went round, saw 
               
                  John 
                  Wells
               



             dropping down from the building, and collared him. He said,
"Stop, I will make it up with you;" and said he would give me 2 l. to say nothing about it - I said I would not take a bribe. We took them both to the watch-house.

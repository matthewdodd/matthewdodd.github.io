            . I am a carman
, On the 2d of February I saw the prisoner go out of my gate with a bag on his back; I ran after him and collared him; he ran about ten yards round the corner, threw the bag into a waggon, laughed, and ran away. I never saw him again until I took him at Stangate. I went to several places after him, but could not find him - he was my servant four or five years. I found a bushel of oats in the bag; he took it out of my yard. I produce a sample of the bulk.
Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Did he not keep corn of his own there - A. No.
Prisoner's Defence. I had some old junk in the bag when he collared me.

            . I keep an old clothes shop in Long-alley, Moorfields: I bought this gown of the prisoner ( producing it) on Saturday the 30th, in the morning. I bought a lawn apron, two pair of sleeves, a cap and a silk gown; I have sold all the rest of the things. The prisoner, and his wife, and child, came all together to sell them; he said he was just come out of the country and sold them through necessity.
Prisoner's Defence.
I keep a cobler's stall
, buy old shoes in the fair, and sell them again. I exchanged shoes for these things in the fair. As soon as I heard my wife was charged, I went and gave myself up.

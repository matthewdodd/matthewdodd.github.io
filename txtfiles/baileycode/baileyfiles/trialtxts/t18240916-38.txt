            . I took out 5 s. in halfpence with the basket of bread on the 21st of July, and met the prisoner at Brompton; he asked if he should go with me. I said he might if he liked - he did so, and I went into a house at the corner of New-street, Brompton, and left my basket at the door with the 5 s. in it - he was with it. I did not miss the halfpence till about half an hour afterwards when I looked for them to pay away; he denied having them. I said there had been no person at the basket but him and me, and I would have him searched - he then ran away. I pursued and took him about one hundred yards off - the basket was a covered one and on a two wheeled truck.

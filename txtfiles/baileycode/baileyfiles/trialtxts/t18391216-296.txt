WILLIAM WINDSOR
. I am in the service of Mr. Phillips, of Lloydsquare, Clerkenwell. On the evening of the 6th of December, about five o'clock, I saw the prisoner against the door of Mr. Watkins, a linen-draper, at the corner of Exmouth-street—I saw him draw something from the door—I was on horseback—I got off, gave the horse to somebody, pursued, and overtook him about two hundred yards from the place—he was running—I brought him to the station-house, and there he gave out of his apron, which was before him, a piece containing seven handkerchiefs.





JAMES WATKINS
. I am a linen-draper, and live in Exmouth-street—these handkerchiefs are mine.





WILLIAM BRADLEY
. I am a policeman. I received the prisoner in charge, with the handkerchiefs.





WILLIAM FITZGERALD
 (police-constable N 255.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction—I know him—I had him in custody, on the 8th of April, for stealing a tub of oysters—he is the person named in the certificate—he was tried in the name of Cornish—(read.)




GUILTY

Transported for Seven Years.

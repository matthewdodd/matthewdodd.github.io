            . I found the prisoner coming out of the court with some lead upon his shoulder; I asked him what he had got; he made no answer but threw the lead down and ran away, I called out stop thief; he was taken in about 200 yards.

I was coming home, I heard the cry of stop thief; I stopt to see what was the matter, and they laid hold of me: it is unlikely I should be able to cut that lead myself.

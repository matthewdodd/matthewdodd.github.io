            . I am wife to William; I keep a chandler's shop near the brick field. On the 16th of January I lost a shirt and gown, apron, and handkerchief, from off a line in my kitchen; I also had lost a silver tea spoon on the 14th in the morning; I took up the prisoner on the 7th of February, and before the Justice she said she stole the gown and shirt out of the kitchen, and sold the shirt in thieving-lane for 18 d. and that she had pawned the gown, and carried me to the place; the people knowing her character, had stopped it, so I got that again.

1580. 




JOHN COONE
was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
19th of May, 19 yards of carpet, value 14s.; the goods of 



John Naylor.






WILLIAM ADKINS.
About five o'clock in the afternoon of the 9th of May, I saw the prisoner come away from the step of Mr. Naylor's door, in Titchfield-street, with a piece of carpet in front of him, he was putting his apron over it—the carpet has not been found—it was streaked with red—he walked quite slowly off the step, I thought it a slovenly way of taking goods out, it did not strike me it was a robbery, but it did afterwards, and I went to Mr. Naylor, and called to him—he did not hear me at first, and the prisoner got off—on the Thursday following, I saw him in custody, and knew him to be the same person—the officer brought in two prisoners—and I knew this prisoner directly—he was taken from my description.

Prisoner. Q. Why did you not take me? A. I did not know but that you were the shop-boy.





JOHN NAYLOR.
The carpet was mine—Adkins called my attention to it—there were nineteen yards of it—there was a good deal of red in it, and some green, and some yellow—it was worth 14s.—Adkins described the lad who took it, and the prisoner answers his description.





STEPHEN THORNTON
(police-sergeant E4.) I heard a description of the prisoner, and took him in Duke-street, Grosvenor-square.

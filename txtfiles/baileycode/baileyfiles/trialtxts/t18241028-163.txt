            . I had the care of this beef which was hanging in the market. About two o'clock in the morning I saw the prisoner come and take the beef off the hook, and run away with it; it was about 20 lbs. weight. I followed, and stopped him, without losing sight of him. I had not seen him about the market before; he had left his shoes and stockings behind him, but he went for them afterwards, to the door of the Cape of Good Hope, public-house.

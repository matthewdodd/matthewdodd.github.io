SARAH BELL
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
14th of February, 1 cloak, value 1l. 5s.; and 1 gown, value 18s.; the goods of 



Charlotte Bell.






CHARLOTTE BELL
. The prisoner is my elder sister, and lived with my mother, at No. 21, Baltic-street—I had been out to service, and returned home on Wednesday, the 11th of February—my sister sometimes goes away for a week together, without my mother's consent—when I went

home, she was at home—she went away afterwards for a few nights, without leave—on Saturday, the 14th of February, at nine o'clock, my mother and I went out, and locked the room door on the first floor, leaving this property all secure—we returned in about half an hour, and I saw my sister in the street—I said nothing to her—we went up to our room, and found the door broken open—the staple was drawn—I missed a gown and cloak out of a band-box, which I found opened—I never allowed the prisoner to pawn them—I was looking for a situation.





JOHN STANTON
. I am servant to a pawnbroker in Redcross-street. I have a gown and cloak pawned by the prisoner, in the name of S. Bell, on Saturday night, the 14th of February.





MARY BELL
. I am the prisoner's mother. I have heard my daughter's evidence—it is correct—the prisoner has got into bad company, and I believe goes on the town.





WILLIAM BARTLETT
. I am a policeman. I apprehended the prisoner, and asked if she knew any thing about these things—she said she knew nothing whatever about them.




GUILTY
. Aged 22.—


Transported for Seven Years.

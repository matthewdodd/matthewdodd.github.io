            . I am apprenticed to a surgeon and apothecary
. I was going up Drury-lane, between ten and eleven o'clock on the night of the day in the indictment, and I met the prisoner, and went with her into a house of ill-fame, in Russelcourt


. After being there about a quarter of an hour, or twenty minutes, she made an excuse for going away. Immediately on her going, I missed my watch, a gold chain, and key. I informed the people of the house, and by advice, made application at Bow-street, and got two officers, who found the prisoner and the watch.

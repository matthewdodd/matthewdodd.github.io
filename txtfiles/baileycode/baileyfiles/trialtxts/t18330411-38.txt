             was indicted for 


               stealing, on the 8th of March

            , the goods of 
               
                  John

            . I am waiter to Mr. 
               
                  John 
                  Cuff
               



             and another, at the Freemasons' tavern, Great Queen-street


 - the prisoner was occasionally employed as assistant waiter
 there; this is our property, but we did not miss it till it was found.

            . I live at No. 47, Clerkenwellgreen, and deal in gold and silver. The prisoner brought these spoons to me on a Saturday, I think it was the 9th of March - I looked at it through a glass, and saw traces of"Freemasons' tavern" on it; I then gave information - he had brought two or three before this, which made me look at it more particularly.

             (Police-constable F 35.) I took the prisoner into custody - he told me on the way to the station that he had taken the spoons, and it was of no use denying it - unless Mr. Cuff forgave him, without mentioning the circumstance, he would rather be transported; in searching the room to which he directed me as his (and of which I found the key in his pocket) I found two files, with silver filings in them.
MR. BANKS. These are our spoons - the prisoner had not been employed there that day; there are sixteen or eighteen spoons a year lost from there, for which the waiters are responsible.



               GUILTY
            . Aged 43. - 


               Transported for Seven Years
            .

            . I am the wife of Theophilus Potter - we keep a shop
 in Warwick-place, Kingsland-road


, and sell cigars. I was coming from the parlour into the shop on the 31st of May, and saw the prisoner put his hand into the box, take something out, and put it into his side pocket; I seized him by the collar, turned him round, and said, "What are you about?" I was calling my husband, and he got from my grasp - he ran out; some persons outside called the Policeman - I considered the articles not worth while saying any thing about, but the Policeman took him.

            . I am a Police-constable I saw the prisoner come out of the shop, and run off; I caught him, and took him back - the cigars had been taken from him by the prosecutrix before he went out.
Prisoner's Defence. I was going to the back of Kingsland-road - two gentlemen came and said I had been stealing some cigars; the Policeman said I had thrown some into the field - he took to the shop, and the lady said I was not the boy.

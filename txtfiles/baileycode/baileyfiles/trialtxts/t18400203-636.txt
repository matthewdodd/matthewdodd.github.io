THOMAS ISAACS
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
14th of January, 5 hurdles, value 1l., the goods of 



George James Nicholson.






CHRISTOPHER NORTH
 (police-sergeant N 17.) At half-past twelve o'clock in the day, on the 14th of January, I was in Hornsey-road—I saw the prisoner alone, drawing a truck—he saw me, left the truck, and went to a brewhouse—he remained there about two minutes, then came out, and went to a beer-shop about forty yards off—he remained there three or four

minutes—he then came out, went to the truck, and took possession of it—I asked him what he had got—he said, old iron, which he had bought at Finchley, two doors from the Red Lion public-house—I took him, and found the owner—this is it.





JOHN DUCK
. I am in the service of George James Nicholson, of Crouch-end, Hornsey. I am positive these hurdles are his—they were taken from the hedge-side, and from the gate—I have seen the prisoner before in the slip, and said, "What business have you here?" and he ran and got over the gate at the bottom.

Prisoner's Defence. He never saw me there.




GUILTY
.* Aged 21.—


Transported for Seven Years.

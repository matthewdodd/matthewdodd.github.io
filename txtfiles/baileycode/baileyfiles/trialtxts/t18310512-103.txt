            . I am the wife of Richard Allmond - he is clerk
 to Mr. Mabely, of Bread-street. The prisoner was employed as a char-woman
 to me, two days every week, for about a year and a half. The gentleman, where I live, lost some articles, and I missed a pair of spectacles - I told the prisoner of it, and she said she thought I had taken them out when I went to the butcher's, as she had seen me with them in my hand - the gentleman in my house sent for an officer.

            . I am an officer. I was sent for, and on searching the prisoner's lodging I found a duplicate of a pair of spectacles and a shirt - I showed the duplicate to the prosecutrix; the prisoner said they were not the prosecutrix's spectacles - I said I thought they were- she afterwards said they were, and she had pawned them through distress.

            . I am a constable. I attended at Mr. Maberley's to search the cutters. I laid hold of the prisoner; I took from him this piece of cloth; it was wrapped round his body. I am sure he is the man.
MR. STEVENS. The prisoner was a cutter

 there. There is the same mark upon that cloth as all the others. There is about a yard and a quarter.
Prisoner's Defence. My lord, during the time I was in Mr. Maberley's employ I have been extremely careful in cutting the articles entrusted to me, and having saved a yard out of the cloth delivered to me, I did not think any harm in taking it, as I had the satisfaction that every garment I delivered was right. I never had my integrity suspected.
The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.

            ; the things mentioned in the indictment were taken out of her house by the prisoner at the bar.
Q. How do you know that?
J. Anderson. I found her in the house the day following, and charged her with taking them; she own'd she had taken them, and that she had sold them to Mr. Haygath.

            . The prisoner at the bar brought the things mention'd in the indictment to me this day fortnight, and the day after the last evidence came to inquire of me if I had bought such things. I told her I had.
Q. What are you?
Haygath. I am a founder.
Q. What did you give her per lb?
Haygath. I gave her 8 d per lb; they came to 2 s. and 3 d. (produced in court.)
Q. to J. Anderson. Do you know these things, whose property are they?
J. Anderson. They are the property of my mistress.
Haygath. The prisoner told me she came from Mr. Smith, a saddler in Gray's Inn-Lane, who, she said, recommended her to me; it is old brass, fit for nothing but melting.
Prisoner's Defence.
I went into the house with a view to get some shavings. I did not intend to take any thing when I went in.

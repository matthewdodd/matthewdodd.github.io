THOMAS NEWMAN. I am a labourer
 in the London Docks, I live in the parish of St George's in the East


. On the 6th of July, an acquaintance brought the prisoner to me, and asked me to let him be with me until he could get a lodging - He slept four nights with me. On Monday, in the morning, I was in the yard cleaning myself, to go to his ship with him, to get his things; I saw him take my watch off the nail - I did not suspect any thing-my wife was there. When I came into the room, he was gone.

            . I am the prosecutor's wife. The prisonerwas in the parlour with me. He asked me to change him a 5l., note. I laid three 1l., notes on the table, and went to the public-house to get a pen and ink - I left him in the room. When I returned, I missed him, the notes, and the watch - He never produced the 5l. note. About three weeks ago I met him, and gave him in charge. I have not seen the property since.
ANTHONY BENNET. I am an officer, I apprehended the prisoner, the prosecutrix swore to him, by his fingers being crooked. He said he spent the money, and pledged the watch.
Prisoner's Defence. I was never in his house - They keep a bad house-the prosecutrix fetched me there.

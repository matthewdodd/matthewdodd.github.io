, in Lisson-street


 - I heard a footstep on the iron of the door, on the 10th of January, and saw the prisoner put his hand towards the brushes - I pursued him about a dozen yards - he had the brushes under his arm, and dropped them - I called, "Stop thief," and Mr. Rowley, the butcher, ran and took him - the prisoner is the man who had been carrying the brushes - when he was taken, he said, "You have got the brushes, what more do you want?" - these are my mistress's.

            . I am a butcher - I was at my shop, and saw the prisoner carrying the brushes - I pursued, and took him - he said, "What do you want? I have got nothing" - I took him back, and we met the young man who had the brushes - the prisoner then said, "You have got the brushes, let me go."(The prisoner put in a written defence, stating that the witnesses were mistaken in his person.)

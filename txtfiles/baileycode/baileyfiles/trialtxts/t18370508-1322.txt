JOHN FINSON
. I am waiter at the Shakspeare's Head. John Rumford was sitting by my side asleep, on the evening of the 11th of April—I saw the prisoner come, put her hand into his pocket, and take out some money—I saw it in her hand, and she put it into her bosom—I sent for the policeman—Rumford is gone to sea.





RICHARD BARBER
 (police-constable K 50.) I went and found the sailor fast asleep on the table, and asked him in the prisoner's presence if he

had lost any money—he said he did not know—I said, "What money should you have?"—he said, "Three half-crowns, three shillings, and a sixpence"—he found it was all gone—on the way, the prisoner said she took one half-crown—I did not search her.





JAMES SHEPHERD
 (police-sergeant K 22.) I searched the prisoner, and found one half-crown and three shillings—she said the three shillings were hers, and the half-crown she took from the sailor.

Prisoner's Defence. I had four shillings in my pocket—I met the prosecutor—I knew him before by drinking in his company—he asked me to give him something to drink, as he had no money—I took him to the Crooked Billet, and called for a pint of porter—I gave a shilling, and they gave me 10d. out—he gave me half a crown to get some mutton chops—that was all I had of him.




GUILTY
. Aged 29.—


Transported for Seven Years.

            . I live in Union-street, Hoxton. On the 16th of June, between eleven and twelve o'clock at night, I was near the New Bridge in the City-road


; I had been out on business - the prisoner ran smack up against me, and said,
"Ah my love," put her arms against me, and in an instant I felt her hand in my breeches pocket - she took 4 s. out. I seized her hand, and endeavoured to take it from her, she made a disturbance - two men came up from behind a wall and took her part, one of them struck me. I kept hold of her, called the watchman, they ran away, and I gave her in charge. I was quite sober. A note has been put into my hands since I came here, threatening my life if I appeared against her.

            . The prisoner was brought to the watch-house, a shilling dropped from her - I found only 1 d. on her. She said two men would come to vindicate her cause. The prosecutor was sober.
The Prisoner's Defence charged the prosecutor with improper conduct towards her.

            . I took no liberties whatever with her.

            . I hired the prisoner to carry my box
 with the things mentioned in the indictment in it, from Turnham-Green


 to Harrow on the Hill


. I gave her a shilling, she never carried them there. I went after her the next day, and found her at Hodsondon-green. She confessed she had broke open my box, and sold some of my things. The woman to whom she had sold them, let me have them again. [Produced in court and deposed to.] She had some of my things on her back.
Prisoner's Defence.
It snowed, I went into an alehouse to drink, they made me drunk, I was not able to carry the things. I laid the box upon a cart, it going by a post, the horses flew, and the cart turned the box down, and the wheels went over it and broke it. A man on the other side the cart helped tie up the things. I went to Hodsondon green, knowing the way thither. There I had more liquor. This kept me stupified in liquor or I should not have done so.

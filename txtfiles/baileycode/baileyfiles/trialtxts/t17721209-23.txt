            . I am a servant to Mr. Low, a turner
, in White-cross-street


. On the 3d of December, about half after five, I had been on an errand; coming up the alley, I met the prisoner coming down, with the stick of Turkey box upon his shoulder, close by the door; I went in and told my mistress; she bid me run after him; I did: the prisoner threw the wood down; I took it up, and brought it back; the prisoner hid himself in a corner, by the Peacock brewhouse; I knew him before; he is a turner.

            . I know the wood is Mr. Low's property; I looked some pieces out, as a purchaser, a few days before; I took away two pieces and left that behind; I saw it before the sitting Alderman, and afterwards before the grand jury; I can be sure to it.

            . I am porter to Mr. Low. About four o'clock last Thursday, week, I had been up stairs; coming down I saw that piece of box at the bottom of the stairs; I turned the piece round and looked at it; about half after five, the maid said she saw the prisoner take that piece away; that she went after him; he threw the wood down and she brought it back.
Prisoner's Defence.
I do not remember taking any wood at all.
He called two witnesses who gave him a good Character.

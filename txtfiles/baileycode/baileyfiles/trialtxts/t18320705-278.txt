            . I am a shoemaker
. I met the prisoner in Brick-lane


 at half-past ten o'clock at night, on the 24th of June; I was sober; I went with her, and gave her a quartern of gin - I took out 6d., and paid for it; I had then two half-crowns, and three halfpence - we went out together, and I felt her draw her hand from my left-hand waistcoat pocket; I accused her of stealing my money: she said I was a liar; I called the Policeman - she then denied it again; she was searched, and the money found on her.

            . (Police-constable H 91). The prosecutor accused the prisoner of robbing him; she denied it till she got to the door of the station - she then said she had robbed him, and would return the money; I found one half-crown, and three halfpence in her bosom - the other half-crown she gave from her pocket.
Prisoner's Defence. I met him; he asked me to have something to drink - we then came out, and he wanted to know if he could go home with me; I said No, not to where I lived - he then asked me to go some where else; I said I did not mind - we went; he told me to go into the house first, and gave me this money.

I live at Islington


; on the 11th of this month I was robbed of my rabbits, and some nails which are here; about six in the morning I got up, and observed my windows broke in the front four panes, and five of the hatches were open, and the rabbits gone as I thought, but we found them afterwards in a bag in the place; the bag was on the bench, just going in at the door; I was speaking to my man, and the prisoner jumped out of the place; my man ran after him, and caught him; the prisoner had been with me before, under a pretence of buying rabbits; I said, oh, you rogue! is this coming to buy rabbits? I do not know whether he said any thing to me; I took three pounds and a half of nails out of the prisoner's pocket, and four picklock keys.

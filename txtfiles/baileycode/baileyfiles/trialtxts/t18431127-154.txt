RICHARD MILLS
 was indicted

 for stealing 1 table-cloth, value 2l., the goods of 



Henry Plunkett Grattan; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






ELIZABETH PUTTOCK
. This table-cloth was put out on the lawn at No. 25, St. John's Wood-road, on the 4th of September, to get out the stains of,

port wine—it is the property of Mr. Henry Plunkett Grattan—it was missed the next morning—this is it—I know it by the stains—the name was on it, but it has been cut off.

Prisoner. Other clothes might have a stain similar to that one, and of course there is more than one of one pattern. Witness. I do not know of any other cloth of the same pattern—we have no more—here are two large stains and one small one—I have not the smallest doubt of it.





HENRY LAWRENCE
, shopman to Mr. Wilson, pawnbroker, Liquorpond-street. This table-cloth was pawned by the prisoner on the 11th of September.





HENRY HOBBS
 (police-constable S 174.) On the 4th of November I was called to take the prisoner at No. 5, North Bank, St. John's Wood—I asked him where he lived—he said at No. 9, Portland-cottages—I went to his father, and asked for his apartment—Bigot pointed out a drawer, in which I found a pocket-book and some duplicates—I took it to the prisoner, and asked if it was his, and he said it was—the duplicate of this table-cloth was in the pocket-book.





MARY ANN BIGOT
. The prisoner lodged with his father—these duplicates were taken from the drawer in which be kept his things.

Prisoner. I bought the cloth in Monmouth-street.





GEORGE JOHN RESTIEAUX
 (police-constable E 49.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction from Mr. Clark's office—the prisoner is the person—I was present at his trial. (read).




GUILTY
. Aged 28.—


Transported for Fourteen Year.

(There was another indictment against the prisoner.)

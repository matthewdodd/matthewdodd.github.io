            , junior, Servant to the Prosecutor, depos'd, that he saw the Prisoner reach his Hand over the Grate, and take the Chocolate, that he pursu'd him, and saw him sling the Chocolate away, and would have got away himself, but this Deponent was too nimble for him.
The Prisoner said in his Defence, that he was so Drunk, he could not stand; but it appear'd he was sober enough to run, the Jury found him 


               guilty to the Value of 10 d.

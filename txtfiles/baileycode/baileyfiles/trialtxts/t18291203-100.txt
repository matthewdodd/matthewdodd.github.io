WILLIAM BRYDIE. I lost a watch, seal, and key, on the 6th of November, out of the bake-house - I hung it on a nail; at one o'clock I went out with some bakings - when I returned the prisoner was there; I went out again, returned, and soon after went out again - when I returned the watch was gone; I got an officer, and had the prisoner taken - he said he had taken it and sold it to a Jew in Monmouth-street, the first shop on the right hand side; I went there with an officer, but found nothing - the Jew was ordered to attend that evening, and the boy said, before the Magistrate, that he sold the watch to him; the Jew denied it.

            . I received charge of the prisoner on the 6th of November; he said at first that he had not taken it, but afterwards said he took it and sold it to a Jew at the corner of Monmouth-street for 5s.

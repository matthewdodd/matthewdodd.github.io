            . On the first of October

 Russel came into my Shop, my Waistcoat and Banjan were behind the Counter; I missed them presently after she was gone, no Body else was in the Room.

            . I charged Russel with them, she said she did not steal them, but another Person did, and gave them to her at the Door, and that she had sold them to the Prisoner, Brown, for three Pence. Brown owned she had them, but would not part with them, for she had bought them and paid for them.

             . The Girl, Russel, told me that she carried them to Brown, who said she would give a Shilling for them, that she gave her but three Pence, and put them into the Closet; the Girl went to her the next Morning, and she said the Things were nailed. I suppose that is a Word used among Thieves. Russel

               Guilty

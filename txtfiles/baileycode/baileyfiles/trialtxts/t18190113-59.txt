            . I keep the Roebuck, public-house, Duke-street, Aldgate


. On the 9th of January, about four o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came to my house, and asked if he could sleep there. I let him a lodging for the night - he paid me sixpence for the bed. In the morning, about half-past seven o'clock, he left, my servant missed the sheets and blanket; Lee took him, brought him back, and found them under his waistcoat. I gave him in charge.

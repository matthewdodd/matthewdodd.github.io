            , in the House of Benjamin Baddily, Nov. 7
.
Benjamin Baddily. The Prisoner came to me as a Servant
, September 22, and was turn'd away Nov. 8. After she was discharged, this Parcel of Cambrick was found conceal'd in her Bed; another Servant found it, and brought it to me. I examined the Stock in my Shop, and found I had lost Cambrick, but I cannot swear to this, because she has destroy'd the Mark. The Fan belongs to a Lady who came to my House on Lord-Mayor's Day to see the Show; 'tis a very particular Thing, and I took particular Notice of it, and swear 'tis the same. The Day after she was discharged, I went in pursuit of her, and found her; I tax'd her with the Goods, and she confess'd she stole the Cambrick while the Family was at Church, and that the Fan was at one Mary Brand's House; she took it off the Table in the Dining-Room; she own'd she took the Fan, the Cambrick, and this Apron. I did promise, (in order to bring her to a Confession) that I would be as favourable to her as I could; but I did not promise her that I would not prosecute her.

                  Brand 
               



            . A Day or two after my Lord-Mayor's Day, the Prisoner brought this Fan to me, to keep for her; she told me that she found it; but when she came so suddenly from her Place, I delivered it to her again; she did not care to take it, and desired I would burn it; I refus'd, and her Master taxing her with it, she return'd it to him.

            . I live with my Brother Baddily; we had a Suspicion that she was not honest, therefore she was turn'd away. The Cambrick being found in the Bed where the Prisoner lay, I went immediately to look over my Things, and miss'd an Apron and a Cap: The Apron she brought again, and confess'd to me that she took it; but as the Mark is taken out, I will not take upon me to swear 'tis the same I lost.

                  Callowell 
               



            . I was the Prisoner's fellow Servant; she desired me, just before she went away, to look in her Bed for some Cambrick which she had bought to make Handkerchiefs, and begg'd I would convey it to her unknown to my Master. I found it, and it was shew'd to my Master.
Mr. Baddily. This is the Cambrick which she confess'd she took from me.
Callowell. She confess'd the same in my hearing.

            . I live with Miss Andrews, and was with her at Mr. Baddily's on Lord-Mayor's Day: My Lady had this Fan with her there; but at Night it was missing, and could not be found.
Prisoner. I know nothing of the Things they charge me with; the Fan indeed I found next Morning in the Dining-Room, and gave it to

            . My husband's name is 
               
                  Owen 
                  Hughes 
               



            , we live at Limehouse; between the 8th and 9th of January I lost the goods mentioned, but know not who took them. I was before the justice with the prisoner and Davis, who was cast last sessions for receiving other stolen goods. (See No. 86, 87) There the prisoner owned he was one that took my things, in company with Christopher and the evidence, we found the copper by the confession of Davis, who told us where he had sold it. (produced in court and deposed to).

            . On Wednesday the 8th day of January last, 
               
                  John 
                  Christopher 
               



            , who was cast last sessions. The prisoner and I all agreed to go and break the prosecutor's warehouse open. Christopher knowing the place, got in, and let us in afterwards, he took away the copper, and we the pot, and sold them to Davis, and divided the money amongst us.
The prisoner had nothing to say in his defence, nor called any witness.

 for stealing, on the 22nd of November, 1 set of chaise-harness, value 1l. 5s., and 1 coat, value 5s., the goods of

HENRY COLE
. The prisoner had been in my employ, at different times, for a year and a half—I lost these things from Drummond-mews—the harness was in the loft, and the coat in the stable—I missed them on the morning the policeman palled me—this is my coat and harness—(looking at them.)





WILLIAM DAVIS
. (police-sergeant L 15.) At half-past five o'clock, on the morning of the 21st of November, I met with the prisoner in Church-way, Somers-town—he had the harness on his shoulder, and the coat on his back—I asked where he was going—he said to his master's house, if I would go he would show me where he got it from—he went to the stable, and when there he threw down the harness, pulled off the coat, and ran away.

Prisoner's Defence. I went into the stable, and the door was open—I took these things to take them to Mr. Coles's house for security.




GUILTY

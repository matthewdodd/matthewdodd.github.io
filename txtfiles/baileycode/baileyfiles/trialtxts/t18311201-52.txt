. On the 14th of November, between one and two o'clock, I saw the prisoner at my gate, as I sat in my parlour; he came in at my gate, and went towards my stable- I thought he was an acquaintance of my lad's; I had a great coat in my chaise, which was standing at my stable door; I saw him go out quite differently dressed to what he had been - I went to my lad, and said, "Do you know that man?" he said, "No, I did not see him;" I took my staff, being a constable, and pursued - he had then got about one hundred yards; he had my coat on, and the tail of it up under his arm - I cried Stop thief! an ostler tried to stop him, and he knocked him down - my lad got up to him, and he cut him down once or twice; two men came up to try to take him, and he used one of them very ill - I got up, and he was then secured; he had thrown off both my coat and his own before he was taken.

            . I live with the prosecutor. I followed the prisoner, and saw him drop the coats - he cut me across the face with a great stick which he had in his hand; two men at last stopped him - I had not lost sight of him; this is my master's coat.
Prisoner. I was in great distress.

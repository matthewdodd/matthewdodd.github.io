            . I am a barber, the prisoner is my apprentice
; there is a passage leads out of my shop into the Swan with Two Necks yard; the boot-catcher having lost a pair of silver buckles, challenged the prisoner with them; I searched him, and found them in his pocket, (produced and deposed to,) I have nothing to say in his praise.
Prisoner's defence.
It is the first crime I ever did, and I never will do the like again.

BARNETT MARKS. I am a slopseller
, and live at Shadwell


. On the 19th of April the prisoner came to my shop - he looked at some waistcoats, and went out suddenly; when he had been gone about five minutes I missed one; he was stopped in the Back-road, and this waistcoat was found under his jacket; he said he had bought it - I said he had not paid for it.
Prisoner. He pulled me in - I know nothing about it; I told him I had no money; I had got a drop of a rum in my head. Witness. He looked at thirteen or fourteen - I first showed him some light ones, this was one of them; he then said he wanted a working waistcoat, and I showed him a blue one - he did not buy any.

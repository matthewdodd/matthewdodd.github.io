            . I am shopman to Mr.
 Thomas Richard Salt, of Charles-street, St. George's


. On the 1st of July a person came into the shop, and asked if I had sold anything from the door; I said No - they said they had seen a person unpin a jacket, and go down the street; I went out, and saw the prisoner drop this jacket, which I took up - I saw him stopped by another person; I had lost sight of him for one minute, but I am quite sure of his person - it hung about half within the door.

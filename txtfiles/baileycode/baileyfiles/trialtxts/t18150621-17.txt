            . I am coachman to Mr. White. I lost the coach glass at the Hare and Hounds-yard, Islington


. I saw it the night before it was lost, about eight or nine o'clock, I was called up the next morning about six o'clock, by the watchman, who informed me that he had stopped the prisoner with a coach glass; which turned out to belong to my coach.

            . I am a coachman of Islington At about half past four in the morning, the prisoner passed me in Barnsbury-street; I saw him come out of the yard with a coach glass under his arm, in a bag. I asked him what he had in the bag, and he told me a coach glass, and he was going to get the string mended. I told him, he had stolen it, and I took him back to the yard, where he pointed out to me the coach from which he took it; he did not say he belonged to the coach.

MR. WHITE. I know it to be my coach glass.

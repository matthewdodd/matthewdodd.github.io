             depos'd. That these Goods which were produced in Court, was the property of the Lady Wyvall, and that she being then my Lady's Servant, was the Person that made them up. After Examination of several Witnesses, the Fact appeared plain on the prisoner; for which the Jury brought him in

                  Wild 
               



            , gave the prisoner a very bad Character, which he confirmed upon the old Testament.

HENRY NETTLEFIELD
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
6th of February, 1 handkerchief, value 4s., the goods of 



William Ayscough Wilkinson, from his person.






WILLIAM AYSCOUOH WILKINSON
. I live on Ludgate-hill. On the afternoon of the 6th of February I was in Wych-street, and felt a twitch at my pocket—I turned and saw the prisoner with my handkerchief in his hand—he was going away—I took it from him and seized him—I received a blow from another person, and was tripped up—I seized the other man, and we were all down together—we rolled over and over two or three times—the other man got away, but I kept the prisoner, and, with a great deal of trouble, I got him into the Strand, and gave him to the officer—he struggled violently.





JOHN MAUL
 (police-constable F 56.) I received the prisoner, and have the handkerchief.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
(The prisoner handed in a petition expressing his contrition for the offence. Mr. John Henry Pearce, a boot and shoe-maker, of Pleasant-row, St. George's-in-the-East, gave him a good character.)




GUILTY
. Aged 25.—


Transported for Seven Years.

THOMAS EAVES
 (City police-constable No. 100.) At half-past fiveo'clock on the evening of the 21st of December I was in Fleet-street—I watched the prisoner for about a quarter of an hour, lurking about, and saw her fix on two gentlemen about the centre of the street—she followed them as far as Bridge-street—there they made a stop and conversed about three minutes, she looking in at a window—one of them walked up Fleet-street—the prisoner followed him, and when he got half-way up the street, she lifted up his pocket, and took the handkerchief from him—he walked on—I went and took her—she was pushing it behind her, and dropped it—I lost sight of the gentleman, and do not know his name.

Prisoner. I did not do it. Witness. Yes, you did.




GUILTY
. Aged 17.—


Transported for Ten Years.

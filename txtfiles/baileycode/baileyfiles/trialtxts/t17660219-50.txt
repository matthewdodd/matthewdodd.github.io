            . I live in East Smithfield. About 5 weeks ago I was knocked down and robbed of two shillings; I had been very ill used; the three prisoners went to get me to bed; after they were gone down, I saw Rose Foy come up again, and take the things mentioned in the indictement, ( mentioning them) from off a chest of drawers in my room. I met Chappel two days after, and asked her if she was not one of the girls that wiped the blood off my face. She said she was; I took her to the watch-house, there she acknowledged where the coat and waistcoat were sold in Rosemary-lane. She said Rose Foy sold the rest, but she could not tell where. The other two prisoners were taken up the same night. The person that bought the coat and waistcoat owned he had bought them, and had sold them to a person in Yorkshire, and has sent for them up.
Foy's defence.
I know nothing about the things.
Chappel's defence.
I never made such a confession.
Foy and Chappel,

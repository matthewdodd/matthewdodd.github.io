            . On the 10th of March I lodged at Mrs. Brown's, in Pulteney-court


, in a room below stairs; I went out that day, and left my things and the prisoner in my room; and when I returned she and the things mentioned were gone: I met her one night in Prince's-street, and got her apprehended; she had one of my aprons on: I charged her with the things, she owned she had taken them, and sold the rest of them in Monmouth-street; this she also said before Justice Wright. (The apron produced and deposed to.)

            . I am clerk to Mr. Lloyd.
Q. When did you lose your tobacco? - A. On the nineteenth of September I secreted myself in a part of the warehouse. I saw the prisoner come up the warehouse; he took two handfuls of tobacco from a cask, which he put into his coat pocket, and returned again almost immediately, took two handfuls more, which he put into his breeches pocket. Soon after he went out, I followed him, and collared him, and took hold of his coat pocket, and brought him back. I sent for an officer, who searched his pockets, and took out of his pockets fifteen ounces of tobacco, in the whole, from his coat and breeches pockets, of the value of seven shillings.
Prisoner's Defence. I trust to the mercy of the court.

JEREMIAH HEALEY
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
26th of February, 1 pair of trowsers, value 15s., the goods of 



William Parr; and that he had been previously convicted of felony.






WILLIAM PARR, JUN
. I live with my father, William Parr, who keeps a general sale-shop in Strutton-ground, Westminster. On the evening of the 26th of February the prisoner ran up to the shop-window, snatched these trowsers and ran off with them—I followed him—he threw them down—I scuffled with him, and brought him back—I had seen him lurking about the neighbourhood before, with two companions.





JAMES DALTON
. I am a policeman. I was called to the house, and took him into custody.





JOHN GRIEG
. I am a policeman. I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction from the clerk of the peace at Westminster—(read)—I was a witness at the trial—he is the person.




GUILTY.*—

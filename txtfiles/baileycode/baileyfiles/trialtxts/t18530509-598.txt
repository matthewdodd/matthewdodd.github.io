Edward White, with intent to do him some grievous bodily harm.


MR. M. PRENDERGAST
conducted the Prosecution.






EDWARD WHITE
. The prisoner is my son-in-law; he lived in the house with me at Wapping, and is a carpenter. On 30th April I beard him and his

wife quarrelling—he was lying down in the yard, on top of her breast, battering and kicking her—I did not interfere till he had beaten her three times—I then went out and got hold of him by the hair, and gave him a blow—in going to strike him with a broom I broke the stick in half, but did not strike him—he went away for about five or six minutes, and I sat down in the house with my wife—I heard a very horrid noise, and somebody called out, "Mind the knife!"—my wife got up, opened the stair door, and went out—I followed her—she saw the prisoner, and she directly caught me by the arms, and said, "Go back"—the words were scarcely out of her month, when the prisoner truck me in the chest over her shoulder—I do not know what with—we both followed him—I found him lying on top of his wife again, in the street, but before that he gave me two more blows—one was on the lip, it bled a little—I did not separate him from his wife again; he went away directly he saw me—I followed him about sixty yards, and then returned—I did not know what had happened—I complained of my chest being sore, and my wife examined, and found a wound, which was bleeding—I fainted three times—I afterwards went to Dr. Ross, who dressed the wound—I received no blow in the breast from anybody but the prisoner.

Prisoner. Q. When my wife and I were quarrelling, was I in my sober senses, or rather the worse for liquor? A. You were not very drunk; I know you had taken some liquor.





BRIDGET WHITE
. I am the wife of the last witness. On this Saturday I was very bad in bed—I heard a quarrel and screaming between the prisoner and his wife, and came down stairs twice about it—I saw my husband break the broomstick—the prisoner was not there then—I saw my husband have hold of the prisoner by the hair of his head, and hit him two or three times—the prisoner's wife was in the yard; be had been attacking her before my husband interfered—I got hold of my husband, and separated them—after that the prisoner went out into the street—he was away about a quarter of an hour—while he was out, my husband and I were sitting down in the house, and I heard a voice cry, "Mind the knife!"—that induced me to go to the door, and I saw the prisoner coming from the yard—I returned back, put my hands on my husband's arm, and told him to go back—before I bad said the words, almost, the prisoner struck over my shoulder and hit my husband in the chest—he then went away, and my husband returned to the house; I examined his breast, and saw a wound, and blood on his shirt.

Prisoner. Q. When you heard the words "Mind the knife!" did you see me? A. No, not then—you have been married two years, and have one child—I have heard you say once that you were a little ailing in your head.

DANIEL Ross. I am a surgeon, of Commercial-place, Commercial-road. I examined the prosecutor—he had an incised wound on the front part of the chest, just by the left breast; the edges were clean cut, showing that it was done by a sharp instrument, as a pointed knife—it penetrated the chest, and wounded the left lung—his life was in danger for three or four days—it has healed now—I did not notice any wound on his lip.

Prisoner. Q. Did not you examine my arm? A. No; that was my son, who was called to the station-house.

Prisoner's Defence. He attacked me in the yard, knocked me down, and stunned me; when I came to my senses he was kicking me, and my wife and mother-in-law were standing by; he kicked me in the private parts; I picked up the broom and attempted to strike him, but be had hold of me by the head; the broom split in two, and I struck him with the splintered part of it; I was not possessed of a knife, I never carried one; my father-in-law said he wished

he could separate me and my wife, that he wished her rather to be a common woman in the street than my wife; I am subject to a little weakness, and he should have laid his hand on my shoulder, and spoken easy to me, as my will does.




GUILTY
. Aged 29.—


Transported Ten Years.

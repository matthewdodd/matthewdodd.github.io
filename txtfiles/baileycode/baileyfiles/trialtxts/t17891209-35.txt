: we received all the things mentioned in the indictment; I saw them all; they were in the hammock; they were all put in one box, in the tap-room; it was the first box going in on the right hand; to be left till called for. The prisoners came into our house the 2d of November, and called for a pint of beer, about half after one in the morning, before tide time; I drew them a pint of beer, and they sat in the same box: one of them went out and told the other to call for a pint of beer; but instead of that he followed the other; I looked and saw something hang loose about Briggs, and I suspected him, and I pursued them, and called stop thief; and the constable had stopped them, and the things: one of the prisoners had a coat of the prosecutor's on: Freeyer took them to the watch-house, and the things.

I am constable and patrole of Billingsgate Ward. On Monday the 2d of November I met with Briggs first with a bundle at his back, about fifty yards from the Queen's Head; I asked him what he had got? he said, his clothes, he brought them from Gravesend, and said, he was going to the Tower to get a boat, to go down the river: I took him to the watch-house; going along Farrer came up and called Briggs; as soon as he came up I took him, with the assistance of the watchman, and put them both in the watch-house: Farrer had the prosecutor's coat on; several other things were found upon them, which I have kept separately; here are two coats, one blue, and one black: these things I took from Farrer, viz. one lamb skin waistcoat, value eight shillings, two black satin waistcoats, value ten shillings, two pair of satin breeches, value twelve shillings, an oldish black coat, value fourteen shillings. These things were taken from Briggs, viz. a blue cloth coat, value three pounds, a black cloth coat, value three pounds, four corded dimity waistcoats, value two pounds ten shillings. (Produced and deposed to.) Briggs had all the new things on his shoulder in the hammock.

BRIGGS's DEFENCE.
I had been on board the Two Brothers with Farrer, from six o'clock till near one; I came on shore and saw two men with these things, they ran away from them, and we picked them up.

The PRISONER FARRER made the same defence.

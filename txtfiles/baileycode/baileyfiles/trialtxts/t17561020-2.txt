John Pinchbeck. I am a taylor
, and live at No. 9, in Steward's Rents, with my father in law. The prisoner came to lodge there, and the first night he took away the things mention'd. He was suspected, and taken on the Saturday following, and charged with taking them. He owned he had, and help'd us to the two pair of sheets, one iron, and the pair of shears again.
Catharine Aringdell. The prisoner lodged in my house one night, and took the things away which are mentioned in the indictment. He was taken, and own'd the fact, and sent for his wife. She brought the two pair of sheets, the pressing iron, and pair of shears again.
Prisoner's defence.
I was taken very ill and fouled the sheets in the night, and I took them to the washerwoman to be wash'd, and she pawn'd them; I took the other things to do a job with for a day or two.
Q. to prosecutrix. Did you lay two pair of sheets on the prisoner's bed?
C. Aringdell. I had taken a dirty pair off, and put a clean pair on, and the dirty pair were left in his room that night.

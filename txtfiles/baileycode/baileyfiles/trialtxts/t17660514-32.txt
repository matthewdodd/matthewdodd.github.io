            . I live in Shepherd-street, Hanover-square


, and am a laundress
; the prisoner worked day-work for me in washing; I missed some linen aprons some time in August. I went and found these three (producing three aprons) at Mr. Truelove's, a pawnbroker; the prisoner, before the Justice, owned she had pledged them to Mr. Truelove.
Mr. Truelove. The prosecutrix brought the prisoner to me, and asked if she had pledged any aprons with me; I produced these; I believe the prisoner is the woman that brought them; she would say little or nothing before the Justice.
Prisoner's defence.
They must do as they please; I don't know what to say; I have nothing to say.

            . This note was picked out of my pocket, with others, to the amount of 405 l. at the Horse Guards




, March 31, about 1 o'clock, this was H. No. 240, payable to 
               
                  Henry 
                  Hoare 
               



            , Esq; and Co. dated 17 Feb. 1763, (producing one) this is it; it was paid into the Bank by Mr. Reynolds, a Goldsmith; I heard of it the very day after I was robbed, he came and described it. I had 
               
                  George 
                  Clark 
               



             tried here for stealing these notes. (See No. 174 in this Mayoralty) And one thing I remember, when Clark pressed between the pillar and me, while I was searching my pocket, he went round two women on my left hand, and behind those two women were two men dressed in black, one a tallish man, to the best of my remembrance very like the prisoner at the bar, the other was shorter, but being in such a confusion upon losing my notes, and my eye so fixt upon Clark, whom I suspected, that I did not take that notice so as to be certain as to the prisoner.

                  Reynolds 
               



            . I am a Goldsmith, I live at the bottom of the Minories. On the 31st of March, about 4 or 5 in the afternoon, the prisoner at the bar, and another man, who called himself Brown, came into my shop, and said they wanted some plate, I shewed them some, they were both in deep mourning; Brown said, he was going to settle at Gravesend; they bought to the amount of 27 l. 4 s. 10 d. Brown offered me a Bank note for 200 l. payable to Castles and Wheatley. I told them there very few tradesmen kept so much cash by them, and said have you no smaller notes? then the prisoner said to the other, you have smaller notes, you may as well give them a smaller, upon that Brown delivered to me this 25 l. note here produced, and the prisoner paid me the remainder in money; they both seemed equally concerned in buying the plate and in chusing it out. The prisoner looked out a pair of gold sleeve mocha buttons, I asked him 25 s. for them, he bid me a guinea; one looked out a silver milk pot, then the other looked out another, they had also two pair of salts; the prisoner looked the things out equally as much as the other. Brown said he belonged to the Hector, Williams, that he had belonged to the India trade 21 years; he look'd very brown, more like a Jew; he was considerably shorter than the prisoner; I observed the prisoner was always putting his left hand up to his neck below his ear. My young man made observation on that afterwards, that he had a fear there, which I observed when I saw him before Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            ; they staid in my shop near half an hour, the prisoner drank a glass of rum, and the other a little negus; the next morning looking over a warning, I found such a note was stole, I went immediately to Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            , and told him the affair.
The note read to this purport.

            . I was 15 years of age last Michaelmas. On the last day of March, betwixt the hours of 4 and 5, the man at the bar, and another man, both in black, came to Mr. Reynold's house, they wanted some plate; they asked for a tea-pot, they bought a silver tankard, salt-sellers, 2 milk-pots, a pair of stone shoe-buckles, and in all laid out 27 l. 4 s. I think this man looked the plate out as well as the other. The short one said his name was Brown, he offered my master a note, he said he was going to live at Gravesend; he offered master a large note, master asked him if he had not smaller; then the prisoner said to the other, you have a smaller; then Brown gave master a note of 25 l. the prisoner paid the rest in money, which was 2 guineas and 2 s. I am quite sure the prisoner was one of them, I took particular notice of his face, and minded a scar on the left side of his neck, which he kept rubbing with his hand; I mentioned that to my master the same day after they were gone.

                  Barlow 
               



            , goldsmith and jeweller, in Aldgate High Street. On the 31st of March last, about 9 at night, somebody rang at the door, I opened it, there were two men came in, they said they wanted half a dozen table spoons, and half a dozen of tea spoons; my master was not at home, mistress came into the shop and served them. After they had agreed for the price, one of them pulled out a pocket book, he said he had not money enough, and mistress must change a 20 l. bank note, there were several notes in it; he delivered a 20 l. note to mistress, and she bid me carry it to my master at the Blue Boar Inn, and desire him to come home and change it; the goods came to about 5 l. Mr. Barlow came home and paid the money. As I was going out at the door for my master, I saw two men dressed in mourning, I passed by them, and looked hard at them, and they at me, I having the note in my hand was a little dubious of them; when I returned I saw one of them standing in the same place, the other was gone, to the best of my knowledge the prisoner was one of them, there was a lamp just by, they had bundles under their arms, I believe the prisoner was the man I saw alone, the other was a shorter thick man. I saw the prisoner since at Justice Fielding's on the 7th of June, and I now believe he was one of them; the people that came in, one was a talk thin man pitted with the small pox, dressed in brown, they went away towards White-chapel-bars, I shut the door, and did not observe whether they joyned the two in mourning.

            . On the 29th of September last I was going to my bankers, messrs. Honeywood and Fuller, I had my banker's book in which I keep my accounts with them, in which were the three India bonds mentioned in the indictment; my Lord Mayor's coach was going to Guildhall, when I got to St. Mildred's church




 there was a crowd, my book stood out of my right hand waistcoat pocket, I missed it immediately, but could not see who took it; I went to my broker, Mr.

            ; near the Poultry we met a gentleman, and all got round him while Casey had an opportunity of taking the book out of his pocket; to the best of my knowledge there was a writing on the outside the book, but we soon destroyed that; there were three bonds for an 100 l. each, I took the numbers of them the next day, 21077, 30623, 30687, I am not particular to whom they were payable. We all went to the first tavern we came to, and examined the book, and took the bonds out, and all examined them, I cannot tell the tavern now; we sold them to one

On his cross examination he said he was a dealer in horses, that he had been acquainted with the prisoner more than 3 years, and that they all set out from the Cock Inn that morning for that purpose of picking pockets, and had also many other days besides.

            , and myself, were in company together, waiting about the Bank, to see who should come out with pocket-books that we could take. We saw Mr.

                  Cockburn 
               



             go into the Bank. we followed him, he staid there a little time, he came out again on that side going towards the Change; we followed him into Lombard-street; we all got as near him as we could, and Parsons and Hayes stopped or interrupted him, while Cole had an opportunity to take his pocket-book out of his right-side pocket, to the best of my rememberance Brinklow and I kept on. The book was soon missed, and the gentleman seemed to have a suspicion of Brinklow and me, and followed us, and kept near us till we came to the water side by London-Bridge; he said nothing to us; we called a boat to go over, he called another; the boats came pretty close together; we paid the waterman and got away, he did not follow us any farther; soon after that, Brinklow and I lost each other, being in a hurry I went below London-Bridge, and took water, and then went to one Lumbley's in Golden-Lane, the sign of the Raven and Crown, where I expected they all would have came, (we all frequented that house) I found they were gone to James Hall's, a house in Gray's Inn Lane; I went to the Sun where I used to feed my horses, and was told that Cole had been to enquire for me, and that he was gone to James Hall's; there I found Brinklow, Parsons, Hayes, and Watson, all together. They told me they were glad to see me, they thought I was taken up; there Parsons produced a Bank post-bill for 20 l. they said that was all the notes contained in the pocket-book, it was made payable to 
               
                  Wm 
                  Cockburn 
               



            , No. 9203. I was not certain but that there might be other notes in the book, so I looked in the advertisement, and found only one advertised; I did not chuse to trust my companions, for that was a practice that we all made use of to cheat one another. We offered to sell it to Watson, he bid us but 13 l. for it, they would have had me have taken it at 15 l. I said I would go home, and see if it suited me if I could spare the money, then I would have it. We went to Lumbley's house, all but Watson, there we dined off a leg of lamb and cabbage; I said I did not care to have it, they might go back to Watson, and take the 13 l. Parsons took it, and I apprehend went to Watson; he came back and brought 13 l. we equally divided it among us 5, taking the expence of the day out. When I was before Sir

            , I saw the gentleman that lost the note, who said he remembered me.
On his cross examination he said, he was by trade a wheel-wright, that he kept an inn at Reading about 9 or 10 years ago, that since that he had dealt in horses, and traded in goods, that he had been a thief about 3 years, that he once had a complaint lodged against him before Sir

Q. Did you hear the two prisoners acknowledge any thing?

            .
Wilks. I was bound over to give an account that I had seen Fuller and the prisoner tog ether at my house, the Cock, in Aldersgate-street, they have drank together there, they seemed to be pretty intimate.
Q. How often may they have come to your house?
Wilks. May be half a dozen times; sometimes once, sometimes twice a week.
Q. Do you mean by half a dozen times, 40 times.
Wilks. I cannot tell, I never took particular notice.
James Hall. I live at the Wheat-sheaf in Purple-lane; I have seen the prisoners and Fuller drink together in my house, they may have been at my house 2 or 3 times, I cannot say whether they knew one another.
Q. Were they never but three times at your house?
Hall. I cannot take upon me to say I never saw them but three times.

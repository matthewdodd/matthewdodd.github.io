            . I am the wife of John Daish - we live in Glass-house-yard, Aldersgate-street


. On the 13th of December, about three o'clock, I saw the prisoner on the first floor-stairs - I asked her who she wanted; she said, a person of the name of Edwards, a boot and shoe maker; there is no such person in that house, or in the next; my daughter-in-law came up at the time - I asked the prisoner what she had in her pockets, she said, it was a pair of shoes - I then thought she looked large round the waist, and my daughter said,
"Mother, you are robbed;" the sheets were found round her person; an officer was sent for; the sheets had been taken from a young man's bed in the house - I had seen them safe on the night before, and know them to be mine.

            . I am daughter-in-law of the last witness - I took the sheets from the prisoner; she at first said she found them on the stairs, but afterwards, that she took them off the bed.

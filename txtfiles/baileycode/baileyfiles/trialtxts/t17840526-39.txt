I am a watchman at Aldgate, I saw the prisoner the 22d in the morning, about half past three, with a copper in his right hand, he pushed down an alley about four yards, and dropped the pot and this dish, I pursued him, and lost sight of him in Cox's-square; six days after he was taken, I am sure it is the same man, I knew him before, I can swear to the things.

CHARLES DYER. I live in Park-street, Westminster, and am a surgeon
. On the afternoon of the 5th of August, I was walking near the Stable-yard, in St. James' Park


 - I felt something at my pocket; I turned, and saw the prisoner and two others - the prisoner had my purse in his hand, and he threw it to the others, but I caught it; this is it - it has 10s. 6d. in it; I am sure he had it, and he was nearest to me.

MR. DYER. He was close to me, and I felt the purse taken from my pocket; I turned, and he had it in his hand.

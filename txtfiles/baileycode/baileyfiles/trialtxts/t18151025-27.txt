             were indicted for 


               stealing, on the 4th of October

               Wardens of the Sadler's Company


            .
JOHN LIMBRICK. I am a police officer. On the morning of the 4th of October, we met the two prisoners, one with a basket and the other with a handkerchief. I asked them what they had there; they said, wine, from Sadler's Hall


, which was the perquisites of their father, who was beadle there. I was not satisfied with that answer, and took them both into custody; I took them to the office, and searched them, and found four silver table spoons on 
               
                  Richard 
                  Hunt
               



            , wrapped up in a piece of paper, which is a leaf of this account book, which belongs to Sadler's Hall. I found on 
               
                  William 
                  Hunt
               



             this key, which I delivered to Mr. Clark, at the Hall.

                  LEE
               



            . I am also a police officer, and was in company with the last witness, and found a duplicate for a silver spoon on 
               
                  William 
                  Hunt
               



            ; that spoon appeared by the duplicate to have been pawned at Mr. Essex's, in Aldersgate-street.


                  ROBERT 
                  ESSEX
               



            . I am a pawnbroker, in Aldersgate-street I produce some spoons, pawned at my house; originally there were two pawned, in September, and on the 3rd of October, one was released. and a new duplicate given for the remaining one.

             I am hall-keeper in the Sadler's Company. I know the prisoner William Hunt. In consequence of his father's infirmity as beadle, he was permitted to do his duty. On the 3rd of October, there was a dinner at the Hall. I have looked at the four spoons produced by the officers, and know them to belong to the Company; before they were lost, they had all the Company's arms on them.
MR. 
               
                  THOMAS 
                  CLARKE
               



            . I am clerk to the Sadler's Company. The officer, Limbrick, brought me a key, which opened a small door in the cellar, where on a shelf we found a skeleton key, which opened the wine cellar. I got the treasury broken open, and found two spoons, with the Company's arms filed out; also a file, with silver in the teeth, and a polishing stone, which when used, would take of the marks of the file. In consequence of an information which I received, and which I supposed came from the prisoners, I sent Mr. Ness, my clerk, to them; I made use of neither promise nor threat.


                  CHARLES 
                  NESS
               



            . I was sent to the prisoners in the New Prison, Clerkenwell. 
               
                  William 
                  Hunt
               



             gave me this paper, and said, if that was not sufficient, he would write more. It is a statement of various articles which they have stolen, and how they can be recovered.

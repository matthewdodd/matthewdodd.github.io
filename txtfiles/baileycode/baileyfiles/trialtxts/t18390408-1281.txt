Philip Read, from to person.






PHILIP READ
. On Sunday night, the 24th of March, about a quarter past ten o'clock, I was in Burton-crescent—there was a woman begging charity, and the prisoner was by her side—I was going to give the woman a penny, when I missed my handkerchief from my jacket pocket under my coat—as soon as the woman saw me put my hand into my pocket, she fell down, and appeared to be in a fit—the prisoner ran off—I pursued, took him, and took my handkerchief from him.

Prisoner. My mother and myself met the prosecutor that evening—my mother asked him for charity, and he knocked her down—we then walked to the corner of Camden-street—he took out his handkerchief twice, and put into his pocket again, and then he took it out a third time, and said I had had it, and gave me in charge.





PHILIP READ

GUILTY

Transported for Ten Years.—Convict Ship.

1867. 




DANIEL BRYANT
 and 




HENRY HUDSON
 were indicted for

 stealing, on the 
26th of May, 2 loaves of bread, value 1s. 6d. the goods of 



Thomas Bartlett Young; and that Bryant had been before convicted of felony.






THOMAS BARTLETT YOUNG
. I live in Drummond-street, Euston-square.
These two loaves of bread are mine—I was not at home at the time they were taken.





CHARLES GRINHAM
 (police-constable S 221.) At half-past nine o'clock on the 26th of May, I was in Seymour-street—I saw the prisoners and another—I followed them to Drummond-street—they went to the prosecutor's—Bryant went in on his hands and knees, and brought out two loaves—the other two were outside—they then went to another street, and parted—I took Bryant—I am sure the prisoners are two of them.





ROBERT KNIGHT
 (police-constable S 221.) I produce a certificate of Bryant's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(ready)—the prisoner is the person.
(John Parrott and William Pike gave Hudson a good character.)

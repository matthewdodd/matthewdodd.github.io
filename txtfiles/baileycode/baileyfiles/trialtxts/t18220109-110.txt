            . I am a salesman
, and live in High-street. St. Giles's


. On the 22d of December, about five o'clock, my coat hung at the door, inside the shop; I heard something torn down, and on going to the door. I found the coat gone - I saw the prisoner running, and pursued him calling Stop thief! and when he got about twelve yards off, he threw the coat down; I pursued him about fifty yards, he was stopped; I secured him with difficulty, he fought desperately to get away; I got him into a public-house, and sent for an officer, and when I got back, I found the coat had been torn down, and part of it left behind. I never lost sight of him.

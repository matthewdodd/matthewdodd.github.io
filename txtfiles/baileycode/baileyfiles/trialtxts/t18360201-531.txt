HENRY JACKSON
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
23rd of January, 2lbs. of pork, value 1s., 6d., the goods of 



John Walker; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






JOHN WALKER
. I am a pork-butcher, and live in Exmouth-street, Clerkenwell. About half-past. eight o'clock on the 3rd of January, I was in the shop, and saw the prisoner come up to the window, and take a hand of pork—I went after him, and overtook him about ten yards off with it under his apron—I brought him back—he wanted to be let go, and said he was going to ask the price of it.





THOMAS SHADDICK
 (police-constable G 97.) I received the prisoner in charge with the pork—he said he was not going to steal it, but to buy it—I searched him, and he had not a farthing in his possession.





JOHN JAMES BARNARD
. I am a policeman. I have a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction (read)—I was a witness on the trial, and know him to be the person.

Prisoner. I will thank you to send me out of the county—I have no way of getting my living—I have got a father and a mother-in-law, but they will not keep me.




GUILTY
. Aged 15.—


Transported for Seven Years.

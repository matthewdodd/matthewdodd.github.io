, and taking thence a gold Watch value 16 l. a Diamond Ring value 10 l. 17 silver Spoons value 7 l. 17 silver handled Knives, one Point Cravat value 10 l. and other Goods to a great Value
            . It appeared, that Hays being the Prosecutor's Servant
, but upon some faults committed by him, was treatned to be turned away; the night before the Robbery was committed, having seen the Prosecutor to bed, and how he had placed his Watch, Ring, and other of the Goods, took occasion before morning to steal the Goods, and was gone, but being discovered was brought to confess his taking them, and said they were hid in a Ditch in St. George's Fields; search being made, the Plate was carried away by one Gray, and some of the Confederates, upon notice of his being taken, only the Prosecutor's Table-Basket was found on the place; and when Hays was seized, some pieces of the plate bruised was found about him; and some of the Goods were found at Pawnbrokers. The Prisoner said, that Gray coming to his Master's House, knockt, and he let him in, and having gone out for some drink, Gray in the mean time robbed the House, and was gone before he return'd, which did not avail him. And nothing appearing against Mackdonald, not any thing as to the Burglary, the Jury 

               acquitted
             Mackdonald, and found Hays 


               guilty of Felony only
            .

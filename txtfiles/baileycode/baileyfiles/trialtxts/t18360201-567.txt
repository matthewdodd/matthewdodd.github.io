HENRY SMITH
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
18th of January, 1 glazier's diamond, value 16s., the goods of 



John Owen Smith; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






JOHN OWEN SMITH
. I am a painter, and live in Ironmonger-street, St. Luke's. The prisoner is my son—I missed a glazier's diamond from my house, on the 18th of January—I charged him with taking it—I did not threaten him—I have tried every way I possibly could to make him better—I told him he would have to go back from whence he came—he is my only child—my wife has been dead six years—he told me that I could find the diamond at Mr. Matthews, in Whitecross-street.





WILLIAM HENRY ROYES
. I am shopman to Mr. Matthews, a pawnbroker, in Whitecross-street. I produce the diamond—I took it in of a lad about the prison—it is worth seven or eight shillings.





WILLIAM GARROD
. I am a policeman. I took the prisoner into custody.





MATTHEW PEAK
. I am a policeman. I got this certificate of the Prisoner's conviction from Hick's Hall (read)—the prisoner is the same boy that was tried.




GUILTY
. Aged 14.—


Transported for Seven Years.

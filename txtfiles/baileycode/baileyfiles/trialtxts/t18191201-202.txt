            , who is a gardener
, and lives in London-fields, Hackney


. On the 12th of November, about eight o'clock, the prisoners, Imber, Hunt, and another, who has escaped, came into the shop to buy fruit. They noticed the clock that was in theshop, and Hunt and the other went up to it - the spoons were just by it. They bought an apple and left the shop. I missed the spoons directly, went after them with my husband, overtook them in a few minutes with Wright, and gave them in charge.
JOHN GARVA. I am a constable of Hackney. I was informed the boys had stolen the spoons, and went out. I secured Wright, the other two were about fifty yards off; I secured them, but could not find the fourth. I found the spoons in Wright's hat.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
WRIGHT'S Defence. A young man sold them to me for 6 d. I never saw the boys. I put them into my hat, as my pockets had holes.

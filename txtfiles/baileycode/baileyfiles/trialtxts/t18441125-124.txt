ALFRED HERBERT
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
6th of Nov., 1 pair of boots, value 14s., the goods of 



Ambrose Joy; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






AMBROSE JOY
. I am a bootmaker, and live in Upper-street, Islington. On the 16th of Nov., about nine o'clock in the morning, I met the prisoner coming from my shop with these boots under his arm—he was about two feet from the shop—I caught him, and asked him how he came by them—he said a young lady had served him—these boots are mine—I took the prisoner back into the shop—I have only my daughter who serves in the shop.

Cross-examined by
MR. PAYNE. Q. As you were going along the street, you met him? A. Yes—he was in the street—I know these boots by the style of them altogether.





JANE JOY
. I am the prosecutor's daughter. I was at home on the morning of the 16th of Nov. from eight till ten o'clock—I did not see the prisoner that day—I did not serve him with any boots, or anything else—I was not in the shop at all.





THOMAS TYLER
 (police-constable N 275.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got at Mr. Clark's office—(read)—he was convicted for stealing one inkstand, value 3l. 15s., and two glass bottles, 5s.—he had four months in the House of Correction—I was present—he is the man.
(Matthew Walmsley, a jeweller, Felix-place, Cambridgeheath, and Augusta Walmsley, his wife, gave the prisoner a good character.)




GUILTY
. Aged 22.—


Transported for Seven Years

             sworn.
I am clerk to the Lords of Trade; about three or four days previous to my being informed of these things being missing, I saw the prisoner in the passage leading from the room that is usually occupied by Lord Hawksbury, as a private room to the room where the committee sit; he avoided me, and said he wanted a Mr. Brown, but could not tell who he belonged to, but he was sent by some person, a clerk in the India-house; I directed him to the Secretary of State's-office; I had no suspicion of him at the time, but when I heard that the ink stands were missing, I thought of him; I described the prisoner.

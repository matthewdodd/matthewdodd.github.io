NICHOLAS SADLIER
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
12th of September, one coat, value £3, and one shawl, value 1s., the goods of 



Joseph Thyer.







JOSEPH THYER
. I am a coachman, and live in Ridinghouse-lane. On the 12th of September I was ordered out with my carriage—I saw the prisoner leaning against the harness-room door—I told him to go and ask my wife for my gaiters and white handkerchief, which he did, and I gave him 1d.—I did not authorize him to get any thing else.





ELIZABETH THYER
. I am the prosecutor's daughter. The prisoner came for the gaiters and handkerchief—I gave them to him—in about five minutes he came again, and said Mr. Thyer had sent him for the coat and shawl—I gave them to him in consequence of that—I should not have done so if he had not represented that he came from Mr. Thyer.

Prisoner. My father knows that I was at home all the time. Witness. I am sure he is the person.




GUILTY.* Aged 12.—


Transported for Seven Years—Convict Ship.

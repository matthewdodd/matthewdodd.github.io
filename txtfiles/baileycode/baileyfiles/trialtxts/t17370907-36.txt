            . I saw the Prisoner steal the Cake of Bread, from this Gentleman's Gingerbread-Stall; he put it under his Arm, and I follow'd the Prisoner and held him till the Gentleman that own'd it came up and took hold of him.

            . I swear to the Cake of Ginger-bread. - 'tis mine.
Tapling. 'Twas I that took the Thief, and the Gentleman asked me my Name, and said he would prosecute him, if it cost him five hundred Pounds. I did take hold of the Prisoner indeed, and the Gentleman asked me my Name, and made me come here against the Prisoner.
Prisoner. I had been drinking in a Booth, and was in Liquor; so meeting with a Boy who had won this Cake at the Turnabout Thing, I bought it of him. They say, I am a notify'd Thief, but it will appear quite contrary, for I am an innocent young Fellow. 

               Guilty

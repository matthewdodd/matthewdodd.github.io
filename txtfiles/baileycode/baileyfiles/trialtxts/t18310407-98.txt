            . On the 25th of February I was in Leadenhall-street


, and saw the prisoner and another person standing against Mr. Welsford's shop - it struck me they were at no good; I passed them, then turned back, and crossed the road - I saw the other one go into the shop, and bring out something, which he gave the prisoenr; I caught the prisoner, and took him back with the two cloaks, which he was rolling up - he had a kind of fisherman's jacket on; the other ran away.

            . These are his cloaks, and were inside the door on the left-hand side - I know nothing of the prisoner.
Prisoner's Defence. I was walking up the street, and in crossing some person came by me with something in his arms - this witness went to stop him, and he threw down this and got away.

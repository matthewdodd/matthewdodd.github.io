             (police-constable M 45). I was on Blackfriars-bridge


, about seven o'clock in the evening of the 6th of May - I saw the two prisoners, whom I had known before - I saw Hitchcock take a handkerchief from a gentleman's pocket, and give it to Wright, who was with him - they had been in conversation for four or five minutes, and had another person with them - Wright put the handkerchief into his trousers pocket - I spoke to the gentleman, then went and took the prisoners - the gentleman identified the handkerchief at the Compter - he said his name was Wisdall, and he was a native of York, but he was then residing at the Castle and Falcon - he has not attended since.

, at near nine o'clock in the evening, there was a show; I heard a female scream Stop thief! I saw the prisoner draw his hand from Mrs. Cheeseman's side, make a stride, and run off; he was stopped by a neighbour, and given into my hands.
Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Are you sure you are not mistaken in his person? A. Yes, there was a crowd near him, but he was out of the crowd.

; we live in Collingwood-street. On the 4th of February I was standing with my child in my arms, looking at the show; I felt the prisoner brush by my side - I turned to look at him, and put my hand outside my clothes and felt my money; I put my hand in my pocket to be more certain, and felt my purse and money - I pulled my gown over it; I then saw the prisoner by my side again - my child being heavy, I put my right hand to its back; I then felt the prisoner touch me again, and missed my money - I turned and looked at him; he walked one or two steps - I caught hold of him; he broke from me, and I cried Stop thief! three or four times; he got a few yards, and was stopped -I had 6s. 9 1/2d. in my purse.
Cross-examined. Q. Has the purse been found? A. No; there was no person on my right hand but the prisoner; there were a good many on my left.

JULIA SMITH
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
1st of June, 40 yards of lace, value 40s., the goods of 




Uriah Macey; and that she had been before convicted of felony.






JOSEPH ARMSTRONG
 I live in Great Tichfield-street, and am shopman to Uriah Macey, a linen-draper. About four o'clock, on the 1st of June, the prisoner came to the shop, and asked for some lace—I showed her some in the box, and afterwards in another she said there was none to suit her—she went to the door, and asked the price of some prints there—I followed

her, and saw the corner of a card of lace under her shawl—she went back to the chair she had been sitting in, and sat down—I then took up the corner of her shawl, and accused her of having the card of lace—she denied having it, and then ran out of the shop—I followed her, and she was given in charge of the policeman—this is the lace.

Prisoner. I asked him for a bit of edging—I did not want to give more than 5d. a yard—he accused me of having the card of lace—if I had it, why had I not run away at first—I had the misfortune of being here before, with another young woman, for taking a pair of shoes.





THOMAS STYLES
 (police-constable E 157.) I was coming up Great Tichfield-street. I saw Armstrong and his master, at a little after four o'clock—I went down Foley-street, and took the prisoner—I took her back to the shop—she denied taking this lace—I took her down to Marylebone station-house, and searched her—I found nothing on her but six pennyworth of half-pence.





JAMES ESSEX
 (police-constable E 68.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, in the name of Julia Conan (read)—she is the person that was tried in this court.

            . I am a journeyman baker
. On the 8th of December, at one o'clock in the morning, I was in Whitechapel, going home, having been with some friends - I was quite sober, and did not see the prisoner till she ran up and snatched my handkerchief off my neck - it was loosely tied round; she ran away. I called the watchman; who stopped her in my sight.

            . I am a watchman. I heard a call of Watch three times, ran, and stopped the prisoner turning the corner, with this handkerchief in her hand. I had one end of it in my hand at the watch-house; she snatched it from me, and dropped it. The prosecutor was sober.

On the 28th of March, I was in my shop, at twenty minutes after twelve o'clock—I saw the prisoners together—I watched them—I saw Witford take the handkerchief from the prosecutor's pocket, and give it to Hickman—I tried to seize them both, but I could not—I seized Hickman, and found it in his trowsers' flap—I called the prosecutor, who identified it, and described the marks on it.
----BATES (City police-constable No. 34.) I took Hickman and the handkerchief.

            . I was at Mrs. Cornely's, with my master lord Henley. I lost my watch in the mob; I made enquiry, and found the constables had the prisoner in custody.
Arthur Hewit. Between twelve and one in the morning, I had the prisoner given in charge to me. I took him into Mrs. Cornely's hall; I had hold of his collar. The prisoner dropped this watch; I saw it in his hand, he took it out of his left hand breeches pocket. When I charged him with it, he denied it.
Q. from the Prisoner. Was not another young fellow charged with it as well as me?
Hewit. Yes, there was, and he was near, but the prisoner dropped the watch.

. They held my hands; I could not take it without putting my hands to my pockets.
He called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.

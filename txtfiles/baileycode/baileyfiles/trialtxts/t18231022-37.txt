            . I am a tailor
, and live in the Commercial-road, the prisoner was my apprentice
, I took him from the Refuge for the Destitute, three months before this - he had been there two years - he behaved well. On the 28th of August, I gave him five sovereigns to pay Mr. Wells, of Bishopsgate-street - he never returned. I found him three weeks afterwards at a public-house at Windsor, in consequence of information, and charged him with it - he acknowledged it, and said he would not do it again, that he had spent it all but 18 d., which he gave me.


                  WILLIAM

            . I am in Mr. Wells's service, and attend in the shop. Newling was indebted to my master, in August last - the prisoner brought no money on the 28th; he had been at the shop several times previous, but not on that day, nor since.

I know the prisoner; she lived in my house; she came to lodge there on the 2d of August; on the 16th, I missed a tablecloth and other articles, out of my bed-chamber; I saw it there the day before, on the table, about three in the afternoon; I missed it the next morning; I suspected her for it; and asked her about it; and she denied it; on the Monday, I enquired in her name, at Mr. Jones's, the pawnbroker's, about three doors off; I asked him if such a thing was pawned on the Saturday, between six and seven; I saw the table-cloth; I told him to look back to the 2d of August, in his books; for I had missed several things between the 2d and that time; I missed a blue apron on the 11th; I never saw that again; the other articles are in another indictment.
Prisoner. Did I take it out of the dining room? - She was in there, cleaning the dining room out that day.

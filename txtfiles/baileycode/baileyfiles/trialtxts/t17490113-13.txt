I have miss'd money several times out of my buroe; upon taxing him with it, he confess'd he had taken 16 s. it was four half crowns and six shillings at one time, he produc'd the money, and here is a shilling or two more; he laid it all down and said it was my money; he speak of late a great deal of money more than we knew he could honestly come by.

             prisoner was my servant, on Thursday the 8th of Dec. having reason to suspect him of dishonesty, by spending more money than we thought he could honestly come by, upon questioning him, he pretended he received it in a letter; the post-man coming in at the time, I ask'd him if ever he brought my servant any money in a letter; he said he never brought him any such letter. The prisoner confess'd it the next day, and sign'd his own confession before Justice Fielding.

            . The young Man that had my Handkerchief, asked me what Sort of a Handkerchief it was. and I said, it was a red and yellow India Handkerchief; another thing that I described it by was, that it was not made.

            . On the 24th of July I saw the Prisoner take this Handkerchief out of the Prosecutor's right-hand Coat Pocket. I pursued him close, and he got on the other Side of the Way. I could not see him do any thing with it, but seemingly he dropped it. I seized him opposite to the New Church in the Strand; he desired to be searched, and said he had none of it. I said positively he was the Man that took it, - The Handkerchief I think was found within three Yards of the Place, where I seized him; - he was never out of my Sight, nor the Distance of Ten Yards from me before he was taken. - He desired to be excus'd.

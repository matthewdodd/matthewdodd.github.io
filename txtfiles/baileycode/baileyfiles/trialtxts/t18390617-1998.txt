John Thome, his master, being fixed to a building.






GEORGE SYKES
. I am a bricklayer. I work for Mr. John Thome—he is a brewer, and lives in South Lambeth—the prisoner was his undergardener, and worked by the day—on the 18th of May I left, and did not go again till the 21st—as I was going along I met Mr. James Thome, who told me there had been some lead missed—but on the 18th I had missed fifteen feet—fifteen feet from the gutter of the stable had been gone on the Saturday, and the remaining fifteen were gone on the Tuesday morning—it was all gone—the prisoner had access to the place—I saw some lead afterwards fitted to the place—it matched exactly—I have no doubt it came from that gutter.





THOMAS EMERSON
 (police-constable V 142.) I met the prisoner at half-past seven o'clock on the 20th of May, carrying this lead on his arm, near to the Crown and Thistle public-house—I crossed, and asked what he had got—he said, "A bit of lead"—I took him, and on the way to the station-house he ran from me—I took him again, and then he said he had had the lead two years from Mr. Cubitt's premises—I found where it came from, and saw it fitted to the prosecutor's gutter—it tallied in all respects—about thirty feet had been taken, and this is part of it.




GUILTY
. Aged 35.—


Transported for Seven Years.

 in Beak-street, Golden-square


. On the 28th of December, between five and six o'clock in the evening, I was sitting in the parlour, saw the prisoner come into the shop, take the jar of snuff out of the window, and run out with it. I ran after him, called out Stop thief! he threw the jar down at the bottom of the street, and broke it. He was caught in Wild-street, and brought back. I never lost sight of him - I knew him before. The jar was half full of snuff.

I had been out with beer, and when I came back my mistress was sitting in the room frightened, and desired me to go backwards as she heard a noise; I took a candle and went into the wash-house and saw the prisoner pulling the copper out of the brickwork; I pulled him off the brickwork.
Court. Had he cut it? - He had put the knife he had under it; it was about a quarter past ten o'clock in the evening.
Court to Prosecutor. Did you see the copper after this? - Yes, the copper was removed some inches up; the brickwork and mortar was tore away, and the edges cut as they are now.

JOSEPH HODGE
. I am shopman to Thomas Steel, and live at No. 65, High Holborn. He keeps a shoe shop—he had some boots on the 4th of September—I saw them safe between eleven and twelve o'clock—they were gone about twelve—these are them (looking at them.)





JAMES BURDEN
. I live at No. 37, High-street, Camden-town. About ten minutes after twelve o'clock on the day in question I saw the prisoner turning the corner of Featherstone-buildings with a pair of boots—I followed him, thinking it was not right, and he was stopped with the boots.





JOSEPH BARFIELD
. I live at Battle-bridge. A few minutes after twelve o'clock I saw the prisoner running with the boots—I took him with them.




GUILTY
.* Aged 21.—


Transported for Seven Years.

CHARLES SHIRLEY
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
6th of August, 1 handkerchief, value 6d., the goods of 



Edward Francis Rimbault, from his person; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






EDWARD FRANCIS RIMBAULT
. I live in Denmark-street, St. Giles's. On the 6th of August, between eleven and twelve o'clock, I was coming through High-street, St. Giles's, with three ladies—the prisoner tried to snatch a scarf from a lady who was walking with me, but did not succeed—the policeman came up and said he would take him—I then went to the station, and there found my handkerchief—I had not missed it, but it is mine, and I had then lost it.

Prisoner. Q. Is there any mark on it? A. No; but I positively swear to it—I had put it into my pocket just before I came out, because it was worth nothing, having lost so many in the neighbourhood.





GEORGE JOHN RESTIEAUX
 (policeman.) About twelve o'clock on Sunday night, the 6th of August, I saw the prisoner with three others—the prisoner left the others, and went behind the prosecutor—he tried to get the lady's scarf, and did not—he ran off very fast—I spoke to the prosecutor, and then went and took the prisoner, as I knew where to find him—I found on him this handkerchief.

Prisoner. I told him I bought it at Kennington; I told him the colour before he took it out of my pocket.





JOSEPH WHEELER
. I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the man.




GUILTY
. Aged 19.—


Transported for Ten Years.

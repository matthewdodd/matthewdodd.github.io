            . My wife and I were going up Dorset-street, Spital Fields; as I turned round, I saw a young fellow run by me in velveteen breeches and jacket; and I saw the prisoner run down with the truss under his arm. I lost sight of him in the corner. I crossed, and the prisoner threw the truss down, and ran as fast as his legs could carry him. I was informed he was taken, and brought back. The prisoner is the man I saw with the truss.
THOMAS JEFFERIES. I was in Red Lion-street. I saw the bundle in the kennel, and took the prisones after running after him.

            . I live in Newgate-street


, with 
               
                  John 
                  Titterton
               



            , a cheesemonger
. On the 9th of February I was in the counting-house about eleven o'clock, and heard a slight noise, which induced me to look, and I saw the prisoner with a firkin of butter on his shoulder, just going outside the shop; I went and overtook him ten or eleven yards off - I stopped him, told him the property was not his, and begged him to bring it back, which he did; there was nobody in the shop - he was a perfect stranger.

            . I was opposite Mr. Titterton's shop, and observed the witness holding the prisoner;he acknowledged stealing the butter, and said it was better to be transported than starve.(Tub produced and sworn to.)
The prisoner pleaded poverty.

JOHN HAYES



, stealing 1 handkerchief, value 3s.; the goods of 



Richard Parker, from his person; having been before convicted.






RICHARD PARKER
. I am a carrier, at the New Inn, Old Bailey. On 14th Oct. I felt a pull at my pocket, in Smithfield, and on turning round I saw my handkerchief fall to the ground, and some one run away—I picked it up—I could not recognize the prisoner as the person who ran away—I should not have appeared against the person if I had been aware that three months would not have been sufficient—I would not appear against a man for stealing a pocket-handkerchief, when I am robbed every day by the rich, and cannot button up my pockets against them.





CHARLES ALBERT
 (City-policeman, 282). On 14th Oct. I was on duty in Smithfield, about eight o'clock—I saw the prisoner take a handkerchief out of Mr. Parker's pocket—I was two yards from him—Mr. Parker called, "Police!"—the prisoner dropped it—I pursued him all round the market—my brother officer took him.

Prisoner. Q. How could you see behind Mr. Parker? A. I was in a door-way; Mr. Parker came opposite to me—I couid sec both behind and before him—this is the handkerchief—I got it from Mr. Parker.





RICHARD PARKER

re-examined. I cannot say that this is my handkerchief—I have no doubt of it, but I do not see any mark—I gave the handkerchief that I saw drop to the officer.





WILLIAM FRUIN
 (City-policeman, 276). I saw the prisoner running towards Long-lane, and stopped him—he must have run nearly 300 yards as fast as he could.





JOSEPH DALTON
 (City-policeman, 366). I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction—(read—Convicted Jan., 1848, and confined three months)—he is the person.

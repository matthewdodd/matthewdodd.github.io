            . I live in Long-Acre


, I lost these things mentioned in the indictment, out of a one pair of stairs room, early in the morning June 22. I advertised them the next day. Mr. Whitmore who bought them came to me; he said he had brought the curtains and a girl along with him. I went to Justice Fielding's to see the prisoner, who worked with me till Thursday morning, and went to breakfast and never returned again; the curtains were brought to the justice's. [The prosecutor would not swear to them, but said his was like them.]

            . I am an upholsterer, I made these curtains, or such as these, for the prosecutor. I verily believe they are his, but I will not swear it.
Mrs. Dubourg. I know the curtains to be my own, they used to lie in a one pair of stairs room. The prisoner was not at work the time they were lost.
Mr. Whitmore. I bought the curtains of a woman June 22. The prisoner was with her at that time, she asked me twenty shillings for them, I gave her sixteen. On the Saturday I saw him and her together again, and I took them both up.
Prisoner's Defence. I have nothing to say, only the woman knew nothing at all how I came by them.

            . I am the wife of William Shaw. The prisoner rented a furnished room in the house we live in; she was in the habit of coming into our room - I missed a shawl on the 4th or 5th of December, and charged her with it - the landlady searched her room and found two duplicates; in consequence of which I went to a pawn broker, and found my shawl; this is it.

            . I am apprentice to Mr. Saunders. The prisoner came into our shop on the 24th of July in the afternoon, and asked to see some black ribbon; I shewed her of several sorts; she stayed some time over them, and then asked for some figured ribbon; I shewed her some; she did not like either of them. Then she desired to see some black ribbon again; as she was standing over them, she desired me to weigh her a quarter of an ounce of black thread, which I desired my partner (the witness to the last trial) to weigh; she took an opportunity of taking a piece of black sattin ribbon, and concealed it under her arm; I saw her do it. She went out of the shop; I followed her, and brought her back, and we found the piece of ribbon under her arm.

            . I am a warehouse-man, in Leaden-hall-market


. The business of the Market having been over; I had gone into the Lamb tavern. I received some information from one of Mr. Fenner's servants, I went out, and at about eight o'clock, I saw the prisoner drive a cart up into the market, load the two dozen skins in question, and drive out again. I followed him into Leaden-hall-street, and laid hold of the horse's head; I asked him what he had in the cart; he said, two dozen skins. I asked him who they were for, and he said for Mr. Wood, of Fishmonger alley, in the Borough. I told him Mr. Wood had not made any purchase that day. Then he said he had made a mistake, and I might take the skins back again; upon which, he jumped off the shafis of the curt, and ran away; I and Mr. Fenner's man ran after him, and caught him.

The prisoner came into my shop on last Monday fortnight; in the evening, between six and seven o'clock, and took three pair of stockings; there was another woman with her, she asked for some muslin, she looked at two or three pieces; she was seen to take the stockings by a person in the shop, she had them under her arm.

             sworn.
The prisoner came in with another woman, I shewed her two or three pieces of muslin; none were good enough for her; I had suspicion, I put my muslins aside, and while I turned round, I perceived she had got the stockings under her arm; I asked her to give them to me, and I called Mr. Waddle; I am sure they are mine.
PRISONER's DEFENCE.
They had dropt down, and I picked them up.

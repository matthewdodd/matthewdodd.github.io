            . On the 28th of May as my Husband and I were in Bed, this Boy (the Prisoner ) brought a lighted Candle into the room; we lost the Key on the outside of the Door and he came into the Room: I was frighted at the Light and thought the room was on Fire: I did not see him, for he was upon his Knees on the Right Hand Side of the Bed: He saw I was startled and flew away; directly I asked who was there, and the Dog follow'd him and made him leave the Things.
Q. Was you before Sir

                  Q. 
               


            (to - Jarvice) What are you?
Jarvice . I am Watchman at the End of Flower-de-luce-Court in Fleet-Street. A Quarter of an Hour after Eleven, this Davis and a little Boy along with him, one Saunders, wanted a little Pit of Candle, I told them if they wanted Candle there was a Tallow-Chandler's hard by; some Time after this, I saw this Boy, the Prisoner, run as hard as he could; he was hardly gone but Mr. Camden came down and said he was robb'd, and ask'd me whether I saw any Body; but he was gone off; and I am sure that is the Boy that ran away.

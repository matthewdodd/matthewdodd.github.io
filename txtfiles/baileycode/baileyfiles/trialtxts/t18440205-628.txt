CORNELIUS BELCHEM

On the 5th of Jan. the prisoner came to me, and said he had left his former master, and asked if I could give him any employ—I said, "Not at present"—he asked if he could deliver some hand-bills for me—I said if he would deliver a few, I would give him a small trifle, and his tea—he was to call the next morning, which he did, and I sent him with some parcels, which he delivered—he came back, and I gave him his dinner, and then gave him a parcel to deliver to Mr. Law, the keeper of the Borough Compter—I also sent him to Mr. Taylor, in Brick-lane, with 3s. 9d., to get 7lbs. weight of cocoa—he never returned—I never received the money for the parcel.

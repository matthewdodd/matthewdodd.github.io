            . I lost a pair of shoes from under my bed on the 25th of March; I pulled them of the night before, when I went to bed; the prisoner slept with me that night, and no one else-it was at the Rummer public-house, at Enfield


; I found him afterwards at Edmonton-he gave me a duplicate of another pair of shoes, and said he would make it up on the Saturday night; I took the duplicate from him, and gave him to the constable - he has worn my shoes out.

            . I am a constable of Enfield. I took the prisoner; he said he had worn the shoes out - I said they must be too big for him; he said, "They fitted me very well, when I had got a truss of hay in them."

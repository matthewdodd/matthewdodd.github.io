WILLIAM DEANE
. I am a carman. I was going up Farringdon-street about half-past five o'clock in the evening, on the 20th of May, and saw a carrier's cart standing—I saw the prisoner take out a firkin of butter, put it on his right shoulder and run away—I am sure he is the person—I went and gave information.





GEORGE BREWER
. I am carman to Joseph Johnson and Son, carriers, at Uxbridge. On the 20th of May I came up to Saffron-hill with a load—I then went to Mr. Weight's and received six casks of butter, some cheese, and bacon—the cart was standing in Farringdon-street—I stopped opposite a gateway there for about three minutes to get the horse a pail of water—my attention was directed to the cart, and I missed the butter directly—the prisoner had offered to help me up with a boiler which came, but I said if I wanted any help I would go up the yard and get it—the butter is quite lost—I ran up Stonecutter-street, but could not hear of it.

Prisoner. I had been there helping to load two wagons, and asked him if I should help him; but I never touched the butter.





THOMAS WEIGHT
. I am a cheesemonger. I delivered four large firkins and two small ones to Deane—the one lost was a large one, ane contained 59lb. or 60lb.

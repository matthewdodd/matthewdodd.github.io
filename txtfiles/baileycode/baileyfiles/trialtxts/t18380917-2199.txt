FRANCIS CHIPPERTON
. I am a bone-boiler, and marine-store dealer, and live in Fulham-fields. The prisoner Watts and his father have been some time in my employ—I lost two baskets, and these other articles, on

Tuesday night, or early on Wednesday morning—Watts was out a great deal with the other two prisoners I know—I sent him in chase of the other two, who I understood had gone away with the metal in a boat—I do not know of Watts ever being in possession of the property.





JOSEPH SINGLETON
. I received information of this. I went after the, who were in a boat—they tried to shove it off, but could not, and they went into the water—I took Williams—I know nothing of Watts—the property was found in a dung heap.





WILLIAM AYRES
. I am a policeman. I went to Mr. Chipperton's house, on Wednesday, the 19th of September—I did not find any property a Watts's possession—I questioned him if he knew any thing respecting he robbery—he said it was no business of mine, and he should not satisfy or his master—his master then gave him in charge.

WATTS—

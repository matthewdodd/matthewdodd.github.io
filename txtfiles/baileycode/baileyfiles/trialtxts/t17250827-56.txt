 last, about the Hour of two in the Night
            .
Mary Rans thus deposed: On the 15th of June I went to Bed about Twelve, and left all my Doors and Windows fast. I was called up about four, and found my House broke open; two Panes of Glass were taken out of the front Window, and six in the middle Windows, which had Shutters without Side and within; but both were broke open, and the Goods in the Indictment taken away. Not long ago, 
               
                  John 
                  Everet 
               



             came to my House, and told me, if I would apply to one 
               
                  John 
                  Bewle 
               



             in New Prison, I might hear of my Goods again. I went: Bewle ask'd me if I had lost such Goods, and could swear to them; and then told me, that he had sold them to Susan Belcher.


                  Sarah 
                  Lear 
               



             thus deposed: About ten Weeks ago, I went to Bed about Eleven, and left all fast. I was called up again about Two, and found my House broke open, the middle Shutter taken down, and the Sash thrown up. I then lost this Quilt, a Hat, and Petticoat; and recovered it again by the Means of Bewle, who directed John Everet and 
               
                  Quilt 
                  Arnold 
               



             where to fetch it.


                  John 
                  Hedges 
               



             thus deposed: On the 26th of June, between Ten and Eleven at Night, I made all fast, and went to Bed; and rising about Five next Morning, I found both the outer and inner Doors of my Cellar broke open; and that several Shirts, Smocks, a Handkerchief, and other things, were lost out of a Tub of Water; some of which I got again by the Instructions of Bewle.


                  John 
                  Bewle 
               



             thus deposed: I have known Jack Little about three Months: My first Acquaintance with him was by means of his Wife Betty, for I have known her longer. Jack, (says she to me one Wednesday) I know a young Fellow that wants a Companion to go a House-breaking with: Do ye, says I? Why then I am his Man. Let me see him. She soon brought us together. We presently struck a Bargain, and broke open 2 or 3 Houses that very Night. On the Friday Night following, betwixt 11 and 12, we entred the House of Mr. Rans, over against the Sugar-Loaf in Virginia-Street





. I remember there was double Shutters to the Windows. I hoisted Jack Little upon my Shoulder; he took out several Panes of Glass, and so opened the shutters, went in, and took out the Goods. There was two Gowns, a Velvet Scarf, several Dozens of Wig Cauls, and other things. About a Week after we broke open Mr. Dear's House in Gravel-Lane





 about One in the Morning. We cut away with a Hatcher, the Runner so far, that one of the Shutters fell upon my Head, and had like to have killed me. We only took a Quilt, a Hat, and a Petticoat from thence; for the Watch coming their Rounds, prevented us. The next Week we broke open Hedgers's House about Midnight, and took, Linnen out of a Tub of Water. The Linnen, the Cauls; and most of the other things we sold to Mother Belcher, who very well knew how we came by them.
Belcher, in her Defence, deny d that she ever bought any thing of either Little or Bewle; but said, that Bewle had own'd that he sold those Goods to one Roger. In Answer to which. Bewle did not deny but that he had sold some things to Roper; but insisted upon it, that he sold the greatest Part to the Prisoner Belcher.

John Little, in his Defence, said, that he never had any Acquaintance with Bewle. But this was proved otherwise by Quilt Arnold and 
               
                  John 
                  Everet 
               



            .
Quilt Arnold thus deposed: While Bewle was in New-Prison, I and Everet found these two Pick-lock Keys upon him; and he expecting to be made an Evidence against Little, desired us to go and take him in Ratcliff. Bewle's Wife (with a Child in her Arms) went with us to set him. And as soon as we had taken him, he said, he was sorry that he did not kill Bewle's Wife and Child, for his Life was gone, now Bewle was made an Evidence.
John Everet thus deposed: When we took Little, he would fain have got away, but we brought him to New-Prison; and as soon as he saw Bewle there, he (the Prisoner) said to him, I little thought, Jack Bewle, that you would have served me so. We took this Handkerchief upon 
               
                  Elizabeth 
                  Little 
               



            's Neck. It is that that was stoln from Mr. Hedges.


                  Elizabeth 
                  Little 
               



            , in her Defence said, that she had it from Bewles's Wife. John Little was found 

               Guilty of all the three Indictments
            . 


               Death
            . Susan Belcher was found 

               Guilty of the two Indictments for Receiving
            . 


               Transportation
            . But Elizabeth Little being under the Influence and Direction of her Husband, was 

               Acquitted
            .

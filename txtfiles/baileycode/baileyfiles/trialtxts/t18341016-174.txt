            . I am an officer of the customs. I was on the quay at St. Katherine Docks, on the night of the 5th of October - the ship Arethusa


 was in the dock - I found the prisoner on board her with this shirt just by his feet - I asked him what that was - he said he knew nothing of it - I told him it came out of the Captain's cabin, what they call the round-house - I took him aft on the deck, and then he said, "I took them out of the cabin" - he had the trowsers on.
JOHN LYONS. I am a seaman
 on board the Arethusa. These are my property - I had left them in the round-house.

JAMES CREW
 was indicted

for stealing 2 brushes, value 5s., the goods of 



Peter Le Blond; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






WILLIAM GROVER
. I am shopman to a pawnbroker in Munster-street. The prisoner came with two plasterer's brushes, on 15th Feb., to pawn them—I asked if they were his own—he said no, his father's—I told him to let his father come—he went away and did not return—I gave information.





PETER LE BLOND
. I am an oilman, and live in Mary-street, Hampstead-road—this brush I can swear to, it has my mark on it—this other has the mark nearly obliterated—I lost them on the morning of 15th Feb., about half-an-hour after I had put them out.

Prisoner. Q. Can you swear I stole them? A. Certainly not.





JOHN HILSDEN
 (police-constable S 42.) I received information, and met the

prisoner in Henry-street—I said, "I want you about those brushes you took to pawn"—he said, "I know nothing about any brushes"—I took him in charge.

Prisoner. A young man asked me to take them to pawn, and said he would give me 4d.; they were stopped; I came out and could not find him.





JOHN HENRY COCK
 (police-constable S 65.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction—(read—convicted 11th Dec. 1843; confined three days, and whipped)—the prisoners is the person—he has been here twice since.




GUILTY
. ** Aged 18.—


Transported for Seven years.

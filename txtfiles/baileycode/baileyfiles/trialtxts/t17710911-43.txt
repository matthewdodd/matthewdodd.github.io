            . I live in a cellar, at the corner of Little-Drury-Lane; behind the New Church in the Strand


; the house belongs to

            ; I was robbed yesterday six weeks, to the best of my knowledge; I lost twenty-one half crowns, a crown piece, 5 s. 3 d. and a half guinea, and the other things mentioned in the indictment; I found my things at a pawn broker's; I forgot the street, I sell milk; I went out about five o'clock in the morning; when I returned, I found my place broke open, and the locks broke open, and the things gone; I missed my little child that I had to take care of the house: the constable came about 11 o'clock and asked me if I was robbed; I said yes; and I had lost my child too; on Monday or Tuesday morning, I was sent for to Justice Welch's; there I saw the prisoners; this gown was brought to the justices; I can swear they are my property.

             and I were going up to Covent Garden; we saw 
               
                  Mary
                   Edgers
               



            , we were complaining of the want of money, she said, she would shew us where to get some; she bid me go down Catharine Cain's cellar and get a half-pennyworth of milk, I did, I asked the child if her mother was out, the child said her mother was at home; then I went back and told Edgers so; I went back again for another half-penny worth of milk, they went with me; Edgers gave 
               
                  Polly
                   Cain
               



             a laced handkerchief, and bid her tell her mother, if she asked her how she came by it, to say somebody threw it down the cellar as they went by; the mother was then at home; this was a Sunday morning about six o'clock; we staid behind the Church till we saw the mother go out; we went down the cellar directly after.
Q. Was the cellar door open?
Griffiths. Yes; 
               
                  Mary
                   Edgers
               



             asked the child for a pot, and she went and got a quartern and a half of gin, and put it in a quart of milk, and made the child drink; she called her up in one corner of the cellar, but I do not know what she said to her; then she took a fork and said she could open the lock as well with a fork as a key; we got the poker and broke the Bureau glass, then Edgers put her hand to the two doors of the cupboard and wrenched them open; the lock flew open, then Edgers put her hands through and said, here are the bits, meaning the money, there was twenty-one half-crowns, a crown piece, a half guinea, and a 5 s. 3 d. and a ring; we took no wearing apparel; we went to the Boot in the Long fields, by the Foundling Hospital, and had a bottle of cyder; then we came back to Field-lane, and the daughter bought a few things, what she pleased, at a shop there, she bought us a pair of shoes a piece, a pair of stockings, and a shift; I throwed the ring away over St. Martin's work house; that is a building near the Strand: then we rid down to Westminster and up again to Charing Cross, in a coach; there we met 
               
                  Mary

            . The witness surrendered herself at the round house, when I was there; this man and I took the two prisoners; we took them before the justice, they owned it; but different from what this evidence has said. Mrs. Cain found her caps, handkerchief, and stockings upon them, whilst I was there; some caps, a black handkerchief, and these two gowns were brought by the pawn-brokers.
Prosecutrix. Edgers had my shift on, and cap and handkerchief; these that I have on now, for they left me nothing to wear.
Q. Was your shift marked with your name?
Prosecutrix. No; she owned to it.
Q. to the Constable. Did you hear her acknowledge the things to be the prosecutrix's?
Lyon. Yes; she said she took them; one part of the robbery, they committed on Sunday; and the other part on the Saturday before; these things I believe they took on the Saturday, the accomplice said so; I did not hear the prisoners say any thing.
Q. to Prosecutrix. Was it

             only; I believe they did not deny it.
Q. When had you last seen the cap, handkerchief. and shift, that you found upon Edgers?
Prosecutrix. I took them off on Saturday night when I went to bed; I took the shift off on Friday night; some of the caps I saw on Saturday night.
Q. Have you the other caps here you took from her?
Prosecutrix. No; I did not know I was to bring them.
Q. Is there any particular mark upon the things?
Prosecutrix. No; the caps are all of a make.
Q. How do you know the handkerchief?
Prosecutrix. I said, that is my handkerchief; yes, says she, and gave it from her neck; I said, that is my shift you have got on; she said, yes, it is; she sent for some caps and handkerchiefs she had given her sister; the sister brought me at the justices three caps and two handkerchiefs.
Q. to the Constable. Was you present before the justice?
Lyon. Yes; all the time.
Q. Did you hear any thing pass about these caps and handkerchiefs?

             came and said, she was in company with this Edgers at St. Giles's, and t alked about the robbery committed on Mrs. Cain; asked me if I knew her; I went down to her house, she was not at home; I asked the woman if Cain had been robbed, she said yes; I went down again when she was at home (the young man was with me) and told her that 
               
                  Sal
                   Edgers
               



            , sister to the prisoner, was at the Noah's Ark talking about it; she desired us to take them; I went this man; we took

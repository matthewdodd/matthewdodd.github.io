John Smith. I keep the Boar's-Head in Barbican

            , Watchman. Between 4 and 5 in the Morning, the Prisoner went by me over Fleet-bridge, with some Pewter-pots, and other Things; I follow'd him, but he went too fast for me. After 5, I went to the Night-house in George-Alley, by the Ditch-side, and found him there with the Goods. Pray, young Man, says I, where did you get these Things? I had them, says he, from Mr. Winniat's in Fleet-lane, and am going to carry them to his Brother in Red-Lyon-Street. I look'd on the Gallon-Pot, and found writ round it, John Smith at the Boar's-Head in Barbican. And upon this I secur'd him, and sent Word to the Prosecutor.
Prisoner. I had the Goods from a Man that I met in Long-lane, and he said he would give me Six-pence to carry them to George-Alley. There being no Proof of a Burglary, the Jury found him 


               guilty of Felony only
            .

GEORGE WINGROVE
. I live in Edmund-street, Battle-bridge, and am a carpenter. I have. known the prisoner some time—he worked in Mr. Matthew Hooker's shop in the Chalk-road, where I worked—on the night of the 13th of November I left at eight o'clock, and locked the door—the next morning, at six o'clock, I found the tiles had been taken off the roof of the work-shop, and the lock of the door broken from within—I missed some tools of mine, some of Mr. Hooker's, and the sack which was Mr. Hooker's, had been in an adjoining shed.





JOSIAH BARNES
. I work at Mr. Hooker's. I left these tools in the work-shop, and lost them at the same time.





WILLIAM PERRIN
 (police-constable E 49.) I met the prisoner at half-past ten o'clock at night, on the 13th of November, with this sack of tools—I followed him to Leigh-street, and stopped him—I asked what he had got—he said some tools, which he was going to take to his master's—I asked where—he said, Just round here"—I went with him a few yards, and then I asked how far it was—he said, Half a mile"—I took him to the station-house, and found in the sack these tools, which the prosecutors have identified.





THOMAS VERES
 (police-constable E 54.) I produce a certificate of the

prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person.

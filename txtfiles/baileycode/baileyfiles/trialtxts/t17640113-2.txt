            . I keep a pawnbroker's shop
 in Spital-fields


: the prisoner lived with me about five months. She went away about five weeks ago; I missed some of the things mentioned before she went away, and some after: the people where she went to live, sent me word she was always spending a good deal of money. I went to her, and upon asking her how she came by the money she spent? she said a little girl had given it her: then I wanted to know what she had done with my shirt and a waistcoat, which I had miss'd; she said she knew nothing of them. I brought her to my house; there she told me she had pawned them for Half a Crown, to one Mr. Woodyer. I went there the next morning, and found them and the other things; ( produced and deposed to).

MARY ANN WILSON
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
10th of Feb., 36 yards of printed cotton, value 14s. 3d.; the goods of 



Richard Cole Baker and another, and that she had been before convicted of felony.






JAMES FERGUSON
. I am in the employ of Richard Cole Baker and another, in Leather-lane—about four o'clock on the 10th of Feb. I was behind the counter—I saw the prisoner inside the step of the door—she took this piece of print off the iron railing inside the door, put it under her shawl, and walked off with it—I went out and took her, three doors from the shop, with it hanging below her shawl—I brought her back—she pointed to two other women walking in another direction, and said they took it and gave it to her.

Prisoner. It was hung outside the door. Witness. It was not; it was the extreme piece, but not outside.





JAMES WARD
 (police-constable G 25.) I took the prisoner, and have the cotton; she said one of the other women took it and gave it her.

Prisoner's Defence. I was by the shop, and two girls took it off and gave it to me—I was going away—the gentleman took and brought me back to the shop—he said, "If you have got any money by you that you were going to purchase it with, I will let you go"—they wanted to search me, but I said no, I had no money.





JOHN LEWIS
 (City police-constable 581.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—she is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 17.—


Transported for Seven Years.

I am mother of this little girl; I sent her out the day she was missed, about ten, and they took some black pluddings and some sausages; they were in two baskets; they had each of them a basket, they would not go out without each other; Charlotte hada dark cotton frock on, and a pair of gold ear-rings in her ears; Sarah returned about one in the day; she appeared to be rather stupid with liquor; we did not find the other till between eleven and twelve at night; I was at home; I have not seen that cotton frock since, but it is here.

             sworn.
Did you go out with your sister on Monday? - Yes.
Where was she to go to? - To Fetter-lane.
Had you any where to go after that? - No.
Then you was to return home? - Yes.
Did you meet with any body? - Yes, with the prisoner at the bar.
Where did you meet with her? - In Fetter-lane.
What did she say to you? - She said to another, a strange woman, there go my two God-children; and she said it was a very cold morning, let us go in and have something to drink; she said so to my sister; then she went into a publick house and called for a pint of purl, and the gentleman gave her change; I said several times to my sister softly, let us go home; then I spoke loud, and the prisoner said, I am going home to your God-mama's, and I will go with you; then she took us all to Fetter-lane and Hatton-garden; we all drank of it, and because Charlotte did not like it, she poured a good deal down Charlotte's bosom, because she would not drink it; she said my mother had lent her a guinea when she lay in; she left my sister at an ale-house, in Turn-stile; I was with her; then she emptied all the things into a basket which was mine; then she took me up to Hatton-garden again, and to Fetter-lane again; she left the empty basket with Charlotte and her bundle; and she said, there was a muslin gown and a muslin apron, and told Charlotte not to open it; they were in a bit of flowered thing; when she got me into Hatton-garden, I asked her how much further; into Clare-market, she said; says I, I must not go all that way, my mother will be angry; then she came into Holborn and she fell down, and I took my basket away from her, and I fell crying, and she said, then if I cried, she would stamp my guts out; then she took my basket; I had turned back to go, as I supposed, to my sister; she told me her name was Cordick; I should know the piece of cotton that bundle was wrapped in.

             sworn.
I am son to the prosecutor; I went to look after my sister; I found her at last, at St. Giles's, at a lodging house, in bed with the prisoner; I found the basket and these rags, just as it is now.
How came you to go to that house? - I had her cried, and a girl told me; I was so frightened, I did not ask the woman how she came by my sister; she said she hoped I would not hurt her; the child had no earrings in her ears, and we could not find the frock; I was not present when it was found.


                  DAVID
                   SPENCER
               



             sworn.
I went out on this search; I was present when the child was found in bed with the prisoner; I took her to the watch-house, and in the morning I went with Mr. Isaacs, and desired him to search her, and in her pockets were the child's earrings; I asked her where the frock was; then she said, I will tell you where the frock is; it is at the corner, at Mr. Lane's; I went there, and saw it.

             sworn.
I searched the prisoner, and found these two gold wires in her pocket; I asked her where the frock was; she said it was at the pawn-broker's in the corner; I went there immediately, and I asked for the frock; they brought it down, and I desired him to keep it.

                   BATT
               



             sworn.
I am servant to Mr. Lane a pawnbroker; I took in a cotton frock, I believe from the prisoner.
Have you any doubt about it? - Yes; I am not quite sure; I never saw her before, nor since.
Do you believe she is the person? - I believe her to be the person that left it.
When was it you took it from her? - The 5th of March.
Do you know what time of day? - I cannot positively say; I think it was the afternoon.
(The frock produced and deposed to.)
To Mrs. Spencer. Is that the frock your child had on that day? - Yes; I have brought the fellow of it; I have two or three of them; I have no doubt of it.

            . This is the frock my sister had on that day, and I have some more of it.
Mrs. Spencer. They were these, or like these, which my child wore.

            . Look at that cotton, and see if it was any thing like that which she had the things wrapped up in? - Yes, this is the piece.

                   HILL
               



             sworn.
I am a poor woman; I saw the prisoner bring in the child to a lodging-house in St. Giles's, at one o'clock; I am a lodger there; she had a long cloak on; I could not see whether she had a frock on or not; she said, let my child sit down by the fire; and the people made room for her. She says to the child, shall I get any tea, my dear? the child replies, yes mammy; she said, get it out; I am sure this is the little child; I saw her taken out from the woman.
What time did she bring her in? - As well as I can recollect, between one and two; I did notice the child for the trifle of time she sat in the corner.
Court. How long has she lodged in this house with you? - I never saw her before in my life to my knowledge.

             sworn.
I met the prisoner and the two children in Fetter Lane; she had hold of them by the hand; she crossed over to me, and asked me if my name was Cimmerick; I said yes; she asked me if I knew Mr. Spencer; I said I did; she said Mrs. Spencer was her godmother, and she had borrowed a guinea of her, and had not seen her these four years, and was going to take the children home; she kissed the children, and seemed to be very fond of them.
Court to Mrs. Spencer. What is the value of the things? - The frock is worth 2 s. and the ear-rings 18 d.
PRISONER's DEFENCE.
I was very much in liquor when I met these children; we had a pint of purl; it was very cold; I asked the children if they would have a drop of purl; I knew them, and my parents lived close by them.
Jury to Mrs. Spencer. Is this woman your god-daughter? - I never saw her in my life.

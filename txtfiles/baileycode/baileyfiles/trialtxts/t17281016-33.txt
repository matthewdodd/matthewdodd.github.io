                     Henry

            .
It appear'd, That the Prosecutor had employ'd the Prisoner for sometime past as a Chairwoman
, and that with a false Key she had open'd the Drawers in which the Silver Spoon and Money were, and they reposing a great deal of Confidence in her, had suffered themselves to be Cheated and Defrauded for a long time; but finding Money missing frequently, Mr. Wells laid wait for her, by taking Notice of what Money was in the Drawers, and watching her, found she had taken a Guinea, which she had upon her when apprehended; and being carried before a Magistrate, she there made Confession, and sign'd the Confession with her own Hand, without either Threatnings, Menaces or Promises. Upon which the Jury found her 

               Guilty
             of single Felony.

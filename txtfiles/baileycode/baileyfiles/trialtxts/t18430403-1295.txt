ABRAHAM STRONG
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
16th of March, 2lbs. weight of bacon, value 1s. 6d., the goods of 




John Brown; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






JOHN YOUNG
. I am shop-boy to Mr. John Brown, cheesemonger, in John-street, St. Marylebone. On the 16th of March, about a quarter past ten o'clock, I saw the prisoner outside, and saw him lift a piece of bacon off the board—I ran out, and called, "Stop thief"—he put it on the rails at the corner of the house, and ran off—I followed, and called, "Stop thief"—he was stopped, and my master came up—the bacon was my master's.

Prisoner. I ran against the board, and knocked the bacon down; I had no intention of taking it. Witness. He had got about three yards from the house—I am sure I saw him lift it off with his hand.





JAMES ROCHE
. I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
. ** Aged 23.—


Transported for Seven Years.

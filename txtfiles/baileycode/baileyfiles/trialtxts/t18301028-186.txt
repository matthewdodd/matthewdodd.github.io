GEORGE HUGHES. I am a waterman and lighterman. Press Granger's wharf is at St. Ann's, Limehouse


; I was there on the 27th of September, at seven o'clock in the evening, and saw the prisoner on the wharf, putting coals into a bag - he scratched them in with his hands; I went and told the clerk - he came, unlocked the gate, and charged the prisoner with stealing the coals; there wereabout three pecks in the bag - as soon as the prisoner got off the premises he began to abuse me - he struck me, and gave me a black eye; he struck the clerk, and had a long struggle with him.
Prisoner. Q. Where were you? A. I was attending a barge about twenty yards from the premises.

                  JAMES
               



            . I am a clerk on the wharf. The gates were locked; the prisoner had no authority to be there - I do not know how he got there; he struck me several times very severely - the coals were Mr. Granger's.
Prisoner. Q. When you first came, did you not make a kick at me? A. No; I said I had caught you at last - your bag was alongside of you.
Prisoner's Defence. I had been working on the adjoining premises; I had occasion to go on these premises, and was taken.

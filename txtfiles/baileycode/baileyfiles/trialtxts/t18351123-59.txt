ELIZA TYE
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
9th of November, 9 Yards of merino, value 10s., the goods of 




Finney Eldershaw; and that she had been before convicted of felony.






FINNEY ELDERSHAW, JUN
. I am a linendraper, and live in Stanhope-street, Clare-market. The prisoner came in about half-past five, or a quarter to six o'clock, on the 9th of November, and asked to look at some merinos, which I showed her—she said she would call again in the evening—she then asked to look at some silks for bonnets—I went round to another counter, and she did not follow me very quickly, which gave me suspicion—she had a large cloak on she—looked at some silks, and said, "Cut me off one yard of that; here is a shilling; I will call again in the evening"—she went off very quick, which gave me suspicion—I looked, and missed some merino—I went in about a quarter of an hour, to my neighbour Allen, the pawnbroker, where I saw the merino—they were doubling it up.





THOMAS WINDSON ALLEN
. I live with my father, four doors form the prosecutor—I took in this piece of merino form the prisoner, in the name of Lea—I have know her by the name of Lea, for the last two years—I described her person to the prosecutor.

Prisoner. Q. Do you know any thing against my character? A. No.





SAMULE GARDINER
 (police-constable F 98.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's conviction, which I got form the Clerk of the peace, for Westminster—the prisoner was tried and covicted, by the name of Bridget Tye—she is the same person.

Prisoner's Defence. It was brought and given to me in the street.

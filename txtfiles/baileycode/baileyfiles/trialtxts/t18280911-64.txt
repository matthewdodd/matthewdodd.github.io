                  , from his person
            .
THOMAS DONOUGHUE. I am a compositor
, and live in Brunswick-cottages, Hackney-road. On Wednesday, the 3d of September, about half-past twelve o'clock in the day, I was in Smithfield


; an officer touched me on the arm - I turned round, and saw my handkerchief falling from the prisoner's hand; I did not see it in his hand, but it fell in such a manner as I could not doubt it fell from him - he was about a foot from me; I had him secured.
Prisoner. Q. Were there many people round? A. A. Yes, many hundreds, but not particularly near me; I have no doubt you took it out of my pocket - it was safe just before.


                  JOHN

            . I am an officer. On the 3d of September I saw the prisoner attempting several pockets; he went up to the prosecutor put his right hand into the prosecutor's pocket, and took this handkerchief out - he then put in his left hand; I touched the prosecutor, and went to seize the prisoner's hand; he pulled it away: I collared him, and he threw the handkerchief down - I took it up.
Prisoner's Defence. He said at the first examination that he took it out of my hand, and at the second that he took it off the ground; he says there was a crowd, and how could he see me take it; I was remanded.
JOHN GIRTON. I did not say I took it from his hand; he was remanded to bring people to his character, but he brought none.

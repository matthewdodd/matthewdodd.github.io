            , ESQ. I am in partnership with 
               
                  John 
                  Thompson

            ; the prisoner was our clerk
, and had been so five or six years, and was entrusted with checks and money. On Saturday, the 4th of September
, I gave him a number of bills, and told him to pay them into Messrs. Masterman's, as was usual every Saturday, for the purpose of their receiving the assets when due in the following week. This bill for 81 l. 7 s. 1 d., accepted by S. and G. Thornton and Co., payable at Sir 
               
                  Peter 
                  Pole
               



            's, was among them; Messrs. Masterman never accounted to us for it. I hold the bill in my hand, and find by the back of it, over our endorsement, are the words
"Received for," and under it,
"
               
                  Charles 
                  Nye
               



            ," which is the prisoner's handwriting. I had given him no authority to receive it - his duty was to pay it into the bankers'.
Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. He was employed to receive money on bills - A. No, not on bills; we seldom employed him to receive money.

            . I am clerk to Sir 
               
                  Peter 
                  Pole
               



             and Co. I paid this bill, and took the receipt. It did not come from Messrs. Masterman's; if it had it would be paid at the clearing-house.

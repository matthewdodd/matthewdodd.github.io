GEORGE BRIGGS
 and 




ALFRED HEARN



, stealing 1 coat, value 12s.; the goods of 



Charles James Browning: Hearn having been before convicted.






CHARLES WILLIAM BROWNING
. I was playing in the Britannia-fields, at touch, with two other little boys, and the prisoners and another boy told me to put my coat on the railing, because it was too hot to play at touch with it—I took it off and put it on the railing—Briggs took it, put it under his coat, and they all ran away together.





CHARLES PRICE TOMLINSON
. I was at play with Browning, and saw his coat on the rail—I saw Briggs take it away; Hearn was by his side at the time, and they ran away together—no other boy on the other side of the rails could have taken it—there was another one who is not here, who spoke to Browning.





JAMES MARSHALL
 (policeman, N 166). I found the prisoners at half-past two o'clock on the morning after the robbery, asleep in a sand-house, in a brickfield—I told them they were charged with stealing a boy's coat—they said they knew nothing of it—I brought them to the station, and Beezley, who was there, was charged with them—he has been discharged.





EDWARD JEFFERY
 (policeman, N 259). I produce a certificate of Hearn's conviction, from Clerkenwell—(read—Convicted Nov. 1847, and confined four months)—I was present; he is the person.

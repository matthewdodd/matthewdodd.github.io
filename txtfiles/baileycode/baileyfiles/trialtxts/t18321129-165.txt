            , a boot and shoemaker
, in Liverpool-road, Islington


. I was in his shop on the 21st of November, about five o'clock; there were two bundles of shoes at his door; I saw the prisoner pass by, take up the top bundle, which contained seven pairs of shoes, and ran off - I ran and called Stop thief! - he dropped them when he got a few yards from the door; I did not stop for them, but ran on; a gentleman said he could run faster than I could - he ran across the road, caught the prisoner, and brought him back - I had not lost sight of him.

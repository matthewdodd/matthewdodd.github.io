ROBERT LEWIS. I am a cabinet-maker
, and lodge in Shoreditch. I was removing on the 20th of June from Little Pulteney-street


 - the prisoner was recommended to me to carry my box; I delivered it to him to carry to Shoreditch


 - I was to pay him 1s. 6d.; I went there the same evening, and he had not been - I gave him 2d., and left 1s. 4d. in Mr. Carr's hand to pay him - the box contained all the articles stated; I gave him a written direction - I never saw him till I offered a reward for his apprehension; there were papers in it I would not have taken any money for.

            . I am an officer. On Tuesday I was at the watch-house; I was called by Carr to take the prisoner, saying he had absconded with a box of clothes - I took him in Bride-lane; he told me he went into a liquor-shop, left the box at the door, and it had been taken away.

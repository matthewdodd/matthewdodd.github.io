The prosecutor deposed that he going out about Twelve a Clock a Saturday-night to buy a penny worth of Tobacco, the prisoner standing in the Street called him to her, and entertaining him with some strange sort of Discourse, in the mean time pick'd his Purse and Money out of his pocket, upon which he missing it, charged her with it, following her for his Money, and at length coming to the Watch, charged them with her, as she did them with him; so they bore one another Company that Night. He was positive she took the Money from him, and that he saw her throw away the purse as she was going to the Watch-house and he took it up, but the Money was gone out of it. The Jury found her 


               guilty to the value of 10 d.

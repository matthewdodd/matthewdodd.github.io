            . I took the prisoner the 17th of November with this cotton on Galley Key, between the hours of one and two at noon; there are two pounds and half of it. ( The evidence produced an apron which was tied about the prisoner when he took him with a pocket in it, with a slap to cover the pocket on each side, made on purpose to carry off such like goods undiscovered.) First of all I saw him go up to the corner where the cotton lay, and observ'd his apron hung loose as being empty: I went round to get upon the bags and detect him in taking it out, I saw him hustling against the bag, but cannot say I saw him take any: I did not observe a hole in the bag before, but afterwards there was one visible enough : I met him loaded, and took him by the collar; he said he did not care what became of him, for he had as lief be transported as stay here to starve to death.

            . I am a watchman. After Mr. Emmerson seized the prisoner, he shewed me the bag, it belongs to Mr. Francoe a Jew: I was employed by Mr. Adams, his clerk, to take care of it.
Q. Has Mr. Francoe any partners?
Taylor. None as I know of.
(Mr. Adams the clerk proved the partnership, and made the property as laid in the indictment.)

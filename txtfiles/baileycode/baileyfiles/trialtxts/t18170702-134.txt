WILLIAM HENRY SAULEZ PENLEY. I am a drawing-master
, and live in Shouldern-street, Brompton-square


. On 8th of June, about three o'clock in the morning, the watchman called me and said the house was robbed. I missed the meat and bread from the area.
THOMAS WHITE. I am a watchman. I saw the three prisoners pass me with two bundles about three o'clock in the morning; I followed them into Queen-street, Edgware-road, and into the fields; another watchman sprung his rattle and two of them ran across the fields - I secured Spaw, another watchman secured the other two, they had passed me just by the house. I am certain they are the men. The bundle contained a piece of beef, half a peck loaf and part of a quartern loaf.

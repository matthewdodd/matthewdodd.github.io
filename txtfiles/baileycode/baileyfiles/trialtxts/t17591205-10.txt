            . I am a shoemaker
, and live at the Crown and Slipper in Ludgate Street. The prisoner at the bar came into my shop on the 8th of November, about dusk, and asked to see a common pair of shoes for herself; but I had none that would suit her. Then she wanted me to make a pair for her against the next night. After that she went away, and upon a lower shelf I missed a pair of pumps, which made a vacancy. I had lost four pair of shoes from that shelf a little before. I went out, and just by Ludgate I stopped her with this pair of pumps in her apron. [Produced in court, and deposed to.] I took her before the alderman, where she did not deny taking them, neither when I took her.
The prisoner had nothing to say in her defence.

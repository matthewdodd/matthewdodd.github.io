MR. DENNIS. On Saturday the 10th of May I was standing at my door, the corner of the mews where the duke keeps his carriage; the prisoner at the bar came past with a bundle under his arm; I had a glimpse of the crest on the button of the great coat; he was going as fast as he could; I suffered him to go forty or fifty yards, and then I pursued him; I caught him by the right hand and seized the coat with the left; I asked him where he had got this coat, he said he did not know; my reply was, that I thought I could take him to a place where I thought he brought the coat from; I conducted him to the duke's stable, knocked at the door, some of the domestics opened the door; I enquired in there was a great coat lost. The coachman came, he owned the coat.

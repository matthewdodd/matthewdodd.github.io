. The prisoner lodged in the same room with me - he went to bed before me on the 25th of March; when I got up next morning he was gone, and I missed these articles; I inquired, and found him; I told him he had used me very ill - he said he had, and was very sorry - that he had sold my things in Monmouth-street; I have not seen them since.

 - I was there on the 11th of December, and saw the prisoner come in without an umbrella; I watched him, and saw him go out; I followed him - he ran across the yard, and dropped this umbrella; I secured him, and found on him forty duplicates; ten for umbrellas, one for a parasol, and the rest for coats, waistcoats, and other articles; most of the umbrellas have been claimed.

            , Servant to Mr Delamot , was the principal Witness to convict the Prisoner; as he was going to lock up the Ware houses, where he saw the Door of one of them lifted off the Hinge; going into the Warehouse, he saw some Sugar in an Apron; mistrusting some Body must be in the Warehouse, he hastened down for some Body to come up with him; as he was going down, he heard the Slings flung out, which made him to conclude that they were about to let themselves down; upon that he cried, Stop Thief, and a Soldier held the Prisoner at the Bar till he came down .
The Prisoner was asked whether he had not some Accomplices, and how he could lift off the Door himself; he said no Body was concerned with him, that he lifted off the Door by main Strength, but that he was never guilty of such a Fault before. This he confessed to the Constable ; upon his Trial, he denied the Fact, and said his Wife had two Children, and big with another. The Jury found him 


               guilty 10 d.

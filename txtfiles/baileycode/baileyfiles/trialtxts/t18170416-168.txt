THOMAS BROWN. I live in Yorkshire. On the 4th of March, about eight or nine o'clock in the evening, I was in Broad-street, St. Giles's


. The officer informed me that my pocket had been picked. He had Kirk in custody - I also missed a book.

            . I am a constable. I was at the top of Drury-lane, and saw the prisoner, Kirk, lift up Mr. Brown's coat, and take the handkerchief out of his pocket-there were two others with him. I collared him, and he dropped it.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

            . I am a constable. I saw the two prisoners and another man following the prosecutor. I watched them. Fellows went first, and I followed him. Whenthey got to the corner of Drury-lane, the prisoner, Flannagan, left the others, and went down Drury-lane, as soon as he saw me-the other men followed Brown. I saw Fellows secure Kirk, and I took Flannagan.

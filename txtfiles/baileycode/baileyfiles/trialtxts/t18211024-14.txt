            . I am a seamen
. On the 22d of September, I was at the bottom of Gold's-hill, Shadwell


, looking at the mountebanks - my watch ribbon was cut, and the seals and key taken; I felt a pull at my watch, I had a child in my arms - the prisoner stood close to me; I caught hold of him, and saw the seal and key in his hand, he threw them down, and afterwards shewed me where they were - I picked them up. I am sure he took them.

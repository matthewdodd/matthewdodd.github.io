. On the 26th of April, between twelve and one o'clock, I was behind the counter, and saw the prisoner enter the shop - he lifted up a bar, and took off these three waistcoats; he ran out - I pursued - he threw them down. I caught him, without losing sight of him, and they were picked up.(Property produced and sworn to.)

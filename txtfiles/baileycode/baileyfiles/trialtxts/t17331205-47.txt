Mr. Walker. The Prisoner was my Servant
, she took the Goods out of a Drawer, and went away. She was found again in Holbourn, with 8 s. in her Pocket; she confess'd the Fact, and carry'd me to 
               
                  Robert 
                  Pardy 
               



            , a Pawn-broker, at whose House I found the Goods.

            . This Girl brought the Rings and Spoon to me, and said her Mistress wanted two Guineas and 4 s. upon them; I told her, that was more than they were worth. Then she would have had 30 s. upon them; I ask'd her where her Mistress liv'd? she said in Monmouth-Street, and dealt in Shoes, and wanted Money presently, to buy a Bargain, and so I lent her 25 s.
Court. You did? And would you offer to take such Goods of such a Child? - Sir, before you go out of Court, find me Security for your Appearance next Sessions, or I'll commit you. 

               Guilty

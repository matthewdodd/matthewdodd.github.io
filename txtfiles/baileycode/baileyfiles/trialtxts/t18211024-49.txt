. On the 6th of October I had seven fowls in a hen-house, which is detached from my dwelling-house. Between eleven and twelve o'clock at night I was called up by Grainger, and found the prisoner in custody of Mallam. I had locked the hen house. Grainger shewed me one of my fowls.

I was going home about a quarter past eleven o'clock, and heard a noise of persons breaking something, and on turning round saw the hen-house door open, and two persons coming out, the prisoner was one - he had a parcel in his apron; Icalled Mallam, who took him, with me - the other man ran away. I found four fowls in his apron, and one under his arm - they were dead, but warm.

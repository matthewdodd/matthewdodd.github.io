            . I am porter to 
               
                  George 
                  Blakeley
               



            . On the 2d of February I was looking out of the warehouse window, and saw a strange man go towards the stable-door - I sent Rees down, returned to the window, and saw the prisoner come out of the stable with the harness on his shoulder. Some words passed between him and Rees; he threw the harness down and ran away - I am sure he is the man.

            . I am Durgon's fellow-servant, he sent me down to the stable; I went towards the door, saw it open, and heard the harness being taken down - the prisoner came out with it on his shoulder and walked by me. I said,
"What are you going to do with that harness?" he said he was going to take them, and asked if they belonged to me? I said Yes - he said,
"There they are for you; don't take me - good luck to you let me go!" He ran off, and I pursued, calling Stop thief. He was stopped without my losing sight of him.

            . I took the prisoner in charge - he had a bag with half a quartern loaf in it.
Prisoner. I was greatly distressed.

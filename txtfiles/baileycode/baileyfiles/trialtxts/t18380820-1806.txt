DENNIS DE BERDT HOVELL
. I live at Lower Clapton. At half-past five o'clock on the afternoon of the 19th of July I was going along Hack-key-road—I heard a slight noise behind me—I turned, and felt my handkerchief was gone—I saw the two prisoners running across the road—I purchased them-Geils fell down—I caught him, and on him was this handkerchief, which is mine-Harding was caught by a witness—they were running together.

Cross-examined by
MR. CHAMBERS. Q. What do you mean by "on Geils?" A. He fell down, and on his chest was the handkerchief—it fell from him, I believe, but it was on him when he laid on the ground—it dropped from him—I do not know how—I do not recollect saying so—my deposition was taken down—there was some obscurity about it, but that was the fact of the case—I forget whether my deposition was read over to me—the Magistrate was writing, and he read those words to me, and said, "Was it so?" and I said, "Yes"—it fell with him, and, I believe, dropped from his breast.





JOHN MORGAN
. I live in West-street, and am a turncock. I was at the corner of Crab-tree-row—I saw the witness, and the two prisoners were after him—the handkerchief was taken by Harding from the prosecutor's and pocket—he passed it to Geils—I went and took Harding as he ran across.

Cross-examined. Q. You saw the two prisoners? A. Yes—they were close together at the heels of the prosecutor—it was on the pavement, on the lags—I called them a couple of young rascals, and they ran off.

            . I am a mariner
. On the 22d December, about half-past eleven o'clock at night, I was in Gray's-inn-lane


, coming towards Holborn, I was in liquor, and the prisoner came up to me, took my watch from my pocket, and ran away. I ran after her, calling out, watch! and followed her till she was taken. I am sure she is the woman.
GEORGE PERRY. I am a watchman; I heard the alarm; I went to Charlotte's-buildings, the prisoner passed, and the man was following her. I saw her throw the watch away, I picked it up and stopped her.
(Property produced, and sworn to.)

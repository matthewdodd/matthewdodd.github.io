            . I am a shoe-maker
. On the 23d of August I lost a pair of leather shoes; I saw them about two o'clock; I went up stairs and came down between three and four; then I missed them.
Another witness. I am servant to Mr. Warren: coming out of the yard, between three and four in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner with one foot within side the shop, the other upon the cell of the door; he leaned over, and took a pair of shoes off of the board; I ran after him and in about twenty yards stopped him; he had the shoes beneath his coat under his arm; they were taken from him.
Prisoner's Defence.
I saw a brown paper on the ground; I thought it an empty piece of paper; I took it up and found in it a pair of shoes.

I am the watchman to Smart's and Dice quay


; on the 17th of last month, at half past twelve at night, there was a lighter laden with tobacco, and I called to the watchman on board the lighter, but he did not answer; I saw the prisoner on board, and there was one hogshead broke open, with the head out, and some of the tobacco laying about; he went to the other end of the lighter, and stood by another hogshead; the watchman and lighterman went down, and brought him ashore, and I saw him searched; there was found, concealed in his breeches, a chissel; the tobacco was in a bag close by him; there was about one pound and a half.

Found the prisoner in the lighter, and confirmed what the last witness said.
PRISONER's DEFENCE.
I belong to a ship in the river; and I had been drinking, and I came down to these stairs; I thought I saw a boat, so I crossed the lighter; and it was a boat belonging a ship; and I laid down among some hogsheads; the chissel our carpenter gave me to carry on board.

            . On the 22d of August, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I was standing between the Admiralty


 and Great Scotland-yard


, in the middle of the street. The Queen had just returned from the house. Clark came up. and asked if I had lost any thing. I felt, and missed my watch; he pointed out the prisoner, who was running from the horses head of a hackney-coach behind which I stood. I stepped forward, collared him, and charged him with stealing my watch, he denied it; another person collared him, he then stooped down, put his hands behind his legs, and said,
"Here it is, I have just picked it up," and gave it to me.

            . I am a paper-hanger, and live in Baalam's-buildings. I was behind a coach, Mr. Bell stood on my left, and the prisoner just before me. I saw him as if in the act of taking something from Mr. Bell's pocket; he suddenly turned round and went away. I told Bell, he felt, and missed his watch. I pointed the prisoner out going towards Scotland-yard, the prosecutor stopped him. I saw him draw the watch from between his legs.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

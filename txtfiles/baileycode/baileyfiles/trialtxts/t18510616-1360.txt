CHARLES THOMAS
. I am a shoemaker. These articles are mine—I lost them on 15th May, from my lodging, 6, King-street, Brick-lane—the prisoner worked with me for my employer, and shared my apartment—I left the house about 9 o'clock in the evening—the prisoner was there—I told him not to leave until I came back—I was gone half an hour, or rather more—I returned to the house; he was gone—I got in at the window, and misted all these articles which were in the room when I left it—they are mine—this hammer belongs to John Noyes—it was in my room.





THOMAS ANSCOMB

JOHN BURBIDGE
 (policeman, G 89). I produce a certificate of the prisoner's conviction at this Court—(read—Convicted April, 1850; having been before convicted, confined one year)—I was present—he is the person.




GUILTY

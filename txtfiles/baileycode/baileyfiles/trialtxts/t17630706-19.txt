, he found he had often been robbed in this way; the two women were his servants; a liver being found concealed they were suspected and accused, they both confessed they had sold livers to Shortland for 3 d. a piece; that Shortland 's business is to sell tripe about the street, that the selling price to those that sell again is 6 d. It appeared that Holmes had not been so much concerned as Myford.

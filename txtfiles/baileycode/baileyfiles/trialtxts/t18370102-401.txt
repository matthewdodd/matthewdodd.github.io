GEORGE DURANT
. I live at Stamford-hill, and am not in any business. 0N the 16th of December I was passing along Cornhill, about twelve at noon, and felt a person's hand at my pocket—I turned, and the prisoner was close behind me—I said, "What are you doing at my pocket?"—there was a girl by his side, and I observed him hand something over to he—I put my hand into my pocket, and discovered he had taken my snuff-box, which I bad used not a minute before—the girl walked off as fast at she could—I accused the prisoner of stealing my box, and gave him to the officer—I am sure it was his hand that was in my pocket, and that he handed something to the girl.

Prisoner. I was going by, and was a yard or a yard and a half from him be turned and laid hold of me, and let me go, and then he came to me again, and said he had lost his snuff-box, and had seen me give some thing to a girl—the only female who was passing, was quite a lady?. Witness. She was such a lady, as he is a gentleman.

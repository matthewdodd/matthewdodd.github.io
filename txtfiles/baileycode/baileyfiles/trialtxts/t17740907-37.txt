            . On the 21st of August, between nine and ten at night, I heard a cry of stop thief, in Petticoat-lane; I met the prisoner in Tripe-yard; I catched him in my arms and we both fell to the ground; I kept him till the prosecutor came up, who said the prisoner had robbed him of his handkerchief; I made him strip and the handkerchief dropped from him; Mr. Adams took it up.

            . On the 21st of August I was present when the prisoner was stopped; as he stripped I saw something drop from him; I took it up and it proved to be the prosecutor's handkerchief.

            . I am a seaman
. I lost my pocket-book on last Saturday; I was in Watling-street


, between two and three o'clock; I was going down to join my ship. I felt somebody at my pocket; I instantly missed my pocket-book. I turned round, and saw the prisoner behind me; I took hold of him. He dropped the pocket-book, and a gentleman standing by, picked it up; he took him in custody.

            . As I was passing along Watling-street, I saw the prosecutor run up to the prisoner, and take hold of him. I saw the pocket-book fall from the prisoner; I collared the prisoner. Whether I picked up the pocket-book or another, I cannot say. I got the pocket-book, and wrote my name upon it, to identify the pocket-book. There was not a third man there until I got hold of the prisoner. I would not let him go. I can swear I saw the pocket-book fall from the prisoner. This is the pocket-book.
Prosecutor. It is my pocket-book; it contained a five-pound note, and four one's.
Prisoner's Defence. I am as innocent as the child unborn.

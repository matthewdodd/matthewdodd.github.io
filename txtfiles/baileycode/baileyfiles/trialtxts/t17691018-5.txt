            . I am a labouring man
, and live in St. Giles's


. I thought the boy at the bar was starving, so I took him home on the Tuesday, and he seemed to behave very well; on the Wednesday and on the Thursday I missed him, and my watch from hanging on a nail. I went to Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            , and got some hand-bills distributed about, and the watch was stopped and brought there.

            . About five minutes before the watch was brought to me, I had a hand bill delivered to me from Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            . A soldier, name Kirk, brought the watch to pledge, and I seeing it answered the bill, stopt it, and took the soldier before Sir John.

                  Kirk 
               



            . I am a soldier. I had this watch of a man, named Alsop. I carried it to pawn, and was stopt with it.


                  John 
                  Alsop 
               



            . I was centry at Whitehall guard, when the lad at the bar came and shewed this watch to me. He said he found it in a piece of flannel, in the Strand. He asked us if we would be so good as to go and pawn it.
Q. Did you know the prisoner before?
Alsop. I never saw him before, to my knowledge. (The watch produced, and deposed to by prosecutor.)
Prisoner's Defence.
I took the watch, and carried it to the soldier, who was to give me nine shillings for it.

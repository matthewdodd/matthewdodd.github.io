            . I live on Tower-hill, and am a tobacconist
. The prisoner was in my service five months - she was the only servant
 I had. I missed the trunk out of my bed-room the day after she left; she left my service without my knowledge; she turned out what was in the trunk. At the time she took it, it contained some pieces of silk, and things which were of no use to her - there was a frock in the same room, which she took away. She was taken up on the 30th of September. I have seen the frock since; the officer brought the trunk. A person sent for me, and informed me, that she was in her house - I and found her dressed in my frock.

            . I am a constable. I was sent for to Norwich-court, East Smithfield; the prisoner was there, and had this frock on - it was owned by Mrs. Thomas. The prisoner told me to go to No. 4, Chandler-street, Goodman's-fields, and I should find the trunk; I did, it was a bad house.

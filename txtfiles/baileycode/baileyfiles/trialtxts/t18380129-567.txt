MARK RAYNER
. I conduct the King of Prussia public-house, Blue Anchor-yard, for a widow—her name is Ann Blandy. On the 29th of January the prisoner came—I served her with half a pint of beer, between one and two o'clock—she staid there a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes—when she went out I went into the tap-room, and missed the pot—I sent the boy to pursue her—I then missed the funnel and the save-all, and went after her—we missed her—I left the boy to watch, and he found her in one of the houses—I went to her again, and held her, and sent for a policeman—there was found on her the pint pot, also a quart pot, which had been in the yard, where she asked me to let her go, and this funnel and save-all.





WILLIAM BARRETT
. I followed the prisoner a short distance, and saw her put down the pots out of her apron—they belong to Mrs. Blandy.

Prisoner. I never had them in my possession at all—they only stood in the passage.




GUILTY

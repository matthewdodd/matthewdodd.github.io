            . I am churchwarden of St. Olave, Silver-street. The prisoner had received relief as a pauper
 from our parish. On Monday, the 16th of August, in the evening, he came to me, and said he had been to Woolwich, and obtained employment as a rigger at the dock-yard, at 1 l. a week, and requested I would advance him 10 s. or 12 s., that he might not draw upon his employers before Saturday night - I gave him 10 s. on the parish account. He called again on Thursday evening, and was apprehended on the Saturday following.

WILLIAM CHECK BOUSFIELD, ESQ
. I live in Blackfriars-road. On the afternoon of the 14th of January, I was in Fleet-street, between four and five o'clock—I felt something touch my pocket—I turned round immediately, and missed my handkerchief—the prisoner and a lesser boy were standing close by—I saw the prisoner tucking something into his breast—they both ran away—I followed the prisoner, and saw him drop my handkerchief on the pavement—I picked it up, and still followed him—he was taken in my presence—he was never out of my sight—this is my handkerchief.




GUILTY
. Aged 14.—


Transported for Seven Years.

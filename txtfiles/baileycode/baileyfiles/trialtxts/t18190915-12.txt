            . I live in the Old Jewry. On the 13th of September, between five and six o'clock, I went to the Poultry


 to see Mr. Hunt's procession; my watch was taken from me, but I do not know who by. Next day I saw it in possession of the officer.

            . I am a constable. I followed the procession from St. Mildred's-court to Cornhill; there was a bustle, as a gentleman had lost his watch; some of the mob gave the prisoner in charge. I found a watch in his fob, which he said was his own. I went to the watchmaker, and found the prosecutor out - he claimed it. The prisoner had two other seals in his pocket.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

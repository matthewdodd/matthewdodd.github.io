            , sworn.
I live with Mr. 
               
                  Richard
                   Ponsonby
               



            , called the Hon. 
               
                  Richard
                   Ponsonby
               



            , in New-street, Spring Gardens


; I am his servant. On the 5th of October, between seven and eight in the morning, the prisoner came down the area steps about a quarter before eight, from the street into the kitchen; the kitchen door was wide open; it is seldom shut; he asked if Mr. Welch, or Walch, lived there, I told him no; he then went up into the street; he staid about two minutes, and then returned: he asked me if this was not Mr. Sponsby's house: the name Ponsonby is on the door; I said my master's name was Ponsonby; then he asked for Mr. Johnson: we have no servant in the house of that name: the silver cream pot stood on the kitchen dresser; and then said this is what I want, and thank you, and he ran up the area steps; I cried stop thief! I could not overtake him: I saw him again I believe the Saturday week after; this happened on the Friday morning; I knew him again; I am very sure the prisoner is the man; he was taken on mydescription; I never saw the milk pot after; I had not so little as five minutes conversation with him at both times; it was about a quarter after eight; I am regular in my work; I general rise at half past six; I was standing on the kitchen table dusting coppers; I said he had very black hair, and a shortish person, nobody pointed him out to me.

             sworn.
I was opening my master's shop, No. 4, Spring Gardens, about a hundred yards from Mr. Ponsonby's, about a quarter before eight, and I saw a man come round the corner very fast, and he ran into Charing Cross, and about a minute after this gentlewoman came running, and calling stop thief! it was the prisoner that ran; I have seen him several times about Spring Gardens before; I saw him again in New-street, going into the Park; I went to tell Mr. Ponsonby, and he was gone; I saw him again the night following in Coventry-street; I came to Charing Cross and told two of the Bow-street patrols; it was at night, about eight; I went with them, but he was gone, and we came down the Haymarket, and we saw him at the corner of Suffolk-street, and they laid hold of him and took him to the Hope; I attended at Bow-street on Monday, I am sure of him.

             sworn.
I am the other patrole, I was also present; the boy pointed the prisoner out as the man.
Court to Mrs. Phillips. What sort of a milk pot is this? - A handsome high newfashioned milk pot, stood on a foot, and had a lid, I do not know the weight of it.
PRISONER's DEFENCE.
I was in Covent-garden market that morning, buying a bushel of apples, which I get my bread by selling on a jackass; know nothing of the matter.

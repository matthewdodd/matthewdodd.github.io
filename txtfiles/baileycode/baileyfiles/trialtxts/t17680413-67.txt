             picked me up in Whitechapel


, and took me in a house; when up stairs she picked my pocket of my watch, there was a chain and seal to it; I saw it in her hand, she gave it to Waters; as we were coming down stairs I charged her with it; Waters said he was a constable, and offered to beat my watch about my head; this was in the house of 
               
                  James 
                  Portland 
               



            ; he was admitted evidence, but he died last Tuesday; I lost at the same time half a guinea and a handkerchief.

                  Sevear 
               



            . I received a watch of Portland to pawn; he said it was his own, and cost him four guineas; I pawned it to Mr. Macaby.

                  Sevear

                  Levi 
               



            . I live in Buckle-street, Whitechapel; I saw Waters, Portland, and the Smith together; Riley asked her for this watch and things; Waters said he was a constable, and had a good mind to knock the watch about his head; I went to the watch-house and got assistance; when we got to the house where he was robbed, the people were all gone.
Mr. Marsden produced the information of Portland, taken before Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            , in which he swore he and Waters were in another room, and they went into the room to the prosecutor, and Smith and she gave Waters the watch, who gave it him, and he sent Sevear to pawn it, which she did for 16 s. which was equally divided betwixt Waters and him.
Smith's defence.
I never saw the watch.
Water's defence.
I was in the house at the time, and went into the room, but never had the watch.

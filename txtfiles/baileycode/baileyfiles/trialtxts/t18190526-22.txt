On the 1st of May, between two and three o'clock in the morning, I met the prisoners at Kensington Gravel-pits; Johnson had the sack with the kettle and saucepan, and Owen had the pail; they said they bought them at Paddington the day before, and had used them at the fair. Johnson said the sack belonged to Owen - Owen said there was no name on it. I found the prosecutor's name written on it in large characters.

MARY ANN GOODWIN
. My husband, John Goodwin, is a shoemaker in Dartmouth Cottages, Kentish Town. On the 10th of July, at half-past eleven o'clock in the morning, I was at home—I did not see any one come into the shop, nor go out—a young man came and told me I had been robbed—he went after the prisoner—I went after him and met him—he returned with the prisoner and the shoes, which are my husband's—they were hanging inside the shop.





GEORGE LAWSON
. I was cleaning some windows, and saw the prisoner walk into the prosecutor's shop—he walked out and walked in again—he had an apron on, and put the shoes into it—there was a young man received them from the prisoner—I pursued them, and they threw them down—I took the prisoner—a boy picked up these shoes—the prisoner if the person that went into the shop.




GUILTY
.* Aged 18.—


Transported for Seven Years.

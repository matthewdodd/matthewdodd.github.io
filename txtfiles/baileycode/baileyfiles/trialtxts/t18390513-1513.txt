THOMAS BECKENSALE KING
. I live in Exmouth-street, Clerkenwell. On the 15th of April I had fifteen yards of carpet in my shop—I saw it

safe about five o'clock—I received information afterwards, and missed it—this is it—(looking at it.)





RICHARD BEETON
. I am a linen-draper, and live in Exmouth-street. I was at my door, speaking to a woman that evening—I saw the prisoner cross the road, with the piece of carpet on his shoulder—he went into the court opposite, and on seeing me follow him, he threw it down—I over took him about a dozen yards off—I took him and the carpet back to Mr. King's.

Prisoner. I did not throw it down. Witness. Yes, I saw it on your shoulder, and you threw it down.




GUILTY

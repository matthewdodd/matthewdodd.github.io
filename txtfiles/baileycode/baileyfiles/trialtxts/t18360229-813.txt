THOMAS WOODLEY
. I am in the employ of Mr. James Brown, a perfumer, in Cheapside—I knew the prisoner for some time previous to the 11th of February—I had known where he lived, but did not know where he lived then—on the 11th or 12th of February he came to bring an order, and he took away some goods that I had put up for another customer—which was three dozen and a half of combs, one dozen of combs, half a dozen bottles of oil, and the other things, as stated in the indictment, were looked out for another customer—he got what he wanted, and then he went away—he was taken on the 12th, and then the cakes of shaving-paste were found.





THOMAS PINK
. I am an officer of Cripplegate. I produce the cakes of Mechi paste, and the other things from Mr. Casey, of Cannot-street.





RICHARD CASEY
. I am a fruiterer. I bought these things of the prisoner on two different days (myself and two boys in the shop)—I bought two little combs and these three brushes—the pins—I did not buy, nor the Mechi paste—I did not ask the prisoner who he was—I paid for them, and in an hour after went to Mr. Brown.





THOMAS WOODLEY
. These are my master's property.




GUILTY
. Aged 14.—


Transported for Seven Years.
(There were two other indictments against the prisoner, one for felony, and one for obtaining goods under false pretences.)

            . The prisoner was entrusted to receive money for me till the 1st of June. Mr. Parsons owed me 7s. for a sack of salt, delivered on the 4th of May. I have never received the money from the prisoner - he made a minute of what he received; I checked it off in the book - he paid me some money on the 12th of May. I had given him a receipt for Parson's; he brought it back, and said it was not convenient to pay it.

            . On the 4th of May, I received a sack of salt from Moore. I paid the prisoner 7s. for it a few days after. I am certain there were some shillings among it; he wrote this receipt on the bill.

            . I am an officer. I took him in charge.
The prisoner put in a written defence, stating, that his master having had to pay a fine for his not paying the turnpike, and had stopped 2l. 17s. 9d. of the prisoner's wages, and that he took this cash to provide for his family.
JOHN MOORE. This is false; I paid him 2l. 1s. 8d. on the 1st of June - I was fined 2l. 16s., but never stopped it out of his wages. It is entirely false.

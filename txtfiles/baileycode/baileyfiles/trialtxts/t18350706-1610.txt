EDWARD GOSNELL
. I am one of the firm of John Giselle and Co.—there are four partners-we live in Three Kings-court-the prisoner was in our service for nearly sixteen years—he had 26 a week, and 2s. 6d. besides, for being employed at dinner time—his situation was a very light one-in consequence of suspicion, last Wednesday, I went into the upper warehouse and observed a brown paper parcel in the prisoner's last which excited my suspicion—I allowed it to remain there till his dinner time which would be in about a quarter of an hour-we then had him called down to tie some parcels up and as he was going out I stopped him at the door and asked him to walk into the counting house—I asked him to show me what he had in his pockets-on examining them, he had nothing there—I asked him for his hat—he had put his hat down on entering the counting-house—I found the same parcel in it, with his pocket-handkerchief over it-it contained six bottles of salts and oil—I said, "Whose parcel is this?"—he immediately said it was ours—I said, "How came you to take it? you are a last man now we have warned you often—enough and are now determined to punish you as for as we can "I asked what he had taken the night before—he said, "Nothing" I asked what he took the morning before he said, "A parcel of grease" he said then was a Jew near Bishopsgate-street, who he used to meet and give these things to this property is ours.

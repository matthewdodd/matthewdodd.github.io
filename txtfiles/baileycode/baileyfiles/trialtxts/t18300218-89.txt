. On Sunday morning, the 24th of January, I missed five fowls out of a hen-house which I had put on the roost at five o'clock on Saturday night; I saw them dead afterwards, and knew them to be my master's - their feet and wings are here; I do not know the prisoner.

            . I am a Police-constable. I was on duty on Sunday morning, the 24th of January, and saw the prisoner with a parcel under his arm, just by the Hero of Maida - I asked what he had got; he said fowls, which he had brought from Mr. Meek's, and was going to take them to Mr. Bull - I said, "I must look at them;" I found five fowls dead, but quite warm - I took him to the section-house, and then before Mr. Rawlinson; I inquired, and got information that Mr. Lawrie had lost some, and the description he gave of them exactly answered those I found on the prisoner.
The prisoner put in a written Defence, stating that he had bought the fowls of a man on his road from Watford, for 4s.

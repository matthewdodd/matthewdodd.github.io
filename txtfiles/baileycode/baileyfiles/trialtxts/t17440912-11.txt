             . I went up stairs out of the kitchen to fetch a hand-basket, and when I came down again I met the Prisoner upon the stairs . She asked whether one Mrs. Williams lived there? I said no; and she went out. I saw something in her apron, and went down into the kitchen directly and missed the pewter. I pursued her and took her about 200 yards from the house, she dropped the pewter, and said a woman gave it her to carry to her lodging. 


               Guilty 10 d.

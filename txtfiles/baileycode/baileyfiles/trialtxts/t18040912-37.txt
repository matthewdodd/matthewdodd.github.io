Q. Did you know him before? - A. Yes; I have seen him a great many times; I am sure he is the man.
Prisoner's defence. I was on shore picking up coals and rope and what I could; I saw this pail; I went and sold it to this woman for 14 pence; I said to them I had stole no pail.
Court. Here is a witness that saw you take it from the barge.

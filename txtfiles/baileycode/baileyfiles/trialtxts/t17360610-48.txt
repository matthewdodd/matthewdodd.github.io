            . The Prisoner and I broke open the Prosecutor's House,) the Fleece Alehouse in New-street by Whitechappel Bars



 ) the 15th of April. A little after 12 at Night, we took down the Shutter, on the backside of the House, and got in at the Window, we took the Money mention'd in the Indictment out of a Cupboard, and a Porrage-pot; the Money we shar'd; and the Prisoner sold the Pot for 6 s. and gave me 3 s. for my Part. He liv'd in Tenner-Row, and for five or six Weeks I liv'd with him and lay in the same Bed with him and his Wife. I was taken up for another Fact the 14th or 15th of May, and then I made this Discovery, because his Wife came to Prison to me and laugh'd at me.

            . I live opposite Mrs. Maria Brown. On Sunday morning, the 16th of April, about half-past six o'clock, I saw the prisoner get into her area, and get the bread and lamb, which he threw up to some man outside. I came down, and asked why the watchman was not there; the man who had received the things got away. The prisoner was taken the same day - I had seen him before - he lives in the neighbourhood.

            . I live with Mrs. Brown - she is a widow. I left these articles in the safe on Saturday night, at twelve o'clock, and they were gone on Sunday morning.

            . I am an officer of Mary-le-bone. The watchman told me the area had been robbed, about seven o'clock in the morning. I apprehended the prisoner about one o'clock the same day - I took him to Mrs. Chard, who said he was the man - he said he knew nothing about it.

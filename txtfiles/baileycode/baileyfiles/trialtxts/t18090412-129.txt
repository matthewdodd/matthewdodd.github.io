Q. Do you know the prisoner 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Yeo
               



             - A. Yes; I saw him on the 4th of April, about one o'clock at noon, I was serving my customers with bread; I had a large basket on a wheelbarrow; I had occasion to go home to my master's shop for a crusty loaf; I left my basket. On my return I saw the prisoner with four quartern loaves, two under each arm; I pursued him and took him; I never lost sight of him; I brought him back to my basket, he threw two loaves down in the basket and two down in the dirt; I took him to the shop, he was sent to Marlborough-street; he was a stranger to me, only seeing him the week before taking two quartern loaves from Mr. Hardy's man; I am sure they are my master's bread.
Q. Are four quartern loaves worth four shillings and eleven pence - A. Yes.
Prisoner's Defence. He never saw me take the loaves out of the barrow; it was not his bread at all.

FREDERICK MILES
. I am a policeman. On the 2nd of September I met the prisoner in Hatton-wall, at half-past four o'clock in the evening—I had heard a pawnbroker's shop had been robbed of some property—I suspected and stopped her with a bundle in her apron—I said, "What have you got there?"—she said, "What is that to you?"—I took the bundle out of her apron, in which was this gown, and took it to the prosecutor—on taking her to the station-house she dropped a pair of new boots from under her gown.





CHARLES WOOD
. I am shopman to Mr. W. Ward, of Grays-inn-lane. We lost a gown from the shop-door that day—this is it—(produced)—I saw it at ten o'clock in the morning.

Prisoner's Defence. Some man brought me out to have a little drink; it took effect on me; I bought the gown.






JOHN LAW
. I am a policeman. I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—I was a witness on the trial, and apprehended her—she is the person.

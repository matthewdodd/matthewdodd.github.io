            . I live in Covent Garden


, the Prisoner came to her Lodging the 9th of October, and at the Time mentioned in the Indictment, she robbed it of the Things mentioned in the Indictment; she went out on Friday the 26th in the Morning, and said she would be back that Day, but did not return 'till the Tuesday after: In the mean Time, I desired my Wife to go to my Lord Foley's , to enquire for her, because she used to talk of going there sometimes, and having lived with the Family; and they said there was no such Person ever lived there; when she came back, my Wife charged her with taking the Things; and I sent her to the Round-House in Covent-Garden, and she told me where they were, and what they were pawned for: She said they were not pawned in the Name of 
               
                  Susannah 
                  Harps

                  Susannah 
                  Beane 
               



            ; I found all the Things where she said she had pawned them. - They were let to her in a ready furnish'd Lodging, and she was to have the Use of them. - These are my Goods.

            . I did take in a Sheet and a Candle-stick of a Woman who said her Name was 
               
                  Susannah 
                  Beane

            . I took in this Pillow and this Pair of Bellows, but I am not sure that is the Woman that brought them. - I do not very well know her; they were pawned in the Name of 
               
                  Susannah 
                  Beane 
               



            .
Q. Then you take in Things of any Body that brings them?
Wood. We take in Goods of any Body, if we believe them to be their own.

            . I never saw her but once, when she brought a Quilt, but I cannot be positive to the Prisoner: if it is her, she is much altered. I examined the Woman that brought it, whether it was her own? And she said it was, and that she bought it new.
Prisoner. His Wife told me, if at any Time I wanted a little Matter of Money, I might make use of her Things, if I had a Mind, so that her Husband did not know it. I did not do it with any Design of Fraud: She begged me when I was in the Round-House not to mention it to her Husband, and I should not have a Hair of my Head hurt.

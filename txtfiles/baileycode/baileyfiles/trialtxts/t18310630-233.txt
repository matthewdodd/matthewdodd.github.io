            . I am a Thames Police-officer. On the 10th of June, at six o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner at the entrance gate of the West India-dock, with a cocoa nut in his hand - I asked what ship he came from; he said from the Ruth, which lay in the Exportdock - I said I did not believe he belonged to any ship; he then said he did not - I asked how he came into the ship; he said he got on board the previous evening, and stopped there all night - I asked what he had in his hat; he said Nothing - I pulled it off, and found about fifty cigars, and he had fifty more round him; I found a shirt and trousers on him, which he said he took from the ship.
THOMAS BIRKENSHAW. I am chief mate of the Ruth. The prisoner was quite a stranger - he might have been on board; the property produced was in my chest in the cabin, which was locked, but not the chest - he broke open the sky-light.(Property produced and sworn to.)

            . I am the wife of John Turner, and live in York-street, Westminster


; he is a salesman
. I have seen the prisoner at our shop at different times; on the 1st of December she came with another woman - I had occasion to turn round, and saw the waistcoat under her shawl; I took it from her, and said I would give her in charge, but while I went round, she got away - this is the waistcoat.

            . I am a Policeman. I took the prisoner, in consequence of information, on the 21st of December; I took her to the prosecutrix's shop directly afterwards - she said to her, "Pray do let me go this time, pray forgive me, I will never come into the shop, nor do the like again."

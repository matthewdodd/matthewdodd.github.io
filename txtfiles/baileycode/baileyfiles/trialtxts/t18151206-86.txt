            . On the 28th of November, I was standing at my door, at 153, Howland-street, and I saw the two prisoners pass by with some dusting brushes beetween them; so I thought it proper to follow them. They went up a few steps, and then crossed between the coaches, and then they run. I followed them, and stopped them at the corner of John-street, in Howland-street; I secured one with my right hand, and the other with my left. Radley made his escape, and then come to the watch-house to see the other, when he was detained. I am positive as to both the prisoners.

. The prisoners came to his shop about four o'clock in the afternoon, on the 13th of August; they were about to make a purchase, when I saw Euston attempting to conceal something - the Policeman was sent for, and four handkerchiefs were found on Euston; they were half an hour or three quarters of an hour in the shop, and were both together - there were no persons near them.

Jones' Defence. I had been out, and in returning I overtook Euston - I said I was going to buy a handkerchief; I went into this shop and looked at these - I offered 4s. for one, the shopman asked 4s. 3d. for, and then they detected Euston; that is all I know.

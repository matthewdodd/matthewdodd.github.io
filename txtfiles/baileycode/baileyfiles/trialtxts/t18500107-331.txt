THOMAS SMITH



, stealing two watches, value 6l.; the goods of 



John Walker and another, in their dwelling-house: having been before convicted.






WILLIAM WILCOX
. I am assistant to John Walker and another, silversmiths, of 38, Whitechapel-road; it is their dwelling-house. On 21st Dec., about half-past eight o'clock, the prisoner came, and said he had been recommended there as being a respectable shop, and he wanted a good sound watch, at about 4l.—I brought out three—he took two, one in each hand, and placed them to his ear to see if they were going, and rushed out of the shop with them—I ran, and saw him run down a dark turning, and overtook him a quarter of a mile off the shop—I did not lose sight of him—these are the watches (produced).





WILLIAM MELOY
 (policeman, H 170.) I was in Whitechapel-road, and saw somebody running down Black Lion-yard—I pursued, and came up to Wilcox and the prisoner—the prisoner said nothing to the charge, but put his hand into his left trowsers' pocket—I tried to pull it out, but could not—I took him back to the shop, and found these watches in his left pocket—the glass of one is broken—I found the pieces in his pocket at the station.





JOHN WHEBLE
 (policeman, R 300). I produce a certificate from Mr. Clark's office—the prisoner is the person mentioned in it—I was present at his—(read—Convicted June, 1844, of stealing in a dwelling-house, having been before convicted; and transported for ten years)—I do not know how he came to be at large.




GUILTY
. Aged 27.—


Transported for Fourteen Years.

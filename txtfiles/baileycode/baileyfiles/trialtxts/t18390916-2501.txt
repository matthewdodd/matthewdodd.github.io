2501. 




JAMES CARNEY
 was indicted

for feloniously forging and uttering a request for the delivery of 1 pickaxe, with intent to defraud 



Joshua Nettleton.






JOSHUA NETTLETON
. I am an ironmonger, and live in Sloane-square, Chelsea—the prisoner is a labourer, and was employed by Mr. Payne, one of my customers. On the 27th of August the prisoner brought a note, and said he wanted a pickaxe for Mr. Payne—I did not look at the note, being busy at the time, but I knew him by coming for things before, and let him have the pickaxe.





HENRY PAYNE
. I am a builder and brick-maker. The prisoner worked for me as a labourer, sifting gravel—he was not in my employ on the 27th of August—he had left me about a month or six weeks—I never sent him for a pickaxe on the 27th of August—this note is not my writing, not at all like it—it was done without my authority or knowledge—I never authorized him to get any thing in my name—(read)—"Mr. Nettleton, Let the bearer have a pickaxe.—H. PAYNE."





GUILTY
. * Aged 20.—


Transported for Ten Years.

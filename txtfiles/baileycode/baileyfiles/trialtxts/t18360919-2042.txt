JOHN WILLIAMS
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
7th of September, 1 handkerchief, value 2s., the goods of 



Thomas Eycott.






THOMAS EYCOTT
. I am a tailor. On the 7th of September I was in Smithfield, and felt some one taking, something from my pocket—I turned and saw the prisoner—I tried to take him—a person behind him and the officer caught him at the same time—I saw my handkerchief on the ground, close by his feet—this is it—I know it by the pattern.





BENJAMIN BEMAN
. I live with my brother, who keeps a public-house in Westminster. I was in Smithfield—I turned and saw the prisoner trying to escape—I took him by the collar—he dropped a handkerchief, which I believe to be this.





JOHN LLOYD
. I am the officer of Portsoken Ward. I saw the handkerchief drop, but did not notice the person whom it dropped from—I picked it up from the pavement, and took the prisoner.

Guilty.

(The indictment further stated that the prisoner had been before convicted of felony.)





JOSEPH POTTER
. I produce a certificate of the prisoner's previous conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office (read)—he is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 17.—


Transported for Fourteen Years.

            . I am an inspector of the Police; I have a handkerchief and collar which I got from the prisoner's box - she had been brought to our station-house for being drunk; she owned it was her box, and sent the key which opened it - I have since sent to Newgate the gown and handkerchief she now has on.(Property produced and sworn to.)
The prisoner put in a written defence, stating that she had found the collar on the stairs after the prosecutrix inquired about it, and that she intended asking if it was hers; the handkerchief she had found in the water-closet.

             came into the shop, and informed me a man had stole a pair of boots that hung at the door, and had run down Leather-lane; I turned up the lane, and I immediately saw the prisoner running with something under his great coat; I came up with him, and took my boots from under his coat.
(The boots produced and deposed to by the prosecutor.)

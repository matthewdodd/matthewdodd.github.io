. On the 3rd of January, at a quarter past eight o'clock in the evening, I was serving some customers, and was told a piece of flannel had been taken from about five feet within the door - I ran round a place about twenty yards off; the flannel was dropped, and I took it up.
Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. When you saw it it was on the ground? A. Yes - I saw the prisoner in custody; there were three persons in the shop serving, but I am quite sure none of them had sold it.

            . I am a journeyman taylor
. I was up all Saturday night drunk. At eight in the morning I went to the Cheshire Cheese, Parker's Lane, where I saw the two prisoners; I went with them to their lodgings. I remember I put my watch into my waistcoat pocket for security. I went up stairs with them. When I came away I found my money and watch were gone. I had been upon the bed with them. I did not go back to their room to see whether my watch could be found there.
He produced a girl who deposed that he gave them several shillings for liquor, that they never gave him any change, but did not rob him.
Both 


               guilty of stealing, but not privately from his person

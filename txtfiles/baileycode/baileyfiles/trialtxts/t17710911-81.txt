             was indicted for

            . I lost a bundle of laths out of my yard, at Finchley


, on the 25th of 
               
                  August.
               


             I was informed the prisoner had taken them; I went after him and overtook him on the road; he had them on his back; I asked him what he was going to do with the laths; he said he picked them up in the path, near the road side; I brought him back into the yard, and compared the laths with the other bundles in the yard that were left behind, and they were alike; there were six bundles before, there were but five left.

             deposed that he saw the prioner come out of the prosecutor's yard, with the laths on his shoulder; that he acquainted the prosecutor of it and he pursued him."
The prisoner said nothing in his defence.




               Guilty 10 d.

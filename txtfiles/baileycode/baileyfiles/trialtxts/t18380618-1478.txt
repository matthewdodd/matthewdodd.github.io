MR. PHILLIPS
conducted the Prosecution.






ALEXANDER CHESNEY
. I am a linen-draper, and live in New-road, Commercial-road. I had the prisoner from Scotland in June, 1836, and took him into my employ—he remained till last February, when I discharged him, as I had missed some things—I went down to the wharf, put him on board a vessel, and paid his passage—after that I heard something, in consequence of which I employed a person to apprehend him, if possible—after he left my service I saw a key found underneath his bed, which fitted my shop-door, in which were my articles accessible—I missed some kerseymere, a shawl, and hat and calico—I have lost about 200l. altogether.





ALEXANDER NELSON
 (City police-constable.) On the 21st of May I met the prisoner in Skinner-street—I told him I wanted him, on account of Mr. Chesney—he said, "You don't mean to take me"—I said, "Yes I do"—he said, "What will you take to let me go"—I took him—he told me where he lived—I went there with a key which I got from the prisoner—I found this hat in an old drawer, in the state it is now.





CHARLES WALLER
 (City police-sergeant.) I went with the prisoner to the lodgings in New-street, Fetter-lane—I searched, and found this linen in a deal box, and this kerseymere, and a duplicate of a shawl.





JOHN DAVIS
. I am in the employ of Mr. Linwood, a pawnbroker in John-street. This shawl was pledged with me on the 30th of May by the prisoner—this is the duplicate I gave.





ALEXANDER CHESNEY

re-examined. This is one shawl that I missed—I missed a great many—this hat has my mark on the paper.




GUILTY

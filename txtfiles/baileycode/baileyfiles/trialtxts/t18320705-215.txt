, on the evening of the 15th of May, and locked the door; the next morning it was gone- the stable was not broken, but there was a place broken, through which some one got in at, and took it out - I had, seen the prisoner the day before; he came to the stable and wanted something of me - I said I could not give him any thing, but I went to the next stable, and recommended him to a person there; this is the whip.

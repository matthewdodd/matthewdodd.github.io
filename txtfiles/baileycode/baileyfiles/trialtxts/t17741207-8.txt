             and company's warehouse on the 22d. of October, it was rather dark, so I did not see him get in, I lost sight of him at the warehouse window, I waited there, I saw him put a bundle of yarn out of the warehouse, I saw him come out afterwards and I pursued him and took him, with the yarn upon him.
The prisoner said nothing in his defence.

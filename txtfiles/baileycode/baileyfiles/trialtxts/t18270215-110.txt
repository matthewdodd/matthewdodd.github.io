SARAH HILL. I am a shirt-maker
, and work for Mr. Lloyd, of Bond-street


; the prisoner and several other women assisted me in the trade. In consequence of suspicion, on the 19th of January, I proposed to search all the women, as I missed a shawl; I took them, singly, into another room; the prisoner was the only one who objected- she was told to take her clothes off; I saw her drop her hand, and a duplicate fell from some part of her dress - she tried to put her foot on it; I took it up, and said,"Here is the duplicate of my shawl;" I gave her in charge - the officer found the shoes and handkerchief in her trunk.

            . I am shopman to Mr. Cottle, a pawnbroker, of Oxford-street. This shawl was pawned in the name of Sarah Jones - I do not know who by, but this is the duplicate I gave the person.

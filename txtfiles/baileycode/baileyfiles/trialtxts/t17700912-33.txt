                  Ann

             knocked him down, and the other pick'd it up; that he got up and ran away; that when he got into the street, he saw Meadows, and challenged her with having his guinea; that she replied, she had not got it now, for she had lost her pocket.
The prisoners in their defence denied the charge.

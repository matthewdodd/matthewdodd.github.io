conducted the Prosecution.






LOUISA ANN EDEN
. I am the wife of George Morton Eden, of William-street, Lowndes-square. Baker came into our service as Butler in March last—I gave him the key of our plate, and gave him charge of it—I am a niece of Sir Hyde Parker; it was arranged that we should occupy his house during his visit to the North—we went to the house in Onslow-square on 18th April—Sir Hyde Parker left in July, and we continued the occupation of his house—our plate was removed to the house of Sir Hyde Parker, and his plate was there also when he left in July—I left town on 12th August, and left Baker in charge of our own plate and Sir Hyde Parker's also—I left two female servants in the house, Priscilla Abbott and Jane Hyam—there was amongst our plate silver tea pots, a mustard pot, forks, spoons, and other articles—the value of the whole was 200l. or 300l.—there was about the same kind of things belonging to Sir Hyde Parker; a silver dish, a gold goblet, and other things—his plate was of more value than ours—Sir Hyde Parker had a man in his service as groom, of the name of Ricketts; he went with him to Scotland in July—the news of this robbery reached me on 19th Sept.—I was then living at Penshurst, in Kent—I did not come to London till Baker was found, on 24th Sept.—Baker did not give me any intimation of his intention of going away.





ALEXANDER RICKETTS
. I now reside in Castle-street, Upper Brook-street, Grosvenor-square. In the early part of this year I was in the service of Sir Hyde Parker as groom—I accompanied him to Scotland in July—I left his service in Scotland on 16th Aug.—I arrived in London on the 21st—I went to Sir Hyde Parker's house, in Onslow-square—I had left a box there, and went to fetch it—I found Baker in charge of the house, and Priscilla Abbott, the housemaid, also—Baker allowed me to stay in my late master's house—I staid there from Monday, the 21st, till Monday, the 28th—during the week I was there, Hyam was away from the house—I did not see her—on Sunday, 27th Aug., Priscilla Abbott went out for the day, and I and Baker were alone in the house—I had sometimes had my meals in the house during the week—there was one jug of wine the first night that I came there; it was sherry—I did not see where it was got from—I assisted Baker in getting some wine out of the cellar—I believe that was on the Friday—Baker sent me to borrow a turnscrew, which I borrowed at No. 9, Onslow-square—that was used in opening the door—I did not take the turnscrew back—I had before lived at No. 9, Onslow-square—I got some wine out with the turnscrew—I and Baker drank part of it—some of it was left on the Sunday, that we had taken out on Friday—a great part of it was sherry—there was another sort, but I do not know what it was—on the Sunday morning after Priscilla Abbott had gone out, Baker made a communication to me about 1 o'clock—he said to me, "Tom, I intend taking off every bit of that plate"—I said, "What do you mean?"—he repeated the expression, adding, "We intend to emigrate to New York or America; if you will join us, you shall have your share of it"—I said, "No, I will have

nothing to do with It"—shortly after 1 o'clock, Crossley came—I did not expect any body—I had not seen Crossley before that day—Baker let Crossley in—I was in the hall with him—Crossley looked at me, and Baker said, "I think Tom is all right"—we then proceeded to the pantry, and Baker opened the closet door and showed Crossley the plate belonging to Sir Hyde Parker—he also showed him General Eden's plate chest, which was outside the closet—he did not open the chest, he only showed him the chest, and told him that was General Eden's plate—after Crossley had looked at it, he said, "I think we had better have a bit of dinner first"—we went and had some dinner in the kitchen—Baker said to me, "Tom, this scamp has been in two or three robberies before, and one murder"—Crossley said, "You fool, it was no murder; the man was only shot"—we drank some of this sherry with the dinner, and after dinner we went into the pantry, and the whole of the plate was then weighed by Crossley, Baker, and myself—I took account of the weight as it went on—I believe the weight was 75 lbs.—Baker asked Crossley what he thought the value of it was, and Crossley said he thought about 500l.—Baker then suggested giving me 50l., wishing me to emigrate to New York or America—he said, "Tom, we will give you 50l., if you like, at once, as your share, and you can emigrate to New York, or America, or Australia, or where you like"—I said, "No, I will have nothing at all to do with it; I plainly see what your intentions are; you would have me take this 50l., and then you will say that I was a thief, and had run away with the plate"—Baker said, "We did not intend you to take it; we only suggested it; if you like you shall have a third part"—I said I would consider; and let them know on the morrow, which was Monday—Crossley was present during the whole of this conversation—the plate was all put back again, and we went back to the kitchen, and resumed the drinking of Sir Hyde Parker's sherry—Crossley stayed till about half past 8 o'clock in the evening; he was then quite drunk—during the weighing of the plate, aquafortis was applied to anything that was doubtful, whether it was silver or not—I purchased the aquafortis from a chemist in the neighbourhood—Baker gave me 2d. to pay for it—when Crossley was drunk, at half past 8 o'clock in the evening, I took him to Brompton cob stand—I spoke to a cab man there, and lie refused to take him—I was in conversation with the cab man for some time, and I told Crossley, "I will pay this fellow's fare"—the caiman said, "I am no fellow, I get my living honestly"—the cabman was offended, and refused to take Crossley—Crossley was not able to stand; he fell down—I picked him up again, and took him on to Knightsbridge cab stand—I there found a less scrupulous cowman, and he took him—I paid his fare to Bermondsey-street, and Crossley gave the cowman his address—when the cabman drove away, I went back to Sir Hyde Parker's house; I found Baker there—Priscilla Abbott had not come home—I think she came home about half past 10 o'clock—the next morning I went with Baker to Crossley's house, in Bermondsey; he keeps a beer shop—he was at home, and we all three went to a public house, at the corner of Tooley-street—I do not remember the name—I had in the course of that morning, before we got to Crossley's house, said to Baker, "I will have nothing at all to do with this affair, Baker, and I would advise you not either;" Baker said, "Tom, I must; for I cannot make my plate right"—I said to him, "That is a bad job"—while we were at this public house in Tooley-street, there was a note written and signed by each of us—I had that note for some time—I am sure I do not know what became of it afterwards; I have

sent home for it, but they could not find it at home—Baker said at the public house, that the reason he could not carry out the robbery at once, was because he wanted time to get his discharge from the army—he said he could get his discharge on 12th Sept.—it was said that Baker and I were to take a portion of the small plate in our pockets the next day, which was the Tuesday—I had agreed in the note to do so, but previously to that, I had employed a man to take my box from Onslow-square, telling him to be sure to say nothing to Baker, as I intended to go away by the first train the next morning to Bristol—I did not intend to have anything to do with this affair—Baker and I then left Tooley-street, and I went to an office in Austin Friars, to inquire about vessels sailing to America—after making those inquiries, I returned to Onslow-square—I did not sleep there that Monday night, but in a room that Jones had got for me at No. 13, Pond-place, Brompton, where my boxes were, and the next morning I went off by the Great Western, to Bristol—my father lives about twenty-five miles from Bristol—I went afterwards to Cheltenham, and got employment as an omnibus conductor—I returned on 24th Sept. by the night train—what brought me back was a letter which I received from a friend in London—on my arriving on 24th, I went to No. 73, Onslow-square—I found a Mrs. Stone there, who had been a former servant of the family—I made some communication to her, and she and I went to the nearest police station—I there saw Serjeant Whicher, and made a communication to him—I accompanied him and another Serjeant the same evening to Crossley's, No. 5, Bermondsey-street—I went in alone, leaving the officers in the street—Crossley was not at home the first time I went—I went a second time, and met him in the street—he said to me, "Well, Tom, how are you? I said, "Quite well, thank you; how are you?"—he said, "I have something to say you;" I said, "I have something to say to you too"—I said, "Of course you have heard of the robbery; have you seen Baker?" he said, "No"—I said, "Well, he has run away with every bit of plate, and they suspect me"—he said, "They cannot do anything with you or me, unless they know about the Sunday job;" I said, "No"—I then said, "I want to go and see General Eden about it; I expect he will come home this evening"—I then went as far as the top of Tooley-street, and got into a cab—Crossley said positively that he has not seen Baker since the Sunday—he went with me to the cab, half way up Tooley-street, and I took a cab which was passing, and went to the top of Tooley-street—I am not certain whether Crossley went up or down the street—when I got to the top, I told the cab man to walk back, as there was somebody I wanted to speak to—I was looking for the officers; I found them, and made a communication to them—I then went home to No. 2, Bury-street, Brompton.

Cross-examined by
MR. BALLANTINE. Q. Tom is your name, is it? A. No, Alexander is my name; but Tom I am generally called, because I believe there were two Toms previously—the fact was, in this matter, that after I had been led in to open the wine cellar, I could not positively say at once that I would have nothing to do with the plate—I thought it was not right to break into the cellar and drink the wine—having taken the wine, I listened to the suggestion about the plate—I did not intend to profit at all by the transaction—nothing of the sort—when I went to fetch the aquafortis, and get the instrument, it was done without the least intention of deriving any benefit from it—I do not know where the plate is now—I believe it is not at Bristol, or at Cheltenham—I gave all the information I could.

JURY. Q. How came you to leave your master in Scotland? A. Through

disobedience of orders; Sir Hyde Parker gave me an order, and I did not execute it—I was not discharged at once; I was there a week after my master gave me warning.

Cross-examined by
MR. PARRY. Q. Were you not discharged without notice? A. No—I got my month's wages in advance, instead of a month's notice, and then I came to his house in London and stayed there a week—I did not tell my master I was going to his house in London—I lived in his house a week, by leave of the butler.

COURT. Q. Was that the week you mean? A. No—he gave me notice on Monday, but there was no vessel sailing till Thursday—he allowed me to stay till Thursday, and I stayed till Monday—I was dismissed because Sir Hyde Parker told the butler to write a note to a butcher at Burrabridge, and I took the not which was to order a black faced sheep; the man had no black faced sheep—on returning, I met Sir Hyde Parker, and said, "The man has no black faced sheep, but he has got what he calls 'between;' I don't know what he means"—he said, "I know what he means;" and he sent me the next day for a dog collar, and to have a between sheep—I would not do it; and he afterwards found I had ordered a between sheep.





PRISCILLA ABBOTT
. I was housemaid in the family of Sir Hyde Parker. I remember Ricketts coming to stop there—he was there a week—I cannot say whether he went away on Monday or Tuesday—I remember the Sunday before he went away—I went out that day, at half past 10 o'clock in the morning; Ricketts and Baker were then in the house, and no one else—I came home about half past 10 o'clock at night—I found Ricketts and Baker there—I do not remember whether it was Monday or Tuesday that Ricketts left, but I remember the fact of. his leaving—lie made a communication to me before he left—I did not see him at all at the house after that—on 13th Sept. Baker went out; he said he was going to the barracks, and he should be gone the day—he might leave about 11 o'clock in the morning—he never returned—he had borrowed a sovereign of me; it might be three weeks or a month before the day he went away—it was after Ricketts had left—Baker paid me one day; a week or ten days before the day he left—I did not then see any other money in his possession, but I saw some the day before he got his discharge from the regiment—he got his discharge on the 12th, and it was the day before that that I saw him with money—that was two days before he went away altogether—he left the day after he obtained his discharge—I might see eight or nine sovereigns; he said he had taken it from the regiment for his clothes, I understood him, and his wages.

Cross-examined by
MR. BALLANTINE. Q. What made him show you the money? A. I do not know—he took it out of his pocket in his hand, and said he had taken it from the regiment—I did not keep company with him—he took the money out of his pocket loose, with his hand—he might have borrowed money of me before, but not lately—he had paid me—he did not borrow as much as a sovereign, only once—I do not know what his wages were—I knew Ricketts—he came from Scotland to the house—I do not know that he was left alone in the house—I was out on the Sunday all day—I left him there in company with Baker.





JANE HYAMS
. I am Mrs. Eden's maid. I lived with the family in Onslow-square—I knew Baker as butler there—I do not know the other man—I went away, by Mrs. Eden's leave, during the absence of the family, on 19th Aug., and returned on the 30th—Ricketts was not then in the

house—I never saw him in the house after I returned—I remember Baker going away on 13th Sept.—I never saw him again till he was in custody—I went to Mrs. Stone's on the 18th, as I frit very uneasy at Baker's not returning—Mrs. Stone lived at Brompton Cemetery—she had formerly lived in our service—in consequence of what passed between us I procured the assistance of a man from a builder's, and took him to the house—he broke open the closet door, and found that the plate was all gone, both General Eden's, and Sir Hyde Parker's—on the morning Baker went away; he said perhaps he should not return that night, and I never saw him afterwards—he said he had taken 5s. with him, and he had left locked up in his box between 60l. and 70l.—General Eden's plate was in the pantry, in a plate box or chest—that was found locked, as well as the closet—that was broken open, and found empty, and one brick in it, and a brick also in Sir Hyde Parker's plate box, which was in the closet—after I returned from seeing my friends I saw General Eden's plate box open, with the small plate on the top—I am not quite certain whether it was the week I returned or the beginning of the week after; it was about a week or a fortnight before Baker left—I saw him go to the chest, and open it—I saw a portion of the plate in it—it appeared to me to be right.

COURT. Q. Are you sure that was after you came back? A. Yes.





CHARLOTTE STONE
. I live at Brompton Cemetery. I was formerly in Mrs. Eden's service—I remember Hyams coming and making a communication to me—in consequence of that I went to Sir Hyde Parker's house—I afterwards got a man to break open a closet and a box, and the plate was all gone—I know Ricketts—I saw him after this discovery of the loss of the plate—he came to me, at No. 73, Onslow-square—I did not go to live there, I happened to be there when be came—that was on Monday, the 24th—he made a communication to me, and I and he went to the police station.





JOHNATHAN WHICHER
. I am a sergeant, of the Detective Force. I received directions to inquire about this robbery—I went to No. 73, Onslow-square, on 21st Sept.—I opened a box that was pointed out to me by Abbott and Hyams as Baker's—there were clothes in it.





JANE HYAMS

re-examined. I pointed out Baker's box to this officer.





JONATHAN WHICHER

re-examined. On the 25th I saw Ricketts at the police station, Brompton—he was there previous to my getting there—I had been making inquiries about him—he made a statement to me—in consequence of what he said, I went to Bermondsey the same evening with Sergeant Tewsley—I went to Crossley's house, a beer shop, No. 5, Bermondsey-street, the Bricklayers' Arms—Ricketts went in first—we stayed in the neighbourhood—after some time Ricketts came to us in a cab—he made a communication to me, and J and he and Tewsley went into Crossley's, house—I saw Crossley behind the bar—Tewsley told him he was an officer, and he apprehended him for stealing a quantity of plate, in company with a man named Baker—he made some reply or some remark, I forget what it was, as to what the charge was—it was repeated, and he said, "Very well"—I proceeded to search the house, and in the top room I found Baker—this was about 10 o'clock at night—there was a bed in the room—Baker was partly undressed, and was sitting on the bed—having a description of him previously, I said to him, "I believe your name is Baker?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "I am an officer; I apprehend you on suspicion of stealing a quantity of plate, the property of Sir Hyde Parker"—he said, "Very well"—he pointed to the mantel piece, and said, "Take care of those

papers"—I took the two papers; they are a discharge from the Army, and a character—I conveyed him to, the station,—I had not heard Crossley ask any question about Baker.





GEORGE TEWSLEY
 (police sergeant, B 17). I accompanied the last witness to Crossley's house—I took Crossley into custody, and told him what for—I took possession of fifteen sovereigns from his wife, but not in his presence—I went up stairs afterwards to a room, where I found Baker—I should say, from what I saw in the room, that he had been there for some considerable time—there were several examinations before the Magistrate—on the day of the last examination I was directed by a man, before the examination, to go to the cell, as Baker wanted to see me—he had asked for me an hour before—as soon as I got to the cell door he asked me if we had found anything—I said, "No, we have not"—he said, "Did you go to Bermondsey-street"—I said, "Yes, we did, and found nothing"—he asked where we had searched—I told him we had searched the whole of the room, and the fireplace, and found nothing—he said, "I placed 452. there myself, in the side of the fireplace nearest tie window, which I received of them"—I did not ask him of whom—he said, "They brought me two twenties, and a seventeen; that was all I received of the whole produce"—I believe he used that word—in consequence of this I was directed to go and look at the place which he named—I found nothing—we tore the paper from the side of the fireplace, but saw nothing—I came back, and he said, "Well, have you found it?"—I said, "No, I have not"—he said, "Did you take the paper off?"—I said, "Yes, I did"—he said, "Did you do anything else?"—I said, "No"—he said, "You should have taken off the plaster—plaster of Paris, I believe it was, and there you will find a piece of wood, jammed between two bricks; that denotes the place where I concealed the money"—I returned to the room, and we found a piece of mahogany between two bricks—I found one of those bricks loose—it communicated with the flue of the chimney below—I found no money—if anything had been put in there I should say it must have gone down the flue.

Cross-examined by
MR. BALLANTINE. Q. You have not stated this conversation publicly before? A. I believe I have not, no more than to the policemen—I believe I have not; I do not know that I can tell you for a certainty; I might have told some persons—I have not told it in any public room, or public court, or before the prisoner, or in his presence—it occurred on 5th Oct.—I was directed to go to the prisoner's cell by what is called the swab of the station, whose name is White—he directed me to go there—I did not go with the swab—I said nothing to him till he spoke to me—I mentioned this communication to Mr. Wontner, the solicitor, the same day that I heard it.





SOPHIA COFFEY
. I live servant in a family at No. 9, Onslow-square. I have seen Baker—I know Ricketts—I lent him a screwdriver—I gave it him at our house—he came to borrow it, between 3 and 4 o'clock in the afternoon—he did not bring it back—I went to Sir Hyde Parker's to inquire for it—I saw Baker, and told him, and he said he would bring it to me, and he brought it on Monday—I told Baker I wanted the screwdriver that I had lent to Ricketts, and he said he would bring it.





WILLIAM SMITH
. I am a sergeant in the Scotch Fusileer regiment of Guards. I know Baker—he had been formerly in that regiment—he received his discharge on 12th Sept.—that was the day when he became entitled to it—this (looking at it) is the certificate given him on his discharge—on that day I paid him a sovereign—that was all he was entitled to.


Cross-examined by
MR. BALLANTINE. Q. What was he in the army? A He was a private, but was employed as a servant; he would have a regimental dress—if that dress belonged to the previous year it was his own—if it belonged to that year he would return it—his character was good.

Cross-examined by
MR. PARRY. Q. Do you know Crossley? A. Yes, upwards of twenty years; he was in the regiment, and he got his discharge—this is his discharge (produced)—I think he was discharged ten or twelve years ago—he was discharged at his own request, and had twelve months" pay.





JAMES THOMASON
. I am waterman at the cab stand at Brompton. I was at my stand on Sunday night, 27th Aug.—I saw Crossley and Ricketts come to the rank between 8 and 9 o'clock—they wanted a cab, to go to Bermondsey—there were several cabs there—Crossley was intoxicated—he did not go in a cab from that stand—there was an altercation between the driver and them—the caiman wanted to be paid his fare first, because Crossley was drunk—I advised Ricketts to pay the fare—he said he would—he said to Crossley, "I will pay the fellow his fare, and you will have nothing to pay when you get to Bermondsey-street"—the driver said he was no fellow; he worked hard for his living—Crossley fell down in the middle of the rank—I was the first to go to" him—I called Ricketts to come and help him up—they went away, and I saw no more.





WILLIAM CHAMPION
. I am a cab driver. I was on the stand at Knights bridge on Sunday evening, 27th Aug.—I merely put Crossley into a cab—Ricketts paid the fare—I did not drive the cab—Crossley was drunk—he was to be taken to Bermondsey.

Cross-examined by
MR. PARRY. Q. He was very drunk? A. Yes; he made a rare noise.





JOHN JONES
. I live at No. 13, Pond-place, near Onslow-square. I am a little acquainted with Ricketts—I being out of place, he gave me a little work in the stable, as groom—I knew him just before he went to Scotland—he came to me on 26th Aug., and asked me to go to the stable to fetch his boxes, as he was going out in the morning—this was at the stable, behind Sir Hyde Parker's house—I packed the boxes myself—they contained wearing apparel; nothing besides—he asked me to get him a bed, for something was going on very unpleasant—he slept that night in a room in the same house that I lodge in—the next morning he started at half past 5 o'clock, to be at Paddington at 6 o'clock—I think I helped to put his I luggage into the cab, and the cab man helped—I went with him, and saw him take a ticket for Bristol—I saw it put on his boxes—he took nothing with him but his own wearing apparel.





THOMAS WONTNER, ESQ
. I am solicitor to this prosecution. It was by my advice that what was said about money being found at Crossley's house should not be mentioned—I gave notice to the prisoners themselves that that evidence would be mentioned here—I attended the examination at which Ricketts was examined—after he gave his evidence in chief, some questions were put to him by Baker—they were not taken down—I requested Mr. Arnold to have them taken down, but he said it was quite unusual, and he did not like to depart from the ordinary course—the first question I remember his putting was whether Ricketts had not done something to disfigure the plate—Ricketts' answer to that was taken down—another question I remember was, whether he had not borrowed a chisel to break open Sir Hyde Parker's cellar—the answer to that was taken down—another question, and the only other that I remember, was, whether

Ricketts did not sleep in Sir Hyde Parker's bed while he was staying at the house.

Q. Do you remember any question about aquafortis? A. That was the answer—the question was by Baker, "Did you do nothing to disfigure the plate?" and the answer was, "I got some aquafortis," as he called it—in answer to the question whether he slept in Sir Hyde Parker's bed, he said he did not; he slept in the stable—after Baker had cross-examined him, Crossley put some questions, which were not taken down, but the answers to them were—I think the first question was, "On the Sunday did not you and Baker bring the first lot of plate out of the pantry, and put it on a table, or the dresser, I forget which?"—that was answered, and the answer put' down—he then said, "Did I help to weigh the plate?"—the answer to that was put down—he asked him also the same question that Baker did before, whether he did not go out and get something—he said, "Was not there a dish which you said was not silver, and did not you go out to fetch some aquafortis, or something, to test it?"—there was another question, whether, on Crossley's entering, there was not some wine on the side table, or dresser, I forget which—his words were, "When I came down stairs on the Sundays, was there not a bottle of wine on the dresser?"—he asked a number of questions about a previous visit on the 24th—he made a statement that on the 24th, Ricketts had come to his house in company with Baker, and he asked him whether he remembered it; and he asked him whether he had not been there, and invited him to come to Onslow-square to dinner on the Sunday, and he asked Ricketts if he remembered it—I recollect another question he asked Ricketts, whether on the Monday when he came to his house with Baker, he did not go to a public house, and ask the landlord for a pen and ink and paper, and write down on that paper some words, which they all three signed—he afterwards asked, "Did not I say, after I had signed the paper, I would have nothing further to do with it t"—he asked Ricketts if he did not tear up the paper afterwards, and Ricketts said he did not—he asked Ricketts to state what words he had written down upon the paper—that is all that I remember—he put several other questions—the answers were all taken down.

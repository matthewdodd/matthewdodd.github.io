ELIZABETH BRAZIER
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
31st of December, 3 sovereigns, and I half-sovereign, the monies of 




Thomas Foy, from his person.






THOMAS FOY
. I came to town on Saturday, from Hampshire, and was robbed on Sunday night, the 31st of December—I worked on the railroad—I had three sovereigns and one half—I put the money into a bit of paper in my right-hand pocket—I came out of a public-house in Brook-street at six or seven o'clock—I was sober, and met this girl at the door as I was coming out—"How far do you go?" said she—I said, "Home"—"Will you walk with me, my dear?" said she—I said, "I do not mind that"—we came down a street, and I went down a court—I put my hand on her shoulders, and she put her hand into my pocket, and stooped down and ran

away—I tried to take hold of her, and could not—I cried out, and the constable came to me—I told him—he took her and brought her to me on Tuesday morning—I am sure she is the woman—I lost three sovereigns and a half—I had been working on the railroad, from Stoney Stratford to Hampshire.

Prisoner. I never saw the man till Tuesday morning. Witness. I will swear she is the woman.





JAMES HENRY ANDREWS
 (police constable K 104.) I heard of the robbery, and took the prisoner, from the prosecutor's description, in Twine-court—I had known her before—the money was not found—I took her on the Tuesday—I could have taken her on the Monday, but they were all drunk together.

Prisoner. He took us on the Monday, and then let us go, and on Tuesday he took me again.




GUILTY

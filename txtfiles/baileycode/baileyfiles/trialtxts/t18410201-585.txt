THOMAS FARDELL
. I am an omnibus proprietor, and live in Three Nuns-yard, Aldgate. I was at the Three Nuns coffee-room on the 22nd of January—the prisoner was also there—I had seen him there before—I saw him looking round, and taking particular notice of the coats—he took one coat, and spread his Macintosh over it—he had no opportunity of taking it—he then folded his Macintosh over my coat, which he removed from the peg, and rolled under his Macintosh on the seat—in a few minutes he went out—I went out, and he began running—I called, "Stop thief!"—a man at the gateway stopped him—I then came up, and took him—he had my coat in the Mackintosh under his arm—my gloves and snuff-box were in the pockets of the coat.





JOSEPH FREEMAN
. I am ostler at the Three Nuns. Between five and six o'clock this evening I heard a cry of "Stop thief"—the prisoner was coming down the gateway—I stopped him—he said, "How do you do?"—theprosecutor and another gentleman followed him, and brought him back—I did not perceive any thing but the Macintosh under his arm.





JOHN GEORGE WADE
 (City police-constable, No. 623.) I took the prisoner, and have the coat.

Prisoner's Defence. On the evening in question I had been in the coffee-room. I had been up late the night before. I had three glasses of whiskey-and-water. I flung my Macintosh on a nail, and fell asleep. I took it down, and was not aware that there was more than my own coat. I am a stranger in London.

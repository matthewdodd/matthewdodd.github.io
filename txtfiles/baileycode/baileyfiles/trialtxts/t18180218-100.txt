. On the 10th of February, the things were taken from my door.
PHILIP AYRES. On the 10th of February, I was at work, a gentleman called out the pails were gone; I ran out - He pointed to the prisoner, and I saw him cross into Peter-street, with them. I asked him what he had got there - He dropped them into my arms, and ran away. I pursued, calling, stop thief - I never lost sight of him.
THOMAS THOMPSON. I heard the cry, and stopped the prisoner, who was running.

            . I live next door to Beal; I saw the prisoner and another man, walking backwards and forwards, they stopped several times to look; I noticed them - I watched them; the prisoner went down the street, and up again in a minute, the other man came down with the pails - I ran out and gave the alarm. I saw them lurking about for half an hour - I am sure they were together.

            . I have an empty house at Harrow


, from whence great quantities of lead have been stolen. I was advis'd by 
               
                  William 
                  Quentery 
               



             to let the prisoner be in the house. I let him in about the beginning of March, but never saw him before now. No body was in the house but him and his wife. He had lived in the parish of Harrow before. About the 23d of May, Quentery told me, a man was taken selling some leaden weights, and they had reason to think they were mine; they belonged to sash windows. The other evidence will give a further account.

            . I live at the Sarazen's head at Watford. On the 24th of January, I had a search warrant of lady Essex, for offenders of this sort. I had been out betwixt one and two o'clock, there are but two plumbers in the town, they had notice of this, to stop all weights, &c. The prisoner came to one King, a plumber, in Washford, who sent him up to my house. I took him in custody.

            , depos'd to the prisoner's offering them to sale; and Quentery, that they were Mr. Brown's property.

            . I am a butcher
, and live in Oxford-market



. On the 6th of January, as I was in a little room behind my shop, I heard something thump upon the board; I went out and missed a mouse buttock of beef; I went to the door and saw the prisoner a few yards off with the beef. I pursued him; he dropped it in the street. I had seen it about ten minutes before. I left the beef and followed the prisoner till I took him.
Prisoner's Defence.
I had been out of work a great while; my wife had been lame a long time; I found the piece of beef upon the ground and I picked it up.




               Guilty 10 d.
            

He was a second time indicted for 


               stealing a wigeon, value 1 s. 6 d. and a teal, value 1 s.
             the property of 
               
                  
                     William
                      Smith

            . I am apoulterer
 in Oxford-market



. I lost a wigeon and a teal on the 6th of January. Mr. Butcher had taken up the prisoner for his buttock of beef; my wigeon and teal were found upon him when he was searched; the teal had the head partly tore off as it was in my shop. I had but one wigeon in my shop, a hen wigeon. I sent home and it was gone.
Prisoner's Defence.
I met a man who said he had bought them, and they both stunk, and said as I was a poor man I should be welcome to them, if I would accept of them.




               Guilty 10 d.

             sworn.
The prisoner has been servant
 to me these three years: he came and told me he wished to leave me, he did not care to stay in my works and longer: I told him he must not go yet; one of my clerks informed me he had secreted a slab of copper, and I detected him. I asked him where he intended to sell it, he said in Long-lane.

Prisoner. Mr. Cox promised me that I should have favour.
Prosecutor. I said, if you will disclose your confederates, you may receive more favour with the Court me! says he; that was all he said.

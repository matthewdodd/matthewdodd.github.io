                  ASHWORTH
               



            . I kept a house in Berner-street, in the parish of Mary-le-bone



. Fricker was a servant
 of mine; I had another female servant; her name is 
               
                  Hannah 
                  Holloway
               



            ; she was the cook; I had no other servant; the 28th of July, was a Sunday. I went to bed before eleven o'clock on the night of that day. Before I went to bed, I had an opportunity of being positively certain that the windows of the parlour and the street door were fastened; but I am not positive as to any other parts of the house. I got up the next morning before six; I first went to my dressing room, and thence to the drawing room; I remained in the drawing room about ten minutes and thence went into the dressing room again. Then the cook Holloway came to me, at about ten minutes before seven. In consequence of something that passed between us, I went down to the kitchen; I found one of the kitchen windows open; we found some papers strewed about the kitchen; my writing-desk that had been in the parlour the day before, was on the ground, and broken open; the papers out of the desk were scattered about. I saw that the street door was open; the bolt was drawn, so as to prevent the door from shutting to. I saw a wine bottle behind the door, and an empty tumbler; there was a little wine in the bottle; but nothing else that I discovered. There was another bottle behind the parlour door, with a candle in it; that candle had certainly been burnt; I could ascertain that it was one that had been in one of my candlesticks; it was not a common kitchen candle, but had been in one of the candlesticks that were stolen. I discovered the sidebord locks broken, and the papers and things that were in the sid board were scattered about. I kept some plate in that sideboard; I had kept it locked when I went to bed. There was a silver bread basket there; the greater part of the plate in the indictment was there. The value altogether was about four hundred pounds; it cost a great deal more. It was on the Saturday before that the prisoner Fricker applied to me to clean the plate; she came to me for a silver waiter; it was a very large one. She asked for that particularly; it had never been cleaned by her before; it was in my bed-room. She had been in my service nearly three months. I had never asked her to clean it, not intimated to her that I wished it to be cleaned. She asked me for it three times, and at lenght I was induced to give it to her. I don't recollect that I expected company, or that there was any reason for her getting it. She also asked for two gilt silver spoons which belonged in the egg stand, and that would make the egg stand comple. They were kept in the drawer with the other plate in the parlour. The waiter might be worth twenty pounds, I believe it cost thirty. When I went up stairs to bed on the Sunday night, the prisoner Fricker came into my room; I used a gilt silver candlestick to go to bed with. She came and took that candlestick up; I asked her what she wanted that candlestick for, and she put it down again, and went out of the room, She brought me a letter, and a few minutes after, she wanted to go out, and I told her I could not spare her, and she said she must go out, and she would, for it was of consequence, she did go out. Her clothes were in the kitchen at that time packed up; it was afterwards discovered to be so. I have a neighbour named King. In consequence of something which he said to me, I looked for my green pelisse, and it was not in the place where it was left.
HANNAH HOLLOWAY. I am cook to the prosecutrix in July last; 
               
                  Elizabeth 
                  Fricker
               



             was a servant to her. Fricker was not at home all Sunday. the 28th of July; she went out at half past seven in the evening; she said she wanted to go, but I did not observe the moment that she went; until she returned about ten; when she came back, I was in the parlour. In about five minutes my mistress called her up into the parlour; my mistress gave her a pelisse; she was to have taken it up stairs to my mistress's bed room. She returned into the kitchen. I asked her to go to bed; she looked at the clock, and said, it was very soon. I left her; I did not go into my room; I went into the parlour. At this time, Mrs. Ashworth had just gone up. There was no work left behind to be done. I heard a noise like raking out cinders; but I had raked out the fire before. I went down, and asked her what she was doing it for, she said she had no particular reason for doing it. I asked her to come to bed, but she did not; she sat down. I said she had better not, sit down, but come to bed; which she did not do. I went up stairs, and left her below. I went into my mistress's bed room. I was attending my mistress there when the prisoner came up; she had a candle in a flat candlestick; but went down for a save-all; she spoke to my mistress and me as she was going down; she said, she had forgotten it. My mistress and I went down stairs into the parlour. Pricker went down stairs for it, and returned with it is a moment; she said, she had got it; when she returned, I was in the passage, on the ground floor, with my mistress. At the time I am now speaking of, the street door was fast. I had fastened it.
Q. Had you before this seen that the windows and doors were fast - A. One window I am positive of, the one that was close against the kitchen door; but I am not certain of the window that was found open. The door behind opens into a little yard at the back of the house; that was never fastened; but I am sure it was shut; there are railings at the back of it. Nobody could get in at that back door, without tearing up the railings, and the railings were quite safe. I am positive that the windows were shut; but I am not positive that they were fastened. I did not leave any candle in the kitchen table when I went up stairs. The candles that Mrs. Ashworth used in her sitting room, were snuffed out, and left on the parlour table; I am quite sure they were both mould candles, and they were in silver candlesticks. After I had met Fricker on the stair-case, my mistress went up stairs; I followed her, and Fricker followed last, all going up to bed. Fricker slept in the same room with me, but not the same bed. When I got into the bed room, Fricker went into my mistress's hed room; she joined me in a minute or two; she was not with me long before she left me saying she had left her book below; I told her she had not, for that she had left it in her mistress's dressing room; she said she was positive she had, left it on the kitchen table. I had not seen the book in my mistress's dressing room, but I had seen it in Fricker's hand as she was coming up stairs and went into my mistress's dressing room, therefore I told her so. She did not remain below above four or five minutes, not longer than was necessary in fetch the book as I thought at the moment; when she returned with the book, she looked the door, and came in and undressed herself, and got into bed, and read a little of the book, and then asked me to put the candle out; I did so. She had never before taken up a book to read. I did not wake, myself, in the morning, but she waked me; that was unusual; I got up, and looked at the clock, I discovered it was a little after six; she said to me when she called me that it was time to get up. I told her I was rather surprised at her calling me, for it was not usual for her to get up until nine o'clock; I don't remember that she made any answer. she got up at the same time; but I went down first. My usual hour of getting up was seven. She got up once, when I first came to live there early to work; but on this morning. I know of no work she had to do. When I went down stairs, there was light enough to see without a candle, it was very light; I perceived a little light through the street door. I saw a empty bottle and runner in the passage. I did not look at the street door to see whether it was a-jar or not. I went straight into the kitchen; I saw the cupboard door open; that had been locked when I went to bed, I am positive. I saw my mistress's writing desk and tea caddy in the kitchen, and I saw at the papers were scattered about on the ground. I perceived that the kitchen front door was a little on the jar, unfastened and open; it could not be opened by any other way than from within by the appearance. One window was fast as I had left it, and the other window shutter was open; but the window itself was down; at that window there were usually flower pots standing; they appeared to be in the same stare that I left them in the day before, apparently nobody had distubred them. Any one to get in at the window from the out side, must have moved the flower pots, for the window is very high. I did not stay for any time in the kitchen, but returned to my mistress's bed room; at that time I did not know what to think. Fricker I had left in the bed-room; but going up, I met her coming down, looking very pale, my mistress went down before me, for I was very much alarmed. Afterwards I came down stairs. My mistress called me into the parlour, and shewed me how the things were broken. I found the sideboard broken open, and the house robbed, as my mistress has told you. I never knew of a candle being used in the neck of a bottle in my mistress's house. The prisoner Fricker went out on the Tuesday following; I had been out myself to the butcher's at about ten minutes before four; the butcher lived a little way down Oxford-street; my mistress's house is above Castle-street, near the Middlesex Hospital; therefore I would pass the corner of Castle-street in going to Oxford-street. When I returned, there was a tall man standing at the door, speaking to 
               
                  Elizabeth 
                  Fricker
               



            . I should know that man again; 
               
                  William 
                  Kelley
               



             is the man, the tall man; I am positive he isthe man. I did not hear any of their conversation. Upon my coming, they went out together. I did not know the man before. When Fricker went away, she did not say any thing to me, nor did I to her. She was gone near open an hour; when she returned. I asked her where she had been, as she knew that I wanted to get my mistress's dinner, and that my mistress wanted to go out. She said she had been out to vent her mind to that person who had called upon her. That was all she said. There had not been any quarrell between her and her mistress, or me, to give her occasion to vent her mind on any subject. I had no reason to expect that she was going to leave Mrs. Ashworth.


                  SAMUEL 
                  PLANK
               



            . I am an officer. On the 29th of July, I went to the house of the prosecutrix, in Berner's-street. I immediately inspected the house, to see in what manner it had been entered. I found the street - door had no key-hole on the outside; therefore the lock could not have been picked. There was no appearance of violence on the outside, nor in any other part. I observed the window next to the fire place, and observed one leaf of the shutter was a little open. My attention was called to that by the prisoner Fricker. On my going down she told me that that was the way they got in. I went with her to the outside of that window in the area; there were six flower pots standing on the window sill; they were all of different sizes, and they had all plants in them, reaching a good way up the window. Those plants reached above the window, nearly as far as the front part, and some days previous to this, there had been rain, and a crust was formed round the bottom of each pot, that enabled me to observe whether they had been removed. I am positive they had not been removed lately, and no person could have got in there; it would have taken a great deal of care to have replaced them exactly in the same situation, if they had been removed. I did this in the presence of Fricker, and acquainted her with my observation. She strongly insisted that they had got in at that window; she did not say any thing else at that time. I examined the front area over, and other parts, to examine where they had been forced; there are no steps in the area; if there he a step, it can not exceed a couple or three inches in height, as it is only the sill of the door. I found no force had been used at the area door. That door was lined with iron. and the shutters was lined with iron; there was no appearance of force at all; they could not have got in at the back area door, for there were iron rails over it. The hall door had been shut before I came. Afterwards I found a bottle and candle, and and so forth. I afterwards searched her box; she was present. At that time I did not look for plate. Subsequently I found a piece of flannel which I have here. After I had taken her into custody, I had some conversation with her. At the first time I stated my suspicion; but left her in the house. I took her into custody before I found the flannel on the Tuesday. After I had taken her into custody on the Tuesday afternoon. I asked her who the man was that she had been speaking to cued the corner. half or three quarters of an hour before. She searched very reluctant to tell me; I proceed her to tell me and said, surely she could have no objection to tell me who he was. She then said, "he was a tally man." She explained that to be a hawking linen draper, who takes part payment for goods at a time. She said, "she had owed him eight shillings up wards of twelve months, and he had found her out at her place by accident, and she went out to pay him." She said "his name was Finch, and she became acquainted with him when she was at Miss Clarkson's. at Kentish Town, a lady who kept a boarding school."She said,"she had not seen him for upwards of twelve months." There was nothing farther passed that I recollect. She said, "she was a widow, and that she had been so for seven or eight years." The name of Kelley was not spoken of at all. When Kelley was before the magistrate, and the box was opened there, he claimed some leather which was in it.

            . I live near the house of the proseutrix; I knew the tall Kelley; he lodged at my house at the time the offence was committed. He had not at that time given up his lodging. He first came to me on the 25th of July, four days previous. He did not sleep at home on Sunday the 28th; he lodged in the second floor, the top room. I have another lodger in the home. He and the prisoner slept in the same apartment. I did not see she prisoner at my house with Kelley on the Saturday. I never saw her to my knowledge until she was taken up.

            . I lodged at Mr. Hill's, No. 3, Newman Mews in July last. I look at the prisoner, 
               
                  William 
                  Kelley
               



            , and know him. He came to lodge three on the 25th of July, he slept there; he did not sleep there on the night of the 28th; I know that, because I was at home late, and I saw the door fastened, and he did not come in after that. I did not see him the next morning. I saw him some days afterwards; but had not any conversation with him. I heard he had been to a fair. I asked him, and he said he had been in the country; but he did not say any thing more that I recollect. He always slept at home before that Sunday, as long as he lodged there. I did not see him between the day that I talked with him, and the day I saw him before the justice. I look at the female prisoner; I saw her on the Saturday, I have no doubt whatever. I saw her come to the door of the place when Kelley lodged, and she asked for Mr. Kelley. He was not at home. She came again about the middle of the day, but I did not see her.

            . I keep the Crown public-house, - street Bloomsbury. Early in the morning of the 29th of July, I recollect two men coming to my house at a little before seven o'clock a they had a bundle with them. They rushed into a box opposite to the bar; one was a tall man; and the other was a short man; I believe 
               
                  William 
                  Kelley
               



             to be the tall man. To the best of my knowledge he is the man; he seemed to be in ill health. The short man I don't remember; I had not the same opportunity of observing him. They came together in a coach, and wept away in that coach. The coachman came in, and they gave him a glass of gin, and then theyloaded the luggage in the coach again. It was a bundle of some size, but I don't know what it was wrapt in. It was cloth, but I don't know the colour.

            . I live at No. 4, Brill Place, Sommer's Town; that may be about twenty yards from the Brill public-house. The old man, 
               
                  Peter 
                  Kelley
               



             lodged at my house; he came about May last, continued to lodge there until the 7th of September. when he was taken up. On the morning of the 29th of July, I was at breakfast, when three men came into the house. I did not speak; but my wife did. She asked who they were; I believe old Kelley was one of the three; the other Kelley was another; when my wife asked who they were, one of the two strangers said they belonged to Mr. Kelley. The short man came first, then William Kelley, and then Peter. It was between nine and ten o'clock. The short man had a bundle wrapt up careleesly in a green baize, a cloth with a yellow border. They all went up into the front room, on the first floor; the room in which old Kelley lodged. In a short time 
               
                  Peter 
                  Kelley
               



             came down, and said,"one of them is my son, the tall one in boots." He told me that his son had just come from the country, and he had a parcel sent by the Litchfield stage; end he said, "he was going to fetch a sheet of writing paper to write a letter into the country.


                  SARAH 
                  COOKE
               



            . I remember the morning my husband speaks of these men coming to his house. 
               
                  Peter 
                  Kelly
               



             was one. I now look at the bar; 
               
                  William 
                  Kelley
               



             is the second, and the other man, Hitchen, is the man who carried the bundle. 
               
                  Young 
                  Kelley
               



             had a horsewhip in his hand, and a green silk umbralla; she was dressed in jockey boots. As they they came in I started up from the table, and asked them whom they wanted, and they said, "they belonged to Mr. Kelley; Old Kelley followed last. In about two minutes old Kelley and Hitchen came down. Old Kelley told me that one was his son, and had just come out of the country. Young Kelley remained up stairs for about a quarter of an hour, and then went out in shoes. Young Kelley called again on Tuesday, at about half past six o'clock with Hitchen. He went away and came again, and asked if the old man was returned. They came again and supped with old Kelley and a friend. Young Kelley stopped and slept with his father. Hitchen went away about half past ten. Old Kelley went to see his friend home, and then returned. It was the lady who was to be his wife; a person of the name of Hansell. On Wednesday morning William Kelley got up at about ten o'clock, and washed himself and went away. He came again on the Thursday, at about half past six o'clock, as near as I can tell, and asked if the old gentleman was at home; I told him no, and he asked me to send for him, and I did so. Soon after he came down and asked me for a light, and I gave him one, and it appeared to me that he had been using sealing wax, and he had a cord to cord a box, and I went up and saw that box; It was a red box; I had painted it red for old Kelley in the latter end of May, I asked the younger Keley if his father was going to lend him that box, and he said, "yes," and said, "he must have it back again next week." I said, yes, when it was all knocked to pieces, he would have it back again.
(Box produced.)
That is the box, I saw them put it into a hackney coach.

            . I live at No. 16, Johnson street, Sommers Town; that is a good bit from Brill place. I know old Mr. Kelley. I have known him almost these seven years. I remember his coming to our house; but I don't know whether it was in the month of August, or not; it was in the summer, some weeks before he was taken up. He called just at dusk, he called to ask whether he might leave a box there; and I said yes. He put the box into the shop; my husband is a carpenter. Old Kelley called in two or three days afterwards, and he said he moved the box because he was moving to Mrs. Stansell's by degrees. He was there several times afterwards, but did not say any more about the box. It might remain a week or a fortnight. I don't remember his coming with a basket. He fetched the box away on an evening, but I don't know how he took it away.

                  UNDERWOOD
               



            . I am the husband of last witness. I know old Kelley. I have done work for him now and then. I understood he came to leave a box while I was not at home; he came afterwards, and told me he had left a box, and hoped it would not be in my way. We moved it out of the back parlour where we were working, up into the two pair of stairs front room; he was going to move it by himself, and I said Mr. Kelly, I will lend you a hand; it was a box similar to the one new produced. He and I moved it up together; it might be half or three quarters of a hundred weight. I remember his coming there with a basket in his hand, and said he wanted some tools out of the box; by which I understood that there were tools in the box.

            . In the month of August last, I saw old Kelley in the street with a large box similar to the one produced, within three or four doors of Underwood's house. I was at work at Mr. Underwood's one evening when he came in and asked me if Mr. Underwood was within. At another time I saw him come down stairs with a rush basket, and I understood he had been up to get tools out of the box; it was when he came down that he had the basket.

             came to my house on the 29th of August; he came with a wheelbarrow, with his trunk in it. He stopped at the door, and, "how do you do, Mrs. Compton; will you be so good as to let me leave this trunk at your house." I said, I have not room for it, unless you put it into the potatoe binn. He said, "that would do. It belongs to a young man who has left his situation, and it has got his clothes in it. He said it might be a day or two first, but when he got a situation he would move it again. That trunk remained there nine days, I think until the 12th of September; on that day a woman came who made an application for the trunk. In consequence of suspicion, I went to Malborough street office, and themagistrates sent an officer to my house, he took the trunk to the office, and I saw it broken open at the office; it was then in the same state as it was when it was first left. I did not put any thing into it. When it was opened, there was a good deal of plate and other things in it. I did not see any clothes in it.

            . I am an officer of Marlborough-street. In consequence of the last witness having made an application at our office, I went and got a trunk; this is it, and I have had it in my custody ever since. We broke it open at our office, and on opening it, we found four silver desert spoons, ten table spoons, four tea-spoons, one butter-knife, one marrow spoon, one pair of steel snuffers, a silver salt seller, a cut glass mustard pot, three damask tablecloths, six yards of new towelling, a metal brass mounted travelling ink-stand, a piece of green baize, a table cover with a yellow border; these are all worth considerably more than twenty pounds.

            . The younger Kelley lodged with me; I let him one room; he came on the 29th of January, and remained until the 24th of July. The woman at the bar, Fricker, came to lodge with him as his wife; they lived there together as man and wife, for about a couple of months; then she got a place in Berner's-street. While she was in place there, she came twice to see him. I heard of the robbery in Berner's-street about a week after West-end Fair. I remember the prisoner Fricker was taken up and was in prison. I remember the prisoner Kelley coming for me; he called on me once, and as I was at home, I received him. The second time I was out. The third time a lad called for me, and when I saw him on these several occasions, he made inquiries how I did, and whether any one had been for him. I remember asking him why he did not come to my house; he said he had reasons for it; he sent for me, and I went to him several times; once Mr. Hitchen came for me. I went to the place where Kelley was five or six times when be sent messages to me. On one of these occasions, he desired me to go to Marlborough-street; he said he expected Fricker to be brought up to the office, and I was to observe whether she came for examination from the House of Correction. During the latter part of the time that he lodged with me with Fricker, they appeared very miserably poor, with scarcely any thing to cover their nakedness. When I saw him in August and September, before he was taken up, he appeared comfortable, with a newish kind of a hat, a goodish coat and breeches, with new stockings, and he had a watch. I remember seeing him ahd Hitchin together when he desired me to go for an attorney for him in Hatton Garden; I refused.

            . I live in Berner's-street, exactly opposite to Mrs. Ashworth's house. I remember the circumstance of her house being robbed. On the Tuesday, I was in my shop, and saw a person standing at the corner of Castle-street and Berner-street, apparently looking up to the second floor of Mrs. Ashworth's house in Berner-street; I should suppose it was then about four o'clock in the afternoon. He watched her house I should suppose for the space of one or two minutes. I saw Mrs. Athworth's servant maid almost immediately come out of the house, and come to the corner to him; it was the prisoner Fricker. It appeared when they met together, by the motion of her right hand to his left, that something passed from one to the other; I did not see the colour of that something; they went a little way down Castle-street, and immediately returned, crossed over the way towards No. 10, and went down Bernersstreet. Knowing the robbery had been committed, I beckoned to Mrs. Ashworth, who was immediately opposite with the window open, and pointed to the prisoners. In consequence of what I observed, I desired my son to watch the man; I believe I did as far as Oxford-street; I observed him; he was a tall man with long dark whiskers, a dark black beard, apparently of two days standing. I thought I had seen that man before, frequently taking up a position, and always such that his eyes was ben on Mrs. Ashwoith's house. I have seen him in that position from perhaps an how to an hour and a half, or two hours. I look at the hat; the younger Kelley resembles that man, but I could not swear to him.

            . I am the son of the last witness. On the 30th of July, my father called my attention to a man in the street; but not until I had seen that man there before; I had seen that man there before; I had seen him about half past one or two o'clock that day standing there. I first saw him about ten, and his eyes were fixed on Mrs. Ashworth's house. About ten minutes before my father called my attention to him. I saw him Fricker came out, and gave him something like green silk, which she had concealed under her apron, and when Kelley took it, he put it under his coat; I saw them go down to the corner of Newman-mews, in conversation, and in a few minutes they parted. Young Kelley I speak positively to.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
Fricker's Defence. I am thoroughly innocent of the charge laid against me.

            's Defence. My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, I feel much concerned to see that so much of the valuable time of the Court has been taken up on this occasion; but if the Court had allowed me before my trial, I could have saved your Lordship all that trouble; but I could not suffer any one to be hurt, if I could say or do any thing of importance. I have therefore submited myself to take my trial, to do the other prisoners that justice which they have a right to require at my hands. I shall therefore coniess to your Lorship that I am the only guilty person; and whatever the other prisoners have done, they have been induced so to do from my mis-representation of the case. Consider what must my feelings be in bringing the grey hairs of my aged father, who spared no parts or expence to render me a respectable member of society, to this ignominious and disgraceful situation. With respect to Hitchin, the consequence of his conviction would be still more unfortunate than to me; for an aged father and an invalided sister who look up to him for support,would he deprived of that support. With respect to

                  Fricker
               



            , I can't conceive that any proof has been adduced to affect her. I am undoubtedly bound to confess the innocence of them all; and if it would be any satisfaction to the Court, I would confess the manner in which the robbery was committed. With respect to my own innocence, I would not have broken and entered the house; but I am an accessary certainly, and have led all the other prisoners to what they have done; and all of them are innocent, so help me God. If I was going to die this moment, certainly I am guilty.

            's Defence. I am innocent; I know nothing of the contents of the trunk.

                  Kelley
               



            , in continuance. -My Lord, would it have any effect if I were to state the manner in which the robbery was committed?
COURT. You can state what you please with respect to yourself; but I must tell you that whatever you state with respect to the other prisoners can have no other effect.


                  William 
                  Kelley
               



            , in continuance. I have only to say my Lord, that the house was entered by a boy; without the knowledge of any of the prisoners. Certainly I know myself to be guilty, and I should be a vile rogue indeed worse than what I am if I were not to say that the other prisoners are innocent.

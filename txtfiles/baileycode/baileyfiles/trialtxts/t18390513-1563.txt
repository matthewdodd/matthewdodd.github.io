 was indicted

(The prisoner being a foreigner had the evidence communicated by an interpreter.)





GEORGE KIMPTON
. I am warehouseman to Mr. Read. On the 15th of April I was in Ludgate-street—I saw the prisoner standing near the prosecutor's door, and before I could get to him he pulled down two lengths of cloth—he found they were too large to roll round his arm—he threw one down, and ran up Stationers'-court with the other—I went and took him—this is the property—(looking at it)—this is the piece he threw down—this is the one he had when I took him—I suppose they had been pinned together.

Prisoner. I only took one, the other fell down.





ROBERT BROWN
. I am apprentice to George Priestley Heap. The prisoner was brought to my master's shop, with these pieces of cloth—they are my master's—here are four yards and a half in all—they had been hanging in the shop.

Prisoner's Defence. I had nothing to live on.




GUILTY
. Aged 26.—


Transported for Seven Years.

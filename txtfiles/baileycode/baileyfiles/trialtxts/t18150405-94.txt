            . Having been robbed every day, for eight days, I set myself upon the watch, to detect the offender; on the 28th of March, the prisoner came into my shop; I asked him what he wanted, he appeared confused, he asked me for a knife; I shewed him some knives, and while I was getting him other knives, I heard the sound of paper drawing along the counter; he saw I detected him, he left the shop, and went about his business.
Q. What was in this paper - A. It was a paper of goods, that I had done up for a customer, he went away: I watched him about sixty yards distance from the shop; I returned into the shop again and concealed myself behind a cabin stove. In the space of two minutes the prisoner came into the shop again, he took a lock from off the counter; I pursued him, and took him, about an hundred yards from the shop; I took the lock from underneath his jacket; this is the lock, it his my lock.

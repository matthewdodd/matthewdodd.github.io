                  George 
                  Smith
               



            , who is a labourer
, and lives at Hackney


. I was crossing the road, and saw the prisoner with two coats under his arm. I ran in, and missed my father's coats from behind the door; I pursued him, calling Stop thief! and a gentleman stopped him. I am certain he is the man.

            . The prisoner ran by me with the coats under his arm; the last witness called Stop thief! he jumped into the hedge of a garden, left the coats there, and returned without them. The constable stopped him. I never lost sight of him.

            . I am a constable. I stopped the prisoner, who was running in Grove-street. He said there was nothing amiss, it was only a joke; I took him back and found the coats in the hedge.

            ; was indicted, for 


               that she, as an accessary after the fact, afterwards, to wit, on the 23d of Feb

                  Calvert 
               



            . I live at Knightsbridge



 with Mrs. Trevill; I placed the goods in the room, which was a dressing room, and the window looked into the road. On the 22d of Feb. at night, the maid went up into the room and found the sash open; she came down and asked me if I had opened it, I said, no; she then said, we have been robbed: I went up and missed all the things, and the window was open; some time after a constable and the evidence Maddox came to our house, to let us know that he was one of the persons that robbed us, or we should never have known it; I spoke to them myself; they asked me if we had not been robbed, I said, yes; then they repeated some of the things over, and told us the prisoners were all taken but two, and those two were taken afterwards; when they were carried before justice Fielding, Maddox said, they were all concerned in the robbery.
Q. Did you ever find your goods again?


                  Catharine 
                  Calvert 
               



            . No, we never found any thing, but this little bed-gown, (which she produced) which is not worth a groat: this was taken from off the back of 
               
                  Mary 
                  Riley

                  Beardcell 
               



            . I am servant to Mrs. Trevill; I went into the room between eight and nine, and found the window open, and missed the things out of the room; I was before the justice when they were all examined; there 
               
                  Ann 
                  Fling 
               



            , and the evidence Maddox confessed, that the four men prisoners at the bar were with them, and that they got into the house and took the things, and that the woman prisoner received them, which they all denied : the bed gown was delivered to me by one of the constables.
Q. Are you sure that bed gown belonged to your mistress ?


                  Elizabeth 
                  Beardeell 
               



            . I am very sure it did.

            . On the 22d of last February, 
               
                  Walter 
                  Knight

                  Riley 
               



             and I, went all to Chelsea to take a walk, I am a shoemaker, Kelley was a runner at the Gatehouse. and the others I know to be common thieves, for I have been with them many a time.
Q. Do you work at your trade?

Maddox. Sometimes I do, but when I have been in liquor they have deluded me to go a thieving.
Q. When you went out, had you formed any scheme of going a robbing?
Maddox. No, we went only for a walk; we went to a publick-house, facing the bunn-house, and drank five or six pots of beer and two half pints of gin; we then went away, and agreed to stop the first man we met; we walked all round Brumpton, but met no body that we thought proper to stop; but Knight seeing a window open in Brumpton said, there was a house that would do for us, and if I would give him a leg-up, he would get in; he got in, and threw out a bible, a pair of spectacles, and other things, and was just going to throw out the bed, had not the maid come up. We then came to Knightsbridge, and from thence were coming to St. Giles's, where we lodged; and as we came by Mrs. Trevill's house, Knight stopped and said to me, James, give me a leg-up, and I will get into the window; I took hold of one of his legs, and Barrat of the other, and we lifted him up into the window; he, being in liquor, fell down into the room; after he was in the flung out about six yards of cloth, fit for sheeting, a patelair and petticoat, a pair of stays and three bed-gowns, one was a cotton, the other two linnen.
Q. Look upon the bed-gown; is that one of them? (he looks at it, and says) yes, my lord, I am sure it is. He afterwards flung out two or three old table-cloths, three or four old towels, and an apron
Q. Were all the four men prisoners with you at that time?
Maddox. Yes, they were; and when they were sold, they all took share of the money.
Q. Are you sure they all assisted in this robbery?
Maddox. They did, my lord.
Q. What became of the goods after they were delivered to you?
Maddox. I tied them up in a table-cloth, and bade Barrat come along with me; I walked with the bundle upon my back as far as Hide-Park turnpike-gate, this was between eight and nine.
Q. Was it dark at that time?
Maddox. It was. I then said to Barrat, do you carry them; he did, and carried them to Monmouth-street; then I took them again, and carried them to St. Giles's; as soon as we came home we looked over the things, which we commonly do, for fear we should cheat one another. The next morning we went to see if we could sell them, we went with them to Bloomsbury-square, they would not buy them. Then the prisoner 
               
                  Mary 
                  Riley 
               



             said, she would sell them for us; she took the aprons, the towels, and bed-gowns, and brought us four shillings for them, and said, she would sell as many things as we brought; I then gave the prisoner 
               
                  Mary 
                  Riley 
               



            , the patelair and petticoat, and she and the witness Fling went and sold them, and brought us four shillings, she gave the money to Knight; I delivered the stays to 
               
                  Mary 
                  Riley 
               



            , she went out with them; when she came back she said, she had been into Monmouth-street, and could get but eight shillings for them, and so brought them back again. The next morning we sold them for ten shillings to a Jew; 
               
                  Mary 
                  Riley 
               



             sold the cloth for four shillings and nine-pence, and brought us the money.
Q. Did the prisoner 
               
                  Mary 
                  Riley 
               



             know that they were stolen?
Maddox. We told her when we came home, that we had taken them out of a house at Knights-bridge. I went with the constables to Mrs. Trevill's house, but would not speak to any body 'till I came before justice Fielding; there I said the same as I do now.
Q. Was the sash pinned down?
Maddox. I cannot tell whether it was or not, but it made a noise when it was flung up, and it went up with a great deal of difficulty.
Q. Was there any glass broke?
Maddox. I do not know that, but he broke some of the bricks down, and I do not know whether they were broke in getting in or coming out.
Q. to Beardcell. Do not you take care to pin your windows every night?
Beardcell. We have pins to pin them down with, but I cannot tell whether they were pinned that night. I believe it was only shut down.

            . On the 22d of Feb. I went with 
               
                  Mary 
                  Riley 
               



             the prisoner into Monmouth street, she went into a house there, but did not stay long; when she came out she said what she was about, and that the people would not buy them. She went home again, and then came down stairs with a patelair on her arm, and went into Monmouth-street; she went into two or three shops, but could not sell it; she then sold it to an old cloaths woman for four shillings.
Q. Do you know whether that was the patelair that was taken out of the house at Knightsbridge ?

THE PROCEEDINGS ON THE
Kings Commissions of the Peace, Oyer and Terminer, and Gaol Delivery held for the City of London, &c.



                  Ann 
                  Fling 
               



            . ALL that I know it by is, that she brought the money to 
               
                  Walter 
                  Knight 
               



            . She had a pair of stays, which she went to one Sarah Cross with, but she would not buy them. The constable, Mr. Flannerkin, took this bed-gown [ looking at it.] from off 
               
                  Mary 
                  Riley 
               



            's back. I was present at that time, and am sure this was the gown. I saw the pieces of new cloth, but she sent a girl with that, so I don't know what it was sold for. As for the stays she did not sell them.


                  Thomas 
                  Ind 
               



            . I was at the taking of Kelly, and another who is not a prisoner here now. When he was brought to the Barley-mow, near Justice Fielding's, I told him if he knew any thing of the matter he should speak, and make himself an evidence; he said it was to no purpose then, they all wanted to be admitted evidences.
Knight's Defence.
Dust is a plaisterer's labourer. He came up to my room, and told me he could help me to work on the Monday, so for his civilities. I desired him and 
               
                  Matthew 
                  Kelly 
               



             to go down and drink share of a pot of beer with me and Joseph Riley, my brother-in-law. While we were there came in Maddox, and 
               
                  Nancy 
                  Fling 
               



             with him; they brought these things. I bought this gown, and gave 6 s. for it.
Q. Who did you buy it of?
Knight. I bought it of 
               
                  James 
                  Maddox 
               



            , the evidence, and all the prisoners were there at the time; it was at the Two-brewers in Maynard-street.
Dust's Defence.
I was acquainted with Knight, and told him I could help him to work. He said he would give me a pot of beer if I would go down to drink. I went down and drank with him.
Kelly's Defence.
Dust and I came up to 
               
                  Walter 
                  Knight 
               



            's room. Dust told him he could help him into work, and Knight said he would give him a pot of beer; while we were drinking Maddox and Fling came in. They shewed the things about and wanted to dispose of some of them, I don't know whether the landlady bought any or no, she is gone out of the way. Knight's wife happened to see this bedgown, and Knight asked him what he would have for it? He said he would give him 6 s. for it, ( if he came by it honestly) which was enough.


                  Joseph 
                  Riley 
               



            's Defence.
I lived with my brother and sister in Maynard-street, and know nothing of this affair.



                  Mary 
                  Riley 
               



            's Defence.
They called me down to drink part of the beer. My husband asked me if I would have that bedgown. I said it was old; he answered it could not be dear at 6 s. and he gave no more for it.
Dust called four persons to his character, who had known him six or seven years, and gave him the character of an honest man.
The others called no witnesses.
All five 

               Guilty

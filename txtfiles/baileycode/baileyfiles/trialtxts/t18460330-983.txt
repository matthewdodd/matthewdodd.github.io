JOHN LEWIS
 was indicted

for stealing 3 pairs of bracks, value 1s.; the goods of 



Mendlewitz Myers; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






MENDLEWITZ MYERS
. I live in London-road, and am a general dealer. On the 4th of March I had a number of pairs of braces hanging outside my shop—about two o'clock I was told something—I looked, and missed a few pairs of braces—I could not say how many—they have not been found, but I know I lost them.





JOHN EASTEBBROOK
. I am shopman to the prosecutor—on the 4th of March I was standing outside the shop—I saw the prisoner run by and take several pairs of braces off the gas pipe—I could not go after him at the time because there was nobody outside but myself—in about five minutes he came back and looked into the shop—I told the young man, who ran and took him—I am sure he is the lad who took the braces.





WILLIAM MORTON
 (police-constable P 289.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction at this court by the name of William Cummins—(read—Convicted 12th May, 1845, and confined three months)—he is the person—I bad him before for threatening to stab his mother, and then for stealing a quantity of books—he has five or six little boys under him and they go out every evening—he has a good home to go to, but he sets them all at defiance.




GUILTY
. Aged 14.—


Transported for Seven Years.

            . On the 5th of September last. I was working at Mr. Hanbury's, in Coverly's Fields, Mile-end New Town


. We left work at six o'clock on the evening of the day in the indictment, and the next morning the chest was broken open, and the property in question taken from it. We found some of the tiles removed from the roof; and by that means the thieves had got in.

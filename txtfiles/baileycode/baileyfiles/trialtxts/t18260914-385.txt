DAVID BRINN. I am a stone-sawyer
, and live in Fitzroy-place. On the 5th of September, about half-past eleven o'clock at night, I was returning from Covent Garden, where I had been to see my uncle; I met the prisoner by the Seven Dials - I was a little in liquor, and asked him to shew me the way to Tottenham-court-road


, and I would give him 6d. to drink with; we went into a house and had something - when we came out, he asked if I knew the way; I said Yes; but asked him to go further - when we got beyond Tottenham-court chapel, we went into a house, and had a quartern of rum - when I came out I wished him good night - I felt his hand in my pocket - I put my hand to it; he pulled his hand out, and slapped my face, and said, "You are no use, and I am off;" I swear his hand was in my pocket - I missed a half-crown, a shilling, and five sixpences - I ran after him, calling Watch! I lost sight of him once in turning the corner; but I heard the watchman say "We have got him;" I went up and found him in charge - the money I lost was found on him.

            . About half-past eleven o'clock I heard Watch! called - I saw the prisoner running; I stopped him, and took him to the watch-house - I saw a half-crown, a shilling, and five sixpences found on him.

            . I found this money on the prisoner.



               GUILTY
            . Aged 16.

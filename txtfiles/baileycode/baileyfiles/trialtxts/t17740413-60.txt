; on the 19th of February I went out about nine in the morning; I came home again about seven in the evening; when I got up stairs I found the door unlocked; I went into the room and found one of my boxes open; there was another box at the door; there were several things in that box; upon searching it I found every thing gone, and part of these things were produced by the evidence on the Wednesday following.

            . One of Justice Wilmot's men asked me on Sunday evening if I knew the prisoner; I said I did; he desired if I saw her I would stop her, for she had robbed somebody in Shoreditch; on the Tuesday following I was at the Half Moon and Punch Bowl in Whitechapel, when a woman came in and asked the landlady to lend her some money to buy a shift a sheet and two aprons, which the prisoner had pawned; I followed the girl and the prisoner; when they had taken them out of pawn from the several pawnbrokers, I took them both and carried them before Justice Wilmot.

EDWARD JANSON. On the 31st of December I was in Whitechapel


, about noon - I crossed over at Houndsditch


 - some persons called to me; I turned round, and saw the officer with my handkerchief in one hand, and the prisoner in the other; I had not noticed him before - my handkerchief was taken from my coat pocket.

            . I am an officer. I was on duty, and saw the prisoner, and two others make an attempt at the prosecutor's pocket, just opposite Petticoat-lane - they then went on, and closed up to him by Aldgate church, and I saw the prisoner put something into his breast - I crossed and took him with the handkerchief.
Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you see his hand at the prosecutor's pocket? A. No; but they were all together; I did not know him before.
Prisoner's Defence. I had been after a situation at Mr. Baker's; I picked the handkerchief up.
MR. JANSON. It was a muddy day - there was no dirt on the handkerchief.

            , a linen-draper
, No. 146, Oxford-street


: On the 27th of October, I do not recollect what day of the week, it was about three o'clock in the afternoon, the shawls were hanging outside the door; a gentleman came in, and said there was a person gone along with something of ours in her pocket; I pursued the prisoner, and found the shawls concealed in her apron, about twenty yards from the shop, or rather better; I brought her back into the shop, and sent for a constable, she gave no account how she came by them; I saw them hanging there about two o'clock, they had Mr. Jackson's private mark upon them, in Mr. Jackson's brother's hand-writing; they are exactly the same size and pattern as those that I missed. (Produces them).
Prisoner's defence. I live in Oxford-buildings, Oxford-road; coming along, I saw these shawls blow off from a railing, a woman came by, and said, my good woman, pick them up, and take them into the shop, and I was going to take them into the shop, when that gentleman came and laid hold of me.

Court. (To Francis.) Q. In what direction was she going? - A. From the shop, at the distance of about twenty-five yards, she said something of this sort at the office.

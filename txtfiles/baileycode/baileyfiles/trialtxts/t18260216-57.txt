            . I am day-watchman, of Woburn-place


. I saw the prisoner go into one of the unfinished houses about three o'clock on the 28th of January; he asked me if that was Mr. Cubit's building - I said Yes, and he asked for the foreman of the plasterers; I said he was somewhere about the premises; I went into the kitchen and, while I was there, he went out with this coat and case of instruments - I pursued and took him - he threw down the coat.

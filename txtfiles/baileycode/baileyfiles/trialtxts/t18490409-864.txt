EMMA TYLER
. I am single, and live at 5, Angel-alley, Bishopsgate-street, I have known the prisoner about six months from this time—he lives at No. 6, at the back of us. On Wednesday evening, 17th Jan., I was in Angel-alley with Eliza Graves, about seven o'clock—I saw the prisoner as he was going to the shop with some work—he came back about eight—he seemed rather angry—I asked him what time it was, and he said about eight—he asked me where I had been, and I said no further than the door—while talking to him John Sumner came by: I went to him, and was talking to him about ten minutes—the prisoner saw me talking to him, and when the conversation was over the prisoner was gone—Graves went in search of him—I followed, and found him in Skinner-street—I put his cap on his head, and he knocked it off and flung it over the wall at the back of his own house; I recovered it and took it to him—he then walked into Back-alley—I then went indoors into my own house—shortly afterwards, in consequence of what Graves said, I went out again—he had sent for me—I asked him what he wanted—he said that was his business; I should see what he wanted with me if I waited time enough—he then seized hold of my right hand—I asked what he held my hand so tight for—he said that was his business—I got my hand away, and he seized me by my dress—I kept asking him to let me go in doors; he would not—I turned my head from him, about ten minutes, to talk to Graves, and as I was going to ask him again he fired a pistol at me—he had still hold of my dress with his left hand—I saw the pistol—it was about half a yard from me—I felt that I was wounded on the side of the head—I fell down twice—Sumner came and picked me up, and when I came to my senses I found myself at the hospital.

Cross-examined by
MR. WOLLETT. Q. How old are you? A. Turned sixteen; the prisoner is about nineteen, I believe—I have never gone by any other name—we have changed our names in a lark—I have been called Jemima—I first saw the prisoner about seven o'clock—he did not tell me where he was going—he had a bundle of cotton in his hand—he is in a weaver's employment—he spoke to me, and said he should be back soon-we had been on very friendly terms—I was standing outside the door when he came back—(The witness here became faint and retired.)





ELIZA GRAVES
. I am single, and live at 9, Angel-alley, Bishopsgate—for some time before 17th Jan., I knew Emma Tyler, Sumner, and the prisoner; we were all intimate together—the prisoner and Tyler had been keeping company about three months—I saw Tyler and the prisoner together, on Wednesday evening, 17th Jan.—I saw Sumner come up—Tyler left the prisoner to talk to him—the prisoner did not say anything about that; he stood by while she was talking to Sumner—he seemed displeased, and went away directly into Skinner-street—I and Tyler afterwards went and found him in Skinner-street, sitting on a post—Tyler took off his cap, and he went up a place called Back-alley, and I and Tyler went indoors—I afterwards went back, and the prisoner asked me to fetch Tyler out—Tyler asked him what was the matter with him—he said that was nothing to do with her—Tyler and I then Went indoors—about ten minutes afterwards the prisoner said to me, "Go and tell Emma Tyler I want to speak to her"—I told her, and she came out—we went to the prisoner—he was then standing by our gate—he said he wanted to speak to her very particularly—she said, "Let me hear it, if you please"—he made no reply—we went to our door, and he flung his cap over into his own yard; he desired me to fetch it, I refused, and I, the

prisoner, and Tyler, then went to Tyler's window—we stood talking together for about half-an-hour, all in good-humour—I went to our gate, about half-a-yard off, and left them talking together—about half-an-hour afterwards I came back to the window—the prisoner then pulled the pistol out of his left-side coat-pocket, and immediately fired; no angry words had passed, or any thing of the sort—I did not hear anything before he pulled the pistol out—he pulled it out with his right-hand—he had let go of her dress—his left-hand was in his pocket—he did not do anything with the pistol, but put it into his pocket again—he fired it at Emma Tyler, he was then about half-a-yard from her—his left-hand had hold of Tyler's right-hand—Tyler fell down into my arms, and she bled very much from the left-side of her head—Sumner came up and assisted us, and she was carried to a doctor—the prisoner ran away—I did not see him do anything with the pistol before he ran away—I did not mean to say that he put it into his pocket as he was running away—I did not see what became of the pistol—I am fourteen years old.

Cross-examined. Q. You, the prisoner, and Tyler, were frequently in the habit of playing together? A. Yes; we were playing on this evening—Tyler pulled the prisoner's cap off in play—no angry words passed between them—I do not know what he did with the pistol after he fired it—he took it out of his pocket, then fired it at Tyler, and as he was running, put it into his pocket again; it was about ten o'clock—the neighbourhood is not very well lighted—I have said I thought the prisoner did it out of a lark—I think so still; it was all in perfect good-humour—I had never seen him with a pistol before.





JOHN SUMNER
. I live at 2, Angel Alley. On 17th Jan., about seven o'clock, I saw Tyler, the prisoner, and Graves together—I had not passed them above three yards before Tyler called me—she came to me, and we were talking together ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, and while we were talking the prisoner went away—we remained two or three minutes, and then Tyler and Graves walked down, and I went after them towards Skinner-place—the prisoner was sitting on a post there—I saw Tyler take off his cap; he was going to walk away without it, when she ran after him, and gave it him back again—Tyler and Graves then went towards their own door, and I went to my own house, and after that I went out and came home about ten, and just before I got to the door, I heard the report of a pistol, or some sort of fire-arms—I heard the screams of a female—I went up immediately, and found Tyler in Graves' arms—there was blood running, but I do not know where the wound was—I took her to the doctor's, and then in a cab to the hospital.

Cross-examined. Q. Have you known the prisoner some time? A. Yes; he generally appeared in delicate health; he never appeared to be in very good health.





ROBERT MASON
. I am house-surgeon at St. Bartholomew's Hospital. On Wednesday evening, 17th Jan., about half-past ten or eleven o'clock, Tyler was brought there—I examined her head, and found a gun-shot wound on the left-side, and about two inches further on there was another wound, about the same size—there was not much blood; she was very faint, the blood being stopped—the wounds, from their shape and size, were evidently caused by a bullet—the bullet appeared to have entered at the lower wound, and made its exit at the upper one, traversing about two inches under the skin; it had gone close to the bone, which was bared, but not fractured—the side of her face near the wound was scorched and blackened by the gun-powder—I probed the wound, but found no bullet—I put her Under the charge of Mrs. Osborne, the nurse, and she has been in the hospital ever since,

that has been necessary, in consequence of the state of her health; her nerves have been very much shaken—the wound of—Itself was not dangerous, but it might have been so in its consequences, if inflammation or erysipelas had arisen.

Cross-examined. Q. On which side was the wound? A. The left—it did not present any dangerous features—she was taken to the Mansion House in a cab, and was just able to give her evidence—it was a large bullet wound—I cannot say, from the fact of the bullet being found in her hair, whether it was a heavy charge or not; the hair was very thick behind—I have not sufficient knowledge of the force of a bullet to say whether, if it had been a heavy charge, it would have passed through the hair—it most have been very forcible, for it went through the scalp in one direction and out at another, and then lodged in the hair.





SUSANNAH OSBORNE
. I am a nurse at St. Bartholomew's Hospital. On Wednesday night, 17th Jan., Tyler was put under my charge—next day I dressed her head, and found in her hair, above the top wound, this piece of lead, or copper, like a bullet (produced)—it was so much discoloured with the blood that I could not tell what it was—I gave it to Mr. Mason.

MR. MASON
re-examined. This is the bullet I received from Mrs. Osborne.





GODFREY FOSBERY
 (City police-inspector). I heard of this matter on Wednesday night, about twenty minutes past eleven o'clock. About seven, next morning, I found the prisoner at his father's house—I took him into custody, and told him what it was for—he said there was nothing in the pistol but paper—I took him to the station, and on the way he said that Tyler wished him to buy another pistol to shoot her, and afterwards himself—I asked him whit he did with the pistol, and he said he threw it away, into "the ruins," which is a vacant piece of ground, near his house, where there is rubbish—I received this bullet from Mr. Mason, and this wadding, almost as hard as a bullet, was found in the cap attached to Tyler's bonnet.





AMOS MERRITT
 (City-policeman, 73). I searched in these "ruins," on 18th Jan., for the pistol—I made two minute searches, but did not find any pistol—I took the prisoner from the Mansion House to the Compter, after his first examination—going up Cheapside he said it was a bad job, and asked me how the girl was; I told him I understood she was very ill indeed in the hospital—he said on several occasions he had seen John Sumner and her larking together, and he did so on the previous evening, and on several other nights, and he felt very much annoyed at it; he saw them standing together that night, for about ten minutes or so, and he then left them, and went away, and soon after he met her again in the alley, and she said she wanted none of his black looks, for she did not mean to keep company with him any longer, but to go along with John Sumner; he afterwards met her in the alley along with Graves, and she asked him to go with her to London, bridge, and asked Graves to go and get her bonnet and shawl, and go with them, to throw themselves, all three, over London-bridge, which he refused to do; she then went in to get her bonnet and shawl for that purpose; they then stood together for a few minutes, and he pulled the pistol out of his pocket, but he did it merely to frighten her; he did not mean to shoot her—he said he threw the pistol into the "ruins."

Cross-examined. Q. Was he in a very weak state at the time? A. Yes—he is generally in a weak state—I do not know that he was weaker than usual; he was able to walk—I knew him before—I never knew anything against him—I understand he has been very ill since he has been in gaol—the last time I took him from the Mansion House I was obliged to take him in a cab.



MR. WOOLLETT
to
EMMA TYLER. Q. I think you say you have known the prisoner about six months? A. Yes—we have not been a great deal together, sometimes we have—we have often played together, and Graves also—I have seen him with a pistol—I did not know he carried it in his pocket—I cannot tell how long he has had it; I believe some time—I have seen him fire it—he has held it before me—he is generally in a very weak state of health—we have always been on friendly terms—I did not suppose he was going to murder me; I had no idea of it—I do not suppose he had any malice towards me—he had snapped it at me before on several occasions—it was not loaded then—it had a cap on it—that was in fun.

JURY. Q. Had you seen the pistol that evening, previous to this occurring? A. No.
(Joseph Perry, boot and shoe-maker, Red Lion-street, Spitalfields, and Thomas Collins, wadding-manufacturer, of Bishopsgate-street, gave the prisoner a good character.)

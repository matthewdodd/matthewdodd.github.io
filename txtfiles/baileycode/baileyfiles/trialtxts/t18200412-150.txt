             was indicted for 


               stealing, on the 17th of March
, 40 ounces of silver, value 10 l.
            , the goods of 
               
                  
                     Joseph 
                     Angel

            . The prisoner worked eighteen months with me, during which time I have lost silver to a considerable amount. In consequence of the apprehending of the last prisoner, and discovering the duplicates, it induced me to go to Armstrong's, a pawnbroker, in Baldwin's-gardens. I went there on Friday, the 17th of March, about half-past one o'clock, which was the day after Beckley was apprehended. While I was there the prisoner came in to redeem four silver figures. I was giving a description of him to Armstrong at the time he came in. Mr. Armstrong said,
"This is the man!" and seized him. He seemed confused at the sight of me, and begged he might have some water or something, for he was near fainting. We took him to the public-house opposite Hatton-garden office; I there asked him where he got the things from which were in pledge at Armstrong's? and asked him if he had not taken my silver to manufacture them? I made no proposition to him whatever. He said, Yes, he had. I said I was afraid a great many more were concerned. After that he begged I would be merciful, and said all the things were made of my silver.

            . I produce twenty-three duplicates, which I found in the present prisoner's house; they are all for silver articles - spoons, snuff-boxes, mugs, and other things; I also found some pieces of silver.


                  JOSEPH 
                  ANGEL
               



             re-examined. I can positively swear to one of the pieces of silver; I saw it three days before in a box in my workshop - it weighs about an ounce and a half.
Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. How many men have you - A. About thirty. They all slept out of the house, except the apprentice. I found near forty ounces of silver at Armstrong's.

            , JUN. My mother keeps a pawnbroker's shop, at No. 38, Baldwin's-garden. The prisoner has been in the habit of pledging articles at our shop. I produce four silver images, which I took in pledge of him for 13 s. - they weigh about three ounces - he pledged them in the name of 
               
                  Edward 
                  Turner
               



            . I have known him sometime before - we always knew him by that name; he gave his residence in Gray's Inn-lane. I have a teapot-stand, a desert spoon, and various articles in snuff-boxes, spoons, &c. He always told us he was in business on his own account. I took him into custody as soon as he came to redeem the images.

            . I am a pawnbroker, and live in Tottenham-court-road. I produce six tea-spoons and two silver-mounted snuff-boxes, which were taken in pledge by a young man who has left us. The residence on the duplicates is Tottenham-court-road.


                  JOSEPH 
                  CHAPMAN
               



            . I am a pawnbroker, and live at No. 50, St. John-street. I have a silver pepper-box, a pair of sugar-tongs, a silver mug, a snuff-box, two salt-spoons, four table-spoons, six tea-spoons, a gravy-spoon, and two desert-spoons - they are all new, except the pepper-box, and were pledged by the prisoner.

            . I am servant to Mr. Banton, who is a pawnbroker, and lives in Monkwell-street. I have six tea-spoons and a snuff-box, which I took in pledge of the prisoner. I took in more things, which cannot be identified.


                  FREDERICK 
                  EDWARDS
               



            . I live at Mrs. Fothergill's, who is a pawnbroker, and lives in Aldersgate-street. I produce a milk-pot, which I took in pledge of the prisoner. He said he lived in Aldersgate-buildings; I have known him to live there for three years. I understood he worked on his own account. I have also a silver teapot-stand, three snuff-boxes, and a pair of desert-spoons.

                  LIMBRICK
               



             re-examined. I apprehended the prisoner in Aldersgate-buildings.

             re-examined. I have lost upwards of 300 ounces of plate within the last twelve months. The goods were not before him when he made the confession. I described the articles to him which I had found at the pawnbrokers' - he said they were made out of my silver. His confession was not confined to the goods found at Armstrong's.
Prisoner's Defence. I have been in business for myself three years, and bought the goods. Four of the snuffboxes were made for me by Mr. Angel's men in their over-hours. Everybody knew I was in business - his men have been to my house, seen me at work, and have issued cards. The prosecutor is greatly mistaken in the property he has selected from my stock - he has selected me for prosecution from suspicion only. The silver mug was given to me by my master, Mr. Socket, of Camberwell, when I was out of my apprenticeship. I was going into partnership with him, but he died while it was in agitation. I commenced being journeyman in April, 1818. The prosecutor had no reason to suspect my honesty, but as soon as he found out that I was in business for myself he suspected I must have robbed him. I went to Armstrong's on business, and met the prosecutor there, who gave me in charge. I do assure your Lordship I am entirely innocent. The same chaser worked for me as for the prosecutor. I have bought 173 oz. of silver within the last three years.

             re-examined. I never knew he was in business for himself, if I had I should have discharged him immediately. I saw his card at his lodgings, but never before.

            . I am an artist. I have known the prisoner for sometime; he has mounted a snuff-box for me. I first saw his cards seven or eight months ago, and circulated some of them among my friends.

            . I lodged with the prisoner in Aldersgate-buildings. He used to work in his own room at his over-hours.

            . Aged 24.

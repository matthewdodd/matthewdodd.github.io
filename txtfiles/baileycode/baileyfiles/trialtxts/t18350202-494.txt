JAMES HENRY FREDERICK LEWIS
. I am a solicitor. Last Saturday week I was going over London-bridge with my sister—there was an obstruction in the road, which made me pause—I felt a tug at my pocket, turned round, and collared the prisoner, seeing my handkerchief in his

hand—he gave my hand a blow, which loosened my hold, and away he ran—a woman got in the way—I saw a witness following the prisoner—I immediately followed, and met the witness returning with him—I gave him in charge—here is the handkerchief.





CHARLES OSLER OWEN
. I was passing over the bridge, and saw the prosecutor being stopped by an obstruction—I saw him turn hastily round—I turned round, and saw the prisoner throw the handkerchief from his hand on the ground—the gentleman took it up, and collared him—he knocked his hand away, and ran off—I ran, and secured him, and brought him back.

Prisoner's Defence. I was going over the bridge—the gentleman came to a waggon which had broken down—I just stopped—he turned round in a great passion, and collared me—I put up my arm, and said, "Don't collar me, I have done nothing"—the handkerchief laid about two yards from me—I never touched his pocket—I had witnesses to prove it, but they would not let me get at them.




GUILTY
. † Aged 20.—


Transported for Seven Years.

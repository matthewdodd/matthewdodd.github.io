MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL, with
MESSRS. WELSBY, CLARKSON, BODKIN, and
CLERK
conducted the Prosecution.

(Upon the application of the Counsel for the prisoners, the whole Jury panel was read over. As the first Juror was about to be sworn, MR. BALLANTINE (for Lacey and Cuffey) challenged him, alleging as cause that he did at stand indifferent between the Crown and the prisoners. The
ATTORNEY GENERAL
having pleaded issue was joined, triers were appointed, and each Juror was then sworn and examined on the voire dire, MR. BALLASTINE
asking him whether he had expressed any opinion as to the guilt or isscence of the prisoners, or any wish as to the result of the trial. Authorities referred to; 1 Coke on Lit., pages 158a & 287; Chitty's Criminal Lar, page 550; Townley's case, reported in Foster; & Layer's case.






WILLIAM BROOM CROSS
 (police-sergeant, G 8). I was present at the apprehension of the prisoner Fay on Friday, 18th Aug. I rode in the same cab that brought him to Bow-street—on the way he told me he had been secretary to the confederate club, likewise to the Chartist club held at Cartwrights Coffee-house, but he had resigned the books on the Saturday previous.





JOSEPH THOMPSON
 (police-sergeant, F 11.) From information I received I went to 11, Hollins-street, Wardour-street, Soho, on the evening of 18th Aug. last, at eight o'clock, to a back room on the third floor—I there found Cuffey, and took him into custody—I told him he was charged with felony—he said, "Have you got a warrant?"—I said, "No, it is not necessary"—I told him he was charged with others with wilfully and unlawfully combining against her Majesty—he said, "Oh that is quite sufficient; I am a Chartist; I understand it"—West was with me—I commenced searching the room—I saw him go to a drawer, fumble about, and apparently take something ont—I went and caught hold of his hand—we had a scuffle, and in the scuffle he tried to pass this pistol to his wife—it fell on the ground—he said it was loaded—I picked it up—it was loaded with powder and ball, and primed—I also found this banner with "Westminster district" on it (produced).

Cross-examined by
MR. BALLANTINE
Q. Did he say that the banner had been used on various occasions. A. Not then; he said before the Magistrate that it had been used on 10th April, and also in Hertfordshire, at some land association of Mr. O'Connor's—I did not take Mrs. Cuffey into custody—she was rather active, as most wives are—this was a small room at the top of the house—it was not a wretched room, for a garret it was a little better

than usual—I read over the charge to him when I took him—it had been written for me by Mr. Burnaby, the chief clerk at Bow-street—other men had previously been apprehended on a charge of being connected with this offence.





WILLIAM WEST
 (police-sergeant, 7.) I accompanied Thompson when he apprehended Cuffey—I went to the house between ten and eleven o'clock next morning, and found this pike-handle (produced) in a cock-loft, the entrance to which was close to the door of Cuffey's room.

Cross-examined by
MR. BALLANTINE
Q. How do you know this to be a pike-staff. A. It resembles those I have seen with pikes on them—the loft is above the garret—I did not search the loft on the first occasion, I overlooked it—I did not know there was a loft, no one told me there was one—I went back of my own accord—I found the outer door open, and went up—I do not know where the witness Powell was at that time—I did not know him at that time—it was a trap-door that led to the loft—I did not see it on the first occasion—Mrs. Cuffey was down at the office at that time—I did not produce this at the Police-court—I had it there, but I gave no evidence—I told the solicitor to the Treasury that I had it.





THOMAS PRONGER
 (policeman, A 237.) On 18th Aug. last, I took Lacey into custody at his own house, the Charter coffee-shop, 32, Strutton-ground, Westminster—I found this card in the club-room, on the first-floor, where they met—I know it was the room in which they met, because I have been there several times during their meetings—the Wallace Brigade met there—(This card being read, the name of William Lacey appeared as Sub-Secretary)—I also found on a shelf, in a book in the sitting-room behind the coffee-shop, this receipt for the hiring of the Milton-street theatre for a meeting—(This was dated July 5, 1848.)

Cross-examined by
MR. BALLANTINE
Q. Then you have attended these meetings? A. Yes, in plain clothes—I did not require any ticket or sign to be admitted—I was allowed to go in—the discussions were then going on—I then learnt that the name was the "Wallace Brigade"—the door was closed against us at times—I do not mean when I was in uniform, but when I was in plain clothes—I was refused admission after 26th June—I did not go in afterwards at all—they had found out before that I was a policeman—I was admitted at times, though I was known to be a policeman.

Cross-examined by
MR. PARRY. Q. Did you know Powell before 15th Aug.? A. I never knew him at all till I saw him at the Police-court.





CHARLES TILDEN
. I am a brass-chaser, living at Little Earl-street, Seven Dials; I work for Mr. Martin, of 18, Grezert-street, Rathbone-place—I became a member of the Chartist Association on 29th May—I belonged to the Dean-street locality—the prisoner Cuffey was my class-leader—according to the rules of the Association, each class-leader has nine men under him—it is his duty to give orders—I never saw the rules in writing at the society—I learnt them from the delegates—they were not printed—I have received orders from Cuffey—in Aug. last, Cuffey told me to get some gunpowder, to he made up into cartridges—he did not give me any money; he said it would be 10d.—he said they were to fire on the policemen—I said I would get the powder, but as I had not got a gun, it was no use getting the powder—he said never mind, when the time arrived, we should break into the gun-shops—about a week afterwards, be came to me one Sunday morning, and asked me whether I had got the powder—I told him yes, and that I could not get it under 1s., but I had got it—about a week after that, I met him in Wardour-street,

and asked him the way to make the cartridges, and he explained that it was twisting paper round a bit of wire or anything round—about the middle of June, I saw him at his lodgings in Hollins-street, and he showed me a pike—head—I said it was very blunt, and was of no use, and I told him I would sharpen it for him—he said very well, and he got down the pole, which was about twelve feet long, and put himself in an attitude to make an attack—he likewise showed me a screw-hole on the top of the pole, and there was a screw tied on to the pike, so that it could be ready at a minute's notice—this is the pole (produced)—I know it by some marks in the centre, and by the turning—he said it was Mitchell's pattern—about a week after that, I saw him at his own place, casting bullets from letter-type—he said they were to be made up in cartridges, to fire on the police—I said I had seen So-and so and he had been telling me about ginger-beer bottles, and I told him what was in them, ragged pieces of iron-nails, gunpowder done round with tow, and dipped in turpentine—he said they would be very good things, they were very good for the wives of the Chartists to be chucking out of windows, while their husbands were down in the street fighting with the police—I recollect the time when the news came about the rising in Ireland—about that tin:; Cuffey told me that the soldiers were being drained away, and that London would soon be in our hands—he said he hoped I should not flinch in coming out, and I said I should be at my post whenever he should call me, if it was in the middle of the night.

Cross-examined by
MR. BALLANTINE
Q. When did you first see Cuffey about these matters? A. The beginning of it was after he was my class-leader, about a fortnight after I joined—I had seen him many times before that—I made the application to be put under him—I was ambitious of being one of his officers—I was a private—I expected promotion—if the thing; succeeded, I was to be made a general, or something of that—I was not to be made King—I expected to be made President of the Commonwealth—I was a Chartist before I joined the Association—I was at work at that time—I have not been in any difficulty to speak of—I bad been locked up merely for getting drunk—I was had up once, seven or eight years ago—I was waiting for a companion of mine in Whitehall-gardens, to go to Putney races, and was standing looking at James I., it being my trade to cast those figures, and I was looking to see whereabouts it was put together, when a constable came up to me, and said I had no business to stand there, and desired me to move on—I thought he exceeded his duty, and did not like his manner of speakiag to me, and thought I would be obstinate, and there I stood all day from nine in the morning till five in the evening, when I was taken up, and taken to the station in Gardener's-lane—I was taken to Bow-street, it was too late, so they took me back again—I was not charged with picking any One's pocket—they searched me, I suppose to see what they could find—I was ordered to find bail for six months—I did so—I remained in prison three weeks—I am sure that is the only time I have been in prison—I have been in a court of justice, merely as a witness, not for the police, but on a private affair—I have been working at my own trade.

Q. I suppose, at the time you joined the Chartists, you were in earnest, and did not mean to inform against them? A. I did not know what their principles were—I joined as a moral force Chartist—I told Cuffey I had bought 1s. worth of powder, but I had not—I did not get paid for it—I told him I had bought it for the purpose of seeing whether I could find out anything to stop it—I was looking for an opportunity to stop it—I intended to

go on with them as regards moral force, but not to have any movement in the physical force, because I thought it was not a right thing—I should think the gunpowder cartridges and ginger-beer bottles were for physical force—I did not fill any of the ginger-beer bottles—I reminded Cuffey of them, because another man told me of them; it was not Powell, it was a man named Peter Cashel—I merely told Cuffey about it to see what he would say, I whether there were any fresh orders coming—he might not have told me without—it led him on to think I was sincere—I was not sincere in the physical force movement—I meant to stop the progress of it, if any attempt was made—I did not mention to Cuffey the way in which the ginger-beer bottles were to be used—Cuffey said they were very good things for their wives to chuck out of the windows on the police—I did offer to sharpen the pike—head—I did that from the same motive—it was not to lead him on, and then to betray him; that was not leading him on—I meant to stop the physical force movement, that was why I offered to sharpen the pike—head—I was in communication with the officers of the Government—I was not employed by them—I first communicated with them about a month after I joined the Chartists, some time in June—it was after that that I offered to sharpen the pike—head—it was said, merely to see what I could get out of him, to see what movements were on—it was not to see how far I could get him to go—I could not get him to go at all myself—he had orders from the wardens who were above him—from time to time during June I communicated what was going on—I was not associated with Powell—I did not know him till I saw him on this trial—I did not know he was employed—there was nobody associated with me—I do not expect to get anything for this—I do it for the good of the public, and likewise of myself—if they succeeded in burning houses they would stop trade and put me out of work, and I have a wife and family—they were to set fire to people's houses, and if anybody opposed them they were to knock them on the head—that would of course stop trade, and cause me to loose my work—that was the good I contemplated to myself by turning spy and informer—I swear that—I was not examined before the Magistrate—I was not examined at all till Saturday, on Dowling's trial—I heard of Cuffey's being taken into custody when I went to his house, about a quarter of an hour afterwards—I did not know he was to be taken—he was taken on the evening I went to his house—I had been before he was taken, and I went after—I went alone the first time—I did not go into his room, I might if I liked—he lives in a garret—I never noticed that there was a cockloft there, or a loft at all—I now know there is one from what I have heard—I did not know it before—I have been into his room several times—about twenty-four times—I never noticed a trap-door there—I did not know there was one—I did not put the pole into it—I merely went to the house to get information from Cuffey—I did not know he was apprehended till I went the second time—I did not get the information I wanted—I knew he was taken, because I saw his son at the door of his house—I believe it to be his son—he is about twenty-seven years of age—I ascertained from him that he was taken—I was not in communication with West, the policeman, at that time, I did not know him then—I am now living by my work; that is the only mode I have no other means—I am in regular work with Mr. Martin, of 18, Grezert-street—I get 28s. a week, sometimes less sometimes more—I have been working for him off and on thirteen years.

Q. Then do you mean that you were in respectable employment at the time you were carrying on this additional business of a spy? A. Yes—I

could live without being a spy—on my solemn oath I have no other means a living, except by what I am earning by my labour—I have received nothing else—I do not receive anything from the prosecution, only my dinner—I have received no money, expect my dinner-money, 18d. a day, which I have had since I have been here—I have not received anything else from Government—I do not expect to receive anything else, except the 18d. a day for my dinner while I am attending here—I have not asked for anything elseI expect to be paid for my time while I am here, not while I am at work—I expect my regular day's money—I only expect to get my expenses, nothing more—I never refuse anything—I should not be in the least ashamed of taking anything from the Government—I lived at 1, Phœnix-street for a year and a half, up to 12th Aug.—from there I went to 26, Little Earl-street, and I live there now—I was to get llb. of powder for the 10d.—I was to make that up into cartridges—I found Cuffey casting bullets up in his garret—his wife was not there, nor any of the little Cuffeys—he had no cauldron—he had a tobacco-pipe—he had a pair of pliers and a mould—he had not much lead—he was using letter type—he had thirty or forty letters—they were not capita-letters, but small ones.

Cross-examined by
MR. PARRY. Q. You said when you were lootings King James, you were thinking of going to Putney races? A. I did not say that I was thinking of going, but I went there for the purpose of waiting for a companion of mine to go to Putney races—I had not been at Putney races before, nor to any races—I have not been since—I swear that—it was a boat-race, not a horse-race—I do not know Powell—Peter Cashel is not a police man.

MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL. Q. Do you recollect the day you were takes up, was it 5th July, 1843? A. That was about the time—it was just after Mr. Drummond had been shot—the charge against me was for loitering about Whitehall-gardens during the day, and not giving a satisfactory account of myself.

COURT. Q. What was the name of your companion you were waiting for? A. I forget his name, but it was the one I lodged with—he had lodged with me about twelve months—I did know his name, but it is seven or eight years ago, and I forget it—he was a tailor.





MARTHA TILDEN
. I am the wife of Charles Tilden—I know Cuffey—I saw him last on 13th Aug.—I had seen him twice before—on 13th Aug. I told him he was not to come to my lodgings—I had removed the day before, because I would not allow him to come to our lodgings, and my husband was too ill to be seen—he said he wanted to see him just for half an hour up at his own house—I said he could not see him for five minutes he was too bad to be seen, by the doctor's orders—he asked me where we had moved to, and I told him to Earl-street, but did not tell him any number or any other place—I was going out to work at the time, and could not stop to talk to him.

Cross-examined by
MR. BALLANTINE
Q. Who does your husband wore for? A. Mr. Martin, to whom he was apprenticed—I have two children.





THOMAS POWELL
. I am a carpenter. Shortly after the 10th of April I joined the Cripplegate locality of the Chartist Confederation—I was appointed one of the Council—our place of meeting was the front long-room, at Cartwright's coffee-shop, Redcross-street, Cripplegate—I was a member down to Aug.—I attended meetings of the same body at other places, and made notes of what occurred, sometimes the next day, and sometimes the day after, and

on one or two occasions, if not three, immediately I got home—they are very short—I speak principally from my memory (looking at his notes)—the first meeting Fay was at, was on Friday, July 28th, at Hopkinson's coffee-shop, Saffron-hill—(it was held by adjournment from a former meeting at the same place—I was present at the adjournment)—on 28th, fourteen persons were present—Ferdinando, Mr. Page, from Tothill-street, Westminster locality; Brewster, Rose, Mullins, Payne, myself, Hopkinson, an Irish Confederate,: Mr. Home, (his first appearance,) Flannagan, Fay, and others—a return was given in of the number of fighting men, and the feeling of the members of the respective localities, by the new delegates that came there on that evening from localities in the metropolis—I was then acting as a delegate for Cripplegate locality—I cannot say bow many fighting men they returned—Mr. Payne was chairman, but Mullins was spokesman—a resolution was passed that each member should bring 10s. as soon as possible, to defray the expenses incurred by the committee—the meeting was adjourned to meet at Cart-wright's, on Sunday afternoon, July 30th—Payne, Dowling, Brewster, Rose, Mullins, Bassett, (his first appearance,) Stevenson, myself, Ferdinando, Fay, and others, were present, twenty-eight in all—I got there between three and half-past three o'clock—returns were given in, the same as before, by the new delegates, and the ulterior committee resigned—that consisted of five—there was some conversation about increasing them to the number of nine, and some charge was brought against Mullins and Rose, two of the five, as being spies—Payne, Rose, Mullins, Bassett, and Dowling, were elected—it was confined to five, but a resolution was passed that four others should be elected at the next meeting—I never was proposed—I said I bad heard that some charge had been brought against Rose and Mullins, and I thought it was better to set aside such trash, and have nothing more to do with it; and they were elected—I also made some remark that it was impossible for them to do anything in our movement, unless they could produce a spirit of subordination among the members—I believe that was after the allegation made against the two men as spies—it was resolved that they should meet at Cartwright's, at six on the following Monday evening, if necessary, but there was no meeting—they met next at the Dispatch coffee-house, Bride-lane. Fleet-street, on 1st Aug.—Rose, Mullins, Brewster, Dowling, Thompson, Donovan, Lynch, Warry, and others, thirty-four in all, were present—Payne was in the chair—Fay was there—I do not remember seeing the other prisoners—Bezer was there, it was his first appearance—he gave in a report of fifty fighting men from Cartwright's, for which locality he was secretary—he was not a delegate—there were other returns made—Fay, Thompson, Lynch, and Donovan, four Irishmen, were elected on the committee—their club belonged to the Irish Confederates at one time, but they altered the name to the Irish Felon-club—I am not certain which it was called at this time—Fay was secretary—they used to meet at Cartwright's—the reason given for adding four Irishmen to the committee was, that a feeling of jealousy existed—the whole of the four spoke that evening, and stated that they thought there was not a sufficient number of Irishmen on the committee, and in consequence of that they were added—there was some discussion on the propriety of dispatching a party to Limerick or Cork—I forget who brought that forward; it was discussed, and lost, at the voting—(The witness here requested that every witness subpoenaed to speak against his character might be ordered out of Court)—during the discussion it was said that it would be a waste of money, and there would be no possibility of getting a correct account of the state of affairs in Ireland; that was said by both sides—a report was given in from the

delegates the same as before—nothing more was said about the Irish messenger—Dowling moved that there should be a demonstration on the following Sunday, 6th Aug., at two o'clock, on Primrose-hill, of Chartists and Confederates, to ascertain their number and strength; that was lost by a majority of five—a resolution was passed that every delegate should return to his locality, and ascertain how the members were prepared for regularity of preparation, and ready to be called out at an hour's notice, and to bring friends to the committee on Friday, Aug. 4th—Mullins stated that he had seen Mr. Kydd that day, and that Mr. Kydd, if the people came out for physical force, would not be backward in heading them; but that Mr. Kydd had entered on the executive only as a moral force man, and that he took the office on that ground—Kydd was one of the executive of the National Convention—the executive had to pay attention to the localities, to look after them, and receive names from them—they were in connection with the localities—that communication was received with a degree of satisfaction and surprise by the delegates—the meeting then adjourned to meet at Cartwright's on Aug. 4th—I attended—there were thirty-two present—Payne was in the chair on all occasions—Cuffey was there for the first tide, and Rose, Brewster, Gurney, Mullins, Bassett, (his second time,) Donovan, Lynch, Dowling, myself, Thompson, and others—I have not Fay's name-there were new delegates present; they gave in a report of the number of fighting men; I have no numbers—money was paid by the new delegates, and by some of the old, to Rose, as secretary—there was a discussion about what scarfs were to be worn, as signs of leadership, and it was decided that they should be red calico sashes—there was a conversation in committee between Payne, Bassett, and Mullins, about a communication that had been received from Kydd, and of a circular he had received, desiring to know how far the delegates then sitting in London, were desirous of sending a delegate to Manchester—I believe Bassett communicated that to the meeting—Payne made some remarks about his sleeping two or three nights at Lacey's house, and Lacey was proposed as a proper person to go to Manchester as a delegate, and it was agreed to—Bassett was proposed to wait on Lacey, who was not present, on the subject, and Mullins gave him money for the purpose—he went off, and I saw no more of him that evening—a resolution was passed by the general body of delegates that they should submit to the determination of the ulterior committee, the committee of nine—it was resolved that the delegates should call on their respective members to meet at half-past two on the following Sunday, at their localities, and they were not, by any means, to leave there, or visit Kennington-common that day—there had been a meeting at Kennington-common advertised in the newspapers, which was not called by any of the Chartist or Confederate bodies, and they were not to go for fear of coming into collision with the police and the authorities—a resolution was passed that every delegate should select four men, or more, for the purpose of placing them as telegraphs from the Dispatch coffee-house, Bride-lane, to Kennington-common, to communicate information to the delegates sittings the Dispatch coffee-house—it was resolved that they should meet at the Dispatch coffee-house, at half-past two o'clock on the following Sunday—I attended there, and was appointed as one to see the persons stationed as telegraphs—I returned to the meeting of delegates just at its close, and found Payne, Brewster, Mullins, and others, there—I have no names—Cuffey was there when I returned, and 1 saw him there before the business commenced—the resolution as to stationing persons was carried out—I saw every man placed—the meeting separated about a quarter of an hour after I returned—I

have no note of what took place, but my memory furnishes me—when I returned, Page, of Tothill-street, Westminster, was speaking on the subject of giving Mr. Bund Hughes, the Government reporter, a sound thrashing for what he had been doing—Page was a delegate—they met again on Monday night, 7th Aug., at Dennis's coffee-house, Great St. Andrew's-street, Seven-dials—there were thirty persons present; Cuffey, myself, Brewster, Mullins, Rose, Allnutt, Donovan, Dowling, Fay. Lynch, Thompson, Bassett, Ritchie, and others—the Ulterior Committee resigned that night, in consequence of the rumours of Smith O'Brien's arrest, and partly from a want of confidence that five of the committee had in the new four that had been added, and the four new ones complained that they had not seen the plans of the other five, and the five gave a similar explanation of not seeing the plans of the others—a new committee was appointed, consisting of five only, Payne, Rose, Mullins, Bassett, and Brewster—it was arranged, after some discussion, that there should be a visionary president, and that one of the committee who had the lowest votes should withdraw to make room for him when he entered on the seat of presidentship, some one asked who this person was, and one of the delegates said he was neither in London, nor out of London, and that was my meaning in saying a "visionary president"—Bassett had the lowest amount of votes—it was resolved that each member of every locality was to pay three farthings a head, as a salary for the president—each delegate was to make that known, and was to collect it—Payne, who was in the chair, read a letter, which he said he had received from Lacey, and part of it was in these words, "Trade is very good, and you will soon receive a very good order"—that was received by the meeting with satisfaction—we then adjourned, to meet on the following Wednesday, Aug. 9th, at the Lord Denman beer-shop, Suffolk-street, Borough—I attended—there were Payne, Brewster, Rose, Mullins, Dowling, myself, Gurney, Donovan, Bassett, and others, in all twenty-eight present—as I was going in, I met Cuffey in the passage, going away—the meeting had begun before I got there—I shook hands with Cuffey, and asked him bow be was—after I arrived reports were given in of the feeling of the members of the localities, and also a return of fighting men—Gurney gave in his return, either 100 or 120, but I think it was 100, from our locality—Gurney was formerly in the Artillery—his duty, as wardsman, was to look after his 100 men—each wardsman had 100 men under him, and each class-leader had nine under him, I often heard that said at Cartwright's—I do not remember the numbers mentioned by anybody else that night—a resolution was passed that each delegate should be called on to declare his allegiance, and determination to abide by the decision of the Ulterior Committee, and they stated, all except one, that they would abide by the determination of the committee—I am not sure who that one was—I think his name was Horne—he gave a reason for it, but I forget it—he came in nearly at the close of the business—Payne read another Utter from Lacey, and, in answer to some questions, he stated that Lacey was still at Manchester—some of the delegates present asked how long he was going to continue there, and Payne replied, as long as was necessary—I think, but am not sure, that there was a return given in at that meeting of the number of cartridges that were prepared—I have no note of it, I go from memory—a resolution was passed that they should meet at Perry's coffee-house, Church-street, Bethnal-green, on Friday, Aug. 11th, at eight o'clock—I went, and found no meeting—when I entered the coffee-room, I saw a person busy in packing up some chairs—he knew me, and said there was no meeting; that it was all up; that the police had been to Rose's house, and seized his papers—

the same person who told me that had been stationed on the Sunday as one of the telegraphs—the next meeting 1 attended was at the Orange Tree Orange-street, Red Lion-square, on Monday night, 14th—I went up stairs—I have not kept a memorandum of the persons who attended, but, to the best of my belief, there were twenty-five persons there—they were Mullins Brewster, Payne, Gurney, Fay, Ritchie, Scurry, Cuffey, and others, whose faces I knew, but not their names—a report was given in from some new delegates of the state of their localities, and of the number of fighting men the number of ball-cartridges that each delegate himself had prepared, and also the members of his locality—the number was 5000 fighting men of Chartists alone, and the number of cartridges was between 500 and 600—a question was asked about the number of Irish Confederates, and Mullins said they were about the same number as the Chartists—a resolution was proposed, I think by Mullins, and carried, that a deputation of two, Ritchie and Scurry, should wait on the North-western Railway engineers, to ascertain what were their feelings, and how far they were disposed to come over ad join the Chartists in their movement—they were to ascertain that if possible, and they were requested by no means to give them the least ides what was their purpose in going there to wait on them—it was mentioned that there was a dispute between the company and the men—I did not know of that till that evening—Mullins proposed, and it was resolved, that each delegate should select four or six men, or as many as he could get, men whom he could depend on, that would do anything and everything—some one asked what purpose they were for; and Cuffey said, to fire houses, railway premises, trains, or anything—Mullins then looked up as the gas. which was burning at the time, and said, "If I look up at the gas you will all know what I mean"—neither Ritchie or Scurry were present when that was resolved—they had left on their deputation, and the sum of 1s. 6d. had been voted to defray their expenses in the way of refreshments—I am not certain it was put to the vote, but I know 1s. 6d. was paid—they were not present when the last part of this occurred—Cuffey was secretary to the Ulterior Committee at this time—he stated so himself that evening—Brewster's conduct was not altogether becoming, and Cuffey said, "As secretary I have a right to rebuke you," or something to that effect—the meets; adjourned to the Lord Denman on the next evening—I went about eight or a little before, accompanied by Gurney—Payne, Mullins, Brewster, Cuffey, Dowling, Allnut, Fay, Gurney, Lacey, Ritchie, Page, Ferdinando, and others in all about forty were present—I saw some new faces, and I believe tier were delegates, and there were one or two that I knew were not delegates—Lacey stood with others near a window, and he began to tell us about the people in the country—he said that the men of Birmingham and Manchester, and I think he said Liverpool, were up and doing, or would be doing that night—that he had been watched all day by the police, and that on coming out of the door a boy came up to him and told him that he had been watched by the police for two or three hours, and he said he had given them the double and reached the place in safety—I had never seen him before—I asked him his name, and he said Lacey—about half an hour afterwards Brewster distri-buted coloured wristbands, exactly such a one as this (produced) was given to me—Mullins was present, and I also think he distributed some—Brewster—said they were for the delegates to wear on their left wrists that their members might know them—about half an hour after the distribution, as far as my memory furnishes me, Fay came in and brought a person of the name of

Donaldson, a member of our locality, who had no right to be there—I believe Fay had not been there before on that evening—Donaldson not being a delegate, had no right to be present—he went by the name of Donaldson—he bad not been long seated before they called for a pint of porter—some of the ulterior Committee, I believe Cuffey and Payne, came in shortly after—I had not seen them before—before Fay came in there was a question asked where the Committee should retire to, as the room up stairs was occupied by singing—that was after the distribution of colours—there was a talk of the Committee going somewhere else, and Lacey said, "There is a neighbouring coffee-shop, kept by a person I know; I will go and see if we can have the room"—he left for that purpose—he came back directly, and said he had engaged the room—Payne, Brewster, Mullins, Cuffey, and Lacey then went—they were away half or three-quarters of an hour—Lacey did not return with them—I did not see him again that evening—they returned after Fay had come into the room—Mullins acted as chairman and spokesman—Cuffey said to him, "Now, Mr. Chairman, you had better give the instructions"—Mullins then said, "Gentlemen, as you are aware the Committee have retired and come to certain resolutions and decisions; they have requested me to give you the following instructions. Our friend Mr. Lacey has informed us that the men of Birmingham and Manchester are up and doing, or will be doing to-night, and we have no reason to doubt the correctness of his statement, therefore, Gentlemen, to-morrow night you must come out to fight, and strike the blow: it is necessary you should speak out honestly and boldly, for there must be no flinching in the matter"—Cuffey said, "My time is short, my men are waiting; I take the western division; you had better put it round the room one by one, and let them answer yes or no"—Mullins then asked the man on ray right, "Will you come out to fight?"—he said, "Yes"—he-appealed to me, and I said, "Yes"—he then went round and put the question to every delegate till he came to Ferdinando, who stood up and spoke, and gave some reason why he would not come out—he said, "No"—the companion delegate to Allnutt, whose name I do not know, also answered, "No"—he did not give any reason—those were the only two exceptions—at this time all those I have named were present except Lacey—Mullins then said, "We shall take up four positions: Clerkenwell-green; the Tower Hamlets; Broadway, Westminster; and the Seven Dials"—Brewster was to take Clerkenwell-green, Payne the Tower Hamlets, and Mullins and Bassett the Broadway and Seven Dials, but which each was to take of the two I cannot say—Mullins then said, "Gentlemen, every delegate must assemble the members of his locality armed at their localities at eight o'clock to-morrow night precisely"—some delegate asked how they were to get there with their pikes—Mullins said, "I can only say get them there the best way you can, and every delegate must be with his members at their respective positions at twenty minutes past nine to a second"—he then went on to say that the different localities that were divided into different districts were to meet each of the four leaders, who were to have charge of the four districts—Brewster was to have Clerkenwell; and the City, Cripplegate, and Finsbury localities were to meet Brewster at Clerkenwell-green—there were different districts assigned to the four positions—Mullins, I believe, proposed Ritchie to be the man to superintend and direct the four or six men for firing that I have spoken of before—that was carried—I think Mullins mentioned firing that evening, because there were some new delegates came in, that did not understand—they were to meet at the Orange Tree, at five o'clock the next evening—the number of firing-men amounted to forty-six altogether, and they were to meet Ritchie at the Orange Tree—a question was asked how they

would know Ritchie without a pass-word, and some delegate proposed the words "Frost and Mitchell," as a pass-word—Allnutt proposed the word, "Justice" instead—that was carried; and when each man went and opened the door at the Orange Tree, Ritchie was to ask him, "Who do you want? what do you want?" and the answer was to be the word "Justice," and by that Ritchie would know them—I was asked among the others how many firing-men I could bring, and I said I had spoken to two, one of those was included in the number forty-six—Gurney said, "Oh, nonsense, you can find six or eight, I can find more."—I was rather struck with his taking me up so soon and I said, "I know best"—I knew I can only speak to these two men—I did not mention their names—the others were asked the same question—the delegates had put the colours in their pockets I suppose, there might have been colours given to those who came in subsequently, but I did not see any—I received one that night—I kept it till I gave it up to the party I was in communication with—I showed it to a person in authority about two hours after I left the Lord Denman—I remember attending a meeting on 20th July last, at the Black Last or Jack, I am not certain which, in sow street in Lincoln's-inn-square—I do not know the name of the street—it is a house that lies rather in the corner of some street—I can hardly describe it—I do not think I have been in the neighbourhood before or since—when I attended on the 20th, there were fourteen people present, Payne, Brewster, Rose, Mullins, Dowling, a delegate from Greenwich, myself, Battice, another confederate, Allnutt, and one or two strangers—I do not know the name of the delegate from Greenwich—his name was mentioned, but it has escaped my memory, it was his first time of attendance—the meeting commenced about nine o'clock in the evening, or it might be a little later—it lasted until twelve, or ten minutes past—it was in a longish room, with a very high ceiling ornamented at both ends with a sort of canopy—it had the appear-ance of a club-room—that was the first meeting of delegates I attended—I was asked for credentials, and produced the leaf of a book which Bezer had given me—when he gave it me he made a statement—I gave the leaf to Payne, who was chairman—he compared it with his book, and then said, "That will do "—there was no writing on it—it appeared to match with what was left in the book—at that meeting a Committee of five was appointed, to draw up five plans of action; Fay, Brewster, Rose, Mullins, and Dowling—I attended a meeting on 23rd July at Dennis's coffee-house, Great St. Andrew-street, Seven Dials—Dowling, Brewster, Rose, and Mullins, were there, and Payne accompanied me there—there was on that day a meeting of the Committee before the meeting of the general body of delegates—some plans were produced—this (produced) is the very identical plan that Mullins produced—Dowling said he thought he should not be able to undertake the management of the Seven Dials—the Seven Dials is shown in this plan—I afterwards saw Mullins put this plan into his pocket-book, and put it into his pocket—before that it was handed to three or four of them—I noticed there was something spoken about barricades—these lines where the crosses are were pointed out as barricades—Brewster said that to buss barricades you must build them halfway down the street—this was matter of conversation among us—there was no decision come to—a map of London was produced—they each had papers in their hands, but I did not see what they were—this is the one that was discussed and talked about—after the meeting of the Committee the delegates were admitted—there were ten persons present—Payne took the chair—he made a statement previous to the delegates coming in.—(MR. BALLANTINE
objected to this statement being



given it being made privately in the Committee, and not in the presence of the delegates. The
COURT
expressing a doubt of its admissibility, it teas not pursued.)—After the delegates came in, Mullins, who was vice-chairman, said he was sorry that the plans were not sufficiently matured for their inspection.

Cross-examined by
MR. BALLANTINE
Q. I believe you went by the name of Johnson at these meetings? A. I did—that was the only name I went by, but there was a person that called me Robinson one evening at Cartwright's—I said, "Call me anything you like; it is all the same"—that was the only night I went by the name of Robinson; that is the only name I have ever gone by, except my own—I am thirty-three years of age—I do not remember going by any other name; I cannot at this moment say positively—I never went by any name but Johnson among the Chartists—I have gone by the name of the Welch Novice, but not by any other surname—I joined this Association soon after April—I did not take notes of the meetings at Cartwright's locality—I made notes of the meeting of 20th July, about two days after, in this book—it did not exceed two days—I did not take those notes by the desire of anybody; I took them of my own accord—I did not show them to anybody after I had taken them; I am certain about that—I do not think I took notes of the meeting on 23rd; I cannot remember—I have not destroyed any of the notes I made—I know these notes were taken either the next day after the meeting or the day after—these are the only notes I took (handing them to the Counsel)—all I put down on July 23rd was the names of the persons present—what I have stated is partly from recollection and partly from the book—what is down I put down, and I have remembered the rest—I did not put it all down at the same time—the memorandum of 23rd July was all put down at the same time, and with the same pen—sometimes I wrote it at different periods of the same day—I may have put down a part on 23rd, and forgotten a part, and put that down next day—that was not the case on each of the occasions; it may have happened on other occasions—I communicated to the police from time to time what was going on—I never showed them my notes; they never asked me—I never showed my notes till I went before some of the authorities—I think that was before the prisoners were taken—I do not remember showing my notes to any one as early as 5th Aug.; I will not swear I did not—I have never altered them since they have been shown to the authorities; I forget when they were shown to the authorities—by the authorities I do not mean the Magistrate, but another party; I am not bound to state his name—I did not show that person my notes—I joined this Asso ciation for the purpose of gaining information and giving information to the authorities—I am a carpenter—I have always had plenty of work to do—I make about 27s. a week—I have a wife and family, and have a little property coming in—I was not driven by poverty to join these people; I did it from a desire to communicate their proceedings—I did not communicate that desire to anybody before I joined them—I entered of my own accord—I was not desirous of having the name of "spy," but I was determined to acquaint the authorities with what was going on—I went in for that purpose; not to betray them, but to communicate what was going on—I do not like the word "betray" any more than I do the word "spy"—I considered that there were parties there that were not scrupulous of what they would do—I did it for the public benefit, and nothing else—I did it for the good of my country—I did not expect to get anything by it; I was not in a position to be necessitated—I have received 1l. a week since I have been obliged to be kept out of the way from personal danger—there is nothing else to come; I do not expect a farthing—it is not as good as carpentering—I have been a carpenter

for the last eleven years—before that I was a bed-pillar carver—I have been connected with the turf, and been rather a sporting man, as a pedestrian—it was then I was called the Welch Novice—I am a descendant of Welchmen—I ran a race; I did not lose it or win it—I did not get persons to back me—I went out for my own amusement to the place, and I was asked to run to amuse the party; it was merely for a draw to a public-house—that was not the only sporting matter in which I have been concerned—it was announced in the paper by a party who I knew nothing of, that there was to be a celebrated runner—I went there out of curiosity; it was only done to draw custom to the house—I professed then to be a bit of a runner, and I profess to be so now—I was not a celebrated runner—I was also at Wimbledon once for the same purpose—the other was at Hounslow—I have also run at Croydon, still as the Welch Novice—that was merely for a day's amusement, and for which I was well remunerated—I believe those are all the sporting matters in which I have been engaged—I know what thimble-rig means—I was never in that line; I swear that—I was never with a thimble-rig table at races; I have looked on at a table—I do not exactly know what a decoy is—I have played at a table—I neither won nor lost—I was paid so much a day for playing at the table; it was not at a thimble-rig table, but a marquee-table, where they play with balls—I expected you would ask me about this, and I am willing to state everything, and all I know of the affair—that was the only time I was ever at such a place—I received 30s., and it was on account of my master that I went there—it was to stand at the table, take the money, and pretend to bet—I was young, and quite ignorant of the nature of these proceedings—it was just before I was out of my time; I was nearly twenty-one—I went more for a holiday—my master had a relation named Durdon, and my master's brother was in the habit of attending the races with Durdon, and my master said to me, "Tom, how would you like a holiday?"—I said, "Very well, master"—he said, "Well, I can get you one if you like to go, you must not let the old man know anything of it; if you like to go with Durdon to the races, you can, and you shall be paid 30s. for your time, and your expenses," and with that I went with my master's brother, who was a door-keeper; and that was the only time in my life that I ever did anything of the sort—I knew that I was not in reality betting—I did not consider myself a cheat—of course I was pretending to bet, in order to deceive people—I do not deny that—I never swindled persons—I never had a farthing—I do not know who did—I do not know whether there was any money won or lost—I swear that—I do not think I was in there the whole three days—it was a three day's race—it was at Ascot races—I kept running in and out of the marquee to see the races more than to stop there, and there was a great disturbance with one of the parties about my going out—I was never at any other rovlette-table than that—I never played at a thimble-rig- table, and never associated with those sort of men—I know Richard Pennell—I never told him that I had walked a match against Townsend, the pedertrian, and sold the parties who backed me, because I could get more money on the other side—I never walked for any money, I am certain of that, merely to draw custom to the house—I was once a witness at this Court, about eight years ago, in the case of a party for picking a gentleman's pocket.—I happened to see it—I never said to any one on that occasion, that I Was frightened about being asked about my thimble-rigging—my father is dead—I have been in the employment of my brother-in-law, Mr. Smith—I have only been engaged a week for another party within the last eleven years—Smith keeps many men—I do not think those men knew that 1 was at all connected with this matter—I never persuaded a man to join it—they are quite capable

of joining it without my persuasion—James Paris is Mr. Smith's foreman—I never told him that I was employed by thimble-rig men, nor anything of the kind, nor that I was employed by the police against the thieves—I never said to him that I had been a witness at the Old Bailey, and was afraid the Counsel would question me about having communication with a thimble-rig man, and I would never appear again—I have occasionally talked to Paris about religions natters—I never expressed my entire unbelief in a God, or in the Scriptures, or in our Saviour, nor anything of the kind; I always have believed, and do believe now—I told Paris that it was likely he would hear something remarkable—I do not think I told him I expected there would be a rising—he has not taxed me directly with being a spy—he has said something like it—I thought that he threw out hints, but I took no further notice of it—I once got about 1lb. of lead from Mr. Smith, my brother-in-law—that was for the purpose of casting bullets for Gurney our warden—he had asked me on several occasions for bullets—he was casting them himself, and made cartridges himself—I got the lead because he wanted to get as many made as possible for him to take care of for the day of rising—I cast the bullets at my own house—one of my boys, about ten years old, was present—he did not know what purpose I had the bullets for—he asked what I was doing them for, and, of course, I made him no answer—I took care of the bullets after I had cast them, and gave them to Gurney—I think those were the only bullets I cast—I received 4s. from our locality for the purpose of buying cartridge-paper and powder, and Gurney had received 5s. 8d. for that purpose on a previous occasion—he did not employ me to get that—the 4s. worth is all that I have bought—I am not aware that I had any nickname among my fellow-shopmen—I do not remember that I was called "Lying Tom"—I should say it was not likely—I never heard it—I never had it put to my face—if they did call me so, it was unknown to me—this is the first I have heard of it—if they had said such a thing to my face I should have resented it, and that they knew well enough—a person named Thomas Osborne worked for Smith—I never told him that there was to be a Chartist rising, and never urged him to join me; or others of the men in his presence—I do not remember doing such a thing—I will not swear I have not—I may have done it and forgotten it—I cannot remember pointing out to Osborne a man who would make him a pike—I remember being at a meeting at Birdcage-walk, and a person named Hook was there, and there was a person there who was a blacksmith and I. think I did speak about such a thing then—I think I have some recollection of pointing out to Osborne a man that would make him a pike—I believe I did—I do not know what the pike was to be for—I will explain how it was—there was a meeting at Birdcage walk one Sunday morning, and Osborne came up to look on out of curiosity, and he entered into conversation about Pennell having slandered his character, and what a disturbance Pennell bad caused in the Carpenter's Society—we fell into conversation on Chartism, and Hook spoke to this blacksmith to make a pike for him, and I believe I did mention, "If you want such a thing there is a blacksmith can make it"—that was bow it took place—I think it was to Osborne I said this, but I am not certain—I do not know whether he meant to have one, or if he had one what he would do with it—I had no idea.

COURT. Q. What made you imagine that Osborne wanted one? A. Why the conversation came up about one thing or another, and Osborne began his joking and talking about his being a Chartist, or something of that sort, and I dare say I did say that—I do not deny it.

MR. BALLANTINE. Q. Do you know Alfred Carr? A. I do—I never old him if I could get a chance in a crowd I would rip the police's

b----guts up with a chisel, nothing of the kind—Carr was in my brother-in-law's service about six years ago—I believe my father was alive at that time—Carr caused great disturbance in our house through his conduct my father and I have had one or two quarrels; I never struck him, I pushed him—he came and struck me a violent blow, and I was so hurt in my feelings that I of course turned round and put my hand on his collar and struggled with him to kepp him away from me—I never pushed him down—I did not say to him, "You old b----, I will murder you"—no such words ever cars out of my lips—I struggled with him—my brother-in-law came and separated us—my father was about sixty-two or sixty-three at that time—he was a strong, able-bodied man—he died about two years and a half after that—I had an uncle; I had had quarrels with him, I have been bound over to keep the peace towards him—I may have spoken to Pennell about my father—I never told him that I hoped my father's soul was in hell, nor anything of lit kind—I do not think I have ever spoken to Pennell about the Government—he is a man that is well known, he has caused a great deal of disturbance in the shop from time to time—he is not in the shop now—my brother-in-law discharged him—I never told Pennell that the Government was a weak and b----y Government, and I would send Lord John Russell and Sir George Grey to the devil in a short time—I never said anything of that kind to him about a fortnight before 10th April—I do not think I saw him anything near that time—I do not believe I have seen him above twice for this six or seven months—he has been discharged a long time—the only time I can remember was, meeting him one night in Pitfield-street, as I was going home—I swear I did not meet him about ten minutes past six one morning, about a for night before 10th April—I do not believe I did, I cannot swear it—I did not stop him, and ask him if he was a member of the Chartists—I do not believe I ever asked him such a question; if I did, it was while he was in mv brother-in-law's service, not since—he never asked me to propose him as a member, nor did I tell him that delegates would be chosen in about a fortnight, to agitate the country—I never told him that I should get from 2l. to 3l. a week, which would be far better than working at Smith's—I never asked him to go to Cartwright's—he did not say that the Chartists would never get the Charter in the way they were going on—I did not say to him, "Look at the Queen, with her hundreds of thousands a year, spending in waste and idleness, while we are obliged to work from morning to night to get a mouthful of bread"—I never spoke to him about the Queen—I may have done so when we were at work, six or seven years ago—I do not believe I ever said such a thing—I never said I would blow her and the b----y foreigner to hell—I never used such words to any person whatever, nor any expressions of that kind—I never asked him to call at my bouse on the Sunday morning, and I would show him materials sufficient to blow London to hell in half an hour—I never saw him to ask him such a question—I do not remember showing him any printed bill—I know James Bennett, a shoemaker, living at Leonard-square, Shoreditch—I do not think I saw him two or three days or a week before 10th April; I might, it is very likely I did; I cannot say whether it was two or three days, it might have been a fortnight before—he was in the habit of mending shoes for me and my children, and very likely I may have seen him about: job to do to my shoes—I do not remember speaking to him about 10th April—I was not intimate with him, and never knew he was a Chartist until 10th April—all I knew of him was, that he used to mend my shoes and my children's—I do not think I asked him what he intended to do on 10th April—I cannot swear I did not—I do not think he told me he was going to Kennington

Common—I do not believe I asked him if he intended to go armed—I will not swear I did not—I do not remember his replying, "Certainly not"—I cannot swear he did not—my belief is, that no such conversation at all passed—I think I saw him here on Saturday—I swear I did not say to him, "You are a b----y fool if you do not, as I shall go armed"—I am quite certain of that—I swear that no words of the kind passed—to the best of my belief, I never had a word with the man about going armed—I believe I had said to him, that I had been making hand-grenades that would go halfway through an inch board; that was one night, coming from a meeting in Holborn—I cannot remember what night it was—it was not since these meetings have taken place—it was not so recently as Aug.—it might have been between May and June, but I do not know; you confuse me rather in going from one thing to another; I will answer any question as far as my memory will enable me—I do not think it was before 10th April; I cannot say it was not, I do not know when it was—I had not been making hand-grenades—it came up in conversation between Watson and him—Watson had a brass-barrelled short gun with him, and it came up in conversation about grenades, and the ink-bottles, and such like; and I remember speaking to him about it, but 1 never had such a thing, or made such a thing—I said so for talking sake—I do not often indulge myself in that way—he was telling me many things that I considered were stupid and untrue, and I thought I would do the same—it was merely pastime—I did not tell him how they were made, he knew that—I believe I did say how I made them; it was all a lie—I was never called "Lying Tom" to my face—I never made a hand-grenade in my life—I told Bennett that I made them by putting powder into a small ink-bottle, and putting a sort of fizgig gap to it—I never filled bottles with stout nails, and I do not think I ever said so—I am sure I did not—I did not say that anything was to be done with these hand-grenades—I dare say we were all busy talking about their being thrown among the police, I think it was so—I dare say I said to Bennett that a blacking-bottle was as good as anything, half-filled with powder, and well mixed with stout nails—there were many things said by us all in the course of conversation—I do not think I said that by lighting the fusee, and throwing it among the police, it would break the b----'s legs—I went to Kennington-common on 10th April—it was the first meeting I was ever at in my life—I did not go armed, I swear that—I had nothing with me whatever—I do not remember meeting Bennett in Chiswell-street, about a week after the conversation I have referred to—I do not remember meeting him at all in Chiswell-street, or meeting him at all shortly after that conversation—I never told him that I had got ten men, and that with four or five more I could easily take the Artillery-ground—I never told him any such thing—I never told him that I had prepared a plan, or said anything to him about a plan or map, nothing of the kind; nor that my men knew how to spike the artillery—I have seen Bennett at Cartwright's—I do not know a person named John Westmoreland, a master-lor, of 75, Watling-street—I do not know Thomas Antill—(Antill was here called in)—I know that man well, but I do not know his name—he is not a member of our locality—I do not remember asking him whether he had seen the Northern Star; I will not swear I did not—I do not recollect saying to him that O'Connor was a b——coward, for he recommended peaceable means, and that the National Assembly should be postponed—I will not swear I did not; I might have said it, I do not think I did—I do not remember Antill asking me what I meant by that, nor do I remember asking him whether he was prepared—I never recognized him as a member, and

never knew his name—I have seen him in and out of Cartwright's, and that is all—I did not tell him to procure arms as soon as possible, and if all working men were prepared as I was they would soon upset the b----Government—I swear no such words were ever uttered by me to him—I never spoke to him above twice—I never said anything to him about the b----Government—I never told him, if he wanted gunpowder, I would supply him with it; nor did he say he was a peaceable and quiet man, and would have nothing to do with it—I never had any such conversation with him—he was turned out of one of our meetings at Cartwright's locality—the first time I ever spoke to him was when he impudently came into the secret meeting there, and he said, "Why am I not allowed to be here? I have a much right as that man," pointing to another individual; and there was great confusion at the time, and astonishment at his impudence, in wanting to she there, without being a member of the locality—he came into the secret meeting—anybody could come in, if they liked to have the impudence to come, through Cartwright's back place—he was a man that had impudence enough to come, and he was turned out by force; in fact, it was with some difficulty they got him down stairs—that was not in April—if you will lend me my book I will give you the date—I think I can refer to the very meeting (referring to his book); it was on Sunday afternoon, 30th July—I swear 1 had no such conversation with him in April as you have referred to—I do not know George Thurston by name—there are many persons whose faces I know, but not their names—I do not know this, (looking at a plan); I never saw it before, it is not my drawing—I do not know Westmoreland—I never gave such a thing as this to anybody, and never drew a thing like it—I have drawn plans, to ascertain what the plans were which I heard of among the different members of the locality—I heard that there was a secret meeting sitting, and that there was a plan they were going to operate upon, and I drew out a plan for the purpose of ascertaining whether there was plan of the kind—I believe that was about June or July—I drew a plan of one circle—I had heard that there were to be four or five mock meetings and sham demonstrations at Bishop Bonner's-fields; and, hearing of that, and also that there was to be an assassination of the police in the night, I was determined to try and find out what this secret meeting was, and what plan it was they had got in operation—that was why I drew the plan—I showed it to person named Mayne, and tore it up by his direction—he said, "I would not have you get yourself into danger, you had better tear it up"—he is a person who is frequently at Cartwright's—it was not before the affair in Bishop Bonner's-fields that I showed it him; that was the only one, and that I showed to three or four at Cartwright's, on purpose to ascertain what was going on—I do not remember saying to anybody that I should want him, and that he must bring something with him—I had a pair of pistols—I did have them on 13th Aug.—I exchanged them for another pair in Holborn, or the Strand, and paid 2s. 6d., I forget when—(George Thurslon was here called in)—I do not know that man by name, I know him by sight—I have no recollection of asking him if he was a Chartist—I will not swear I did not—I do not think I ever offered to sell him a pair of pistols for 6s.—I will not swear I did not—I swear I did not offer to do so on 13th Aug.—I do not believe I offered to do so some time in Aug.—I will not swear I did not—I swear not offer them to him after 13th Aug., because I think I had not had then for two months before that time—I did not offer that if he would buy the pistols, I would give him half-a-pound of powder into the bargain—I never offered him any powder, or any one; and never gave or offered any one any

powder, except Gurney—I was never a member of the Wat Tyler Club—I have heard of it, but do not know where it exists—I never attended any of their meetings—I do not know where it is held—I know a public-house at Hoxton—I am not a member of any club held there—I have attended meetings there—it is a beer-shop—I do not know the sign—I have only attended one meeting there that I remember—it was of Chartists—I do not know when it was—it was some time ago—I believe it was after April—I cannot say whether it was May or June—I do not know Henry Green, a working-man—I recollect the meeting at Bonner's-fields—I cannot say whether it was on that day that I attended the meeting at the public-house at Hoxton—I have attended perhaps two or three meetings at Bonner's-fields—I cannot say whether I attended one on Sunday, 23rd April—I know Dennis Dwaine by being at Cartwright's—I never was intimate with him—I do not think I said of him that he was a b----Government spy—I do not think I ever uttered such words, I cannot swear I did not—I do not believe I ever said he was a b----Government spy, a milk-and-water moral-force b----, and ought to be kicked out—the man gave me offence—I do not believe I ever used such words of him—I will not swear anything of the kind, I believe I did not—I was not likely to use such words—my memory is Dot sufficient, I may forget it—it may have come out of my mouth, but it is not likely, I do not think it was uttered by me—there were extraordinary characters at Cartwright's—it is a complete den of infamy, and the characters there would surprise any moral man—I noticed them with astonishment, from my being a moral man—(Westmoreland was here called in)—I knew that man in that locality—I did not give him this plan—I have talked to him about a plan—I showed him the plan which I tore up—it was not the same size and shape as this—it was a large plan—I swear I did not sketch this very plan in Westmoreland's presence—I never saw it till you produced it—I have not seen a plan about the same size and shape—I do not know what it means, I have no idea—it is done with black lead pencil—I have seen nothing like it—I can hardly recollect now what mine was a plan of—it was a circle with a ring in it—nothing was in the ring—it was not filled up at all, only some dots which were to represent people standing in the circle—I do not know what points they were to stand at, it was merely a rough thing sketched by myself, just the idea which presented itself to my mind, because I heard they had got plans and were going to have meetings, and I drew the plan just to ascertain what their plans were—mine was only a piece of paper just to see if there were any plans in preparation—the dots in the centre were not to represent Chartists particularly, or policemen, they were merely people in a circle—it was for no other purpose—I did not fill up the whole circle with dots, only just a few—there was nothing written on it—lean hardly recollect whether any lines, except the circular line, were drawn on it—it was torn up—I have given as far as I am able about it—I do not remember any lines, my memory is so bad—I did not show Westmoreland the large plan and take a pencil and sketch this small one from it—I do not remember seeing any lines at all on my large plan, there were no lines at all—I know John Collins—he is a very noisy and desperate character in the locality—he does not want much encouragement to go on—I have not informed against him—I did not tap him on the shoulder one day and tell him there was a grand meeting, and no one was to attend but those prepared to fight for their rights—I do not remember saying to him in my life, "Are you coming up stairs to-night? there is a grand meeting, and no one is to come but those prepared to fight

for their rights"—I will not swear such words were not uttered by me—I do not recollect saying to him, "Are you prepared," or his answering, "I do not know what you mean, Mr. Johnson"—I might have said such words—I swear I never said to him, "I have a very handsome dagger, which I will make you a present of, to keep against you want it"—I am sure of thatI never had a dagger, and never said I had one—I never said, "If you and others will join me, I will lead you, and show you the way to over throw the b----Government"—I saw him on 16th Aug. outside Cartwright's—I did not see him inside—I do not know whether he was drinking a cup of tea—he was standing on the pavement—I did not say to him, "Don't be in a burry to go away from here to-night"—I swear that—he did go away—I did not ask him to stop—he did not say, "I am in no more hurry to-night than any other night"—I said, "Is there to be a meeting to-night up stairs? there are a great many strangers round," and he said, "No, I do not think there is"—I of course knew that at eight o'clock the members of the locality were to be assembled—I merely asked Collins that out of curiosity, on the spur of the moment—I did not want to know—I did not ask anybody else—I may know a person named George Medlock—(he teas here called in)—I knot his face—I may have seen him at Cartwright's on Monday, 14th Aug.; I cannot recollect—I have no recollection of saying to him, "Ain't you going up stairs?" nor of his replying, "No, I believe the room is engaged by the cigar-makers for a trade meeting"—such a thing might have passed—I forget whether the room was engaged for such a purpose on 14th Aug.—I do not think I went up, saying to Medlock, "I will soon have them out"—I do not recollect seeing or speaking to the man at all that night—I will not swear I did not say so—I do not recollect returning and saying, "I will serve out those moral force b----rs; there is Gill and another moral force b—"—I do not think such words were ever uttered by me to that chap—I will not swear I did not say so—I may have said it, and forgotten it—I know Gill—I was at Cartwright's on the 14th; Fay and I went there together—our business was when we left the Orange Tree meeting to make arrangements for the men for firing, and we went into Cartwright's back-place—Gill, Donaldson, Carter, and two or three others were there, and I was ties accused of being a spy—Carter asked me how it was that I went by the name of Johnson, and not by my right name, Powell—Gill said, "I have looked at the books, and I don't see either the name of Johnson, Robinson, Powell; it is very strange; you should clear this matter up"—there was some talk between us, and it was arranged that Fay and Donaldson should inqnire into where I lived, and what was my right name, and be satisfied upon it—I believe that was all that transpired that evening, and I went home shortly after—I do not know who it was that charged me with being a spy—I did not admit it—I said, "If you have any reason to doubt that I am not what I am, go and make inquiry at my place of work; my real name is Powell, but I have gone by the name of Johnson, so that my brother-in-law and friends should not know that I have entered the Chartists at all"—I do not know Henry Green by sight; I know him by name—I know Bryant—I was standing outside Cartwright's early on Wednesday evening, 16th Aug.—I do not know that Bryant saw me there, and asked what was the matter—I never saw Bryant there at all that night, to my recollection; I am sure I did not—I did not say to him, "Don't take any notice of me; I think it is a botched job by these milk and water b----s"—I do not recollect savin; such words—I will not swear I did not—I never saw Briant there that

evening—I do not remember saying to anybody, "We expect to have a turn out to-night," or saying that a signal rocket was to be fired between nine and ten o'clock, and the people were to be turned out—I do not believe I mentioned such a thing as the word rocket, or anything that night, for I was very much alarmed for my own safety—I will not swear I did not say so—I do not think I said, "These bl—st—d milk and water b----s must have sold the job, and I think the delegates must have been nailed in Orange-street"—I do not think I uttered any such words to any living being, because I was desirons of screening my person from being seen as much as possible—it is not likely I should say so—I do not remember it—I will not swear I did not—I may have said it, and forgotten it—I know a man named Briant," who keeps a coffee-house—I think I walked up Chiswell-street and into Finsbury-stjuare on the night of 16th Aug., between ten and eleven, with a person, and 1 believe it was the man I spoke to on the subject of firing—I do not know Ms name—I showed him sixty-eight ball-cartridges—I did not say to him that I bad 200 fire-balls to throw into people's houses—I believe I produced. a small tin box from my pocket—I am not quite sure—there were not some small paper parcels in it—they were percussion caps—I have them at home now—I did not tell him they were band-grenades, and that I had 200 more of them—I pulled out a pistol, and showed it him—I had a sword in my coat-pocket, at the side—I showed him the handle of it—I did not pull it out—I might have said, "You see I am well prepared for them; are you?"—I do not believe I did—he wanted to have them from me, to load them—I had this pistol and sword by me for the purposes of safety, and the cartridges too—I put the cartridges into my pocket, so that nobody should see them or get hold of them, and the sword I carried about with me for my own-safety, to defend myself if I was attacked, because I suspected I was found out—I carried the pistol in my pocket—it was not loaded—I carried that to take care of it—I showed them to this man merely for pastime, nothing else—I did not know that the men were then at tie Orange Tree—I knew that they were betrayed—this man was to have been at the Orange Tree for firing, but he would not go—that bad been arranged on the night previous—I did not want him to go—I had given him the orders the night previous to go—I knew that the men were taken when I was with him—I know Daniel Byrne—(he was here called in)—I suppose he is a working man—I have heard that he is something in the coach way—I do not think I ever showed him any pistols; I did not show fan any on 10th April—I do not think he has ever seen any pistols belonging to me—I do not believe I ever showed him any pistols; I will not swear I did not—I will swear I did not do so on 10th April, before going to the Ken-nington-common meeting, or a weapon of any kind—I do not believe I did at any time; I will not swear I did not—I did not generally carry cartridges about me—I do not think I ever did, unless I carried them to give to Gurney—they were cartridges made by Gurney, and given to me to fill with powder—they were the only cartridges I ever had in my possession—I will swear I. never said to Daniel Byrne, and to others in his hearing, that I wished the people would assassinate the police and fire the houses; I do not remember such words being used—I will swear I never said any such thing to him—I do not believe I said it to anybody; I will not swear I did not—I do not think I ever said that I wished the people would assassinate the police—I swear I have not said it a dozen times, or half a dozen—I do not believe I have said it three times—I might have said it, but I do not think I did—I

was always rather as a friend to the police, and I believe that was generally known—it is possible I might have said it to Byrne, but I feel quite sure I never did; it was not likely I should—I was at a meeting at the Milton-street Theatre—I did not, some time before that, show Byrne a pair of pistols—I never showed him a pair of pistols in my life; I swear that, nor yet one pistol I think; I will not swear I did not—I never said to him that I wished to see all the police assassinated, and to have some good fires in London—I never said any such words in my life, nor did I say, showing the pistols, "These are the things that will do for them;" nothing of the kind—I do not believe such words, or that any conversation passed with him or in his presence; I will not swear it did not—I know a man named Carter—I do not remember saying to him that I should want four desperate men, who would do any kind of work; yes, I think I did; it was at the meeting in the back-room, at Cartwright's, on the Monday night, if that was the time I was charged with being a spy—I will not swear it, but I think I did—that was the order I had given to me at the Orange Tree meeting, to speak on the subject of firing—I think I did say it—Carter may have said, "You won't have me"—I do not believe he did; I never asked him—it was a sort of order given to me, and I was obliged to tell those who were assembled in the room—Fay was present—it was spoken privately among ourselves, among the council—I do not remember showing Carter a plan of London; I will not swear I did not—if I showed him any plan it was that plan of the circle and the small circle in the middle—I never showed him a plan of London; I might have showed him that small plan for the purpose of ascertaining who the parties were that were drawing up some plans—I cannot recollect when I showed it him—it was not on 16th Aug., or 15th, or 14th—I do not think it was any time in Aug.—I do not know a person named Goodfellow, a tailor—I did not meet a young man on 14th Aug., and tell him that I was going to Australia and wanted an outfit—(Goodfellow was here called in)—I never saw that man before in my life—I did not tell him that I was going to Australia; that I wanted an outfit, and that he was to come to the Orange Tree on Wednesday, 16th; nor did I give him a half-crown as earnest money; nothing of the kind occurred—I never had any such conversation with anybody—(a small piece of wood, with a nail in it, was here shown to the witness) I have seen such a thing as this, of my own making—I expected this would be produced—I made one like it, and lent it to a person named Mayne—this appears to be the same—I will explain how it was—at a meeting at Cartwright's Brewster showed two articles of this description, and I suspecting that some such articles were being made at Cartwright's, made one—those that Brewster produced were twice as large as this—I asked who made them, and Brewster told me he made them himself, and told me they were made for the purpose of crippling the cavalry—I asked him to show me the action of then—he showed me the action by throwing them on the floor—there is apiece of lead in them, which, if thrown on the ground, will always cause the point to be presented upwards—I have a similar thing in my pocket, which I wish particularly to produce (producing it)—this was lent by me to Mayne, and he never returned it—I made this last one within the last two months, since the other has been kept away and not returned to me—it is made on a similar plan, expecting that this would be produced, and it is produced—I swear positively those are the only two I made—I made them in order to ascertain whether they were making such things at Cartwright's—I showed it to several persons at Cartwright's, and have thrown it on the ground and on the table.


COURT. Q. How could your exhibiting that at Cartwright's enable you to discover whether they were making them or not? A. Because I expected there would be some produced like that.

MR. BALLANTINE. Q. You did it for a trap then? A. I did it to detect tie parties, if I possibly could, who were making these sort of things, to find out who they were—I did it knowing the solemn position I placed myself in—I do not think I ever said, "These are the things to throw among the troops of the b----Government"—I do not think the word b----was used at all—I do not believe I said "the troops of the Government," or "the mops of the Queen"—I might have said, "They would do to throw among tie troops," I do not say I did say so—I said that I had a large quantity at home—that was false—I wish to speak the truth now, and confess what I have done—I dare say I told several falsehoods in the course of these proceedings—Gurney is in custody; I went to him in his cell, one of the turnkeys let me in—I believe I said to Gurney, that if he would inform it would be better for his wife and children—I believe I did say those words—I am not exactly positive, I am rather confused with so many questions—I cannot say whether any policemen were waiting outside—there were lots of police-nea in the yard—I did not, as I came out of Gurney's cell, say to a police-P nan, "It is no go," or "It won't do"—nothing of the kind—I never spoke to say policeman coming out—I do not believe I said so to the turnkey or to anybody—I believe I said to Gurney that he, his wife, and family would all be made comfortable for their lives if he would inform, and I told him to speak the truth, all he knew about it—I had no authority whatever for saying that—it was untrue—it was done for him to state all he knew, and for him to tell me what he knew of it—I did not mean to get all I could out of him, and then tell it—I did not tell all that he said to me—I wanted him to tell all he knew about it, because I thought he would be telling the truth and getting himself out of a scrape—I cannot tell what made me think so—I was not sent in—I was not requested to go—the turnkey let me in—I told him what it was for; that I thought he would confess, and tell all about it—I do not think that 1 said when I came out that it was no go, but I will not swear—it—Gurney was put into a separate cell for me to speak to him—he was by himself when I saw him.

Q. Have you been in England all your life? A. Except about three months, about thirteen years ago—I went over with a friend, named Rodder, to New York, and stayed there I think about a month—I was certainly not away four months altogether—my father was alive at that time—I did not know that he had any money at the Savings' Bank—there was no charge against me about that before I went to America—I was married at that time—I did not take my wife—I had but one child—I only let two or three persons know that I was going—my father never made any complaint of some money having been taken out of the Savings' Bank—there was money of my own, which I drew out of the Funds—it was in my own name, and I used my own name to get it out—I signed nobody else's name—it was money that had been given me by my father, and put into the Stock-broker's hands in my name—I went to America a few days after I drew the money out—my father was very cross that I left my wife—when I came back I gave what money I had into my father's hands to take care of—I got back every farthing of it from him—his name was Howell Powell.

MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL. Q. You say this was about thirteen years ago? A. I think so—I think I had been married about eighteen months at that

time—there had been some family differences, and it prayed upon my spirits.—I went wholly and solely to recruit my health—at the time I met Collins at Cartwright's, on the evening of the 16th, I knew that the parties at the Orange Tree had been apprehended—the people were talking about it all over the neighbourhood—I have not seen Carter here to-day—he did live in Moneyer-street—I have not seen Gill here—he is a shoemaker—I do not consider him a moral force Chartist—Fay was present when I said I should want four men or more to fire the town—Carter lived at 32, Moneyer-street East-road, Hoxton; and Donaldson lodged with him—Carter is a Chartist-. Owen Jones was present at that time; he is a tailor, and lives at 5, Hoare-lane—I cannot remember whether it was on 23rd April that I pointed out to Osborne a man who would make a pike—it was most likely that there was a meeting on 23rd April at Birdcage-walk, but I cannot remember.

I know Mr. Lacey—I remember the police searching my house—I will not be certain whether Lacey was there the day before that—he has frequently called—he did not come for anything particular—some persons came with him, I do not know how many—they had four cups of coffee—they went up stairs into the public coffee-room—it was about eight o'clock in the evening—they stayed about a quarter or half an hour, tin then left—I do not think Lacey left with them, but I will not be positive—I saw him sitting down in the room down stairs—I cannot say how long is stayed after the others left—it might be half an hour, or longer—I cannot say whether this was on the day before my house was searched—it might be two or three days before—I really do not know—it was on a Tuesday, I believe—Lacey did not come to our house on the following morning that I know of—I did not give him some pistols out of a cupboard in my house that day—I never had any pistols in my house—I did not put them into a basket for him—there were three pistols in the house, but Mr. Lacey never had any—they were my sister-in-law's—her name is Simmons—I took them to her a long-time ago, before Lacey and his party came—I do not know whether Lacey came on the Wednesday or not—he was so frequently in the habit of coming, that I did not take notice—there were not three powder-flasks there—there was only one, and that is there now—I dare say the policemen saw it when they searched the house—it is an old one belonging to my sister-in-law—the lot was not sold for 10s. 6d.—I told several persons that she wanted to sell them, as they were no good to her, but she did not sell them—I to three or four constables' staves at my house—a young man who lodged with me had them to paint for a gentleman named Alsop two or three months ago—he left them there, and they are there now—they were for special constables—my sister-in-law lives in Church-street, Bermondsey—she is a widow—her husband has been dead above two years.

Cross-examined by
MR. BALLANTINE
Q. What was her husband? A. He once had belonged to a ship, and then worked at the London Docks as a lumper—he bought the pistols when he was on board ship, and that was how my sister-in-law became possessed of them—I know she has had them for ten or twelve years.

Nicholas Pearce, superintendent of police, and James Dowsitt, gate the same evidence as in Dowling's case (see pages 747—8.)





JOSEPH THOMPSON
 (being re-examined, produced the articles found by him at Ritchie's, as in page 748.)

Cross-examined by
MR. BALLANTINE
Q. I believe you searched Cuffeys

garret? A. Yes—I have not produced all I found there—I have some papers, but they are quite irrelevant—they are here somewhere—I have not judged of their relevancy—I have not kept them back—the landlord of Ritchie's room came in while I was searching it—it was the front kitchen—I believe he did not occupy any other part of the premises—the landlady is here—somebody showed us the room, and the landlord came down afterwards—I think it was about half-past six o'clock in the evening of the 16th that I searched, after he had been apprehended, at the Orange Tree—I did not know Powell at that time—I knew nothing of him—the landlord took up a bottle that was there—it was not on a little shelf near the powder-flask—I believe it was on the sideboard, but I will not be positive—it was where all the things were, standing on a shelf by the cupboard—I found that the first time I searched—I am sure of that—I went again next morning, and found some tow and the little band that has been produced—it laid among some rags—I am sure I did not find the bottle the next day.

MR. CLARKSON. Q. The bottle contained the powder, and that you brought away when you first went? A. Yes.

COURT. Q. What did you find next morning? A. That band, a piece of paper and one of these small books, apparently the same that the cartridges are made of—it is not cut—I found the tri-coloured band against the window where he slept, amongst some old rags and a filthy flannel shirt covered with termin—I looked at it over night, but next morning 1 examined it more minutely—it was a very dirty, miserable place.

Samuel Bohlin, Anthony Rutt, William Cockerill, Samuel Harris, Robert Smith, Henry Baker, John Collins, Thomas Rogers, and Edward Kendall, repeated the evidence given by than on Bowling's trial. (See pages 748, 9.)





THOMAS SLAYMAKER
 (policeman, L 124.) I went to the Angel, in Webber-street, with the superintendent, and the rest of the police—I searched George Cox, and found this card in his coat-pocket—(this certified the entrance of George Cox as a member of the National Charter Association on 3rd April, 1848.)





JOHN HAYNES
 (police-inspector), gate the same evidence as in page 749, and produced the books and papers found at Lacey"s, from which several extracts we read referring to the bye-laws and regulations of the Wallace Brigade branch of the Chartist Association; also a bill printed by Austin, of Strutton Ground, announcing a Sunday evening lecture at the Wallace Brigade branch, held at the Charter Coffee-house, Strutton Ground; with blanks for the name of toe lecturer, and the subject of the lecture; some ladies' visiting-cards cut in halves and sealed—a list of candidates for the Central Election Committee among were the names of Dr. M'Douall, Ernest Jones, Samuel Kydd, Feargus O'Connor, Vernon, Sharpe, Shaw, Lacey, Bassett, Fussell, Cuffey, Burn, Donaldson, Reynolds, and others—a printed paper, containing resolutions passed in favour of the Charter at a meeting at Southampton on 14th March, 1848, the Mayor in the chair—and a letter addressed to Lacey from the chartists of Lower Worley, complaining of the arrangements made for the. defence of the Yorkshire prisoners, who they were informed were to be defended by Mr. Roberts for £250, and recommending that all the Chartist prisoners should be defended from one fund.


Cross-examined by
MR. BALLANTINE
Q. Where were all these books and Papers found? A. In a box in the club-room—when Jones was taken he was talking to a man named Frederick Stokes, who was remanded and discharged—nothing was found on him.






CHARLES WALKER
 (police-inspector, V). I was at the Charter coffee-house at the apprehension of Jones—I saw him put his hand into his lefthand pocket, and take out a pistol—I immediately seized hold of his hand and took it from him—I afterwards went with Kendall to his lodging, at 20. Grey Coat-street, and in a cupboard found four perfect pistol ball-cartidges.





JOSEPH THOMPSON

re-examined. I produce some papers, which I found at Rose's house on 11th Aug.—this plan was amongst them—(this was the plan spoken to by Powell).





EDWARD HENRY EAGLE
. My father, is collector to the Chartered-Gas-light Company. I know Mullins by sight—I do not know what his profession is, ray father has corresponded with him on the subject of business—I have always seen his letters, and have formed an acquaintance with his hand writing.

MR. PARRY. Q. Is by sight, the only way you know him? A. The only way; I have communicated personally with him respecting business when he has called at our house; he lived somewhere in the neighbourhood—I have spoken to him several times—I have spoken to him about the letters I have received.

MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL. Q. Look at that plan, and tell me if you believe that to be the hand-writing of Mullins? A. To the best of my belief it is his hand-writing.

Cross-examined by
MR. PARRY. Q. You have never seen him write, I believe? A. I have not; I only believed the letters I received to be in his hand-writing by his coming on that subject.

COURT. Q. He has corresponded with your father, and you have spoken to him on the matters contained in those letters? A. Yes; to the best of my belief this is the same hand-writing as those letters were.
(These being put in, were five plans; the first was that spoken to by Powell with marks across the streets denoting barricades; one was a rough plan of the Seven Dials, one of Clerkenwell, and two blank sheets headed, "Seven Dish" and "Clerkenwell." The others were the two papers with the first syllables of names and numbers against them, as in page 745, and two receipts for gas cotton.)





THOMAS BARRETT
. I am a shoemaker, and live at 17, Charles-street Lisson-grove. I am a member of the Chartist Association—I belonged to the Robert Emmett Brigade—I joined it last Whit-sunday—they held their meetings at a beer-shop kept by Morgan, in Praed-street, Paddington, and at a beer-shop kept by Breadon in Shouldham-street, Edgware-road, Marylebone—I know Mullins, and have heard him on more than one occasion address the Chartist meetings at Breadon's—there were Chartists and confederates present—I heard him address a meeting on Sunday, 13th Aug., I heard him address meetings once or twice before on Sundays—at Breadon's—on 13th Aug. I heard him tell the men to prepare for the crisis that was coming, and that it was necessary for each man to make a small sacrifice to aid the Committee of Progress, and that they would judge by their actions, by the way they contributed, how to act—I recollect a meeting at the same place Tuesday, 15th Aug., about eight o'clock—Mullins did not speak then—there were about twenty people, Chartists and confederates, assembled there—I went from there to Morgan's, and there were about twenty persons assembled there—they were waiting for the delegates to return and give instructions and orders, it was so stated at the meeting—the delegates did not arrive while was there, and a man named Smith took a cab and went to Kensal-green—I

did not go with him—on Wednesday, 16th Aug., I attended a meeting at Morgan's, in Praed-street—I went about eight—there were between twenty and thirty of our brigade present—they were waiting for—some delegates to come and give instructions—it was not mentioned exactly what for, but it was generally understood—there were several things mentioned, such as "a break out"—I went merely to see what was going on—I went from there to fireadon's in Sliouldbam-street, and got there about a quarter to nine—I found about thirty people assembled there—Mullins came into the room while I was there—he was not there when I first got there—when he came in, Smith, who had gone away in the cab on the Tuesday, was there—he clapped Mullins on the shoulder, and said, "My boy, I was afraid you were taken."—Mullins said, "No, they will only take me with my life."—Mullins then nentaway—another man, whose name I believe is Cruikshank, came into the room, and laid a musket on the table—I had seen him before on several occasions—I also saw two pikes and two pistols in the room—I saw no pike-handles—I heard orders given by Smith to the men to prepare and go to Seven Dials, and Crown-street, Soho, at ten that night, and their leaders would meet them there—a question was asked how the men could take their arms, and the reply was in the best way they could—the word "arms" was used, and "tooth-picks" as regarded pikes, there was an inquiry whether they had got their tooth-picks ready—Mullins had retired when he first came into the room, after what had passed between him and Smith—after a while, Malhins came and looked into the room, and then Smith ordered the people to go to Seven Dials—Mullins had looked into the room just before—this was after he had gone away as I stated—I did not see Mullins go away finally from the place—I do not know how he went away—he did not come in a third time—I saw a cab come there when he first arrived—the cab remained at the door—I do not know who went away in it—on the direction being given to go to Crown-street and Seven Dials, the people went away, in twos, threes, and fours, at short intervals—they did not go in procession—I went to Crown-street with one or two more, but I do not know their names—when I got there, I saw about thirty persons, about half, I think, of whom I had seen at Breadon's—I recognised them—I cannot tell the precise number.

GEORGE DAVIS
. I am a shoemaker, of 5, Straite's Mouth, Greenwich. I joined the Wat Tyler brigade of Chartists, which was held at the Druids' Arcs, Straite's Mouth, Greenwich on 24th May—I was accepted as a delegate, to attend a meeting that was formed at the George, in the Old Bailey—thirteen persons met there; Mullins, Rose, Payne, Lacey, Smith, and others, whos names 1 do not know—they first met on the day of Ernest Jones' trial—Mullins asked if there were anv members of the old delegate committee wbis was formed on Whit-Monday there—I was one, and said, "Yes"—he asked them to retire on one side of the room, and those that were not delegates, to the other—they did so, and consulted together, and said that it was a shaffi the prisoners should go to gaol without one struggle to release them—it was stated that the route taken from Newgate to Cold Bath-fields would be through Cow Cross, and that would be the best place to attack them, for they would find a friend there that would lead the Iribh out of their localities, (meaning Daley)—a motion was made with regard to calling the delegates

together from every locality—I attended meetings of the Committee up to 16th Aus., and within two hours after every meeting, made communications of what took place to Inspector Marks—he wrote down what I said, from my dictation, read it over to me, and I signed it—this paper, signed by me, was written by my dictation, and is an account of the meeting of 15th Aug.





KINGSTON MARKS
 (police-inspector, R). I was in communication with Davis, at Greenwich—he made reports from time to time of what occurred at the different meetings which he attended—I took it down in his own words—I read it over to him slowly and carefully—he approved and signed the whole of them—these are the reports (produced)—I sent copies of them forthwith to the authorities.





GEORGE DAVIS

continued. I have kept no note or minute of what occurred—I have no means of speaking with accuracy of what occurred, without referring to the notes taken by Marks—on 16th Aug. I was present when the people were apprehended at the Orange Tree—the night before that, I attended a meeting at the Lord Denman, Suffolk-street, Blackfriars—about twenty-six or twenty-seven people were present—Mullins was in the chair, and Payne, Erewster, Allnutt, Fay, Cuffey were there, and Lacey for a short time—I understand be went away with the Sub-committee, to a coffee-house, a few doors higher up—there were others there.

MR. BALLANTINE. Q. Have you any recollection except from the note? A. I can recollect the main substance, but not the dates—I refer to the notes ii. to refresh my memory as to the dates and who was present—they have not been read over to me lately—I have not read them myself—I can read and iv. write, but not very well.
(The
ATTORNEY-GENERAL
proposed to put this paper into the witness's hands, that he might refresh his memory by it. Mr. Ballantine, (fallowed by
MESSRS. PARRY, PARNELL, and
METCALFE,) objected to this being done; the paper being written by another party, and not by the witness himself, who could nal touch for its accuracy. The
ATTORNEY-GENERAL
referred to two cases, in the one where Mr. Baron Parke had allowed a witness to refresh his nmory from the notes of the learned Judge himself, and in the other where Mr. Baron Alderson had permitted the notes of counsel to be used for the sane purpose. The
COURT
was of opinion that, in strictness, this course was admissible, if the witness, after looking at the paper, spoke only from his recollection, and not from the contents of the paper. The
ATTORNEY-GENERAL, after some discussion, slated that he would endeavour to pursue the examination, if possible, without referring to the paper.)

MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL. Q. Who were present at the Lord Denman the night before the people were apprehended at the Orange Tree? A. Mullins the chairman, Payne, Brewster, Lacey, Fay, Cuffey, Allnutt, Ferdinando, and a person named Simmonds part of the evening, Ritchie, Johnson, and others; in all twenty-seven—Lacey was there a very short time—Lacey did not come back with the sub-coraraittee—Mullins, Lacey, Payne, Brewster, and Cuffey, went out with the sub-committee—they all came back, except Lacey—they were absent about three-quarters of an hour, or it might be an bur—Mullins said they had come to a resolution that they would have an outbreak on the ensuing evening (Wednesday)—that he himself meant to take the fceven Dials, Brewster was to take Clerkenwell, Payne the Tower Hamlets, and Busbctt, I think, was to take Strutton-ground, including the south of London—Brewster distributed tri-coloured bands, to be worn on the right arai, for tite delegates, to appoint them as leaders—I myself received two

from Brewster, one for myself and one for a delegate that ought to have attended with me—they were to meet at twenty minutes past nine and to bring what arms they could get—a motion was made as to where the localities should meet on the Wednesday—one was appointed to meet, at the Peacock, Westminster-road; another, at the Crispin, in Milton-street, Cripplegate; another, at Breadon's beer-shop, Shouldham-street; and the fourth, I think, at the Buck's Head, somewhere about Bethnal-green-road, or Hackney-road—a motion had been made the night before that the delegates select four men that were willing to risk anything and everything to attend where Ritchie should appoint them; it was merely a conversation—they were appointed to meet Ritchie at the Orange Tree, from five to seven—they were called luminaries by Mullins—there was to be a pass-word—Ritchie was to say to them, when they came in, "Do you want me?" and if they answered "Justice" he would know they were the men sent by the delegates-nothing was said about what Ritchie was to provide, but that he would give instructions to these men; but each man was advised to come armed, if he could—we met at the Orange Tree, Red Lion-square on the 14th—there wert between twenty and thirty present—Mullins, Payne, Brewster, Ciiffey, Ritchie, Crookshank, Allnutt, Fay, Johnson, Pearce, Simmons, Fleming, two Granshaws, (brothers,) and a person named Ford; he was not a delegate, but was bail for Ernest Jones, he brought 6s. 1d. from a new localto started at Knightsbridge—I do not know where he lived; I understood th; he came from Knightsbridge-district—at the same time he came, Mr. Reank, the editor of the Northern Star, came under the pretence that he was seit the meeting; but there had been reports that he was a Government spy, ana they would not go on with the business till he left the room—he was asked to go down stairs—it was moved by Mullins, at that meeting, that each delegate should go back to his locality and pick four men out, who were willing to do anything that was required of them—some one asked what they meant by it, and be said be would point to the gas, and they might take by his pointing what he meant; and Cuffey said it was no use to mince the matter, they wanted them for firing, or anything that might be required of them; for it was no use to mince the matter now, they knew their necks were in jeopardy; in fact, the halter was round their necks, and it was co use to say it in half words; that they wanted men to fire station-houses, or warehouses, or anything that might be required of them—a motion was made that two delegates should be sent to the meeting of the engine-drivers of tie North Western Railway to know what iheir opinions were; not to compromise themselves too much, by stating their views, and getting them to join the Chartists, but to hear the opinions of the drivers first; and if they found they were agreeable to close with the Chartists, they were to bring them to tie meeting, or delegates from their body, on a future night—Crookshank and Ritchie were appointed to go, and 18d. was allowed them for expenses—a remark was made that they wondered Lacey had not come that night—they waited for him till half-past eight, and then adjourned to the Lord Denman-there was another meeting that night of Confederates, at Nagle's; I did not attend it—Johnson attended both these meetings—I did not, at that time, know that his name was other than Johnson—I did not know he was in communication with the police; in fact, he was the last man I should hm thought of—I have not had any communication with him since, except one word as I stood in Court, now—the meeting before that at the Orange Tree was held, I think, at Breadon's—I remember two or three meetings at Hopkinson's

coffee-house, Saffron-hill—the last meeting I attended there was on the Sunday morning before the apprehension of the parties—there were not many delegates present—Mullins, Payne, Brewster, Fuzzon, Allnutt, Ritchie, and others, were there; I did not see Johnson—I had received a letter from Mullins on the Saturday, calling the meeting—a resolution was moved by Jluliins that the meeting should be adjourned till the afternoon—a few of us had a consultation down stairs, and they invited us up to the locality meeting, which was held every Sunday morning—when I went in there was a motion on, whether the district of Clerkenwell should turn out for physical force or not—it was put to the vote and carried that they should turn out—mention was made that a person of the name of Meriman had made a report that two nen at the head of the movement were in the pay of the Government, and communicated to the police the whole of the proceedings—there was a long discussion upon it, and two delegates were appointed to wait on Meriman, to know the truth or falsehood of the statement; but I understood they could not get an interview with him—the meeting adjourned till three in the afternoon, and met at Breadon's beer-shop, in Shouldham-street—there were about thirty present—Cuffey was there, and was appointed secretary to the subcommittee at that meeting—there was a letter read from Lacey. I understood, from Manchester, stating that trade was very brisk there, and he was surprised that he had not received the order that he sent down, which we inferred meant the money that he had written for; trade was very good, and he expected a very large order—an order was wanted to be sent down by the Monday night, by the last train—the letter did not mention when he expected to be in town—a stranger, whose name I do not know, and—who I never saw before, stated that the Irish brigade in St. Giles's had provided themselves with a musket each, and so many rounds of cartridge, and were willing to assist in whatever resolution the Chartists might come to—the meeting broke up between five and six—I remember going to attend a meeting at Perry's coffee-house, Shoreditch, and no meeting took place, because the police had seized some papers from Rose's at eight the same morning, (Friday); some persons there told me so, I do not know their names, one was Donnovan; a person who was there purposely appointed, told me so—they were playing at cards down stairs—I did not go up—I went away with Pedley, to Rose's house, to ascertain if it was true, I found it was so—the meeting that I attended before that was either at the Lord Denman or the Orange Tree—I think it was on the Tuesday or Wednesday before—Wednesday was the 9th—Mullins, Payne, Brewster, Cuffey, Nash, Rose, Pedley, Johnson, Donnovan, Fuzzon, and Allnutt, were there—something was said about M'Douall, but it was a private conversation—Rose is a carrier by trade, and was secretary to the sub-committee—Mullins was treasurer—they in general inquired whether anybody had brought any funds, and the delegates made reports of the state of their localities, and how many men they could depend on that would turn out to fight in case of an outbreak they did not do that at all the meetings, but at three or four of them—I think the number was mentioned as 1500 at one meeting, and above 2000 at another—they reckoned that the aggregate number mustered about 3000, and Mullins remarked that it was not those they depended on; they did not depend on the organised Chartists, but they reckoned there were about 30000 thieves and vagabonds about London who would co-operate with and assist them—on the Sunday morning before that, we met at Dennis's coffee-jouse, Great St. Andrew's-street, Seven Dials—Mullins, Payne, Brewster, ttose, and Thompson, were there—I know Lynch; I will not be certain whether

he was there, and I will not ho certain whether Fay was there—there were not above nine—I do not believe Cuffey was there—it was proposed, I think at that meeting that each delegate should bring up 10s. to form a fund—I was present at a meeting when the committee resigned, and a fresh committee was appointed—I think that was on Monday evening, the 7th, at Dennis coffee-house—the committee consisted of Fay, Mullins, Bassett, Donnovan Payne, Brewster, Lynch, and Dowling; I do not think Cuffey was a member—there were three Irish on it beside Dowling; Lynch, Fay, and Donnovan—they resigned on account of the news coming from Ireland that the rebels had been defeated, and there was some remark about Smith O'Brien, bull forget it—the Irishmen had been added to the committee in order that the; Confederates should be fairly represented as well as the Chartists—a new committee of four was then formed, with ore prospective, who was to be president—his name was not mentioned, but it was understood from Mullies that it was Churchill, who was then in France—the four were Brewster Mullins, Payne, and I will not be certain about the other; but 1 think it Cuffey—I know Bassett, the president, was to take the command of the whole committee; and it was proposed, by a person named Warry, that a farthing should be paid by each person in each locality to support the president—at the meeting at the Dispatch coffee-house, Dowling made a motion that the Confederate's and all the Chartist's localities should meet on Primrose—the Sunday; but when it came to the vote it was not carried: they hthougt it was premature—there was a meeting previous to this at the Dispatch coffee-house, I think, on the Wednesday—the Sunday meeting was at two in it afternoon—I think it was at the latter end of July—there was a meed; proposed to be held on Kennington-common on that same Sunday—we held a meeting that day at the Dispatch coffee-house, and had messengers from there to Kennington-common, to communicate any outbreak that might place—it was to be passed along on a bit of paper, written in pencil—persons were stationed every two hundred yards—it was supposed to be a meeting of Chartists; it was called by advertisement, by a person named Dwaine, of Cartwright's locality—the men were stationed between the common and the coffee-house; that had been agreed on before—I do not know who was employed to superintend them—Johnson was very busy over them-a meeting did take place at Kennington-common, but there was only a politic! sermon preached, I believe—there were reports that everything was quiet, except that two or three policemen in plain clothes were attempting to get up a disturbance—nothing further was done, that I am aware of—I forget at what place we met before that Sunday—I was taken so suddenly in coming forward to give evidence that I cannot recollect, for I did not think of comb; forward to give evidence in this ease up to ten this morning—I have only just come from Greenwich—I attended several other meetings before that—there was one meeting at Hopkinson's coffee-house, and I saw plans, and like weeks a map of London there—I think Payne had possession of them, and Hose, Mullins, Brewster, Thompson, and myself, were there together—I cannottd. when that was; it was before the meetings I have poken of; it was is forepart of the evening when the plans were produced—Johnson was there afterwards—those plans were just marked out, similar to a map on a piece oi paper—they were rather small—Mullins explained it, and pointed out thati. was to erect barricades from Clerkenwell down to Seven Dials, and from Seven Dials down Drury-lane to St. Mary's Church, in the Strand, by Somerset-house, and right along the Strand to Temple-bar; that would form

a good barricade, and from Temple-bar down Fleet-street, and by the water-side, and they were to make sure of Chaplin and Home's premises—I should know the plan if I were to see it—this is not it (looking at the one identified by Powell)—there were not so many figures on it; it was very plain indeed V—this is not it (looking at another)—they were to make a circle round from Holborn till they got to St. Martin's-le-Grand, and down there till they got to Clerkenwell-green and Aldersgate-street, and they were to take possession of St. Paul's Church—this is not the plan (looking at another)—it was merely in the centre of the paper, scribbled out, a rough plan—I attended a meeting at the Black Jack; that was not my first attendance as a delegate; I first attended as a delegate on Whit-Monday—I attended of my own accord at the Black Jack, for Greenwich—I merely went to get information—Mullins, Payne, Rose, and Dowling, were there—Johnson came in afterwards—Dolling said he attended the meeting, not being elected as a delegate, but at the invitation of Mullins—Dowling was a confederate, and secretary of the Davis-dub—a sub-committee, consisting of Rose, the secretary; Payne, the chairman; Mullins, the Treasurer; Dowling and Brewster were appointed for the purpose of drawing out plans to attack the police and soldiers—it was not said how many plans were to be drawn out—I attended other meetings.

Cross-examined by
MR. BALLANTINE
Q. I understood you to say, in answer to the Attorney-General, that you were not a Chartist? A. I was not when I first gave information to the police—I have become so since—I do not mean a genuine Chartist, but a member of the Chartist Association—I am not a Chartist in principle, merely for the purpose of gaining information—you may call it for the purpose of trickery—I was desirous of finding out their secrets, and then betraying them—I was not desired to do so.

Q. Have you carried on the business of a spy long, or was this your first start in that vocation? A. I have carried it on since 12th March—I am not. attached to the Government, or to any division, nothing of the sort—I never was employed as a spy at all—I employed myself—it was my own private speculation—I did not want to turn it to anything—it was merely to save destruction of life and property—that was my sole object—it was with no object of emolument to myself—I had no desire to gain anything by it—when I gave information I did not require anything for it, nor had I any desire for anything of the sort—I did not expect to gain anything by it—I offered to give it up several times, and wanted to retire—the superintendent and inspector begged me to keep on with it, and I did so—I did not give the superintendent my notes at the end of every meeting—I saw him at the end of each meeting, and told him my story—I have been paid nothing for this job—I have been at wort, and have been living on that—I employ men—I have other means of living without being a spy—I keep a shop, and have for seven years, at 5, Strait-mount, Greenwich—I am married, and have three children—when I first gave information, I did not expect to get anything by it—I now expect to be remunerated for the loss of what trade I shall be compelled to lose—I have not made any bargain about what I am to get for the loss of my trade—I trust entirely to the generosity of the Government—they have not agreed to give me one farthing—I mean to apply to them for compensation for what I have lost in my trade—I have lost something in my trade at present—people have suspected me of being a spy for the last month past—I have found myself pointed at—I have not found all the honest and respectable people in the neighbourhood endeavouring to avoid me—I communicated with the police previous to enrolling myself—it was not by agreement with them that I enrolled myself—I thought I could learn more—Robinson,

a member of the Chartist Association, solicited me to join them—he is not one of the persons I have betrayed—he is a Chartist—I was not here yesterday at Dowling's trial—I was not before the Grand Jury, or before a Magistrate—the prisoners have not heard one word that 1 had to say against them.

Q. When did you first know you were required as a witness? A. I did not know I should be required at all—no application was made to me—I came of my own accord, at eleven o'clock to-day—I was not sent for—I applied myself, to be made a witness—I am not brought here by the Crown or under any subpœna—it was a voluntary act of my own—the Government have been in possession of my papers, and they applied to me to go as a witness, and I refused—I cannot tell the exact day they applied to me; it two or three days after the arrest at the Orange-Tree took place—I had not made any bargain with the Government that I was not to appear—I have sworn it, and repeat it, that I came of my own accord to-day, having refuse: previously.

Q. Plow came you to alter your mind? A. Through reading the newspaper this morning, and seeing the character the witness had yesterday, and 1 knew no one could bring such charges against me—it was from reading the account of the cross-examination of Powell—it occurred to me that he bore rather a bad character, and cut rather a bad figure—I did not want to bolster him up—I came to give the light evidence, because I thought the Jury would not believe Powell's statement to be true, as he bore such a bad character.

Q. And did not you know that if there was a verdictof acquittal, you would lose all your payment for this job? A. I did not think anything at ail about payment—on my solemn oath, I did not believe that if there was a verdict of acquittal, I should lose all the remuneration that I might otherwise get—I read Powell's examination nearly through, not very carefully.

Q. I dare say, from what you saw of it, you would hardly believe him on his oath? A. I do not know; I would with regard to that, because he told the truth—I carried a couple of loaded pistols for my own protection—I have never got up any meeting—I have never said I had fighting-men at my command—I saw Marks, the inspector of police, at Greenwich, this morning, at his own house—I went to him—I did not come up here with him, I came by myself—I asked his advice whether I should come up—he communicated with the superintendent, and decided, if I came, they would be in attendance here for me, and I came.

MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL. Q. You say you saw the examination in the paper this morning? A. Yes; in the Morning Advertiser—it was the cross-examination, where he was asked whether he belonged to the thimble-rig—on reading that cross-examination, I went to Inspector Marks, to ask his advice, whether it was requisite that I should come up, whether he thought it would do any good—I was unwilling to come as a witness.





CHARLES BALDWINSON
. I live in Webber-street, Black friars-road, and am a tailor. I became a member of the Chartist Association, of the Lambeth locality, about the middle of May—their place of meeting was Chartist-hall, Webber-street—I became a class-leader about three weeks after, and had nine men under me—on the Monday night before the men were arrested at the Angel, in Webber-street, I remember meeting Morgan, who was taken up there—on Tuesday, 15th, I mot him again, at the Queen Victoria beershop, at the corner of New-street, in Short-street, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, and went with him to the Peacock, in Francis-street,

Westminster-road—we found the class-leaders of the Lambeth district thera—a person named Pedley, a delegate belonging to the council of the Lambeth locality, was there—I was there that evening about two hours and a half—Pedley said there was a delegate coming from Manchester, and that they were up and doing in Manchester and the North of England—Pedley told us all to sit down, and he asked us all if we were prepared to fight—one man smiled, and said, "You don't mean it?" and Pedley said, "We do mean it;" and then he said, "Then we are ready to come out"—he told us to tell our men to come there the next night, at eight o'clock, with arms, and those who had not arms would be put in the way to get them—we were to meet at the Broadway, Westminster, where we should meet the Dean-street locality—we were to come to the Peacock first—he mentioned that the other localities were to meet at the Seven-dials, Clerkenwell-green, and at the east end of the town—in pursuance of those directions, I went, about one o'clock, next day, and spoke to six of my men, I think—Conway, whowas taken at the Angel, was one, and Prowton another—I told them what Pedley had said—I went to the Peacock by myself, I believe, at eight o'clock, and met Morgan, Pedley, Conway, Chester a class-leader, and Winspere, there—Pedley brought a paper, with some coloured ribbons in it, which he said the delegates were to wear, that tie men might know them; and another paper with some powder, with which he filled up some ball-cartridges—I had a pike—head, and I afterwards fetched my pistol—Pedley gave me a ball-cartridge to load the pistol—this is one of the ribbons (the one produced)—in consequence of something that the landlady said, I went to the Angel, in Webber-street—I left Pedley behind, but he came afterwards—he left about three minutes before the police came—I had given information to the police between two and three o'clock in the afternoon—I saw Pedley load a pistol at the Angel for a man, whose name I forget—he did not take it away.

Cross-examined by
MR. BALLANTINE
Q. Am I to take it that up to 16th Aug. you were a party in this transaction? A. Yes, up to the 16th—I had left them for about a fortnight previous to that—I mean I had not attended any meeting for a fortnight up to 14th—I had not been in communication at all with the police before—I knew of the meeting of the 16th—it was of that meeting that I gave information—I was at the meeting, and was taken into custody—I then had a loaded pocket-pistol on me—I am a journeyman tailor by trade—I gave a pike—head to Conway to take care of; and it was found on him—I bought it, I cannot tell when—it was somewhere about July, or the latter end of June—I had it to take off suspicion, that the parties might not know I had informed—I carried it inside my coat—I showed it to them, and the pistol too—I never took the pike—head to the meeting before the 16th; yes, I beg your pardon, I did once—I was not examined before the Magistrate—the prisoners have never had an opportunity of hearing what I had to say against them—I did not go before the Grand Jury—I knew last week that I was to be examined as a witness—I have never been in any trouble.

MR. WELSBY. Q. Were you examined last Friday in Dowling's case? A. Yes.
(George Wilson, Thomas Pronger, Samuel Evans, William Thomas, Thomas Mollison, John Bambridge, Joseph Hoyle, William Robert Black, John Johnson, and William Randall, gave the same evidence as in pages 750 and 751.)





HENRY JONES
 (policeman). On 17th Aug. I was on duty on Clerken-well-green—about half-past four o'clock in the morning I went into the

churchyard, and found this basket, containing ball-cartridges (produced)—here are 280 perfect, and about fifty unfinished—it was close adjoint. Clerkenwell-green—the churchward is inclosed in a railing—there is a passage in it leading to some old houses—any one can go in at all hours of the night—I found it in a dark corner, opposite a bookbinder's, shop—any one into the churchyard to put them there—the gate is always open.

Cross-examined by
MR. BALLANTINE
Q. Did you expect to find them? A. No; I found them by accident.

Cross-examined by
MR. PARRY. Q. Had you been in the churchyard the morning before? A. Yes, the 16th—I go into the churchyard at all times—I went in every quarter of an hour while I was on duty there—on on the night I found these I was on duty four hours, from two o'clock in the morning till six—I do not know who had been on duty before me—two o'clock is not say regular time to come on duty, but I was kept on reserve that night—I was ordered to stop at the station till I was ordered on duty—that was at two o'clock—I had not been out on special duty the night before, or the night before that, hut the night after I went out regularly—that is my regular status—it is something out of the usual way to go at two in the morning—after I went round my beat as usual—that part of the churchyard forms part of my beat—I did not go with any intent to find anything, or discover anything—I had not been there the morning before at that time, nor the morning before that, nor did I go the morning after.

MR. BODKIN. Q. At what hour do you usually go on your beat? A. At nine in the evening, but on 16th Aug. a reserve force was kept till two o'clock and I did not go on duty till two, in consequence—I did nothing else than obey the orders of my principal when I went on duty that night—at a quarter past four, just at daylight, I found the basket—I do not go through the churchyard—there is a passage, with pallisades on one side, and tombstones on the other, and three houses on the right-hand side, and on that side there is a sort of nook, this basket was set there, and this handkerchief laid over is and the unfinished cartridges sticking up in it—the handkerchief enabled me to discover it, by its being daylight.





JOSIAS CHILTON
. I live in Crawford-street, Bryanston-square. I know Breadon's beer-shop, in Shouldham-street—I went into the tap-room there an 16th Aug., between eight and nine o'clock at night—there were eighteen or twenty people there, chiefly Irish—I heard Crown-street mentioned—I took it to be Soho—I did not hear Soho mentioned—they were to meet there—I saw a gun unfolded from a wrapper—it was in pieces, but it was put into the stock—I saw something similar to a sword on the table near the door, with a rough handle, made of wood—the people dispersed about two at a time I was there nearly an hour and a half, till they had all gone.





ROBERT WARRINGTON
. I am an operative chemist, attached to Apothecaries' Hall. Here are some forms of mixtures on this paper (found at Rose's)—they could be applied to purposes of spontaneous combustion—they become explosive by mixture with themselves—here are three ditierent spontaneous explosive compounds—this is a common lecture experiment, illustrating a case of spontaneous combustion—it is nitrate of copper wrapped up in tin-foil, and in five minutes it ignites, and becomes perfectv red-hot, or in three or four minutes; it depends on the quantity of water used—the next is a mixture of a portion of steel-filings and sulphur, which I presume are to be made into a paste; that is, a mixture which gives out a great deal of heat, but it does not inflame—the next mixture is woollen rags

steepped in a mixtuie of three parts of nitric acid and one ounce of sulphuric which is a very powerful explosive compound—when I say explosive, I mean calculated to ignite very shortly—I cannot make out the last item on the paper, it is nitrate of silver inclosed with pebble stones—this ball I have not looked at, it seems to be a packet of gunpowder—here are some nails in it and a piece of cotton which attaches the paper together—I do not know whether it is a slow match.

MR. PARRY
to William Broom Cross. Q. Did you apprehend Fay? A. Yes—he was not searched—I took him to Bow-street station—he has been in custody ever since—I do not know that he has been searched at all—I took him at 14, Knight-street, Milton-street—I believe it was his residence—it was a private house—I believe there was no name—he was at work there with his father—the house was searched by Serjeant Grey—we found nothing—the father said Fay was his son—I saw him on a seat there at work with a person who he called father, and who called him son; but at first be denied his name being Fay—I do not think I have said that before—tins was on the 18th—Powell was being examined when I was at Bow-street with Fay—Brannan and Grey pointed Fay out to me—I did not consider him in my custody.





JAMES BRANNAN
 (police-sergeant, G 20). I took Fay—I know that he lived at 14, Plough-court, Milton-street—he said, "My name is not Fay"—I said, "It is, you must come along with me."

Cross-examined by
MR. PARRY. Q. "Was it his father's house? A. His father lived in the top room, he is a boot-closer—he was sitting at work—he knew me before—I knew where he resided, and knew him—I had not bees in bis company, more than seeing him—I have done duty there many years—I should say he knew me very well—we have spoken together—I do not wear uniform—I have not the slightest doubt that he knew me, and his father also.

Witnesses for the Defence.






JAMES PARIS
. I am foreman to Mr. Smith, a master builder, of Taberaicle-row, Finsbury. Thomas Powell is his brother-in-law—I have worked in the same shop with him seven or eight years I believe—I have known him about eleven years, but only about seven years intimately—he is not a man who I would believe on his oath.

Cross-examined by
MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL. Q. You are a Scotchman? A. Yes—I have seen Powell this morning—I did not talk to, or. shake hands with him—I was not within reach of him—I never heard him examined as a witnes, and have never heard him sworn—I would not believe him on his oath, because he is in the habit of telling so many lies—he once said Lord John Russell committed suicide by cutting his throat, and that a thief took a side of pork from Mr. Rowland's bhop; and that two or three policemen went in search of him; and Mr. Rowland's wife went and made inquiry, and there was no truth in it—at another time he told me that Mr. Hudson, a neighbour, was dead; it turned out not to be so—these things were not long ago—I have had this opinion of him for two years—I worked with him up to the time he left—I do not recollect seeing him last Friday—I did not shake hands with him, and say I hoped Government would take care of his wife and children—I said I was sorry for his children for what he had done—I would not shake hands with him, because he has told so many lies—I believe I am not a Chartist—I do not know what Chartism is—I belong to no public body or association whatever.

MR. HUDDLESTON. Q. Have you been Mr. Smith's foreman eight or nine years? A. Not all the time, I was a journeyman before that;. I was foreman

two years—I left, and was away two years and a half—when I said I was sorry for him and his children, I referred to his becoming an informer—I do not remember hearing him called "Lying Tom" in his presence.





THOMAS OSBORNE
. I am a workman at Mr. Smith's. Powell worked there—I believe he is a relation of Mr. Smith's—I have known him three years and five months, and from what I have known of his character I would not believe him on his oath, if he was on his dying bed—I have heard him talk very little of Chartism—I was not in the shop much lately—about two months ago he told me there was to be a Chartist rising, no one else was present—he asked me to join three or four months ago, it might be three weeks after the Kennington-common meeting on 10th April, not more.

Cross-examined by
MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL. Q. Did you go to the Kennington-common meeting? A. No, I was at Bishop Bonner's-fields but a: no meeting—I was there on the Sunday when people were collected, not during the evening—I was there on the day the police were attacked—I was there when the church windows were broken, but did not see them—I did not hear Ernest Jones speak—I do not know him—I was at a meeting at Birdcage-walk—I cannot say if it was on 22nd April—Powell pointed out a blacksmith to make a pike if I wanted one—he asked whether I had joined—I said, "Yes"—that was a lie, but I would not believe him on his oath, because I have found him out in so many—I heard him examined here on Tuesday—I was here to speak the truth—I was subpoenaed—I did not hear the witnesses ordered to leave the Court, but as soon as I heard there were orders, I left—that is the only occasion I have heard him examined—he came in one day as if he was frightened, and said Lord John Russell had committed suicide—two or three days before he gave information, he was sharpening a saw, and broke one of the wings of the nut which it was fixed with, he said there was no man at that end of the shop but me, I must get another—I said, "You can get one for 1d.," and gave him one—he went out, I said to one of my shopmates, "Depend upon it it be will say it cost 2d.," and accordingly he did so, but a man in the countint-house said he gave it to him—I did not deny breaking it—none of the other belived and it was the same with me—I did not attend Chartist meeting before 10th April—I attended a meeting at Birdcage-walk, it was quite accidental—I went two or three times, on two or three Sunday mornings—it was in some ruins where houses had been built—several persons spoke—May was one—no one went with me—I did not hear there was going to be a meeting on 16th Aug. not till next morning—I was never taken up—I did not take Powell's advice and get a pike—I am not at regular work—if Mr. Smith wants me, he employs me—I sometimes earn more than 30s. a week, sometimes less—I went to the meeting because it was proposed that as so many carpenters were out of employ, and their tools were all popped, and if they would subscribe something to get them out of, pawn, they could go to work, and be able to be a great help to the cause—I did not subscribe, I went to oppose him—I spoke—May had put the proposition at a former meeting—he was a perfect stranger to me—I did not go the next Sunday—if it was brought forward, I should have told the parties he was doing it for his own self—I do not think I went four times—I have done jobs with Pennell-there was a little difference between us—I am not aware that he charged me a with taking some wood—he never did to my face, and I never heard of it—I worked at Bishop's Stortford, in Hertfordshire—I left there about a low affair, which my parents were against me in—I brought her to London—I married her first—I never heard Powell examined on oath.

MR. METCALFE. Q. Why did you tell Powell you had joined the

Chartists? A. Because I was always afraid of him ever since I knew him—if any of us offended him, he would not tell us of it, nor seek revenge at the moment, but would Jet it go over five or six months, and then seek revenge, not on us, but on our tools—I cannot say that he has done so.





RICHARD PENNELL
. I am a carpenter and joiner, and work for Mr. Hill, of Turner-street, Whitechapel—I have known Powell twelve or thirteen years—I have worked in the same shop with him for a number of years—from what I know of him I would not believe him on his oath—I have heard him called "Lying Tom" to his face, thousands of times, in Mr. Smith's shop—I once heard him say he would send Lord John Russell and Sir George Gray, the Queen, the b—y foreigner, and all the family, to the devil within a month—about a week or ten days before 10th April be wished me to attend at Cartwright's to be proposed a member of the society—I said I did not like the proceedings, and I did not think they would gain the Charter in the way they were going on—he said they would gain it, and would not be long about it—they would have it within a month, or a fortnight—he wished me to propose him as a delegate if I joined, as he was not known in the Society, and said he could get 2l. or 3l. a week, and that would be better than humbugging about for old Smith, his brother-in-law, the builder—I asked, "How are you going to get the Charter? what do you think the Government will be about?"—he said, "We have got a weak and a b----y Government—look at our present Queen, with her hundreds of thousands a year, and you and me are working at our benches from morning to night for the sake of a bit of bread"—he said if I would come to his house on Sunday morning he would show me materials enough to blow London to hell in half an hour—I went a portion of the way, but not liking his character prevented me going further—some years ago he gave me a printed bill about Socialism.

Cross-examined by
MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL. Q. Did you ever work for Mr. Smith? A. Yes—I was dismissed through shortness of work—that was the only reason—he did not tell me I never should have work there again—I have never required it since—I left I suppose seventeen months ago—I never heard Powell examined on his oath, but I have beard him swear openly in the shop times out of number, so help his God, be would swear anything if he could get paid for it—I do not mean to say he would speak out openly to every one in the shop; he did not like the foreman to know what was going on at all—he has told me of instances when he has been brought to the Old Bailey as a witness, and has said be would swear anything that he could get paid for—I heard him called "Lying Tom" in presence of Osborne and Goner, a carpenter and joiner, but not of the foreman—I have seen him take the Scriptures in his hand, and when he came to a place where Christ was named, he would break it off, and say, "We will bum that b----r, and put it into the fire"—Carr and me were present—he tore out a leaf—I have seen him break out the name of Christ's disciples—when he came to a certain part, he would say, "Here is Christ, we will burn him," he would break the portion off, and when he came to the disciples, he would say, "Here are villains, here are some of the scoundrels," and would burn them; but when he came to the name of Judah, he said he was the best fellow of the lot, he did get paid for his job, but he (Powell) would have done it for half the money—I have only seen him burn the paper once—I did not mention this to the attorney who examined me—I did not think of it—it would not have done for me to have told Mr. Smith—I was shocked—I never spent an hour with the man in my life—I continued to work at the next bench to him—I never saw him reading the Scriptures to get any good out of was only to pick out and damage it—I suppose it was his own book—the

leaves were partly missing—it was about five years ago—it may besix—I do not think Carr was present when he spoke of Judah—I cannot tell whether it was summer or winter—I think it was between four and five years ago—there was a fire in the shop—it was breakfast time—we boil the coffee there;—sometimes there were five or six sitting round the fire some times two—Powell and me were the only men that breakfasted in the shop at that time—Carr was present when he spoke about Judah and the disciples—I have heard him express himself about Scripture scores of times, and have told him he ought to be ashamed of himself—Carr might be present—I have never been a Cnartist—I attended meetings at Bishop Boiiner's-fields—I have been to no other Chartist meetings—I have never been to Cartwright's—I never saw him but twice in my life—I never saw the prisoners—I do not know the man's name who found me out—it was a carpenter and joiner worked for Mr. Smith—I have not seen him these three weeks—I should know him if I saw him—he called on me one evening, and told me to go to Dalston, and gave me a card of a boot and shoemaker, whose name I do not recollect—I went—it is in a street in the Queen's-road, just over the bridge—I have lost the card—I saw the man twice—it was a few days or a week after the Chartists were taken—he asked if I knew anything about Powell, and I told him what 1 knew of him—I did not write a letter to the Northern Star—I have lived at 51, Molyncaux-street, Hoxton, three years next March—I have never had any meeting of the witnesses there—I do not know Collins—a man nans Reynolds lived in the house with me, and a man named Rooney, and an old lady who has only been there a few days—I know Thomas Osborne—there is no angry feeling betueen him and me, no more than I discharged him when I was Mr. Hill's foreman—before I went to Mr. Smith's, I worked at St. George's Hospital—I come from Wiltshire—I hive not been in London ever since—I was in Wiltshire and Dorsetshire again, about three years and a half—that was six years ago—I did not know there was going to be a rising in London except from the papers—I heard nothing of the meeting of 15th Aug.—I was not at Cartwright's that night—I have only been there twice in my life—I have never seen Powell there—I dropped in there one Sunday evening for a cup of coffee three years ago, and again last Sunday week—I did not stop there two minutes.

MR. HUDDLESTON. Q. Was it in consequence of your knowledge of Powell's character that you were asked to say what you knew of him? A. Yes—I saw the statement which I made reduced to writing by the master shoemaker, and I put my name to it—I afterwards saw it in the Northern star—that was a statement of all I knew of the character and conduct of Powell except about his being the murderer of his father, but I always thought it was robbery—the conversation about the Scriptures has occurred scores of times. not a day in the week but he would bring it up, but I only saw him burn a portion once—Carr was present once when he said Jesus Christ was a thief and has been there scores of times when he used such expressions—the person who came to me with the card was in Mr. Smith's employ, and a member of the Trades society—I saw by the papers that Powell was a witness—I can not mention half the shopmates that have heard him speak so.

COURT. Q. Where was the book kept that was torn? A. It was part of the New Testament—it was kept in his chest, in the shop—he was not much in the habit of reading the Scriptures—on rhis occasion lie merely took hold of a leaf and said, "See, here is a history of Christ," and so on—I only saw him do it once, but he broke out several portions on the same occasion but when he came to Judas, that betrayed Christ, he would not bum that—sometimes read the Testament of a Sunday, but generally read the newspaper

on a working day—he took out several parts of one leaf, or it may be another leaf—I cannot say how many leaves he broke—he broke up a number of pieces but whether all out of one leaf I cannot say.





ALFRED CARR
. I know Thomas Powell well—I worked with him at Mr. Smith's three or four years, part of 1838, 1839, and 1840—I met with him once since, at a coffee-shop—from what I have known of him during that time, I would not believe him on his oath, not a bit of it.

Cross-examined by
MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL. Q. You have only met him once in a coffee-shop for the last eight years? A. It may be seven years—that Was about two years ago (looking at a paper)—1842 was the last time I worked with him—I did not make this paper—I asked a party named Bennett, in Mr. Smith's employ, whether it was right—I do not know whether he was the man who went after Pennell—this "March, 26, '42" means when I left that employ—this "Feb. 9, '40" means when Powell attempted to murder his father—I tad this to refresh my memory—I worked for Powell's father six or seven years ago—I have only worked with Powell at Mr. Smith's—I would not believe him' on his oath, because I have found him out in so many base lies, and he pulled Scripture to pieces so often—he had an old Bible, and would stand up when the shop was a little cleared, and begin reading it, and when he came to particular passages he would say Jesus Christ was a b----, and the Virgin Mary was the biggest w----that ever * * *—it was his continual study to tear the Bible to pieces—I have seen him cull it to pieces—at one time he brought a part of the book of Genesis, picked it to pieces, and pitched it into the fire—I cannot say what it was, or whether our Saviour was mentioned—he said, "God said let us make man," but I cannot swear to the words—he pushed the pieces into the fire and said they would contaminate a bawdy-house—Pennell was not there—I do not think there was any one but me—I do not belong to the Chartists—I was subpoenaed nearly a fortnight ago—directly I had it, I went to Pennell's house—I have seen Powell destroy tools—I never destroyed his or my own, or any of them, or any one else's—this paper was put into my hand about eleven o'clock to-day—I was talking to a party yesterday named Daniels, to refresh my memory—I do not know whether it is his writing—he is here—I had it just to jog my memory, and refer to other little things—I did not hear Pennell examined—I never attended any Chartist meeting—I heard of these meetings in the paper—I have attended no Chartist meetings since 1839, when Powell wanted to betray me—that was in Ship-yard, Templebar, on the first-floor, on the right—I was on good terms with Powell when I left but when you were on good terms with him, it was the very time he going to betray you—after be tried to murder his father, he tried to spite in everything.

MR. METCALFE. Q. What does this "Feb. 9, '40," refer to? A. It was when Mr. Powell died—Powell drew me to the meeting in 1839—he wanted to get me into trouble and leave me in a mess—he has talked about ripping policemen's guts—I attended from four to six meetings—I was never enrolled as a member—I took a card at the Lord Denman in 1839—I did not stay, because 1 found the peaceable way was the best—I was employed to keep the peace on 10th April.





JAMES BENNETT
. I know Powell—I worked with him about four years ago—since then I have repaired boots and shoes for him—about 3rd April, 1848, I met him at the National Hall, Holborn—he asked what I intended to do on 10th April—I said I intended to go to Kennington-common—he asked me in what way—I wanted to know what he meant by it—he asked if meant to go armed—I said, "Certainly not; the executive would

have better cause to attack us, and I would advise working-men not to go armed on any account"—he directly said I was a b----fool if I did not go armed.

Cross-examined by
MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL. Q. Were you at the National Hall meeting? A. Yes, and at the Kennington-common meeting and likewise at another at Kennington-common—I was not there on 6th Aug.—I was not aware that there were men stationed at certain distances along the road to give notice at the Dispatch coffee-house, if any disturbance of the peace took place on 6th Aug.—I never heard of it—I was not then myself, I was on 10th April—I attended one meeting at Bonner's-fields—I think it was on a Sunday evening—I was not there till the meeting was over—I think the police broke a few heads that day—I do not know that the police themselves had a few heads broken—I think that was the day the Church was attacked—I did not Lear anybody speak, the meeting was over—I was not at the row—I was not there when the windows were broken—I was there when the police were dispersing the people—I was not present at the trial in this Court of the persons for that disturbance—I did not see the windows broken—I heard of it—I did not see it when I got there, I did go near enough—I was not at the place of meeting—the meeting was dispersed before I got there—I attended one meeting at Clerkenwell—I cannot tell you when it was, I should say it is perhaps three months ago—that was not the night the people walked through London—it was eight or nine days before—I was not at the meeting at Trafalgar-square—I think the meetings I attended were at Bonner's-fields, Kennington-common, and Clerkenwell-green—I was not at above four meetings—I was not in the procession on 29th, I did not see it—I have never been in any procession—I have sat been at any meetings at private houses—I was at Cartwright's on 10th April—I belonged to the Whittington-and-Cat locality, in Church-row, Betbsjl-green—I had no class-leader—I do not know who was the warden of the district—I am not a class-leader—I never had any directions—I have not get; my card—I belong to the National Charter Association—I do not know what you mean by a class-leader—there was no one over me—I believe there was a secretary to the society—his name was Lefevre—I cannot tell you who where the delegates for our locality—I do not know whether there was a delegate—I never had a pike myself; I swear that, or a gun, or pistol, or anythingcf of the sort—I was only at Kennington-common once.

MR. METCALFE. Q. Did you countenance physical force at all? A. I did not, as a Chartist.

COURT. Q. I think you say Powell asked you whether you intended to go armed to Kennington-common? A. He did; and the reason I did not go armed was, because the notice was not to go armed—if the notice had been to go armed, I certainly should not have gone armed—he told roe at that time whether he should go armed; I am certain of that; and more than that I searched his pockets in Cartwright's, to see that he had no grenades about him, before I went out of the room with him—he said he had been making grenades all the previous Sunday—we had not been talking about cornbastibles—I did not find any grenades in his pocket, or I should not have walked with him, because I should have considered him a very dangersman if he had been armed.





JOHN WESTMORELAND
. I am a master tailor, at 75, Watling-street. I am a real out and out moral force Chartist, and have been so for forty years—I think I should recognize Powell if I were to sec him—I did see him here slightly—he is a perfect stranger to me, but I think I could recognize him—I

believe so, from the description of his person and dress given me by the parties attending Cartwright's coffee-shop, who were personally acquainted with him—I just got a glance of him in Court the other day, when I was called in to be recognized—I think he was then standing in the witness-box—that was the very man 1 had seen at Cartwright's—I remember some time ago his coming into the box at Cartwright's where I was sitting—I had very little conversation with him—while he was in the box he sketched this piece of paper (looking at the circular plan produced to Powell) with a pencil—that was the only paper produced at that time—this was his project of organization—I think it might be about two months ago—it might be about the end of July or beginning of Aug., I am not positive—it was before these men were taken into custody—he gave me this sketch at the time he made it, and it appears that I kept it, but I was astonished to find that I had it—I did not know that I had it until I found that he had turned traitor, and then there was an agitation whether I knew the man or not—this is the same piece of paper—I saw him again at Cartwright's, I think about a week after, and he showed me a similar plan, done on a larger sheet of paper—it was very different to this in point of finish—it was highly finished, neatly done, and properly executed, on a beautiful clean sheet of paper—he put it into my hands for a few minutes, and I asked him if he could spare it—he said, "No"—I had no acquaintance with him, and never spoke with him till be came into the box where I was sitting, and sat down by my side, and began to talk about organization.

Cross-examined by
MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL. Q. You have been in the habit of attending Cartwright's pretty much? A., I have for the last four years—I speak there very frequently in the large room—I am a moral force Chartist by all means—I have been a moral force man all my life, not only in chartism but in religion, and everything else—I am not a member of the Irish Felon-club—I am not an Irishman; I was born in Yorkshire—we have discussions at Cartwright's twice a week, Monday and Thursday nights, and sometimes I take part in them—I do not know a man named Carter—I know Mr. Kydd by sight, and by hearing him lecture occasionally—I do not know that he is here—I do not think I know Donaldson—I do not know Fay personally; I may have seen him—I saw an account in the paper of the men being taken at the Orange Tree—I cannot say whether I was at Cartwight's the night before—I am there every night—I go merely for the purpose of looking at the paper, and on discussion nights—I cannot say whether I was there on Tuesday night, the 15th—I have no means of knowing—I do not think I heard of their being taken the same night—I think it was the night after, at Cartwright's—I do not know Mullins—I may have seen him, but not to my knowledge—I do not know him by name—I did not hear talk at Cartwright's of the persons being about to turn out on the Wednesday night—these physical force proceedings were quite foreign to my principles—I did not know that anything of the kind was going on, only from what you say—I took no interest in the movement—I did not know there was a movement—I never gave heed to anything of the kind, but denounced it whenever it came in my way—I have at Cartwright's repeatedly denounced physical force.

Q. I am afraid it was not very well received, although you are a popular orator? A. I do not care about the reception; I spoke the truth—I speak as I feel the conviction of my mind—I do not know whether it was well or "'received; how am I to know?—I never heard any applause—I was not

very popular I must confess, for I was not at all applauded—I have met with persons who were opposed to my doctrines, but they found it was not their while troubling themselves with me on that point—without presumption I hope I am considered by every one that knows me, to be a highly quiet and peaceable man—I was determined to act on nothing but moral force; that was, to get all the people I could on the register-list.





GEORGE THURSTON
. I have been out of Court during this trial—I have not been sitting in the gallery; I will take my oath of it—I am a cabinetmaker, and live in Milton-street, City—I know Powell—I have seen him frequently at the coffee-shop in Redcross-street—I saw him about a fortnfe before 16th Aug.—he told me he could sell me a pair of pistols for 6s. I did not see them—I believe he said he bad got them at home—he said he would give me half a pound of powder if 1 took them, but I thought I would have nothing at all to do with them—I am a moral force Chartist, and have been enrolled.

Cross-examined by
MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL. Q. Were you at Cartwright's the night the men were taken up? A. No, I was the night before—there were not a great many persons there, about the number there is generally—I do not know Carter—I am not aware that there were some persons sitting in the back room down the passage—I believe there is such a room—it is a sort of kitchen—I was never there—I will take my oath I never was in this gallery in my life—I beard that there was to be a meeting next day—I did not hear where—I heard nothing said about the Orange Tree—I do not know how many districts there were to be—I never heard about our locality going anywhere—I belong to the Cripplegate locality—I had no class-leader that I am aware of—I have not often been there—I know Gurney—I do not know that he was my warden—I never spoke to him—I do not know that there was a warden at all—it was on Tuesday evening, the 15th, that I heard talk of there being a meeting next day; I was in at Cart-wright's, and 1 heard there was going to be a something, I did not know what it was—I know Fay—I saw him there that night—I do not know whether Johnson was there or not—I was at home on the Wednesday night—I did not go to Cartwright's—I was not out at all on Wednesday.

Q. Did you attend any of the open-air meetings? were you at the meeting at Kennington-common? A. On 10th April, I heard there was a meeting there, and I took a walk there like any one else—I did not form in procession to come from that meeting—I went to one in Bishop Bonner's-fields, I think on Whit-Monday, but 1 saw there was a great quantity of police there, and I walked back again—that was the only other meeting I went to—I do not remember another meeting at Kennington-common on Sunday—I have heard say that Johnson went by two or three names, but I was not acquainted with any name besides Johnson.

MR. PARNELL. Q. Did you see a number of nags and banners at the meeting at Kennington-common on 10th April? A. I did—(looking at the one found at Cuffey's) I do not remember seeing that there.





THOMAS POWELL

re-examined by
MR. PARRY. I do not think I ever saw that man before in my life—(looking at Henry Green) may I be allowed to make a remark: I was in such a state of exhaustion after my examination having been in the witness-box eight hours, that at the latter part 1 scarcely knew what questions you put to me—I was in such a state, bodily and mentally, that I was really not myself—I have been at meetings at Birdcage-walk—I do not remember whether I was there on Sunday,—23rd April last

it is very likely I may have been—I do not remember at any meeting about that time busying myself in asking questions among the parties present—I do not remember saying to Green, "Have you got any arms?" or his saying, "No, that he did not know the use of them"—I have no recollection of saving to him, "You are not worth a d----as a Chartist, unless you have got arms"—I will not swear I did not say that to him, I might have said such a thing—I do not know whether I then went among the crowd and asked others the same questions—I will not swear I did not.





HENRY GREEN
. I am a ship felt-maker. I am a Chartist—I know Powell—I remember a meeting held on Sunday, 23rd April last, at Birdcage-iralk, Bonner's-fields—I saw Powell there—I was in conversation with two other gentlemen, I believe two weavers, and Powell came and asked me whether I was provided to obtain my rights—I asked what he meant—he asked whether I was possessed of arms—I told him I was not possessed of any except what I had on my body—Powell then said I had no right to speak a word about the Charter, unless I was possessed of arms, and determined to maintain my rights—he asked me if I had got a pistol first, and then if I had a sword—I said I had not—he then asked where my residence was—I did not tell him—he said, "You are not worth a d----as a Chartist, unless you have got arms"—I told him if he said anything more to me about those sort of arms, I would get out of the society altogether—he then left me—I did not see him go among the crowd—I saw no more of him that day.

Cross-examined by
MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL. Q. What locality do you—belong to? A. I belong to no locality; I am a Chartist, but I have not been possessed of a Chartist card, or belonged to any locality, since the night I and Powell joined the Wat Tyler Brigade—that is' the only night I was in his company, and he knows that perfectly well—I am not acquainted with the exact night, but it was some time after 23rd April—I had often been to Cartwright's at my meal-times, but I never joined in the locality there—the Wat Tyler Brigade used to be held at a beer-shop at Hoxton, but it is broken up—I do not know the sign of the house—I remember the night the parties were apprehended—I was at Cartwright's that night with Powell, and went along with him up part of Golden-lane, and he showed me the arms he was possessed of, and asked whether I would tell him where I lived—I am speaking of the 16th—I went with him as far as the top of Old-street-road—he showed me part of a sword, and said, "You see I am prepared for the Government, and if you tell me where you live, I will bring you a dagger?"—he had seen me the night before in Old-street-road: Fay was not there—I was at Cartwright's the night before, but did not see Fay there, I do not know whether he was there or not, but I never saw him—I may have seen him, bat not to swear to him—(looking at the prisoners) I believe I know every one of these gentlemen on looking at them, but before you told me their Dames, I did not know them—I did not see any of them at Cartwright's on the night of 15th—I do not know Abel—it was the night before the Chartists were apprehended, that Powell spoke to me—he did not ask rue to go to the Orange Tree—he asked me whether I was prepared to come out and fight at eight o'clock that night—this was before the committee was postponed, before the case was postponed—I do not know when the case was postponed to; he did not tell me, but he said it was postponed for that night—I met him twice that night, first about a quarter to six, as I was going home, and again between eight and nine, when he told me it was postponed till the next night

at nine precisely—he told me that as I was not possessed of any arms, I must either join the Seven Dials or the Tower Hamlets party, as there were several gun-shops that were to be broken into, and there I might provide myself with arms—he did not tell me where I was to get gunpowder—I had no leader but Powell—I believe he was the chief leader that I knew anything at all about—the Tower Hamlets and Seven-dials would have been strange places to me, but according to what he told me, I was only to mix up with the mob that was to be assembled there to get what arms I could—I went home to my bed along with my wife the night the fire was to take place—I am a regular physical force man, but I would rather be at home with my wife than fighting—I did not say I was a regular physical force man, because I opposed Powell's motion as to physical force—I should have been on the committee, only for opposing Powell as a physical force man—I did not hear other persons besides Powell talk of the meeting that was to take place on the Wednesday—I did not listen to any one, and did not inquire—I had the advice of men before me, who knew very well what the case was, and I took their advice, and took care that no man should ensnare me—it was nothing else but reading the Northern Star that led me to be what Iwas—I was determined not to be ensnared—although Powell tried all he could, be never could find out ray residence—he asked me three nights running before the job was to take place, where my residence was, that he might provide me with arms.

Q. Then the job was to take place? A. I do not know that: that was Powell's assertion—there were not many persons at Cartwright's the night before the Chartists were taken; not when I was there—I believe I was there the firs time about a quarter-past six o'clock, and the last time about a quarter-pal eight, and I do not think there were more than seven or eight—I do not know Payne or Carter; I know Cuffey perfectly well—I did not see his there; I have never seen him at Cartwright's—the only time I have ever seen him was at the institution, in John-street—I only recollect seeing; Lacey once in my life, and where that was I cannot recollect—I believe I have seen Fay several times, but where I cannot recollect.

do with it, I thought I would not have any connection with it, any more whatever, because I felt convinced it would be hurtful to me even to come here tell this statement, and I thought I should have no further use for it—I wrote it on the impulse of the moment, and felt I had no further necessity for it when I came to consider my own actions—I found a party had been inquiring for me, and wanted to speak to me on this trial—I had my work to attend to and could not support my wife and children, unless I attended to it, last Monday I met a man who I do not know—he gave me a subpoena to come here—I did not offer myself, not to that party—I said when I found I was wanted, I would come forward rather than see the men sacrificed—I was at Kennington-common meeting, but not at Clerkenwell, or Finsbury-square, or when they marched round London—I have been at meetings at Bonner'-fields—I have been at Dean-street three or four times—I know Barry—I was not at a meeting when a paper was read, "To hell with the Queen"—I did not hear Crowe speak or Looney—I do not know whether the people that met at Dean-street were Chartists or Confederates—they talked of the affairs of both Irish and English—I saw Cuffey outside the door at the meeting at Dean-street on the Kith Aug., not in the meeting—I did not see him lock the door—I did not stay till the meeting ended—he was there two or three minutes—I did not speak to him—I had known him three, four, or five years—I hare never seen Fay or Lacey—Cartwright's was my place—I was at home on the night of the 15th—I did not go to Cartwright's, or Dean-street, or to any; meeting—the last time I was at Cartwright's before the 16th, was one Sunday night, about three weeks before this arrest—I do not know Carter, or Gill by name, nor Donaldson—the only public meetings I have been to, are Kenning-ton-common and Bonner's fields—I have attended public meetings, Anti-Con law, Poor-law, and so forth, but none since 10th April, except Cartwrigii's—a meeting was called by one of the speakers at Cartwright's, inviting parties to come forward and join the association, and by doing so they would be benefiting the cause of the Irish Confederation, and those who did not join they considered ought not to mix themselves up with the affair, unless they brought members—Dwaine was there—I got up, and asked if their object was peaceable, legal, and constitutional—the consequence was that I was cried down by the parties—Powell, who was there, said, "That is a b----y moral-force coward"—he pointed me out, cried me down, and those that were in connection with him—three or four made themselves very busy—about 100 were there—I do not know their names, they were strangers, I never made it my business to ask names, because I was suspected, not being a member, of being at different meetings to be inquisitive—I cannot say whether it was 4th Aug.—it was on a Sunday, a fortnight or three weeks before the arrest—I do not know Mullins, Dowling, Rose, Payne, or Bassett.

shot and could supply Stanton with it, neither powder nor shot, not to any one nothing of the kind—I never told Stanton if he would buy them he could pay so much a week in the best manner he could—I was attending Chartist meetings at the time I offered the pistols for sale—I never told Stanton the police Intended to arrest all the Chartists, and he had better have a pike to defend himself—I have had very little conversation with him—I did not tell him the police intended to arrest all or any of the Chartists—I never advised him to have a pike—I never had but two guns, two swords, and a pair of pistols, in my possession—I have got one old sword at home now—I have not shown them to a great number of the labouring classes—they are exposed for sale in the shop, and the pistols I have got now—I never said, while they were lying on the counter, to different people, that I wished I had a place where they could practise firing them, that they might serve out the b----blue devils—I understand Stanton once met me coming-out of the police-station at Blackheath hill, I did not see him—he did not speak to me—he never has done so, I am certain—I did not tell him I had been there to repair the inspector's boots—I have called and showed one person a pair of boots I had to repair for the inspector, but not at the time he said I came out of the station-house—I know Joseph Munday—he might be present when I tried to sell a musket to a man named Sheedey—I did not hear Munday persuade him not to buy it—I did not turn round and say Munday ought to be ashamed of himself, as he knew the Chartists were arriving in London—I never made use of the expression—I saw Munday at the Druids' Arms in June, I do not remember any particular night—he is a Chartist and a Confederate—I offered to sell him a brace of pistols for 16s., having a pair to dispose of—I cleaned them, having served for years to the gun-making trade—I was to give 12s. for them, whether I sold them or not—he wanted to buy a pair, I offered him them for 16s., he thought it too much; and I told him who I bought them of, and how much I was to give for them—I never said they were good ones to fire—I never let them off—he did not ask me if they were good ones to fire, and I did not say I should like to have the b----old Duke of Wellington before me to try them—he refused to buy them at 16s.—when the Duke of Wellington has been blamed, in the Druids' Arms, as a bad general, I have supported him—I know Henry Heath—he carries on business, in the same street with me—I had a room in his house—I left about 4s. or 6s. rent owing, but I left two tea-caddies or work-boxes as security for it till I could recover myself—it was between six and seven years ago—I swear there was not 3l. 4s. owing, or 1l.—there was nothing in the tea-caddies, to my knowledge—he afterwards agreed to keep them for the amount I owed him—one was brass-bound—I did not call on him, I to my knowledge, about twelve months ago, and ask him to help me in forming a Chartist club in Greenwich, for it was formed before—I swear I never asked him, or any other man, to join a Chartist club—I may have asked him to come up to the meeting for the benefit of the landlord, that is all—I may have asked 100 or 150 to do so in the course of my time—I swear I have not asked 500—I think Heath declined; I am not certain—I never saw him there—I do not know that he refused—I will not say he refused, or said he would come—he never did come—my interest or the landlord was because he was a young and inexperienced man from the country, when he took the house it cost him more money than the house was worth, and I knew it, and took it in hand to get customers for the house; and if a deputation came down from London, I considered they should have their Private meetings there—I secreted myself, heard their conversation, and

reported to Mr. Mallilaew, the superintendant of police, what was being formed in the town—he advised that the meetings should be allowed to be held as long as nothing was going on—he said he would send policemen there, and he did—I did not advise the people to come to the meeting—I took people there for the landlord's benefit, as the house was doing nothing—the persons applied to the landlord for the room, but not in my presence—the landlord has paid me for soliciting custom to the house—I was paid for my friendship if I wanted half-a-sovereign or five shillings, the landlord has given it—there was no stipulated mode of payment—I never showed Heath some and said I brought them down from London, and was going to take them to the Druids' Arms—he did not say that no sensible man would talk in that way—I never begged him to go to the Druids' Arms, as he would there hear arguments that would convince him—I only advised him or any one to go for the sake of what they would spend on the landlord, and not for any good to the;. selves—I did not say they would benefit by the speeches—I considered just the contrary—I do not know that it would do them harm—the speeches. I am confident, would do nobody any good—I do not particularly remember the birth of Her Majesty's last child—I did not allude to it to Heath—I never used any disrespectful expressions about that child to him—I never said to him, "Now you will see what we can do, we shall soon all be ready," or words to that effect—I told him I had joined the Chartists—I did not say I was one—Heath was not a Chartist—I do not believe he ever attended any meeting, for the benefit of the landlord, or any other party—I know parish—I do not know his Christian name—I do not know that I told him I had got up a Chartist association at Greenwich—he is a Chartist—he belonged to it before I did—I never told him so—I told him I had bought two guns at a sale, and had got them cheap, which I had—I did not say, "You shall have them cheap, as guns are wanted"—I said I had bought them cheap, and should sell them cheap—I did not say "As guns were wanted"—I saw his on 16th Aug., on Blackheath-hill, between one and two o'clock—I may have said, "You are the very man I want to see," or something to that effect—he said, "What's up? "or something to that effect—I believe I said that was the night the blow was to be struck—I did not ask him if he would come up—I asked him to wait at the Druids' Arms till I came down from London at eight o'clock—he was then going to his dinner—that was to keep him out of mischief—I did not put my hand to my breast and say, "I am ready" nothing of the kind—I never carried any thing in my breast-pocket—I thought you inferred I had something there, that is why I say that—I know William Robinson of 1, Green's-cottages, Skilton-street—I did not see him on Sunday 9th April, to my knowledge—I saw him the Thursday before—I will not be certain whether that was the last time I saw him before the 10th, for I was ill at the time—I did not then propose to him a meeting at the Druids'Arms on the following Tuesday—I did afterwards—I did not belong to the Charts then, and did not know what their principles were—I did not offer him a pair of pistols to go up with to the meeting that was to be held on Whit-Monday—I offered him a pair of pistols, or any one else who would buy them for 16s.—they were in my window—I carried them with me when I went to the meeting have never offered them for sale—I took them to the meeting, I have told them of them, but never offered them—I carried them in my breeches pocket loaded both in one pocket—they were pocket-pistols—they are at Greenwich—I did not succeed in selling them—I would have, if I could—I told the Jury yesterpay or the day before that I needed them for my protection—if I had sold them 1 should have brought another pair for my protection, and got some

thing for profit—I should have taken the chance in the meantime—I do not Remember telling Robinson I had been a witness in the County Court at Greenwich, it was well known—it was an action for assault—I know John Ward—he is a farrier, or smith—I never asked him to attend Chartist meetings—he is leader of the Confederates—I never told him physical force was the best thing—I never advised it to anybody—I told him, for the sake of his family, to be careful what he was about, in case he should get into trouble—I never advocated physical force—I knew the man, and did not wish to see him throw himself away—I knew if he said anything I should report it—I did not say to him "Physical force is the only thing," or words to thai effect—I believe I asked him on Whit-Monday if he was going to the meeting at Bonner's-fields—I did not tell him I was going armed, or advise him to go armed; I advised him to stop at home—I told him I was going, but it was not worth his while to lose his work to go to the meeting, and he had better stop at home—I did not get up a raffle for arms—the pistols were attempted to be raffled, but they were not, because I returned the money—I originally proposed it, but there was not a paper drawn—there were to be sixteen shilling chances—a person named Brewerton gave me 1s., that was the only one, I returned it him, as it never came to a raffle—it was at my shop—I told Ward, and a good many people, there was to be an outbreak in London—that was to keep them away—I told them to keep away, for they would never get the day—I told Ward and Sheedey so—I did not tell Ward I was going to reconnoitre the town, or examine the town, to ascertain the point of attack; nothing of the kind—I said I would get up early with Bligh, to see if there was a chance of a riot taking place, and if there was, we would get out of danger—that was why I went to Bonner'sfields—Robinson very likely saw me tear the covers off some old books, I do not remember his seeing it—I said I should give them to Blagden, the landlord of the Druids' Arms, for wadding, as he was going into the country to shoot—I do not remember whether that was to Ward or Robinson—I dare say Blagden could show you the best part of it now—I recollect Ward and Robinson proposing to dissolve the association—I cannot tell you the date—it was on a Sunday evening in July or Aug.—it was through a speech made by Bligh—I opposed it—I never addressed a meeting in my life—I merely said in private conversation with three of us, "Why should you wish to break the meeting up?"—Bligh commenced it by asking the members to support Looney's wife, and said the club would receive their money—I opposed a dissolution, because I thought it would injure the landlord if the trade was to go away from the house—I did not say they were a parcel of cowards, to my recollection—I cannot remember every word that took place three months back—I may have made use of the word coward on account of being frightened at Bligh's stating that the officers of the club were ready to receive subscriptions for the support of Looney's family—I used the word "coward" to prevent them dissolving the club—the club broke up then, notwithstanding my calling them cowards—I did not then pull out my pistols and say if anybody attempted to take me I would blow their brains out; never in my life—I had not the pistols with me—I never said what 1 would do if anybody had a disposition to arrest me—nothing was said about arresting, or attempting to arrest, to my knowledge—I do not believe I said if anybody attempted to arrest me, I would blow their brains out—to the best of my knowledge I never made use of the term—I do not believe I said it—I have used a great many expressions—I cannot swear it—I possibly made use of the expression—it was merely to throw them off their guard, but I forget it if I did-there are not billiards at the Druids'

Arms; there is bagatelle and dominoes—I played every night, or nearly so—very seldom for money, but for liquor—sometimes there was a bet on it.

MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL. Q. Did you, from time to time, report to Inspector Marks what had occurred at the Druids' Arms, as well as other places? A. I did; it was taken down by him; I signed it—I have carried on the business of a broker and shoemaker near on twelve months—I was a shoemaker when I had a room at Heath's, seven years ago—I was not well off when I went there but through working early and late I saved 2s. or 3s., and got the shop—I only went in with two or three shillings—I have been thriving since—I have been at the shop seven years next April—it was at a sale three months ago of Mr. Toolm's, a large auctioneer in London-street, Greenwich, that I bought the gun, pistols, and sword—I bought the two guns and sword for 4s. 6d., and the pistols for 12s.—I did not have the old iron sword at the sale that was bought at the Druids' Arms—they were at my door and window for sale and were sold in three or four days—Stanton was formerly a policeman-! did not know him as one—I have known him four or five years—Le came to see people that worked for me, and told me he was one—that was before the time I had conversation with him—he was not a Chartist to my knowledge then—I believe he is not now, but they would not let him work as asssistant grave-digger at the parish church if he went into that house—he is assistant grave-digger, merely a jobber—Munday is a Chartist, and I believe a Confederate, but I will not be certain; he is a shoemaker—Heath is not a Chartist, he keeps a shop now; he did not when I first lived with him—he is a boot-closer—there is a little animosity between Wright, who works for me, and him, because Wright had a boy apprenticed to him—Parish is a Chartist and Confederate, I have known him, I suppose about a month—he is a blacksmith, working for Mr. Mackie at Blackheath-hill—Robinson is a shoemaker, and a very violent Chartist—Bligh made a very violent speech at a meeting, and at the conclusion called on the persons present to contrite to the support of the wife and family of Looney, who is in confinement, and said the officers of the club were ready to receive the money, and his fried Mr. Ward—Ward was a Chartist and Confederate—he had a good situation in Greenwich, in constant work, and he thought by being called an officer of the club, he should be arrested and loose his work, and his family would be starving—he found fault with Bligh for using that term, knowing there was no club formed, and Bligh said, "You know there is no club, you cannot be hurt for it;" and I said, "You must be cowards to leave it in that way"—the club was never dissolved—some kept away, and some came—no officers were appointed to the club—we used to meet and read the newspapers, and sometimes make a speech, but Bligh was the principal spokesman, with the exception of when Looney came down from London—he came several times, and other persons—M'Manus, and the two Barry's, and Bailey, were there—those are all the names I recollect—they were Confederates, I understand, from the Davis Club—Looney was not at Greenwich, to my knowledge, when the people walked round the town, he might have been the Sunday before.





JOHN STANTON
. I am a labouring man. I was fomerly a policeman of the R division—I have known Davis for the last two years—about three months ago, he asked me to join the Wat Tyler Division of Chartists at Greenwich—he offered to sell me a pike—head for 2s. 6d., and handle it for 3s. 6d.; and if that would not suit me, he had a brace of pistols, and plenty of powder and ball—he did not show me the pike—head; he said he would go to London and get it for me—I was to pay for it by instalments in the best manner I could, as I was out of employment—he said he had a place in London

where be could purchase such tilings—he said the police were going to arrest all the Chartists, and I had better have a pike to defend myself; he expected perhaps the police might drop in on us some time when we were little aware of it; that he had powder and shot in his possession, and he could supply me or any of us that wanted it, up-stairs in the club-room at the Druids' Arms, that he wished he had a place where they could practise firing, as they would serve out those b----blue devils, only he said he thought it would annoy tie neighbours—he held a long fowling-piece in his hand—I did not speak to him or he to me when he came out of the Blackheath station; he took care of that, for he ran away like a dog with a tin-kettle tied to his tail.

Cross-examined by
MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL. Q. He did not want you to see him come from the station? A. Of course not, he was my class-leader, as he termed himself—I was a Chartist at that time, under him—I hare been assistant grave-digger—I have a wife and family to maintain—I was never in the P division of police—I joined the R division when it first went to Greenwich—I was in the service five years and a half—I gave up my clothes, because I took work on the Greenwich Railway—I got 18s. a week for that—I had 19s. a week in the police, but I had not so many masters over me as I had in the police—I was not discharged from the police for taking improper liberties with the wife of one of my fellow-constables—I was not discharged, I gave in my resignation, and gave my clothes up to the sergeant Imuse I bad a better situation to go to, I had not such an eye over me as I had in the police—in the police I paid 2s. a week for my clothes, and 1s. for my lodging—my money was 1l. 1s. a week, 2s. was stopped, which left 19s., and single men living in the station have to pay 1s. a week for their lodging—I had 19s. a week and my clothes—I had clothes every year—as far as I can say, I had had the clothes which I gave up three or four months—we generally received them in May—Mr. Philpot sent sergeant Mallilaeiv to take my clothes—the sergeant went with me to my house—I gave up my clothes within the next week, and received the balance of wages due to me—I was at work six days last week at Greenwich Iron-works, earning 1l. 1s. a week—the week before that, I was lumping, unloading a ship, for three days—this-week I have been at work at Blackheath—I worked Tuesday and to-day, when I was called on to come here, for Mr. Robertson, the wheelwright—I suppose I have been a Chartist nearly five months—Davis first asked me to join them, five or six months ago—he said it would he a benefit to me and my family—it was with his wishes and proposal—he made me such good promises, and said bricks were made all in a minute—I saw the pistols in his hand at his shop—he did not take them out of the window—I saw three guns in his shop, but it did not matter what it was I wanted, gun, pistol, or anything, if I had money to have purchased it, and he would have furnished me with powder and shot as well, if I had been destitute—he said he had guns at 6s. 6d., 7s., 6d., and different prices—he had a large fowling-piece and a soldier's musket—he took up the gun at his shop-door, and said, "What do you think of this? do not you think this would do if it was loaded, to shoot the b----y blue devils?"—I went over to the Druids' Arms—he came over soon afterwards—there were three men with me—John Matthews was one—I cannot recollect the names exactly now—a gentleman named Ward, of Blackheath, asked me questions, and said, "You are wanted at the Old Bailey to speak the truth"—I told him what I knew, this morning before I started—a gentleman who was with him, wrote down what I said—I do not know who that was—I saw Ward last evening coming

out of the shop where he was at work—we did not talk about this—he did not say a word to me about Davis—I had not been in the habit of topping to him—I said, "There you are John," and away I went—he is a Chartist—he is chairman of the Confederates' Club—I was not a Confederate—I did not go to the meeting of 10th April—I only went to one on Blackheath—I hered several persons speak, I did not hear Looney—I have heard him speak in a room—I have heard Ernest Jones speak there—I heard Sharpe speak at the Three Crowns one night—I have heard Vernon speak on the Heath—the prisoners are all strangers to me, I never saw them—I am a lucky man that I am not in the same situation.

MR. HUDDLESTON. Q. You have a wife, and how many children? A. Four—I left the police because I wanted to go on the railroad—I had over time on the railroad, and was paid for it—I had overtime when a polices—I could earn 26s. or 27s. a week at the railway, and have my Sunday to myself, and my night always in bed—I was at work this morning when I was subpoenaed—I have never attended Reform or Anti-Corn Law meetings and never went out of Greenwich to see anything of the kind—I have heard a good many people speak.





HENRY JOHN HEATH
. I am a master boot-maker. Davis had a room a my house six or seven years ago, as near as I can recollect—about twelve months ago, he asked me to join a Chartist club—he showed me some guns which he said he had brought from London, and was going to take to the Druids' Arms—he had pistols at one time, and afterwards a gun—is said he was in the habit of going to London, and purchasing arms to supply the Chartists with—I said to him that no sensible man would talk in the way—he advised me to go to the Druids' Arms, where I should hear arguments to convince me—after the birth of Her Majesty's last child, Davis something disrespectful in reference to its birth—about six days before 16th Aug., the 11th as near as 1 can recollect, he said to me, "Now you will soon see what we can do; we shall soon all be ready "—he said he was a Chartist. and asked me to join them—I am not one—I refused, and ridiculed him.

Cross-examined by
MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL. Q. It is your brother that is a Chartist? A. I do not know—Davis said he was a Chartist, not that had joined them—I mentioned what I could state, to Mr. Roberts yesterday, after nine o'clock at night—Mr. Bellus, who I know, sent Holmes to me, who was a stranger to me—I had told Bellus on Saturday that Mr. Davis, the great Chartist leader at Greenwich, was supposed to be a spy; that he had tried to make me one of himself, but being such a character I could not place any faith in him, provided my principles laid that way—that was why Bellas Holmes to me—Bellus is not a Chartist that I know of—I was not afraid Davis was coming as a witness—I said he was a spy, because it was reported in the neighbourhood for some weeks—by a spy, I mean a man to deceive another—I was not mixed up with the Chartists—Frederick Martin, a carpenter, came into my shop, and said he would have a word about Davis respecting this spy, and Davis said be would give him 2s. worth—that was the first I heard—I knew Davis as a Chartist by his words and actions—I never saw him at the Druids' Arms—I never was at a Chartist meeting, only public meetings—only one where Chartists were mentioned—that was at the Lecture-hall, Greenwich—I know Wright—he works for Davis—he has never had me up for illtreating an apprentice—I have an apprentice, who is a foster child of Wright's wife, and is a cripple—he was sent to the hospital from my bouse—Nature is not favourable to everybody, it was no fault of mine—he

was hump-backed when he was apprenticed to me—that was all that was the matter with him—he went to the hospital for a pain in his side—no one took him from my place—he went up himself several times and got advice—Wright's wife has not threatened me for ill-using him—I never spoke to her in my life—Wright has never complained to me nor anybody—it is only the boy's own temper—he has accused me of his hump-back—he has not accused me of kicking him in the side, or striking him, or shoving him down stairs—I have a greengrocer's shop and a coal-shed—some nuts had been stolen, and I met the boy cracking them—I shoved him over some coals there—he never complained, but since that he has been trying to make out that the hump-back was caused by it—he tried to raise that three months ago—there has been no illwill between Wright and me—we have always been nn good terms; only while the boy was in the hospital, he wanted me to bear all the expense of it, and to find him in everything—everything has gone on right, and at the last conversation I had with him he advised the boy to behave better—the boy fell on the coals on his hands—I was rather in a passion, and cannot say whether he fell sideways or backwards—his face was towards me when he ell, but he never went plump down, as the wall kept him up—befell over a heap of coals, and partly of wood and rubbish, which had been swept up in one corner.

MR. HUDDLESTON. Q. What relation was he to Wright? A. None Whatever—a woman had had five bastard children, Mrs. Wright was in the habit of nursing them, Mr. Wright was in the habit of fetching her back-wards and forwards and one child was apprenticed to me under false pretences—I sell firewood and greengrocery, but not coals—I have given up the shoe-making two years and a half—when this happened to the boy, a partition went across to part off the place where I carried on the shoemaking—he had nothing to do with the greengrocer's shop—he was apprenticed to me as a boot-maker—I caught him in the greengrocer's shop, and found some nuts in his mouth—I came on him suddenly—I had missed nuts before, and money—no complaint was made by the boy or his friends for two years—I had to complain of him in the meantime—I had complained to Wright plenty of times of his idleness before he brought the charge against me—he merely said when he had been vexed—if you had him here he would say I did not do it—when he complained of bis back, I gave him leave to go to the hospital—the people there thought he had better go into the hospital, and I allowed him—it was about a month ago—the only quarrel between me and Wright was because he wanted me to pay part of the expenses—I gave the boy 1s. while he was there, and took him apples and pudding, and did his washing—his friends never took him a halfpenny.

COURT. Q. I suppose, by the indentures, you were bound to keep him? A. Yes—Wright said I ought regularly to supply him with tea, sugar, and refreshments—I said he should want for nothing, but I thought his friends ought to do something for him, as he was doing no work for me—Holmes introduced himself to me as a friend of Bellus, whom I knew—Mr. Roberts, the attorney, came and took down my evidence—I told him what I have told you to-day.





JOSEPH DUNN
. I am a hat-manufacturer, of 128, London-wall—I have lived there about a year and a half—before that, I lived at 82, Chiswell-street, finsbury, and carried on the same business. I am a Chartist—up to Aug., 1846 I was a member of the National Charter Association—I am not so now—I have attended meetings lately—I was not a member in 1848—a similar card

to the one produced was used in 1846—this is not exactly the same plan of organization as was used in 1846—it has been revised since—I do not see any very important difference—the plans of organization are similar to those which existed in my time—I was a member about six years, from the foundstion up to 1846, and took an active part up to that time—I held of be—I was president of the City of London branch, and treasurer—I always considered the object was to obtain the Charter by peaceable and constitutional means, otherwise I should not have mixed myself up with it—I never witnessed any secret proceedings in the society—there were none in ray department—there were delegates at that time—the plans for class-leaders were laid down, but not acted on.

I am a Chartist by political sentiments—I have been a member of the National Charter Association eight or nine years—(looking at one of the cards produced) this is a card of membership used by the National Charter Association—I never understood that its object was otherwise than to obtain the people's Charterer peaceable and constitutional means—there is something about class-leaders on this plan of organization (produced)—I do not see anything about delegates—this is the plan of organization now recognized—there have been revisions of it—there is nothing connected with the Association, or the means which it employs illegal, unconstitutional, or otherwise than peaceable—there is nothing about arms in this paper—there is nothing about arms connected with the Association—it is not a secret association, club, or confederacy—any one may join it, on the condition that he enters his name on the books, and subscribes to the six points of the Charter—to my knowledge, it has no secret correspondence with any other association—it was not formed for the purpose of raising insunecte or rebellion in this country.

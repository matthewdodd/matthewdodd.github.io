Q. Do you know the prisoner. - A. Yes he lived in the service of Usher and Co. in June last. On the 25th of last June, at eight o'clock in the morning, previous to the bell ringing, I went to the necessary, I saw the prisoner at the bar come and make a plunge close to the partition, I had a full view of him, there was a crevise in the partition that I could put my little finger through; I watched him narrowly, he looked round every way, I could not see what it was, I saw him go into the men's necessary directly opposite with something he had taken up behind a basket, or under the basket, I do not know which; he stopped in the men's necessary two or three minutes, and, when he came out I called to the other foreman 
               
                  George 
                  Kemble
               



            ; we took him into the melting house - I insisted upon searching him, he surrendered it, partly out of his small clothes, and part flung round his body.
Q. What was it. - A. Half a pig of lead, it weighed sixty five pound.
Q. Whose lead was it - A. The property of the firm. I went for an officer; the other foreman let him go away, he never come any more.

            . I came to the assistance of the other foreman; the prisoner took the lead from under his waistcoat and out of his breeches; the prisoner made his escape from me, I was not strong enough to hold him; he went away the 26th of June, and was taken a little before Christmas.
Prisoners Defence. Kemble told me to go to my breakfast, then he said there would be no more bother. I went to my breakfast and went down to my old master, and worked there till they took me up. I am innocent of the crime I am charged with; on my being in the melting house I saw that lay in the yard, I carried it through the yard openly in order to melt it down the next day, it was not done with intent to carry away.

            . I was coming along Fleet-street


 on the 11th of Feb. between seven and eight of the clock at night, there was no body near me but the prisoner; I felt something at my pocket, and turning about, saw the prisoner had my handkerchief in his hand. I charged him with stealing my handkerchief, upon which he immediately ran away, but was taken. There was an evidence saw him drop the handkerchief, but he is now ill in bed. I carried him before Justice Fielding, who sent me back with him into the city, the fact being committed there. Coming along he pulled out a knife, and swore he would stick me if I would not let him go. He got away, but I knocked him down, and retook him again, and took up the knife, [producing it in court] the prisoner said if ever he got his liberty, and could meet me in an open field, he would make fine sport with me.
Prisoner's defence.
I was not near him, and know nothing of this handkerchief; they took and dragged me about, and knocked me down, and used me very ill.



               Guilty
            .
After the prisoner found he was 


               to be transported
            , he thanked the court, and said, if he had staid at home he should have been hanged in three sessions more.

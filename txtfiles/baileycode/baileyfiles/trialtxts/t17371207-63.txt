            . On the 7th of November, I lost 2 pieces of Check, and between 20 and 30 pair of Stockings, from my Shop in Petty france, Westminster





. I suspected a parcel of Boys, and took the Prisoner up on Suspicion; another of them is made an Evidence. I took one Southall first, and he told me, that my Check was sold to the Prisoner Correl, in Thieving-lane





, and the Stockings were sold in Pairs about the Streets. I went with the Constable to Correl's House, and ask'd him for the 2 pieces of Check, he deny'd them, and said he had no such Goods; but at last he told us we should have them, and bid his Wife fetch them. She went with the Constable, and he brought them to me.

            , my self, the Prisoner and

                  Smith 
               



            , went to Mrs. Wilbey's Shop, about a Month ago. Smith put his Arm over the Hatch, and unbolted it. Then he went in and took 2 Bundles of Check: I took it from him and gave it to Southall. He went in a second Time and took out a Bundle of Stockings; we carried all to Correl's House. Chap was with us, and went out with us upon this Business. Smith and Alexander lodged in Correl's House; he gave us but 5 s. for the two Peices of Linnen and we were obliged to carry off the Stockings from his House, because Southall having offer'd a pair of them to a Soldier, at a Cook's-Shop, next Door to Correl's, he stopp'd them, and we were afraid of being pursu'd. Alexander receiv'd the Money from Correl for the Check, and we were to have our Shares the next Morning, but the Constable came and took me out of Bed. Correl us'd to buy the Goods we brought him.
Wilbey. There was above 20 Yards of the Check, I am sure and 'twas worth a Shilling a Yard.

            , Constable. I search'd Correl's House with a Warrant, and not finding the Goods, I charged him with knowing something of them: At first he deny'd them, but at last, he told me, if I would not hurt him, he would tell me where they were. I said, if it was in my Power, I would do him what Service I could. Upon this he carry'd me to a Cockloft, on the Top of his House, and there he grop'd about, for a quarter of an Hour. I bid him not sham with me, I must (I said) know where they were. At last he bid his Wife fetch them, and she brought me these Peices of Check.
Wibley. These are the Goods I lost.
Chap's Defence. Smith dropp'd 2 pair of Stockings out of his Lap; I found them and sold them for 6 d.
Correl. They receiv'd no Goods from me, nor do I know any Thing of them.
Several People appear'd to Correl's Character: Some of whom said, he kept a two-penny Lodging House, in Thieving Lane, and some, that they believed him to be superannuated. The Jury found Chap 


               Guilty, 4 s 10 d.
             Correl 

               Guilty

            . I lost a Roll of Ticken out of my Shop, and the Prisoner Chap being taken, with the rest of the Boys, I went to him, and he told me, my Ticken was sold to Correl.

            . Southall lifted up Mr. Horner's Sash, and pull'd the Shoes within Reach with his Crutch, (for he was a lame Boy;) Chap was not in our Company then; but 2 or 3 Days afterwards we all went with him, and Southall then took the Roll of Ticken out of the Window and gave it to Chap. We cut off a Peice and went with it to a Pawnbroker's in the Broad-Way, Westminster, but they would not take it in, so we sold it to a Soldier, and Correl bought the rest, for half a Crown or 3 s.
Horner. The Roll that I lost was worth about 20 Shillings.
Adams, Constable. Correl's Wife brought me this Ticken with the Check. I did not ask for this.

            , Chap own'd that he and the rest of the Boys, had taken the Things out of the Window, and that the Ticken was sold to Correl. I went upon this to Correl, and ask'd him for it. He said, he knew nothing of it, at first, but afterwards he told the Constable, if he would not hurt him, he would see the Goods forth coming, and he sent his Wife out for them.
The Jury found them both 

               Guilty
             as above.

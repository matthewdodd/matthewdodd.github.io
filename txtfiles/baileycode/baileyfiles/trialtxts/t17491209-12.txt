            . I live in Tower-street, I am a grocer: between six or seven in the morning on the 26th of Nov. a person knocked at my door and said, some body had broke into my shop; I got up, and called some of my servants, we went to the money drawer, and found all was gone; a parcel of halfpence, and 3 s. 6 d. in silver, and by looking about the shop, we found the prisoner concealed in a rice barrel. I asked him how he got into the shop, he said he pulled the paniel out from the window with his hands; we saw marks made with some iron instrument to wrench it out; we f ound a parcel of half pence in his pocket: which he said he took out of my drawer, there were 7 s and odd in half pence.

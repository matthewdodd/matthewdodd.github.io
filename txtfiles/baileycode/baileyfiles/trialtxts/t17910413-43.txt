             sworn.
I keep the Queen's-head, at Knights-bridge. On Wednesday, the 9th of last March, I saw the prisoners passing my door, in company together; one had a bag on his head (Charles Beale), with something in it; I gave notice to Mr. Fenn, the constable, and in the space of five minutes he took him into custody; the bag was examined, and I saw ten iron bars; I secured one of them.


                  WILLIAM
                   FENN
               



             sworn.
I am the constable of Knightsbridge: I stopped the prisoners, and asked 
               
                  Charles
                   Beale
               



             what he had got on his head; he said, What is that to you? it was nothing: I took it from them, and secured the lads; they all said they had got nothing they were afraid of: I found ten iron bars, and three pieces of lead. (Produced.) I found nothing upon them else but a knife: I took them to Justice Bond, and they were committed.
What time of the day was this? - Between eight and nine in the morning.

Did you ever go to the Duke's seat, and see if any thing had been missed? - I did, and found all these bars missing.

             sworn.
I am a carpenter; I believe them to be the Duke's property; I put these all into the fence, and they fitted.

             sworn.
I am a labourer. On Wednesday, the 9th of March, about a quarter before six in the morning, I met

                   Beale

                   Harcombe
               



             in a path that leads from Isleworth to Brentford-road; I saw 
               
                  James
                   Beale
               



             inside a tree in Sion-park: when I got into the park, I said to Hyde, there is the other brother behind the tree, 
               
                  James
                   Beale
               



            ; so we made a full stop; and when he saw that, he went to the other two, with a small bundle under his arm; I went on to my work, and saw no more of them.

                   Harcombe
               



             and George Beale walk up the path together, as Morris and I were going to work, and saw 
               
                  James
                   Beale
               



             behind a tree; says I, Morris, let us give a bit of a stop; upon which he went out of the park: I am sure they are the same as we saw about a quarter before six in the morning of the 9th of March.
To Mr. Hooseby. How far from the gate might these things be taken away from where these two witnesses saw the three prisoners? - About 100 yards from where he might see the men.
Is the railing fixed to any building? - It is fixed to a lodge inhabited by the steward.
ROB. HARCOMBE's DEFENCE.
We were all three of us coming up to London to look after work, and we picked them up along-side of the road.
- BELL sworn.
I am steward to his Grace of Northumberland; the lodge is used with his mansion, and connected with it by a wall as well as by these rails.

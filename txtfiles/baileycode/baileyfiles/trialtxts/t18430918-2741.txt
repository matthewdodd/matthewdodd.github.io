CHARLES HILLIER
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
9th of September, 1 watch, value 7s.; the goods of 



John Riddle.






JOHN RIDDLE
. I keep a chandler's shop, in Cambridge-terrace. On the 9th of September I was in my room looking at my watch—the prisoner came in and called for a pint of beer—another man was with him—I went into the back yard and returned directly—the prisoner was then gone, and I missed my watch—I ran out, and followed them almost to the Elephant and Castle—they ran away when they saw me—I have not found my watch.

Cross-examined by
MR. HORRY. Q. You lost sight of them by the corner? A. Yes—I cannot tell how far they were before me—as I ran some one cried out, "They have thrown it over the wall"—the prisoner went to the station quietly—he and the other man could have knocked me down if they liked, but I told them I would give them in charge—I saw another man running after them.





RUTH RIDDLE
. I am the prosecutor's wife. When I had drawn the beer I saw the prisoner come out of the room where the watch was—he had no business in that room.

Cross-examined. Q. Have you got a counter? A. Yes—he went round the counter—I was drawing the beer, and he came out and went away immediately—I had seen him and the other man come together on the Friday night before.
(Edward Roberts, a carpenter, gave the prisoner a good character.)

            . I am a green-grocer
, and live at Kensington. On the 18th of September I turned my mare out on the green in Addison-road, Kensington


, about eight o'clock in the evening - I went after her about twenty minutes before five o'clock next morning, and she was gone- I found her at Kensall-green, Harrow-road, in the custody of Brown, the constable - it was the mare I had lost.
Prisoner. Q. Where did you buy her? A. At Smithfield, of Mr. Butcher.

            . I am constable of Wilsden. In consequence of what I heard, I went down to Old Oak Common, and met the prisoner with a mare, in a cart, near Wilsden - I met the prisoner in the lane, with two men - the mare was in the field just by - I did not meet the prisoner with it - I met him in possession of Hallett and his son - I said to him, "How came you by this horse?" - he said, "It is my brother's."

            , JUN. I live at Shepherd's Bush. In consequence of something which happened, I made a search, and found the prisoner in Old Oak-lane, about ten minutes past eight o'clock in the morning - he had the mare out of the cart, about one hundred yards from the cart - the prisoner was between the shafts of the cart - he had the collar and traces (but no bridle or saddle) hanging to the shafts of the cart - the mare appeared to have drawn the cart - I asked who that mare belonged to - he said it belonged to him, or his brother, it did not matter which, for they were all one - there was no other horse there - I asked him to go with me - he said he would go with the greatest pleasure - I and my father took him along, and gave him to Brown - Arnold claimed the mare, which the prisoner said belonged to his brother.
Prisoner's Defence. The mare was lost from the Lord of the manor before he bought it - it was in St. Giles's pound- I work for the Lord of the manor, who is Sir 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Hallett
               



            , of St. Giles's, in the Aylesbury-road - she belonged to my brother at first, and she was taken in a very bad way, and took to the Red Lion, over Westminster-bridge, as you go to the Elephant and Castle; and he ordered me, on the 5th of July, if I saw the mare and cart, to take it back to the Lord of the manor - I wrote for my brother to come here - I had been to Covent-garden that day, and rode home with a man named Reed - between Chelmsford and Romford I saw this mare and cart in the road, and went on with it.

            . I had lost the mare seven weeks ago.

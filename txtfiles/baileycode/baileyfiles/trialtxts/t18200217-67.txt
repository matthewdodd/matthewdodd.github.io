. On the 2d of February, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, two women came into the shop, the prisoner followed them - they all consulted together a little while before they came into the inner door - the prisoner immediately ran off. I ran out, and saw him running across Drury-lane. I overtook him, and found the piece of stuff under his greatcoat.

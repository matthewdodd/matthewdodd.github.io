I was at this house when the prisoner was there, the 13th or 14th of June, I gave the prisoner orders to get me change for a guinea, and gave him a guinea to carry to his master; he never returned it to me, I waited a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes, then I asked Mr. Dudley for the change; he said he sent in the change by the prisoner but I never received it.
PRISONER's DEFENCE.
I laid down the change on the table in the parlour, the house was very full, and I was very busy; who took it up, I do not know.

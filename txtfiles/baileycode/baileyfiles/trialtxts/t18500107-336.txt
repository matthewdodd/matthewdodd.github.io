ALFRED FARRELL



, breaking and entering the dwelling-house of 



George Summers, and stealing 100 cigars, value 8s., his goods; having been before convicted.






RICHARD PURCELL
. I am in the service of George Summers, a tobacconist, of Mile-end Road, Stepney, and sleep there. On the night of 21st Dec. I was going from the shop to the parlour, and heard a knock, as I thought, at the next shutter—I went to the street-door, and saw the prisoner with his hand in the window, and the glass was broken—it was not broken before—he made off—I could not catch him—I called "Police!"—he was brought back, and I recognised him—I missed cigars from the window, and found several under it—the policeman brought this bundle of cigars—they are George Summers's—they are tied in a particular manner, with ribbon.






WILLIAM WILLSHIER
 (policeman, K 249). I was on the opposite side, and heard glass break, and saw the prisoner at the window—he ran away—I ran, and caught him with this bundle of cigars in his hand—he said he hoped he should be transported, that he had committed a robbery before, and asked the Judge to transport him, who refused to do so, and he was obliged to go thieving when he came out.





JAMES CLARK
 (policeman, P 108). I produce a certificate—(read—Alfred Farrell, Convicted Aug., 1848, having been before convicted, confined one year)—I was present—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 20.—


Transported for Ten Years.


Before Mr. Justice Patteson.

            . On the eleventh of this month, between six and seven in the evening, the prisoner came into our shop, and asked if I had any sea cloaths; I said, yes: my sister came out of the parlour. The prisoner desired to see a scarlet jacket. I reached down a bundle from a shelf, and he took off his cloaths, and put one on; he said it was not good enough for him and then my sister reached down another parcel of the fort of this in court. We took out one: the prisoner gave it a pull out of our hand, threw it to another man, and they both went off.

            , who were in the shop, confirmed this evidence. (The jacket was produced and deposed to by the prosecutrix.)

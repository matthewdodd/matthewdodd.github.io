WILLIAM MARTIN.
I live at the Three Pigeons public-house, Brentford. About a quarter-past four o'clock, on the 6th of June, I put my clothes in the coach-house, and went to work, when I came back I misted one shilling and two halfpence out of my waistcoat pocket—it had been safe when I put my clothes away—I saw the prisoner in the yard—in the afternoon I saw him go into the coach-house again, and when he came out, I went in—I had marked the shilling—(looking at it)—this is the same.





JOHN POOL.
I am an officer. I went after the prisoner, and found this shilling on him—he said he took it at Smithfield-markct the Monday before.

Prisoner's Defence. A man came and asked me to give him change for it, and I gave it to him.

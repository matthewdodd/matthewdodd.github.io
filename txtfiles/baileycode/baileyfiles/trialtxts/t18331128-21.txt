            . I live at No. 5, Angel-court, Throgmorton-street; on the 26th of November, between twelve and one o'clock in the afternoon, I was in Mincing-lane


, and saw the prisoner pulling a handkerchief out of Mr. Kemble's pocket; and when I got up to him, he was putting it into his own pocket - he wished to get rid of it, he struggled, and got away, and ran a few yards, and was knocked down; his hat fell off and I picked it up - I took hold of the handkerchief, or rather he gave it to me - he was stopped without my losing sight of it of it.
HENRY KEMBLE. I live at Camberwell. On the 26th of November, I was in Mincing-lane, and in consequence of what Lane stated, my attention was called to my handkerchief, which was gone from my pocket - this is mine, I have not a doubt of it.
The prisoner made no defence.

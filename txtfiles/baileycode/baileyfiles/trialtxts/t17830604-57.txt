            .
Court. Have you reason to suppose the prisoner broke open the house? - I found my things on the prisoner at the Vine at Stanmore, all tied up in a handkerchief.
When was this? - Tuesday at four or five o'clock, I went to see if I could find out the man that had them, I went to a public house, and was informed a man had been there, and had a pint of beer, who had a bundle, and a man thought the handkerchief was mine.

(Produces the bundle.)
I took these things from the prisoner, a man came to me and said a person was at the Vine whom he suspected of robbing his brother, I went there I took him into another room, and asked him how he came to rob the prosecutor, I desired him to pull a purse out of his pocket in which were eight shillings and six-pence, he said those things were given him, he seemed sorry for it, and wanted the prosecutor to forgive him.
(The prosecutor deposed to the purse, coat, and handkerchief, which were in his house on Monday morning.)
PRISONER's DEFENCE.
I was coming down Hill Field, and a man overtook me and gave me the things, he ran away over Harrow-wheel common, and I went to the Red Lion, and had two quarts of beer.

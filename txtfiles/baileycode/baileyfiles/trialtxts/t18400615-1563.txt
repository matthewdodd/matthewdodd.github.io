THOMAS HAWKINS
was indicted

for stealing, on the 
3rd of June, 1 spoon, value 5s., the goods of 



John Pullen.






ANN PULLEN.
I am the wife of John Pullen, a confectioner, in Fleetstreet. On the morning of the 3rd of June the prisoner came in, and took the spoon off the counter—a lady in the shop ran to the door, and said, "Stop thief! "—a gentleman took him, and he dropped the spoon—this is it—(looking at it.)





FREDERICK ADAMS.
I was going down Chancery-lane—there was a cry of "Stop thief! "—I took the prisoner, and as I was going back to the shop he was working the spoon down his trowsers.





GEORGE WARDLE
(City police-constable, No. 325.) I saw the prisoner in the custody of Adams—he was working something down his thigh, and presently this spoon came out from his trowsers, in going over a grating—I picked it up, and took him.

GEORGE BEAZELY
. I packed up three dozen of sherry, on 17th Nov., and put them into this hamper in the cart—they belonged to Mr. David Hart, and were in his cart—I swear to the hamper, and the direction on it—I sent it by our carman.





JOHN DAVIS
 (City-policeman, 551). I saw the three prisoners in East-cheap, about six o'clock in the evening, on 17th Nov.—Yarmouth was trying one of the errand carts—I followed the prisoners about an hour and a half—they went to the Blackwall Railway, Fenchurch-street—Broadley and Yarmouth took a hamper and carried it away—Skinner was there, about ten yards from them with a basket on his head—he could see them—I am confident he was aware of what was going on—he was merely out to look if the man in uniform was coming—I followed the two prisoners to Fenchurch-buildings.


Cross-examined by Mr. Prendergast. Q. Did they not call out to Skinner, and did he not refuse to pay any attention to them? A. Broadley gave a halloo for Skinner to join them; he did not, he had not an opportunity—he came in the direction where they were—I swear he was watching them—I was secreted under a doorway—Broadley called, Hoy, Hoy! which is a signal among thieves—I said before the Magistrate that Broadley called out to Skinner to join them, but he did not—I do not know that I said that Skinner walked towards them—Skinner told me he had just been to Billingsgate.

SKINNER—


NOT GUILTY

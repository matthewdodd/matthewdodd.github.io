            . I am a cheesemonger
, and live in Old Jewry. Last Friday night, about nine o'clock I was at the top of Newgate-street


, and felt a handkerchief drawn from my pocket, the prisoner past me, he was alone; I saw him putting something into his breast, I laid hold of him and pulled my handkerchief from under his coat. I gave him to a watchman, and gave the handkerchief to the constable of the night.
JOHN HEBBERD. I am a watchman. I heard a cry of watch, I came up and found the prosecutor holding the prisoner, I took him in charge; he begged forgiveness, and said he did it through distress. I took him to the watch-house, and five more handkerchiefs were found in his hat.

            . I was constable of the night, and took the prisoner in charge. We found three handkerchiefs in his hat, and two in his pocket.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I was going home; in going up Newgate-street, the prosecutor was before me - I saw a tall man behind him run across the road, I picked a handkerchief off the ground - he took hold of me; as to the other handkerchiefs, they are what my mother used to put me out victuals in, as my father-in-law turned me out of doors.

            . Aged 21.




               Transported for Life

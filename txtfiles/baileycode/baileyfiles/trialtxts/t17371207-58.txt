Legg. I was going past the Fleet-Market


 about half an Hour after 7 at Night, and the Prisoner put his Hand into my Pocket, and took my Handkerchief. I seiz'd him, but he beat me, and ask'd me if I had a Mind to rob him. I saw him by the Light of the Market, and am positive he is the Man.

            . I live in Bell-Court in Gray's-Inn-Lane, and keep a Chandler's Shop. The Prisoner did live with his Father at the Rainbow Coffee-House; since that he has been a Gentleman's Servant
, but I believe he has not been in Business these 2 Years. 


               Guilty 10 d.

            . I am a tailor. On the 17th of May I was in my gig, with my servant, going from the Bank, and met the prisoner in Holborn, with this saddle on his shoulder - he had been a servant
 of mine - I got out of the gig, and took him on another charge; I said "I think this saddle is not come honestly by" - he said Yes, it had been given to him by a servant in Oxford-street, to take to Bayswater - I said that was not the way there; he then said he had a brother in the City, and he was going to call on him to walk with him - I forced him into my gig, and took him to Marlborough-street.

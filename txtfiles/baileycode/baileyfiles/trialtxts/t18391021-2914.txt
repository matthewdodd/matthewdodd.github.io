SARAH GRAHAM
. I gave out the bundle of linen to the prisoner on the 24th of September—I do not know the contents, as my mistress had counted the things up the night before—I know it contained a table-cloth and some other things—I gave it the prisoner to take to Mrs. Charles.





ELIZA CHARLES
. I wash for Mr. Phillips's family—the prisoner had left my employ on Friday, the 20th of September, and he went for these things on the Tuesday following—he never brought them to me—I never saw him till he was taken up.

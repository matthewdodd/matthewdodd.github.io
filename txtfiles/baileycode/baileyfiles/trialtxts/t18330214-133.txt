             (Police-constable C 42). On the 4th of February, about half-past eight o'clock in the morning, I was with Stone in Regent-street; we saw the two prisoners, and watched them for upwards of an hour, as I knew them - I lost sight of Smith for a few moments, and saw Vickerman standing opposite the prosecutor's shop; I then saw Smith come out of the shop, and they went off together - I went and took Smith, and found these articles on him.

            . I was with Farrant - what he states is correct; I took Vickerman.

            . I am apprentice to George Bather, a scale-maker
 - when the officer brought the prisoners into our shop, I missed these articles; they are my master's, and had been in the middle of the shop.

            . I am a shoe-maker - I have a certificate of the conviction of Vickerman, which I got from Mr.Clark's office; I was a witness, and know he is the man. - (read).

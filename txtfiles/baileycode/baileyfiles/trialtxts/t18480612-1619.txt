THOMAS BROOME



, stealing 2 pence and 8 halfpence; the moneys of 



Thomas Slark; having been before convicted.






ELIZABETH SLARK
. I am the wife of Thomas Slark, a beer seller, of 96, London-road. On 2nd June, about eight o'clock, I was coming into the shopfrom the parlour, and found the prisoner lying across the counter with hishand in the till, which I had left safe not half a minute before—I laid hold ofhis arm—his hand was shut half way out of the till, with halfpence in it—itdid not quite inclose them—he got his hand away, and put it into his pocket—he got near the door, took some halfpence out of his pocket, and said he hadnot robbed the till, but if I liked to be satisfied with those few halfpence bewould call again and settle it with the landlord—a lodger pushed him in, and I gave him in charge—I am sure five or sixpence were taken from the till—this is one halfpenny which was there—it has a hole in it—I bad examinedit a few minutes before.

Prisoner's Defence. I had the halfpenny twenty-four hours before; Iwent to the house for half a pint of beer; nobody came; I had 5 1/2 d. in myhand, counting it, as I had just got change opposite; I resisted, thinking shewanted to steal my money; I could have escaped if I liked.

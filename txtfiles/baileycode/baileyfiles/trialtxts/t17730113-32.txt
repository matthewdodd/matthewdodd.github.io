            . I am servant to Mr. Wollaston, a distiller
, on Holborn-bridge. I was sent with some gin and other liquors in a cart to the Custom-house; I left them in the cart while I went to receive some other orders; when I came back I observed the prisoner about the cart; I found the tail of the cart cut and the cask of Geneva upon the ground; the vessel was staved and about three gallons was run out; I saw it twice in his hands; he catched at it again, then I struck him with my whip.
William Hill. I was shutting up a shop near where the cart stood; I saw the prisoner with the cask in his hand, endeavouring to get it upon his shoulder; he dropped it, which staved the cask and then Morris came up.
Prisoner's Defence.
I saw the cask upon the ground; I thought it had sell out of the cart; I attempted to put it upon its head for fear the liquor should run out. Morris came up and struck me, and very much abused me.
He called one witness who gave him an indifferent character.

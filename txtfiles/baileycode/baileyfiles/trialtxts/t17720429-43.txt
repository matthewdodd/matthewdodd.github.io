. On the 7th of April I was informed the prisoner had confessed he had stolen a silver spoon out of my kitchen. The prisoner is brother to my servant. Soon after I was ordered to attend the Justice, where the prisoner then was; when before the justice, I asked when he took the spoon; his answer was the Sunday after Christmas; he said he took it out of the sink at a house where his sister lived; I saw him that very night at my house, and having company he went away about ten; I was surprised he did not stay supper; I have seen him twice at the house.

            . I keep a chandler's shop; the prisoner came to my house sometime after Christmas, to buy some bread and cheese for his dinner; while dealing with him about the cheese, he said, he had found a silver spoon; he produced it to me, and several people in the house; he asked me to buy it; I gave him 7 s. for it (the spoon produced and deposed to by the prosecutrix.)
Prisoner's Defence.
I was at the prosecutrix's about three weeks after Christmas, I went from thence to work; I broke my shovel; I went to a dunghill to find a bit of packthread to tie it, and I there found the spoon.

FRANCIS KEYS
. I am an officer of Marylebone. On the 10th of February I was by St. Giles's church, about one o'clock—I saw the prisoners standing at the corner of Lawrence-lane, looking at gentlemen's pockets—they followed a gentleman down to George-street, and then Johnson made an attempt at the gentleman's pocket—they followed on to Museum-street, and there Johnson took a handkerchief out of a gentleman's pocket and gave it to Jewson—both turned round towards me—I collared Jewson, and took the handkerchief from inside his coat—I sent a person after Johnson, but he did not get him—Jewson said it was the first time he had ever done such a thing—that he was a broken down costermonger, and took the handkerchief to get a shilling to set himself up—four days after, I saw Johnson sitting on the rails, in Lawrence-lane—I took him for being in company with Jewson, and picking pockets—he said I was mistaken—I never could find the gentleman, as he walked on—I am positive of both their persons.

JEWSON—

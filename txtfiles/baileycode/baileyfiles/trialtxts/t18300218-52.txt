JOHN PENNISTON TOPPER. I am clerk
 to Mr. Willcotton. I usually dine at a coffee-shop in Hand-court, Holborn


 - I went there about four o'clock on the 30th of January, and called for my dinner; I put down my hat, and two bags in it - there were ninety sovereigns in one bag, and silver in the other; I saw the prisoner there - I instantly missed my hat; the prisoner was gone, and I pursued him down the court, across Holborn, up Turustile and up another court; I took up my hat from the ground, and all the money in it - I cannot say I saw him throw it down; I think I saw my hat on his head - I saw him again at Bow-street, and am certain he is the person who ran away.
Prisoner. Q. Do not you think it was possible for me to make a mistake in the hats? A. I cannot say - they were on one table.
MARY COURCELL. I keep the coffee-house, and remember the prosecutor coming in to dine; I saw the prisoner take a hat, but I did not know but it was his own; there was one hat left behind.
THOMAS YOUNG. I am a Police-constable. I was on duty, and saw the prisoner running - the bags were given to me.
Prisoner. My friends are out of town; I have not let them know, as I am afraid it would injure their feelings, and perhaps be the death of them.

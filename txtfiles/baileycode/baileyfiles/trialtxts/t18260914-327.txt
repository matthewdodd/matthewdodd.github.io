GEORGE HALLOWS. I met the prisoner on the night of the 11th of July, and went with her to a house in the Almonry


 - I was not tipsy - I slept with her, and when I awoke in the morning she was gone, with my watch and handkerchief.

            . The prisoner slept at my house that night - she had slept there twice before; I met her afterwards, and told her she had made a nice job of it - she said, "Well, if I did, you did not know what I was going to do;" I told her the man said, if he had the duplicate of the watch, he would not mind; she said she would give it me next morning; I said, I would have it then, or keep her, which I did, and had her taken up - the watch has not been found.

HENRY GILPIN. About twelve o'clock on Saturday night, the 18th of December, I was in Oxford-street


 - I was returning home with two companions; I observed three boys loitering before us; the moment I passed them I felt some person at my pocket - I extended my right arm, and took hold of the prisoner, and saw the handkerchief in his hand; he extended his left hand, and tucked something under his waistcoat - I searched under his waistcoat, but could not find it - I asked him who the boys were, and my friend pursued them; his companions came back, and one of them offered me a handkerchief, which was nor mine; they then got away, and I gave the prisoner in charge.

            . I was with Gilpin, and saw him seize the prisoner - I saw the prisoner pass a handkerchief to a companion on his left; and the other two companions walked down Charles-street; the prisoner called to one of them,
"Jemmy," who immediately pulled off his hat, and shewed a handkerchief, and said,
"Is this the gentleman's, if it is, he may have it?" but it was not; I then looked to see, if he had another, which he had not; I then went after the third boy, but he got away.
Prisoner's Defence. I was returning home from the Coburg Theatre, and got into conversation with the other two boys; the gentleman took hold of me, and said I had robbed him, but I had not.

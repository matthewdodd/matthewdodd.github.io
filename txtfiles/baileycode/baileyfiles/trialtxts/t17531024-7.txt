, the prisoner came into my shop towards dusk on the 3d of October, and wanted to buy a frock for her child; she look'd at several things, and said she wanted for another woman to come to pay for what she bought. As she was going out at the door I saw something under her cloak, I went out after her and took up her cloak, and found it to be a piece of linnen that I had just before taken out of the window, my property; she said she had bought it at another shop higher up, I took her into the shop. where she fell on her knees, and said it was her first offence and begg'd I'd let her go.
The prisoner had nothing to say, nor call'd any witness.

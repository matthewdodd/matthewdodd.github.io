Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Where did you get them? A. I got one from 
               
                  Elizabeth Ann 
                  Fawdon
               



            , the last wife, and I believe she had the other - I have compared them with the originals - they are correct.
ELIZABETH ANN FAWDON. I was married to the prisoner, on the 5th of August last.
Cross-examined. Q. How long have you known him? A. Two years - we heard he was a married man; I, and my mother went and enquired, and the next day his wife came, and said she was his landlady for ten years; she knew he had been married, but did not know that he was married now; I had a great many presents, and some cash, but all in a proper way - my mother washed for a Mr. Ward for seventeen years.

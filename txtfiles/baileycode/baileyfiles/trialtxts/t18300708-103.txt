            . I am a licensed-hawker
. The prisoner was a stranger to me; I was under a gateway at the Crown public-house at Chiswick


 - I saw him take a pair of sheets out of my bundle, and turn a corner going up Gunnersbury lane; I had left my pack under the gateway to keep it from the rain - I called the ostler to take care of my pack, and I ran and met the prisoner coming down the lane again; I asked for my sheets - he said he had none, he did not take them, and no one had seen him with them; the witness told me where he had hidden them - these are the sheets.

            . I saw the prisoner go and hide these sheets under some bramble bushes; I told the prosecutor, and we went and got them - I am sure the prisoner hid them.
Prisoner's Defence. I saw this man, who asked if I had seen his sheets; I said No, I had not; this witness said I had put something under the nettles - I said I had not; he ordered me to run away - he said, "I don't think you stole them;" and I went behind a tree, when the Policeman came and took me.

WILLIAM RILEY
 I am in the employment of John Riley, a licensed lighterman. I had charge of a barge called the Oak, lying at Nicholson's Wharf, with 104 bags of sugar in it, which I had loaded on Friday, 20th—I saw them all safe on the Tuesday evening at eight o'clock, and missed them at nine on Wednesday morning—I did not watch them all night—I left at eight, and returned at eleven—I did not see whether they were all then safe—I staid till three in the morning—nobody came during that time—I returned, and watched from five till eight, went to breakfast at eight, returned at nine, and then missed the three bags—they had "HE" branded on them.

Cross-examined by
MR. WOLLETT
Q. When did you first count them? A. On the Friday—I know they were all safe at eight o'clock on the Tuesday night, because I lifted up the tarpauling, and saw no disturbance—I did not count them, but I know how I stowed them—Nicholson's Wharf is about 200 or 300 yards below London-bridge.

Cross-examined by
MR. PARNELL
Q. When did you first know they were marked "HE?" A. When I took them in—43 were marked "HE," and 61 had another mark, I do not know what it was—the three bags were taken from the upper tier, off the larboard side—I am sure, from the state they were in, that there were none gone on the Tuesday night, or I should have missed them.





JOHN RILEY
 I am lighterman, and job for my uncle, John Riley, of Lower Thames-street. On Tuesday evening, 24th April, between nine and ten o'clock, I was on Nicholson's Wharf dummy, which is a pier projecting from the wharf, and saw M'Clarens and Midcjleton there—I first saw them shove away in a boat from Cox's Quay, which is the second wharf above Nicholson's, nearer the bridge—I watched them, and saw them drop alongside Mr. Riley's punt, the Oak, which was afloat off Nicholson's Wharf, and had sugar in it—they made fast their boat to the Oak, got out of it on to the Oak, and walked over her to another barge which was lying alongside of her—they got out of her into a French vessel, which was lying along the wharf, and stopped there several minutes, while the Thames police-galley was passing

along—I saw no more of them that night—next morning, on coming to Legal Quay, I saw my uncle, and, in consequence of what took place between us, we went to find Draddy's house out; it is in Rosemary-lane—I saw a cart coming down Rosemary-lane with three bags of sugar in it—I saw the bags that were left in the punt next day, and they were like those in the cart—after I left the cart I met the police and my uncle in the lane, went to Draddy's house, and saw him in the shop; it is a greengrocer's and chandler's—they sell everything, I believe—I said to Draddy, "I wish to speak to you"—he said, "Oh, it is all right, the police have been here"—I said, "Have they?"—he said, "You had better come again by-and-by, I can't talk to you now"—I then returned to a house in the lane, where my uncle and the police were—that was between one and two o'clock—I went again to Draddy between seven and eight in the evening, and asked him if I might step backwards—he said, "Stop a minute," and went and said something to his wife, which I could not hear—he then said, "Yes, you may step backwards"—I walked into the parlour, saw Mrs. Draddy sitting there, and I said to her, "You have had a curious start to-day"—she said, "Yes, I have indeed"—I said, "I hear the police have been here?"—she said, "Yes"—I said, "I came to let you know that the police had information"—she said, "Yes; but you were too late"—she said the police had been there and wanted to search the house, but she refused as they had not got a search-warrant; that one of the officers went into the cellar, but she did not mind that, because she knew there was nothing there—she said had they had a warrant she should not have known what to have done—I said, "Why, were the three bags here, then?"—she said, "Yes, they were all lying together," and her and her daughter had had a rare job to wash the sugar away down the sink-hole—I said, "What did you do with the rush part of the bags?"—she said she burnt them—I asked what she did with the under part (there is a matted part underneath)—she said her daughter carried them out of the shop underneath her shawl, and she should not have known what to have done if it had not been for a good tub of water that was in the yard—she said there was sugar in the bags, at least I said to her, "Did you have the three bags of sugar here when the officers came in?" and she saidr "Yes"—she said she bought the sugar—she did not say what she gave for it, but said it was a great loss to her to have to lose between 4l., and 5l., to have to wash it away in that manner down the sink-hole—she did not mention who she got the sugar from—I said, "Why did you buy so much sugar of them?" and she said she would not again—there was a cask of sugar in the shop, and I saw some on the table which she was pounding up with a hammer; it was moist sugar, but in little lumps—she said that it was all that remained out of the three bags—she asked me to have a drop of gin, which I had in a little water, and mixed up some of the sugar with it—I then went away and called the officers—I saw the lug-boat on the Friday that I had seen M'Clarcns and Middleton in on the Tuesday night—it was then lying at the Tunnel-pier—I knew it again; there is not another boat like it oh the river.

COURT
Q. What became of the cart with the three bags in it? A. I followed it into Mark-lane, and finding from the description the man gave of them that they were not the bags, I went back again, I did not see what became of them.

Cross-examined by
MR. BALLANTINE
Q. When did you happen to be last on your uncle's barge before this sugar went away? A. I cannot tell—I was not there the day before it was stolen; I swear that—I will not be positive whether I was there on the Saturday—I was at the wharf some time in

the week; it is where I look out for my living—I do not know whether the barge was there all that week—I had not been in any barge belonging to my uncle that week—I mostly go to the wharf of an evening to see whether my uncle has got anything for me to do next day—I went down on this evening for that purpose, but I did not see him—I went to Billingsgate first—I expected to find him at Mr. Howard's; I went there—I think the first time was about half-past eight—it was between nine and ten that I saw the two men at the barge—I had been standing in the market between half-past eight and then; I do not know what for, to look about I suppose—I might justas well have seen my uncle there as anywhere else—I do not think he is here to-day—I cannot say that the Draddy's knew me before—I was never there before—I have seen them many times in Rosemary-lane, but had never been in the shop—I had never asked Mrs. Draddy to buy sugar of me—I never spoke to her on such an occasion—I never spoke to her on any occasion but this—she told me all I have stated, and made no concealment of any kind—I have never gone by any other name than Riley—I have never offered tea, coffee, or sugar, to either of the Draddys—I gave this information to the police to protect my uncle's property, and to punish the thieves—I have never been in any trouble; I swear that—I was never in custody, nor ever charged with any felony—I was not charged with having some stolen bottles of oil in my possession—I was never before a Magistrate or in prison in my life—I do not know Lambeth-street police-court—I was never in custody of a London Dock officer named Trotter or Trotman for stealing 8 1/2 lbs. of currants, nothing of the kind (looking at a man named Trotter)—I was never in his custody; it is only a spite against me.

Cross-examined by
MR. COOPER. Q. What caused you to go to the dummy on this 24th April? A. To see if my uncle was there; sometimes he goes down when the men are there to see that they moor the craft properly—the prisoners were about twice the length of this Court from me when I first saw them in the boat—it was about two or three minutes after that that the police-galley passed—I could have made myself heard if I had called out—I saw no one there but the prisoners—I first mentioned this circumstance to my uncle next morning, between eleven and twelve, on the wharf—he came to me there—I knew where he lived—I was never stopped at Wapping-gate with any currants—I have been a lighterman about nine years—when I was a boy I was a paper-stainer—I have never been in the custody of the river-police, nor ever stopped by them.

Cross-examined by
MR. WOOLLETT
Q. How have you been getting your living? A. By my work as a lighterman on the river—I am not always in the employ of my uncle, but of anybody I can get a day's work for—I had been standing about a long time when I saw the men at the dummy, expecting to see my uncle—sometimes he does not come down till eleven o'clock—I think it was a very dark night.

Cross-examined by
MR. PARNELL
Q. How much sugar was there on the counter at Draddy's? A. I cannot say exactly; there might have been a pound or a pound and a half—when Mrs. Draddy spoke of not liking to lose 3l. or 4l. I said, "Why, of course you don't"—I said, "How stupid it must have been of you to buy three bags of sugar; I told you before not to buy of them"—I had never spoke to her before that night, but that was my observation to learn of her whether she had the property; I only said it to her, I had not really spoken to her before.

COURT
Q. Then it was not true that you had told her so before? A. No; I had not seen her before the sugar was bought—I only made the observation; it might have been a question of mine out of the way, perhaps—it was a word out of its place.


MR. KENEALEY. Q. Was that the first time you had ever spoken to her? A. It was the first time on any occasion of the sort—I knew them by sight and by information which I had received several times about them—a relation of mine named John Riley was transported, about three years ago, for felony.

JURY. Q. Was Draddy by when you had this talk with his wife? A. He came in once or twice and checked his wife not to tell me so much—he was in the shop most of the time.





WILLIAM RILEY

re-examined I did not see my cousin John Riley on the Tuesday night—the Oak was lying at the outside dummy—I left the barge at eight o'clock, and went and saw my uncle at Howard's, and got my orders—I was not in the barge at half-past nine—I left no one in the barge while I was away—I got my orders about nine, and then went and had my supper—I had to bring up another barge at three o'clock, and I returned again at five.





JOHN STOKES
. I am a cab-driver. On Tuesday night, 24th April, I was on my stand in Ratcliff-highway, and about quarter-past eleven I was called by McClarens—I went with him, and he put three bags of sugar into the cab—I did not see the sugar, but the bags were such as sugar is put into—we see a great many in our neighbourhood—Middleton was with him when they were put in—I went from the stand down to the river-side, at the first stairs below the Tunnel, and it was there that the bags were put in—they brought them up the stairs on their backs—they then told me to drive to Chamber's-street—M'Clarens went inside with the bags and Middleton rode outside with me—I stopped at the top of a court in Chamber's-street, which leads into Rosemary-lane—one bag was taken out there, and carried down the court by M'Clarens and Middleton—they came back again in about a minute and a half, and we then went with the cab into Rosemary-lane, which runs parallel with Chamber's-street—I stopped there at the other end of the same court—Draddy's house is at the corner of the Rosemary-lane end of that court—I saw him standing at his door—he came towards the cab and said to the prisoners, "Wait a moment"—M'Clarens said to Middleton, "He be b—dt let us get them out while the wind is good," and they then took the other two bags down the court—I do not know whether they went into his house or not—there is a door that opens from the court into his house—I was paid my fare—I saw Middleton return to Draddy's shop-door; M'Clarens was standing there at the time—I went away and left them at the shop-door.

Cross-examined by
MR. BALLANTINE
Q. Did you always recollect Draddy's saying, "Wait a moment?" A. I did not the first time I went to the Mansion-house, but next day I stated it—no one had spoken to me about it in the interval.

Cross-examined by
MR. WOOLLETT
Q. Did you know M'Clarens? A. Not before that night—it was rather a dark night—the bags were about two feet square, I should think—they were ordinary-looking bags—I did not see Riley that night; I do not know him—I received 5s., as my fare—it would only have been a shilling without luggage.

Cross-examined by
MR. PARRY
Q. Did you know Middleton before? A. I did, years ago;

COURT
Q. Are you sure he is the man? A. Yes; I was well acquainted with him, and have often talked with him—I saw M'Clarens once afterwards before he was in custody, but did not speak to him—it was a week after the 24th that I saw him in custody—I did not know Draddy before—I saw him in custody the Same day that I saw M'Clarens—I am sure he is the same man—I have not been to the shop since—I have been by it repeatedly—his name is up.






JOSEPH SHAYNE
 (Thames-policeman 40). On Wednesday afternoon, 25th of April, I went to Draddy's house in Rosemary-lane, with inspector Jones—some words passed between him and Draddy which I did not hear, but I heard Draddy say he would not let us search the house without a warrant—Jones asked if he would allow us to search the cellar; he said, "Yes; but nowhere else without a warrant"—after that we went away—I produce a sample of the sugar from the barge, and also some of the matting of the bags that were left.





WILLIAM THOMAS BRIDGES
 (Thames-police inspector) On Wednesday afternoon, 25th of April, I went to Draddy's house, between three and four o'clock—I measured the length of the court which leads from Chamber's-street into Rosemary-lane—it is about sixty or sixty-five yards—Draddy's shop-door is at the corner of the court, in Rosemary-lane—there are two other doors in the court leading to Draddy's house—three doors altogether—the first door in the court is about five yards from Rosemary-lane, and the second about the same distance; the front door is in the lane itself—I went into the shop and walked into the back-room where he was—I told him I wanted to speak to him, and walked up-stairs followed by him and his wife—I said to him, "Draddy, have you had any sugar offered to-day or last night?"—he said, "No"—I said, "Have you bought any?"—he said, "No, except a quarter of a cwt, I had of a Mr. Wood," and I think he said "yesterday"—his wife said, "It is not likely he would have bought any, for if he had he would not be as he now is (meaning that he was sober), for he would have bad a drop on the strength of it"—I then asked if he had any objection to allow me to search his house—his wife said, "Are you going to look for anything else besides sugar?"—I said, "No"—and she said, "You may look"—I then went over the upper part of the house, and on going down into the back parlour, where I had left inspector Jones, he said in their presence, "Why, they have been burning the sugar bags; see, here is some of it," and he produced a portion; I do not know where he took it from, he had it in his hand—I then looked in the grate, and found a portion of burnt sugar bags which I now produce, with some sugar still on it—I then went into a back wash-house adjoining that room, and I saw sugar spilled over the flooring, and the yard adjoining was very wet, as though it had been recently washed down—I then went into the room again and saw a large cask with about one and a half or two cwt. of sugar in it—it was dry sugar—I took a sample of it—there were three kinds of sugar in it, placed one on the top of the other—I asked Draddy if any of that sugar was what he had from Mr. Wood; he said, "No"—I then left—I went again between eight and nine the same night—I had had some information from the witness John Riley—I asked Draddy if he had any objection to show me the bill of parcels for the sugar he had had from Mr. Wood—he said, "No, certainly not," and he produced a bill of parcels—I then took another sample of sugar from the same cask, and near the cask I saw a brown paper bag containing sugar—I took a sample from that—I asked whether it was any portion of the sugar he had had from Mr. Wood—he said, "No"—I then asked where he had got the sugar from, and he said, "That is putting it too close"—his wife said, "We sometimes buy ten pounds of sugar or so of the labourers"—he told her to hold her tongue and not to say too much—I then went away—next day I went again, and told him I was not satisfied concerning the burnt sugar bags; that I must apprehend him for receiving three bags of sugar knowing them to be stolen—he said, "Where are they? ah! where are they?"—I afterwards went to Mr. Wood—I have been to the place with the witness Stokes; he showed me Draddy's house.


Cross-examined by
MR. BALLANTINE. Q. At the time you paid these visits, had you been in communication with Riley? A. Not half an hour previous to my going—I had received information from him previous to my first visit—Draddy's is a chandler's shop—I did not bring the invoice away—there is no one here from Mr. Wood's.

Cross-examined by
MR. PARNELL
Q. As I understand you, Mrs. Draddy I was giving you some account of where they had bought some of this sugar? A. No, she was saying they sometimes bought ten pounds or so of sugar of the labourers, and her husband told her to hold her tongue—I think she did I not obey him; but I did not pay particular attention—there were two examinations at the Mansion-house before Mrs. Draddy was taken into custody—I saw her there at one of the examinations—I took her on 2d of May, and I she was discharged on 3d by Mr. Alderman Gibbs; I do not know why, I am no lawyer—she has been taken on this indictment since the Court hat been sitting—there were witnesses in attendance before Mr. Alderman Gibbs to prove that she was married to Draddy.





JAMES JONES
 (Thames police-inspector.) I went to Draddy's house on Wednesday afternoon, the 25th April, at half-past four o'clock—I saw Draddy and told him I wished to speak to him; that I was an inspector of police, and I had come to search his house for three bags of sugar which had been stolen the night previous—he said he had got no sugar there but what was his own—I asked him to allow me to search the cellar—he said that he did not know that he should—I asked him a second time, and he said, "You may go in the cellar"—I took Shayne with me, and a small boy with a light, but found nothing there—I then went into the back room—it smelt as if there had been afire—I found four pieces of mat bagging on the back part of the stove—two pieces are partly burnt, and a great quantity of water had been chucked on the fire, and the fire was nearly put out—there was water left behind on the hobs and under the grate—I put my fingers into the water and tasted it; it was quite sweet and sugary—I afterwards went into the yard, it had been well washed with water—I put my fingers into it close to the sink between the stones, and it tasted of sugar—I was with Bridges when Mrs. Draddy was taken on 2d May—Bridges told her he came to arrest her for being concerned in the sugar that had been brought to the house—she said she was not prepared to go; it was a hard case that she should suffer for what had been brought there.

Cross-examined by
MR. PARNELL
Q. How came you to go and take her? A. I was ordered to go by the superintendent—there was no warrant—the water on the hob was quite warm—the fire, smelt as if it bad been put out by water—the place in the yard where the water tasted sweet was close to the water-butt—I did not see any pump—it appeared to be water that had been chucked about the yard—a tub was emptied, which seemed to have had soapsuds in it, but the water I tasted was clean and cold.





RICHARD GARRARD KESTIN
 I am clerk to Mr. Taylor, a colonial broker, of Mincing-lane. At the latter end of April we sent 104 bags of sugar, by Riley's barge, consigned to Messrs. Andrews and Co., of Dublin—the sample of sugar produced, found in the bag, is of the same description as was contained in forty-three of the bags which were marked HE—the sugar is first put into a kind of canvas bag, then a matting over it—the pieces produced are the kind of thing—there are traces of burnt sugar on them—these bags come from the Mauritius.

Cross-examined by
MR. COOPER
Q. It comes with a good many articles, does it not? A. It always comes with sugar—I am principally concerned

with sugar—this kind of bag comes only from the Mauritius—there is plenty of this kind of sugar in London—a bag contains about 1 1/2 cwts.—it would sell for 40s. a hundred-weight.





ROBERT WAGOETT
. Between eleven and twelve o'clock on Tuesday night I saw a lug-boat come down to King Edward Stairs, which are just below the Thames Tunnel—there was only one man in it—he jumped out and went ashore, and I saw no more of him—the boat was left there till the next day.
(Frederick Carey, messenger at the City of London Institution, Aldersgate-street, deposed to M'Claren's good character: and John Rogers, a grocer of North-street, Whitechapel; Benjamin White, corn-dealer, of Leman-street, Goodman's-fields; William Hart, grocer, of Royal Mint-street; and John Lynch, cheesemonger, of Royal Mint-street, to that of Draddy: but the two latter admitted bis having been imprisoned for three or four months for smuggling.)

            . I am a watchman of Coleman-street. I went on duty at seven o'clock on the 23d of November, and at the end of Finsbury-circus


 and London-wall, I saw the prisoner coming over some boards - I laid hold of him by his wooden-leg, and said, "You must go to the watch-house" - I searched him, and found this pipe and cock on him.

            . I am an officer. I found this property on the prisoner at the watch-house - I compared it with what remains at the building - it fits exactly - it is a water-pipe, and was fixed to the cistern.
GEORGE CROWHURST. These three chisels are mine, and were on Messrs. Harding's premises.
JAMES HARDING, JUN. This building was in the Circus, facing the London Institution - it is in the City - it belongs to my father only - I am in partnership with him, but not in this building; I have seen the pipe fitted with what remains - it fits exactly.

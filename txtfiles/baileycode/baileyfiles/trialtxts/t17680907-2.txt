            . On Friday the 26th of August, a little past twelve at night, I was handing my wife out of a coach near Bartlet's-buildings


; I felt-something at my pocket, I felt and missed my handkerchief; I saw the prisoner about half a dozen yards from me, I went towards him; he took to his heels, and turned out into the carriageway, by the side of a stand of hackney coaches; I pursued him, and saw him throw a handkerchief down by the light of the moon, about twenty yards from where my pocket was picked; I was then within about three or four yards of him, I called, stop thief; he was stopped, he begged of me to be forgiven; I took the handkerchief up (produced in court) my property; he was taken to the watch-house near the end of Shoe-lane, the next morning I charged him before my Lord Mayor.
Prisoner's defence.
I was running along, they called, stop thief, I did not know what was the matter; I am as innocent as a child unborn.

THOMAS BLOSSETT
. I am a constable of Covent Garden Market. On the 1st of June, between six and seven o'clock in the morning, I saw the two prisoners together—I knew them and watched them—they followed a gentleman down the market, and Benson took a handkerchief from the gentleman's pocket—he gave it to Barrs—I followed and took them both, and Barrs dropped the handkerchief—this is it—I do not know the name of the gentleman, I lost him in the crowd.

Barrs. I was not with him—I never saw him before. Witness. Yes, you had been with him and were covering him.





JOHN ROBINSON
. I am a salesman. The officer came to me and said "These two young fellows have done so and so, help me to take them"—I saw the handkerchief drop between their feet.

Barrs. I am innocent.

Benson. I never touched the gentleman's pocket.

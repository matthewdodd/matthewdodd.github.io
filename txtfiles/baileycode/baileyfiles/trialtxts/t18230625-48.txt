            . I am a tailor
, and live in Hemlock-court, Carey-street. On Sunday, the 8th of June, I was in Water-court, leading into Fleet-street


, going home, several people were passing - I felt something behind at my coat pocket, looked over my shoulder, and saw my handkerchief in the prisoner's hand; he was passing it to another boy - there were four of them in company; one appeared older than him. It was safe just before. I secured him with it - the other three got away. A friend took one of them, but let him go, as the prisoner kicked his legs and bit his hand.
(Property produced and sworn to).

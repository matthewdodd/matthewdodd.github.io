            . I live in St. Martin's-court


. On Thursday, the 28th of November, between two and three o'clock, I saw the prisoner standing against my window for about half an hour; he went away. Next morning, between seven and eight o'clock, he was there again, and kept watching me for twenty minutes, and then left. I went out, and a young man asked me if I suspected him? I said, No. I looked at my window, and found a pane of glass that had been cracked was pulled out, and some purses taken out. I saw him return again, watched him, and saw him, about two o'clock, take another purse out. I secured him - He gave it to me.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

ELIZABETH HEBBEN
. I am single. I went into the Three Cups public-house, at Bow, at eight o'clock in the morning of the 28th of January, to wait for a young man whose breakfast I took up—the prisoner was there—I took my shawl off my shoulders, and put it on the table while I had my frock pinned—I turned my head, and my shawl was missing—I went outside, and a lady told me something—I went to the pawnbroker's, and found my shawl—I came back—I found the prisoner sitting in the same room at the public-house—I asked him about my shawl—he said he knew nothing about it—this is it—(looking at it.)





WILLIAM EDWARD VINSON
. I am in the employ of a pawnbroker at Bow. This shawl was pawned by the prisoner.

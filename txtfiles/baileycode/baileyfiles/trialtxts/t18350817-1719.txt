DANIEL DONOVAN
. I live at Jubilee-place, Commercial-road. I was coming down High-street, Whitechapel, on the 20th of July, about eleven o'clock at night; the officer tapped me on the shoulder, and told me something—I felt, and my handkerchief was gone—I had had it safe about two minutes before; it was produced to me; this is it, I know it by some holes in it.





WILLIAM SAVAGE
, (police constble, H 50.) I was on duty, in plain clothes; I saw the prisoner about eleven o'clock in the evening—I watched him and another—I saw the smaller one go to the prosecutor, and draw the handkerchief—the prisoner was close to lhim—I went to the prosecutor, and asked him if hehad lost his handkerchief—he said, "Yes"—we then went into the City, and saw the prisoner and the other one looking at it, with a girl—I took the prisoner; the other dropped the handkerchief on the ground.

Prisoner. I was never in the county of Middlesex—I was in Aldgate at the time—I never saw the other lad before.

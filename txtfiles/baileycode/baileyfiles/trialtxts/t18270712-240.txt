MARK ANTHONY ORME. I live in Houndsditch


, and rent the house - I am a tobacconist
. On the 20th of June, about a quarter-past seven o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner and another lad come to my window - the prisoner raised the glass with some instrument, and left for a few minutes, then returned, and loosened the glass;he took it out, laid it down, and went away - they returned in three or four minutes, and took a canister of snuff out. I ran over the way, and took the prisoner; he threw the canister over the church-yard rails; I believe there was a flaw in the pane before; there was a small crack in it, but no cut. My wife, Hester, and a female servant were at home. The snuff is sold for 2s.

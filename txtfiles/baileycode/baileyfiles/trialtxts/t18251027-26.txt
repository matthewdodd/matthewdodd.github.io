. The prisoner was in our service; he was to carry out goods, and to bring what money he received when he returned with his cart. On the 23d of July we had sold some malt for 7 l. 8 s., and some hops for 2 l. 2 s., to Mr. 
               
                  James 
                  Robinson
               



             - the prisoner took them but never accounted for the money.
JOHN RIDE. The prisoner never accounted to me for the money.

            . I am the wife of James Robinson. On the 5th of September
 I paid the prisoner nine sovereigns and some silver - I have his bill, which he gave me at the time, and the receipt which he wrote.
SAMUEL MUMFORD re-examined. Q. Has the prisoner accounted for any money since the 5th of September? A. Yes, for money received from other customers, but not for this. I accused him of keeping this money and he said "The Lord have mercy upon me."
Prisoner. I hope you will be merciful to me.

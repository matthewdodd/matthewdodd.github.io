                  , 2 Snuff Boxes, value 45 s.
             on the 8th of August
 last. It appear'd that about noon 
               
                  Luke 
                  Anderson 
               



             (an Evidence aged 13) lean'd over the Show Glass which was unlock'd; that the Prosecutor might not see the prisoner, who lifted up the Glass, and Thorp who took out the Goods. The Prosecutor afterwards saw them run cross the way, upon which he look'd in his Show. Glass mist the Goods, and pursu'd them to St. Clements Church yard, where he took Anderson and the Prisoner, but having no suspicion of the 2 others whom he had not seen at his Window, they got off with the Goods. 


               Guilty to the value of 10 d.

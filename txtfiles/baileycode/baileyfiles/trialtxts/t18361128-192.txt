MARTHA CLOSSIE
. My husband's name is Frederick, he is a Greenwich pensioner, and a teacher of music. On the 8th of November, Mrs. Cooper brought the prisoner to me to get her a lodging, as she had just come from London, out of place—she lodged and boarded with me till the 14th—she was there about six days—these four half-crowns and fifteen shillings were in a box by the side of the dire-place, in a little brown holland bag with twine round it—she said she was going a little way, and then she should come back, but she did not—I saw the money safe at half past eleven o'clock, and missed it about two o'clock—I have not got any of my money since.





FREDERICK CLOSSIE
. I was sitting a the table, and heard the box move, and then the prisoner went away—I told my wife I heard, and the money was gone—the prisoner left at two o'clock on Monday the 14th (This witness was blind.).





MARY DOYLE
. The prisoner came to our house to see my mother on Monday—she said when she was there before that she had nothing to give, but then she had a half-crown, and sent Mrs. Doyle for some liquor.




GUILTY
. Aged 22.—


Transported for Seven Years.

Before Mr. Justice Vaughan.

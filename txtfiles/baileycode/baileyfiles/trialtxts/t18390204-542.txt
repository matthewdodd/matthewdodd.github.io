GEORGE WILLIS
. On the 18th of January, a little before one o'clock, I was passing through Crosby-square, Bishopsgate—I felt a tug at my great-coat pocket—I turned and saw the prisoner putting my handkerchief under his coat—I made a snatch at him, but as it was frosty I fell—he ran off and dropped the handkerchief, which some person took up—there was a hue and cry—the prisoner was brought back, and he begged forgiveness—this is my handkerchief—(looking at it).





THOMAS NAPOLEON RENNOLDSON
 (police-constable C 77.) I took the prisoner, and found another handkerchief in his possession—he said he had had it four years, and it had no mark on it—but I found the mark H L on it.

Prisoner's Defence. I saw the handkerchief on the ground—a gentleman seized me, and I was taken back to the prosecutor, who said I had picked his pocket—he was asked at the Mansion-house whether he saw the handkerchief in my hand—he turned to another gentleman, and said to him, "Did you see it in his hand?"—he said, "No," and then this gentleman said he did.

            . On the 24th of June I was walking with a friend in Great George-street. Westminster


 - we got clear of the gate going into the Park, when a Policeman touched my friend and asked if he had lost any thing; he said he had not, but I put my hand to my pocket, and my handkerchief was gone - the Policemen then went after the prisoners, who were walking down the street; my friend and I walked after them, and I saw this handkerchief come down Harris's trousers - they were fifty or sixty yards off when I first saw them.

            . I am a Police-constable. I saw the two prisoners in company, between eleven and twelve o'clock - a boy came and told me they were trying this gentleman's pockets; when they saw me they walked on quite smart - I spoke to the prosecutor; I told them to follow me, and I took the two prisoners - I saw the handkerchief come down Harris's trousers; this was between eleven and twelve o'clock.(Property produced and sworn to.)

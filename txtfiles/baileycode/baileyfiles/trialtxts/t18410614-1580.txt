FRANCIS RANKIN
. I am a surgeon, living in Gloucester-terrace, New-road. About five o'clock in the afternoon of the 7th of May, I was going down Barbican, and near Golden-lane I felt some one take something from my pocket—I turned round, and a person behind me told me something—I pursued the prisoner, and took him—I waited about five minutes and an attempt was made to rescue him by a party—he struggled very much, but did not get away.

Prisoner. Q. When you turned round, was any one behind you? A. Yes.





HENRY FRENCH SHARP
. I was there, and saw the prisoner drop the handkerchief—I went after a policeman, and on my return I saw an at tempt to rescue the prisoner, by eight or ten of his friends; and during that time the prosecutor lost his hat.





JAMES CONNOR
. I live in Long's-buildings. I saw the prisoner drop this handkerchief—some bad girls and bad men attempted to rescue him—I saw them outside this Court yesterday—they accused me of coming against him, and took me by the collar.

Prisoner's Defence. I was coming along Barbican—this handkerchief was lying by the pump—I picked it up and went on—I know nothing about the rescue—there were two Irishmen fighting.




GUILTY
. Aged 27.—


Transported for Ten Years.

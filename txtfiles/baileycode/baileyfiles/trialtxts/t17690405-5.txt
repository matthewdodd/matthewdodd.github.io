            . I am a butcher
 in St. James's market


. I had the carcasses of two dead sheep in my shop on the 15th of March; they were then whole. The prisoner was found in my shop between three and four the next morning. The other witness can give a farther account.

            . I am an apprentice to Mr. Leach. I got up and found the prisoner in our shop, between three and four o'clock, on the 16th of March. I called for a watchman, and we took the prisoner to the Round-house. I found the two carcasses cut up, and packed up in a basket of my master's, ready to be taken away.
Q. Had that basket any meat in it over night?
Garner. No, it had not.
Prisoner's Defence.
The door was open. I had a fever and ague upon me, and got in there for shelter. I had not been in above two minutes before this boy came. There was nothing taken out of the shop.

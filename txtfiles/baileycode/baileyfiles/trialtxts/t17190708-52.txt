, the 5th of July
 last. It appeared that the Prosecutor was asleep on a Beach behind a Table, with the Money in his Pocket, and the Prisoner very busy about him; that the Prisoner call'd for more Drink, which the Landlord refused to draw unless he would pay for it, and the Prisoner saying he had no Money, the Landlord kickt him out of Doors; and remembring that he had been busy about the Prosecutor, wak'd him, who immediately miss'd his Money; whereupon they follow'd the Prisoner, who finding himself pursued and hard set, jumpt over a Hedge in a great Fright, and told one of the Evidence who happen'd accidentally to be there, that several pursu'd him to kill him; the Evidence bid him not fear, for he would stand by him; and saw him throw the Money mention'd in the Indictment out of his Hand; which he took up and carryed before the Justice with him. The Prisoner pleaded that there were a great many playing at Nine-Pins on the Common, and the Prosecutor being drunk pull'd out a Guinea and would have play'd for it, but no body would take him up; that he threw his Money down, and they all went into the House to drink; and when the Landlord kickt him out of Doors, as he went home he found the Money among the Nine Pins. But the Jury not, believing him, found him 

               Guilty
             of Felony.

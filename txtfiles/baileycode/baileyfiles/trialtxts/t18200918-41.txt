. On the 11th of July, in the afternoon, these stockings hung by the door, inside the shop - I was sitting by the counter, reading a newspaper - observed the shade of some person in the door-way - I looked up, and observed the prisoner at the door - I missed a pair of stockings. I got over the counter - she presented a pair of new bellows, and asked if I wanted to buy them. I said no, took hold of her arm, and found the stockings under her arm, and another pair in her bundle. I gave her in charge.

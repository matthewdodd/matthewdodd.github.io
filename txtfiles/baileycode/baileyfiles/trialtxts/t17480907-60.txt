            . I lost in July a silver quart tankard, and a silver pint mug.
Q. Where do you live?
Hose . I live in Aldermanbury


; I am a corn-chandler
.
Q. Where were these when you lost them?
Hose. They were in a little room adjoining to my shop.
Q. Have you got them again?
Hose. The tankard is in the constable's hands, the mug is in my possession.
Q. Where did you find the mug?
Hose. I found the mug in Colchester-street Goodman's-fields, and the tankard was found, I believe, upon the woman [The constable produced the tankard, and Mr. Hose the mug, which he said were his property.]
Mrs. Montgomery . The prisoner Fisha brought the tankard to my house one night about 7 o'clock, and gave Seabrook orders either to pawn it, or sell it, as he thought proper.
Q. Do you know any thing of the mug?
Montgomery . The tankard and the mug were in Seabrook's custody all that night.
Pris. Seabrook's Coun. Were not these pieces of plate in your custody?
Montgomery . No.
Pris. Co. Don't you live with Seabrook?
Montgomery . Yes.
Q. What, as a companion?
Montgomery . Yes.

             . I detected the prisoner Fisha, with the tankard in her lap.
Q. Did she say who she had it of?
Marcrost. She did not at first, but afterwards she said she had it of Seabrook.
Pris. Co. Who was with Fisha when you found the tankard upon her?
Marcrost. Seabrook was.
Q. Did you take them?
Marcrost. I took them both on the 28th of July in Upper Moor-fields.
Q. Did Seabrook at any time acknowledge any thing about them?
Marcrost . He owned he had them in his custody.

            . I was an officer in that liberty, and was sent for to Mr. Marcrost's, and there were the two prisoners; and I asked them whose property the tankard was. Fisha said it was not her's, and Seabrook said it was not his; so I took them into custody.

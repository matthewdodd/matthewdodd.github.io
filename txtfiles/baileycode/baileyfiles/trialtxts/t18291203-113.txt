THOMAS RIDGE. I live at No. 15, Cumberland-street Middlesex-hospital


, and am a broker
. I lost a sideboard on the 7th of November - I did not see it taken, but my next door neighbour asked if I had sold it, and I said No; she said there was a man going up the street with in - I followed him, and just got sight of him turning into a coal-shed; it was the prisoner - I went up, and he was endeavouring to conceal the sideboard among some coals; I brought him back - he persisted that he had bought it; I thought he might have bought it of my wife, but she denied it.

            . I am an officer. I took the prisoner - he said he would give me a sovereign to let him go, but he had not got one.
ANN DUSON. I heard the sideboard moved from the prosecutor's door - I went and saw the back of the person, and told the prosecutor.
The prisoner put in a written defence, stating that he had bought the sideboard of a person who stood at the corner of Tottenham-street, for 1s. 6d.

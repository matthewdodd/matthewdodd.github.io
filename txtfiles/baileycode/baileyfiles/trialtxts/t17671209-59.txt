            . I am a waterman; last Tuesday morning, a little after the clock struck two, I saw the two prisoners on board a barge belonging to Powers Fitzer and 
               
                  Christopher 
                  Woodham 
               



            , loaded with coals, they were handing great coals out; we went and took them, and brought them on shore; they had upwards of seven bushels in their boat.

Power Fitzer. The craft upon which the prisoners were taken, belong to me and 
               
                  Christopher 
                  Woodham

            . I saw the two prisoners handing great coals out of the craft; I was with Argent, and helped to secure them.
The prisoners in their defence said, they had assisted a bargeman with his barge, and he had given them the large coals.

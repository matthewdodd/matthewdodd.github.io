. I lost this coat on the 4th of July; I got up in the morning of that day, and cleaned my stibes and knives, and unlocked the area gate; I then went for some knives. I had left the over night; and while I was gone, the prisoner came in, and took the great coat in question off a peg in the servant's hall; he went out, and I followed him, in consequence of information, and seized him; I brought him back with the coat, and sent for an officer.

                   MARSDEN
               



             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. I am an officer belonging to the Police-office, Queen-square: I was sent by the Magistrate's orders to search the prisoner's room, at Mrs. Wood's; here is a list of the articles that I found in that room, with my name signed to it.
Q.How did you open the door? - A. It was opened in my presence, I don't think I ever had the key at all; I found the prisoner's boxes locked, there were two of them, I broke open one of them, I opened the other with a key that I found in the box that I broke open; I found a duplicate in the first box, (produces a duplicate of a gold thimble for twelve shillings); I apprehended the prisoner the next day, in the road leading to Chelsea; before I searched her, she gave me this ticket. (Producing it).
Q.Before that, had you told her upon whose charge you were apprehending her? - A. I had.
Q.(To Mrs. Wood.) In what street did you live? - A. In Queen's row, Plimlico; it is likewise called Queen's-row Terrace.
Court. This duplicate is in the name of Mrs. Mason, King-street.
Mansden. When she gave me the ticket, I accused her with other things of her mistress's; she said she would take me to the place where they were in pledge, and that she had pledged them by her mistress's consent, and gave her the tickets. I went with her to the pawnbroker's.
Q.Was this after, or before you had searched her box? - A. The next day. After I had found the duplicates in her box, I went to the pawnbroker with her, and she called for the articles; I think there was a spencer and three linen gowns, a tambour cloak, and a ring.
Q. Had you then asked her whether she had any duplicates? - A. Yes, before that; she said she had given them to her mistress: I took her to Queen-square Office, and she was committed.
Court. Q. Were any other duplicates found, to your knowledge, besides those for the thimble and the cloak? - A. None.
Q. Did you find any ring upon her? - A. No.
Cross examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. The very first time you questioned her about it, she said she had done it at the request of her mistress? - A. Yes, that is the account she always gave.
Court. Q. Do you know what she was going about when you arrested her? - A. She said she was going to Bow-street, to see her attorney.
Q.Did she tell you who her attorney was? - A. Mr. Combes; she was coming towards the Park.
Court. Q. You were present when the duplicate was found in the box? - A. Yes.
Q.Was Mrs. Wood in the room at that time? - A. Yes.
Q.Did she appear to understand what it was? - A. Not at that time, she did not; I explained to her that it was a duplicate of a thimble, and that it was in pawn; she told me that in a bill she received from the prisoner, there was something like a duplicate, and she supposed that was it. I understand the duplicate is of two articles, one belonging to the mistress, and the other to the servant.

            , Jermyn-street.
Q.Look at that duplicate? - (The duplicate of the thimble). - A. This is our duplicate, (produces a gold thimble); I took it in in the name of 
               
                  Mary
                   Mason
               



            , No. 7. Jermyn-street.
Q.Does this scratch at the bottom stand for Jermyn-street? - A. Yes, it was done in a hurry, and it was late on a Saturday night when she pledged it.
Q.Do you remember the person of the prisoner? - A. Yes, she is the person that pledged it.
Q.Did she ever pledge any thing with you before? - A. No.
Q.Is it not very common for persons to pledge articles of their own in names that do not belong to them? - A. It is very common.
Q.It is a flag of distress that they don't chuse to display? - A. Yes.

Court. It seems to me rather odd that such articles should be taken in from such a woman, with different places of abode; it looks odd.
Mr. Knowlys. There is nothing more common than for persons to pledge goods in names that are not their own.
Mrs. Wood. They are all mine, except the petticoat.


                  THOMAS
                   GREENHILL
               



             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. I believe you ship the adventures of petty officers? - A. Yes.
Q.Are you the agent of Mr. Wood, of Calcutta? - A. I am.
Q.In the character of his agent, were you commissioned to supply Mrs. Wood with money, while he was upon his voyage? - A. Yes, without limitation.
Q.Whenever Mrs. Wood applied to you for supplies of money, had she them? - A. Yes; this is an extract from my ledger,

Q.Between the 30th of March and the 30th of June, had she any supply from you? - A. The 24th March, she had ten guineas; April 4th, ten guineas; May 16th, eighteen pounds, three shillings; July 8th, twenty-five pounds.
Q. If Mrs. Wood had applied for twenty pounds when she applied for ten pounds, would she have had it? - A.Certainly.
Court. Q. Did you ever refuse to let her have money? - A. Never.
Mr. Gurney. Q. I believe you have now a great deal more money in your hands than you have paid? - A. A great deal.
Q. Upon Mrs. Wood being arrested, you were sent for? - A. Yes; but I was out of town, and Mr. Luard was sent for.
FRANCIS LUARD sworn - Examined by Mr. Gurney. I am an attorney in Gray's-inn; on the 12th of July last, I was sent for by Mrs. Wood, I found her at the private house of a sheriff's officer.
Q. Was any bill delivered to you by the prisoner? - A.Yes, the next morning; I had heard of it the day of the arrest, for balance of account for wages, and money laid out in small articles of housekeeping.
Q.Was that the arrest? - A. No, the arrest was for the clothes of the prisoner, of the value of ten pounds and upwards, which she swore in the affidavit she refused to deliver. I desired Mrs. Wood to pay every thing that was justly due to her. I went the next morning; Mr. Armitage met me, and said the attorney was there with the bill; he was here just now: he calls himself Combes, but he is not upon the list. The bill that was delivered to me my agent has lost, since we have attended this Court; the last words of that account were, part of a pledge, half-a-crown.
Q. Was there any thing else about pledges in any part of that bill? - A. None.
Q. Had you any conversation with Mrs. Wood? - A. Yes.
Q. Did it appear to you, from that conversation, that Mrs. Wood understood what a pledge meant? - A. She did not; I had the greatest difficulty in the world to make her understand it; I spoke to her in the English language, and I spoke to her in the French; I put it in every possible shape before I could make her understand it.
Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. A part of that bill was for part of a pledge, half-a-crown, that she had pawned, somehow or other, on account of some pledge? - A. Yes.
Q. And this was before Mrs. Wood had made any charge of felony against her? - A. It was.
Q. Therefore it was drawing Mrs. Wood's attention to the subject of pledges? - A. Not to my knowledge, or in my judgment; it drew her attention to something which turned out to be very bad.
Court. Q. This hill was delivered to you with the article, part of a pledge? - A. Yes.
Q.Was it in consequence of that article, that you advised any step to be taken? - A. To go to Queen-square, and get a search-warrant; she did so.
Mr. Knowlys. Q. You had heard of a demand of wages? - A. Yes, pending the arrest; before she was bailed.
Q. Had you heard from Mrs. Wood that there had been such a demand of wages? - A. I had.
Q. Then Mrs. Wood had been apprized of a demand of wages by her, before she was taken up? - A. I believe so, to the best of my recollection.
Q.Have you any doubt of it? - A. No; and when I say demand of wages, I mean a demand of the balance of a general account of money laid out, and wages together.
Examined by the Court. Q. Do you mean the demand of the bill, then? - A. Yes, the balance stated at the foot of this paper.
Q.Had Mrs. Wood signed that bill at that time? - A.
Q. In answer to Mr. Knowlys's question, you said you had heard from Mrs. Wood, that this woman had made a demand of wages upon her: now are you correct in that? - A. To the best of my recollection, I am.
Q. You say it was in consequence of your advice that Mrs. Wood went to Queen-square? - A. Yes.
Q. Did Mrs. Wood shew any reluctance to follow your advice? - A.None.
Prisoner's defence. I am innocent of the crime of which my mistress wrongfully accuses me; my mistress went with me to Jermyn-street, and stood just by the pawnbroker's till I came out again, to receive the duplicate and the money for the thimble; I gave her the duplicate and twelve shillings; she went to a fishmonger's shop in St. James's-market, and laid out two shillings of it in some salmon for Sunday's dinner; then she went to the poulterer's shop opposite, and bought a fowl at four shillings and sixpence, for the same dinner; the remainder of the money was to pay a grocer's bill that was at home, one pound, two shillings, and threepence-halfpenny. A lace cloak was pledged for one pound, in the beginning of last winter, my mistress gave it me from her drawers, to pledge; the lace is on her handkerchief that she has now round her neck; the money was not enough to pay the baker's bill, and she asked me to lend her my gown and petticoat, because there was not enough to pay the baker; his name is Drake. I pledged them for seven shillings and sixpence: the man brought a note from his master, saying, that he should summons Mrs. Wood if she did, notpay it. Another time I pledged, a shawl for two shillings; the shawl will be produced that was pledged at the same time as the gown, petticoat, and ring were pledged: two shillings went for an ounce of tea and a pound of sugar: before I fetched the shawl home, I pledged a gown and a shawl for four shillings and sixpence, and that was to buy two shilling's-worth of oysters, and a pennyworth of cheese: she gave me one shilling of the money to fetch the shawl home, and I pledged a dirty handkerchief from my own neck, for one shilling, for some green tea, when she was going to have company; and a gold necklace she gave to a French gentleman to pledge at Mr. Turner's, in Panton-street: she gave me the duplicates to keep, as it would hurt her very much if any ladies should see them in her apartment: she went to this French gentleman's for a duplicate, he lived at No. 62, Swallow-street, a stationer's shop, and I brought it home, and put it in my box: she gave this French gentleman a silver tea-pot and stand, and five guineas and a half out of her own pocket, in gold, because the French gentleman was going to be arrested; she left herself without a farthing of money; at that time I bought her a quarter of a pound of bees-sausages, with three halfpence that I had in my pocket; this was somewhere about January: when I came away, my month was up and three days over, and she pushed me out of her apartments, and said I should not stay another moment in her house, nor I should not have my clothes nor my wages, and I now make a demand of my wages, four pounds, ten shillings, and sixpence, and a bundle of asparagus, four shillings and sixpence, which I did not put down in my bill, and I wish to have that, and my clothes. Before I got out of the house I turned back to ask my mistress if all the duplicates were safe; and she told me she had got them safe: all the things that are pledged now was to buy dinners and things when she had company: my mistress gave me two long-sleeve gowns to pledge, and I have got a witness here who was in the house at the time my mistress made me go out with them; she told me if I did leave her it should be the worst day's work I ever did, for she would ruin me and my family; I said, as to my family, she could not hurt them, and as to the duplicates, they were in my name, and I was very sorry for it; she might ruin me, but she could not touch my family. Miss O'Hara was in the room when I asked her if she had got her duplicates safe; I got to the door, and Miss O'Hara was in the room, with the door open: I hope Miss O'Hara will speak the truth between the prisoner and the prosecutor, as her evidence will be of great service to me.

THOMAS WHITE
. I am a cambric-dyer. I know Mr. Stapleys at the corner of Mary-street—he deals in chandlery—on the 16th of October I saw the prisoner standing against the door with another—he said to the other Go and get a 1/2 d. one"—I and my friend crossed, and the prisoner and his friend took this tub, with the herrings in it—I said, You must stop here—he said he would not—I took the tub off his shoulder, and Mr. Stapley and the policeman came and took him.





JAMES STAPLEY
. I am master of this shop. I missed such a tub as this—there is nothing about this tub I can swear to—I have no doubt it is mine.

Prisoner. I was not near the place at all.

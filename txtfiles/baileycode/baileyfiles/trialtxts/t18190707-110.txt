            . I live at Hammersmith. On the 17th of June, about one o'clock in the day, I was in Drury-lane, near Great Queen-street


, a coach had broken down, which occasioned a crowd; I stopped to look at it, there was a cry of
"Mind your pockets." I put my hand down to feel for my handkerchief, and at that time the prisoner snatched my watch out of my fob. I saw him, and caught hold of the ribbon, but he got it away, and passed it to another person - he was seized before he got out of my sight. I have never found it. I saw it in his hand.
Prisoner's Defence. He found nothing on me.

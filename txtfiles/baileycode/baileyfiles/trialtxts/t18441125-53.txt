JOHN JOHNSON
 was indicted

 for stealing 464 yards of Orleans cloth, value 14l., the goods of 



Sydney Aquilla Butterworth and another; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






WILLIAM COVENY DADES
. I know this Orleans cloth. It is the property of Sydney Aquilla Butterworth, and Jabez Butterworth—I know this cloth was delivered by the carriers, and immediately stolen.





JOHN FREEMANTLE
. I am in the service of Mr. Dades. He is agent to Sydney Aquilla Butterworth, and Jabez Butterworth, of Manchester—on the 14th of Nov., at a quarter before two in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner and another man, and the other man lifted this bale of cloth on the prisoner's back from the gate-way, leading to Mr. Dades' warehouse—I followed the prisoner to Watling-street, and took him with this bale on his back—he said a gentleman had asked him to carry it.

Prisoner. Why did he not give the other man in charge?

Witness They parted; one went one way, and the other the other—he was not a gentleman, but such another as the prisoner—I saw them both in the gate-way, and the other lifted it on the prisoner's back.





JOSEPH COMBER KNIGHT
 (City police-constable 437.) I took the prisoner, and found this bag in his pocket, it is large enough to have covered this bale.

Prisoner's Defence. I was standing at the corner; a young man asked me if I had anything to do; I said, "No;" he took me to the place with him, and put this on my back; he told me to follow him; I turned to follow him, when the witness caught hold of me; I said I was going after that gentleman; he said he should hold me, it did not matter about the other man; the man was not ten yards from us.





GEORGE DIXON
 (police-constable E 137.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the man, and that he had been before convicted of felony.




GUILTY

Transported for Seven Years

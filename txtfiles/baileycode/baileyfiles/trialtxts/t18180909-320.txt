            . On the 24th of July, about eight o'clock in the evening, I was going through the posts on
Saffron-hill


, and saw some men standing there; they divided; as I came to the posts the prisoner rushed against me with great violence, and put his hands to my fob. I felt him draw my watch out, and immediately secured him; the others closed upon me. I took the watch from him. The gang demanded of me to let him go. I refused and held him fast. I had another person with me, or they would have rescued him. They wanted me to take him into a house to search him. I held him about ten minutes, when Limbrick and Read came and took him. I never let him go.
JOHN LIMBRICK. I am an officer. Read and I were going by, and took the prisoner in charge from the prosecutor.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. The prosecutor was in liquor, and said I took his watch. I know nothing about it.

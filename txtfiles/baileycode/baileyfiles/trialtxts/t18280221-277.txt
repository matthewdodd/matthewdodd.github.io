JAMES ILES CHAFFIN. On the 25th of February I was returning with a friend from Drury-lane Theatre - I was under the Piazza in Covent-garden, near James-street


, and had an opera-glass in my right-hand coat pocket (I do not reside in town) - I felt my pocket lighter; an officer came and told me I had been robbed, and produced it. I had not seen the prisoner.

            . I am a watchman, in the employ of the Commissioners of Woods and Forests. I was returning home, and saw the prisoner and another go up to this gentleman; the prisoner took the glass out of his pocket - I seized them both, but was obliged to let the other go, as there were a number of boys and girls round; I took the glass from him.(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner. He has a spite against me.

               Transported for Seven Years

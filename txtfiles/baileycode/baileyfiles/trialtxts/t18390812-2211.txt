JAMES GOODHALL
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
23rd of July, one handkerchief, value $"., the goods of 



Edward Whitmore, from his person.






EDWARD WHITMORE, ESQ
. I live in Lombard-street. At half-past eight o'clock on the 23rd of July I was in the Strand, and Davis gave me information—I felt, and missed my handkerchief—this is it.





GEORGE DAVIS
. I live in Little Compton-street. I was in the Strand and had just passed the prosecutor—I saw the prisoner with another boy about his height, and a young man—I turned round and saw the prosecutor's coat move, and something light pass from the other boy to the prisoner—they immediately passed the prosecutor—I told the prosecutor, and then went after them—the other two made their escape—I took the prisoner, and upon pulling open his jacket I took this handkerchief from his pocket.

Cross-examined by
MR. DOANE. Q. How near was he to the prosecutor when you saw something pass? A. Very close—I was about two

yards off—I am sure this is the boy I found it on—he never went out of my custody after.
(Ann Lane, a laundress, gave the prisoner a good character.)




GUILTY
. Aged 14.—


Transported for Ten Years—Isle of Wight.

I am Mr. Yates's clerk, he is a pewterer
, No. 20, Shoreditch


; on the 18th of October, Mr. Yates received a letter informing him of the robbery; I marked some goods about one, and about six in the evening Mr. Yates and I went out, and returned at eight, and searched every workman; a dozen of spoons were found on a chair, another dozen found under a chair, but who put them there I cannot say. I marked the spoons after they were found.

                   PITT
               



             sworn.
I was employed by the prosecutor, on the 19th of October, about seven, I met my master, he begged me to stop to be searched, the three prisoners were ordered to stand by themselves in the parlour. My master readthe letter; during that time one dozen of spoons were laid on the chair behind where Clinch stood, and I heard a rustling, and saw Owen shuffling something into his bosom. I asked him what he had there, he said he had nothing, but turned round, and attempted to pull off his coat, and there was a bundle laid on the ground between his legs; neither Clinch nor Blair stooped down at this time; there was a carpet on the room and a cloth over that, and each spoon was in a single paper.

             sworn.
I am another of the journeymen; last Wednesday I was desired to keep a sharp look out after the three prisoners; I placed myself opposite to them, and while my master was reading the letter I observed Clinch stoop with his hands under the chair behind him, and there was a dozen of spoons, which master opened; then Pitt took the candle and looked, and there was no more then: while these spoons were examining, a second parcel was found near Owen, between him and the chair; he stood before the chair, close to it; I do not say whether the spoons were between his legs, for when charged he moved his situation.

             sworn.
I was present at the search, I observed nothing particular till the spoons were taken out of the chair, then I saw Owen endeavouring to shift himself, and I saw him stoop, and something dropped, I did not see it, I heard it.


                  HANNAH

             sworn.
I have a stand in the Fleet-market, I sell hard ware and spoons; six weeks ago the prisoner Clinch offered and sold me some spoons, I gave him two shillings a dozen, and bought of him several times; he said, I make them myself, I live in Petticoat-lane. (The spoons that were found on the chair near Clinch deposed to, marked R. Y. And are part of the goods that were marked.)
PRISONER CLINCH's DEFENCE.
About five weeks ago I was coming down Holborn, and met a man with about six dozen of table spoons and tea spoons, he stopped me, he asked me to go of a message for him, and he shewed me the spoons, and bid me go to a woman that stands in the Fleet-market, and sell them, I did so, and he gave me a shilling.
PRISONER OWEN's DEFENCE.
I know nothing of the spoons, nor knew nothing of them till that night we were stopped.

THOMAS BELLAMY
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
5th of April, 1 handkerchief, value 2s., the goods of 



Joseph Rush Fordham, from his person.






JOSEPH RUSH FORDHAM
. On Sunday afternoon, the 5th April, I was crossing the Minories to the corner of George-street—a gentleman spoke to me, and I missed this handkerchief.

Prisoner. That handkerchief is my own property, there is no mark upon it. Witness. I know it by the pattern, having one of the same pattern, and by losing this at the same time.





MARK LAST
. I was at my brother-in-law's drawing-room window, about three o'clock—I saw the prosecutor walking with a lady—the prisoner followed him and pulled out a handkerchief, which I believe was this—I opened the window, and called to the prosecutor that he was robbed—I shouted, "Stop thief, stop thief"—the policeman took the prisoner before he got out of my sight.

Prisoner. Q. How was it that you was with the policeman when I was taken into custody? A. I was not, I went down when the policeman had got you—I suppose about two minutes afterwards—you were going between a run and a walk—you were taken about twenty or thirty yards off.





GEORGE ENGLISH
 (police-constable H 153.) I was on duty, and took the prisoner—he attempted to rush by me—I took him by the collar—he asked me two or three times to let him go—I got him on the pavement when the last witness came up—I looked into his right-hand pocket, and saw this handkerchief—he did not say it was his then.

Prisoner. Q. Was I running? A. Between a run and a walk.

Prisoner's Defence. I was walking—I heard a cry of "Stop thief," and the policeman took me—he took this handkerchief out of my pocket, but I had bought it of Mr. Sowerby, the pawnbroker.




GUILTY
. Aged 19.—


Transported for Seven Years.

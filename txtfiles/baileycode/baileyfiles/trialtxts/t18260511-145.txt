JAMES AVREY. I am a bricklayer
, and live in Green-street, Theobald's-road. I was at Holloway


 on the 4th instant, the day when the first stone was laid for the new church; I was in the crowd, and missed my watch when I was coming away (I had not seen it for an hour before); an officer shewed it to me since, and I saw the prisoner at Hatton-garden.

            . I am an officer. On the 4th of May I was on duty at Holloway, and saw the prisoner there with ten or eleven more; I suspected something wrong: I went up, and seized the prisoner, and took this watch out of his pocket - there were ten or twelve of them together. I saw the prosecutor afterwards; this is the watch, which the prosecutor claimed.(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I saw the watch laying in the road - I picked it up, and put it into my pocket.



               GUILTY
            . Aged 20.

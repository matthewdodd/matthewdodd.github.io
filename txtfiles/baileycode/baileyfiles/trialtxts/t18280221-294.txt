ANN ATLEE. I live in Turnmill-street. The prisonerlodged with me for nine days; on the 2d of February he came and gave my child a book, and said he should work at home next week - I said the child could not read, and told him I wanted a flat iron: he fetched me down two from his room; he and his wife left that night - they took the key, and never returned; I broke the door open on Monday, and missed all this property, none of which has been found.

            . I am a constable. I took the prisoner at the Horns, Kennington; I told him the charge - he said"I surrender myself to you, in order to exonerate the girl," alluding to a girl I had taken before - I found some money on him.
Prisoner's Defence. I can only deny it - the young woman I lived with took the room; the things were all safe when I left - I said I would exonerate the girl, because she left two hours before me, but I did not take the things; the door is always open, and there are several lodgers - I locked the door, and left the key in it when I left; I cannot recover my character, and if I am transported it will be a pleasure to me - but declare I am innocent.

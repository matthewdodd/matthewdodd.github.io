            . On the 10th of this month, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, running out of Cornhill by Bishopsgate street


, I observed something twitch my pocket ; I turned round and looked: then I saw the prisoner's hand near my pocket, with my handkerchief in it; he ran away near Gracechurch-street with it in his hand. I called out a pickpocket, and a person in a court hearing me, pursued the prisoner, and took him. He put his hand in his bosom, and took out my handkerchief. (Produced in Court.) He was taken within twenty yards of me, and was not out of my sight all the time.

            . I was going along Cornhill, between seven and eight in the evening on the 10th of this month: I heard somebody cry a pickpocket; the prisoner came running across the away; I ran and took hold on him in about twenty yards running. Mr. Jones came up. I put my hand in the prisoner's bosom, and took a handkerchief, which Mr. Jones said was his.

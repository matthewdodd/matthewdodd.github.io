2nd of August, 1 purse, value 6d.; 14 sovereigns, 2 half-sovereigns, 2 half-crowns, one shilling, and 1 sixpence, the goods and monies of

ROBERT JOHN BENJAMIN CHAMBERS
. On the evening of the 2nd of this month I was in the dress-circle of the Haymarket theatre—in consequence of information I felt in my pocket for my purse, and missed it about nine or ten o'clock—it contained fourteen sovereigns, two half-sovereigns, and an odd shilling—I had felt it safe a quarter of an-hour or ten minutes before.





EDWARD GREEN
. I am free-list taker at the Haymarket theatre. On the evening of the 2nd of August I saw the prisoner at the theatre—I saw him go into several boxes in the dress-circle, which made me watch him—at last I saw him take a purse from Mr. Chambers' pocket—I was looking through the glass in the door—he immediately rose up, put his gloves on, and left the theatre—I followed him—he went down the Hay-market among the coaches, hearing footsteps behind him—I said, "You have robbed a gentleman in the theatre, I insist on your coming back and delivering up the property"—he put his hand into his pocket and gave me this purse from it with all the money in it—I took him back to the theatre and gave him to the constable, who found the property stated in the last trial on him.





JAMES HACKWELL
. The prisoner was given into my charge with the purse.
(Purse produced and sworn to.)

Prisoner's Defence. The man says he saw me through the glass window of the box, and yet let me go into the street, why not detain me?





EDWARD GREEN
. I did not like to disturb the audience.

MARY ANN BIGG
. I am the wife of Edward Bigg—we live in Westmoreland-place, land-place, Camberwell. On the 18th of Oct. we had a time-piece—I saw it safe at half-past seven o'clock that morning—I missed it at ten minutes past eight—this is it—I had left the parlour window open a little way—there were flower-pots outside.

Cross-examined by
MR. ROBINSON. Q. Are you quite sure you saw it safe at half-past seven? A. Yes.





EDWARD ROBINS
. I am a gardener. On Friday morning, the 18th of Oct., I saw the two prisoners walking about Westmoreland-place—I watched them, and saw Randall go into the prosecutor's window, and take out the time-piece, and deliver it to Ashley—I and Clark ran after them—Clark caught Ashley, and I ran and took Randall.

Cross-examined. Q. Did Ashley run away? A. He could not—he was held tight by Clark, and I ran after Randall—I saw some flower-pots taken down by one of the prisoners, I do not know which, and Randall got in at the window—that I swear—it was about ten minutes past eight—the prisoners were together—I saw them together—while Randall went in Ashley was outside, on the grass-plot in the little garden—I have known both the prisoners for some time.

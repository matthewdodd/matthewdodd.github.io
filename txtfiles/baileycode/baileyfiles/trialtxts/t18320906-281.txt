             (Police-constable I 51). On the 24th of August I was at Ealing, at half-past one o'clock in the afternoon - I saw the prisoner and Harvey quarrelling about some watches; the other said to the prisoner,"You stole a watch from Hammersmith" - the prisoner said, "Yes, and you stole one from Isleworth the other week;" I then took them into custody - I found nothing on Harvey, but on the prisoner I found this watch.
Prisoner. I bought it of Harvey.

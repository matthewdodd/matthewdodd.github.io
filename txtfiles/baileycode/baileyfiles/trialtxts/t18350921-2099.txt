JOHN PATERSON
. I keep a broker's shop in the Greenwich-road. Or the 21st of September, I lost a pestle and mortar—this is the mortar.





JOHN EVANS
 (police-constable R 190.) I was on duty at Greenwich on

the 21st of September—I saw the prisoner go to Mr. Pateson's window—he put his hand in—I took out something, which he concealed under his jacket, and went off at a quick step between a walk and a run—I called the officer who was on duty, and told him—before the officer came up to him, I saw the prisoner stoop, and conceal something at the step of a door—I went there, and found this mortar.

Prisoner. I was walking quite slowly. Witness. You did, after you deposited it there.




GUILTY
. Aged 19.—


Transported for Seven Years.

Sixth Jury, before Mr. Common Sergeant.

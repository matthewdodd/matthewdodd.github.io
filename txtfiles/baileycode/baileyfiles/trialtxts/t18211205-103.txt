            . I belong to the Humane Society. I saw the prosecutor walking along; the prisoner and two others were together, one of them took the handkerchief out of the prosecutor's pocket, and gave it to the prisoner. I went and told him to follow me, and I pursued and took the prisoner; and as he ran he took the handkerchief out of his hat, and threw it down an area, it lodged on the rails, I picked it up and secured him.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

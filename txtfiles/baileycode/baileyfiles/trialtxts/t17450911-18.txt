             , of St. Martin's in the Fields


, was indicted for 


               stealing 150 complete sets of the 1st, 2d, 3d and 4th vol. of the Roman history, By Ozell, of the value of 30 l. 400 sheets, being part of the 5th and 6th vol value 3 l. and 200 books of the 4th vol. value 10 l. the goods of 
                     
                        
                           Francis 
                           Blayer 
                        




                      
                  , privately in the warehouse of the said Francis
            , July 17
.

                  Blayer 
               



            . These goods were in a warehouse belonging to Mr. Carne, I had not room to put them in my warehouse, so he gave me leave to put them into his, till I could get a chap to buy them; and when I came to look for them, there were only thirteen bundles out of 47. I discovered it first by this; my wife sent a pair of muffatees to Mr. Avery to be died, and they were sent home in some of my paper. I enquired how he came by that paper , and he said he bought it of one Mr. Roberts .


                  William 
                  Roberts 
               



            . In November last, the Prisoner's wife brought a parcel of this paper in loose sheets in her apron, and I gave her two pence farthing a pound, which is the common price for waste paper; I had about three hundred weight of her, and I made use of it from November till the 17th of July, before I knew it was stole, and then Mr. Carne and Mr. Blayer came to me to know if I had got that paper: so I took the Prisoner and his wife up, and the remainder of the paper I had left, was returned to Mr. Carne's house . I carried them before Sir 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Deveil 
               



            , and he committed him, and discharged his wife: he was committed upon his own confession , he owned he sold great part of the paper himself .
Q. Did he say he took it?
Roberts. He said he was ruined and undone forever.
Q. What business is the Prisoner?
Roberts. He is a carver by trade.

                  Carne 
               



            . The Prisoner worked with me two years, and when Mr Blayer brought this cargo, which was a very large one, I told him, I had a large warehouse to put it into, and I did not think any of my men would take it; the front of the pile always remained whole, and they had taken it away behind, and had as it were scooped it. Mr. Blayer said, Mr. Carne here is but very little paper left, here are but thirteen bundles; I said to the Prisoner, you had better confess the fact; and he said, he had sold between four and five hundred weight to one; I have three hundred, three quarters, eleven pound and a half , which he had sold to Mr. Ninn . When the Prisoner worked for me, he always behaved very well. I paid him a guinea a week, and when he worked piece work, I have paid him 25 or 30 l. a week. I would employ him again if he was at liberty, to make any work at home.

                  Ninn 
               



            . My servant bought two parcels of paper of the Prisoner of about half an hundred weight each, and I paid him for a third of about half an hundred, and there were several other parcels that he brought afterwards .

                  Blayer 
               



            . I sold the thirteen bundles to Mr. 
               
                  William 
                  Rayner 
               



            , for 32 l. 16 s. which makes my whole loss, according to that computation, amount to 85 l.

                  Carne 
               



            . The Prisoner said, he cut the sheets so, as to put them into his pocket or into his breast, for if he had carried never so little a thing openly, I must have seen it, as he came out .
Prisoner. I never stole any of the paper, but it was brought me, and I sold it.
Godwin Prime. I asked him, (I think it was in New Prison) how he came to do so, and he said the devil possessed him: he said, he took the paper by piece-meal, and desired to speak with Mr. Crane and Mr. Blayer. I have entrusted him with a great deal, and he always had a good character; and I would employ him again, that is, if he made any goods at home, I would buy them of him.
The indictment being laid for stealing them in the warehouse of

            , and it appearing they were stole in the warehouse of 
               
                  Charles 
                  Carne 
               



            , He was 


               acquitted of privately stealing in the warehouse, which is a capital offence, and found guilty of the felony only
            .

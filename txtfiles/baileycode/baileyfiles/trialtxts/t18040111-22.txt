(The case was opened by Mr. Gurney, and stated by Mr. Knapp.)
Mr. 
               
                  JOHN 
                  GARCIAS
               



             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. I believe you live in Finsbury-square


? - A. Yes, and in April last I employed Mess. Wild to bottle off three pipes of port for me; the prisoners came to do it; they had been at my house before; I saw them at work bottling the wine in my cellar; I asked them to be careful in taking away all the ullage, or thick part, into bottles; they said they had, and in order to draw off the wine clearer, they turned the pipe edgeways; they pointed out thirteen bottles, in which they said they had put the ullage of the three pipes; I saw Miller particularly officious, and thought it was occasioned by drinking too much wine; thepipes were taken out of the cellar before me, and Miller locked the door, and brought me the keys.
Cross-examined by Mr. Gleed. Q. You gave no particular directions as to the manner the wine was to be drawn off? - A. No.
Q. When the men went away, did they give you the quantity of wine in the binns? - A. They marked it with chalk on the binns.
Q. Have you since that time had an opportunity of examining those binns? - A. I have.
Q. Have you found the quantity correspond with the numbers? - A. With twenty-two broken bottles found in the middle of the binns, it corresponds with the number; the twenty-two broken bottles might be accident.
Court. Q. How much did you find in the binns? - A. One hundred and fifty-one dozen and nine bottles, including the twenty-two broken ones.


                  JOHN 
                  WILD
               



             sworn. - I and my brother are wine-merchants and wine-coopers; the prisoners were our servant

s; Pugh has been so nearly twelve years, Miller upwards of six: On Saturday the 30th of April I was with them at Mr. Garcias's, and saw the pipes were full; I thought they would yield fifty-two dozen for each pipe, which would be one hundred and fifty-six dozen, without the grounds, and I should have expected to have found three times thirteen bottles of ullage or grounds at least; I speak within compass when I say thirteen bottles a pipe.


                  THOMAS

                  PARISH
               



             sworn. - I live in Halfmoon-street, Bishopsgate-street, opposite Miller's: On Saturday the 30th of April, I was cleaning my windows, and saw Sellwood bring a cart to Miller's house, with two or three pipes in it; I saw the name of Wild on the cart; the cart came in a hurry to the door, and at a single knock the door was opened in a moment; they were all in confusion; one of the pipes was removed a little way by the cops of the cart, and a thing with a cock was put into the bung-hole; two pails lined with copper were then brought; Miller filled the first; they were all assisting as fast as they could; Pugh took in the second in a hurry, and Miller scolded his wife, upon which a pan was brought to the door in the passage, and a pail emptied into it, while Pugh was drawing another; a knock was made at my door, and I was obliged to go down, but I think I saw four pails drawn full, but I will not speak to more than I know; as soon as it was over the things were hurried into the cart, and it drove off as fast as possible. Sometime after my husband sent information to Mr. Wild, as I had seen the cart there several times.
Cross-examined by Mr. Gleed. Q. How long have you lived opposite Miller? - A. About four years.
Q. Did you always go by the name of Parish? - A. No; our real name is Parish; my husband's mother sent to him to inform him that he was by a former husband, and his name was Parish.
Q. You went before the Lord Mayor in December? - A. Yes.
Q. And this took place in April? - A. Yes.
Q. How do you know that? - A. For a particular reason, which I suppose I am not obliged to state.
Q. Can you write? - A. No.
Q. Can you read? - A. Yes.
Q. How far might the cart stand from the door? - A. There is a corner, and our house is in a nook; but the horses heads were towards Bishopsgate-street.
Q. Were there two or three pipes in the cart? - A. There were three no doubt, but I will not be positive.
Q. Have you not, in giving an account of some former transaction, stated there were only two? - A. Not to the best of my recollection.
Q. Have you not said there were only two? - A. I was not positive to be on my oath that there were three, but I think there were.

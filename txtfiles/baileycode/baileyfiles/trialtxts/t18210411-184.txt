            . I am an officer. About eight o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoners, suspecting them, I followed them, and just as I turned the corner, one of them snatched this tongue down - I saw them run from the shop with it - they had nothing before. I followed and stopped Billet, he said he had it of Peeling, and Peeling said he did not have it from him.

            . I met Read, following the prisoners. I went on; soon after the prisoners came by me with something - they had nothing before; we stopped them, one said it was a tongue which he had from the other, and the other said he knew nothing about it.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
PEELING'S Defence. I met this man, he said he was going my way; he left me, and soon after brought the tongue up, saying he found it.
BILLETT'S Defence. They have both told an untruth - the tongue laid inside some rails in the New-road - I took it out.

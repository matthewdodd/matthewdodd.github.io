            . I am a hardwareman
, and live in Leadenhall-street


. On the morning of the 6th of August, between nine and ten o'clock, these things were stolen. I saw them safe a few minutes before; I saw some boys loitering about the shop, and one less than the prisoner came in and go out immediately. I saw him take these things off the counter; we pursued him; there were four of them; I saw the prisoner throw the property out of his apron; they all went different ways, and I took the prisoner.

ALFRED HAY



, stealing 9 shillings; the moneys of 



George Smith; having been before convicted.






GEORGE SMITH
. I live in Holborn-buildings. On 14th Sept., I gave the prisoner nine shillings to go on an errand for me—he did not return.

Cross-examined by
MR. THOMPSON. Q. What did you give it him for? A. To go and fetch a donkey from Watford—that is ten or eleven miles from Uxbridge—I was to give 12s. for it, and I gave the prisoner 9s., and goods to the amount of 4s. 6d., that he might pay for the donkey, and get himself a day's work out of it—I said, if he did not sell the herrings I gave him to get the don key, he was to bring the money back that night—I left London that morning, and went down by the railway—I have employed the prisons before—he did not come to me, but I saw him, and said, "Where is the money?"—he said he had got drunk, laid down in the field, and lost it.





JOHN DENT
 (policeman, T 141). I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction at this Court—(read—Convicted Jan., 1846; confined six months)—he is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 19.—


Transported for Seven Years.

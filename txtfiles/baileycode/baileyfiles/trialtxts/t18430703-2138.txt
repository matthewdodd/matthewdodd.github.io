JOHN EATON
 (police-constable S 193.) On the 29th of June I saw Brown in the crowd very busy trying several gentlemen's pockets—I followed him to Pall-mall, where Cooper joined him—they went behind a gentleman—Brown pot bis hand into the gentleman's pocket, took this handkerchief out, and gave it to Cooper, who put it into his pocket—I took him, and took it out of his pocket—the gentleman said, "That is mine"—he tried to get it from me—I would not let him have it—on taking Cooper, he said, "I have two more handkerchiefs which I bought of Brown"—I found five more on him altogether.





GEORGE GEORGE
. I saw Brown attempting to pick several gentlemen's pockets, and I saw him draw the handkerchief, and hand it to Cooper—Cooper's hat was taken off, and these other handkerchiefs found.

Cooper. Q. Did you see Brown pass the handkerchief to me? A. Yes, and I saw you speak to one another.

Cooper. I heard George ask the policeman what he should say, and he said, "Say you saw Brown take the handkerchief and give it to Cooper." Witness. He did not—I had been nearly an hour watching Brown.

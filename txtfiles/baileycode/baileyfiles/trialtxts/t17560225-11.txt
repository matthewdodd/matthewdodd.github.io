            . I lost the goods that are mentioned in the indictment last Wednesday about 12 o'clock: I was just come in with these things from the washerwoman, and went to draw a tankard of beer; the prisoner and 3 Irish men were just come in; when I came up with the beer, they and the things were gone; I ran out and met the woman in Fleet-street, near the end of Salisbury-court; I asked her if she had been at the Castle in Portugal-street; she said no. I laid hold of her hand, and the apron and things dropped from under her arm; a man struck me, and said she should not go with me, but a gentleman said she should go; then the man went away and left us. The goods produced in court.
Prisoner's defence.
I was going along the street. I met some men who sell oranges and lemons, they took me in at this house and called for a tankard of beer, we went away and that man came and laid hold of me, and I saw a young man pick up the handkerchiefs off the ground; he said I had stole them, and because the man struck him, he now swears it on me,

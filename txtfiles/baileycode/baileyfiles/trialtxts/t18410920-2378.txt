WILLIAM WYATT
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
8th of September, 1 handkerchief, value 1s., the goods of 



Frederick Kenyon, from his person.






FREDERICK KENYON
. I am a linen-draper. Between three and four o'clock, on the 8th of September, I was in St. Martin's-court—the witness asked if I had lost any thing—I felt in my pocket, and missed my handkerchief—he told me the prisoner was gone on into St. Martin's-lane—I went and took him by the collar, and saw it in his left-hand pocket—this now produced is it.





HENRY NORTON
. I saw the prisoner take the handkerchief out of the prosecutor's pocket, and put it into his own—he turned round, looked into a shop window, let the prosecutor go on, and then he went on.

Prisoner's Defence. I had no work; I came down St. Martin's-court; I saw the handkerchief lying down, took it up, put it into my pocket, and walked to the bottom of the court; the gentleman caught hold of me, asked me for it, and before I had time to take it out, he took it out.




GUILTY
.* Aged 21.—


Transported for Ten Years.

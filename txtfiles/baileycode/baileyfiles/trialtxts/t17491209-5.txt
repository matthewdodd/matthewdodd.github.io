            . I live at Totenham




, I keep the White-Hart inn
, I have been robb'd as mentioned in the indictment, but I never saw the Prisoner to my knowledge till the 28th of Oct, when he was taken. My house was broke open on the 26th of July, between the hours of 2 and 4 I saw all the doors and windows fast before I went to bed that night, as I always do, about 6 o'clock my maids got up, and they called me, there was a window, the glass of which was taken down, it was an old fashioned window, and the doors were open.
Q. What did you loose?
Walker. I lost a hat, a tea chest, 3 cannisters, a pound of tea in a cannister, one napkin, a velvet pillareen, a hand-bell, a pocket book, some papers, notes of hand, and other things, a pair of silver spurs, and a hat of Mr. Thomas's.
Q. When did you see these things before ?
Walker. I made use of the hand-bell behind the bar the night before, and had wore my hat that day; here is the bell and pocket-book in court. I had intelligence where the Prisoner lodg'd, 
               
                  Edmund 
                  Thomas 
               



             and 
               
                  Daniel 
                  Richardson 
               



             assisted in taking him; when we came to his lodgings in Maiden-Lane in Southwark, we asked for him, he was not at home, we went up stairs into his room, and found about nine pocket-books, one of them was mine, and the bell was hid in the middle of the bed, and I found this hat, this was the 28th of Oct. I being inform'd he used to pawn things with Mr. Jennings, went there and found my hat, which I can swear to by the lining, &c. All the things I lost was valued at about 3 l. exclusive of Mr. Thomas's spurs and hat.
Mr. Thomas deposed the same, as to taking the Prisoner in Maiden-Lane, and finding the pocket-books and hand-bell, with this addition, that the Prisoner got away from them after they had search'd him, but they took him again, and that the Prisoner's landlady told them, that sometimes the Prisoner went out in a gold lac'd waistcoat and ruffles, and sometimes in a mean dress, crying hot pyes, and that they found a pack of cards in his pocket wrapp'd up in one of Mr. Walker's bills, which Mr. Walker confirm'd.
Q. from the Prisoner. I desire the prosecutor may be ask'd, whether he has ever heard any ill of me?
Walker. I have heard of several robberies committed by him, since these things were found in Maiden-Lane.



                  Wm 
                  Jennings 
               



            . I believe, I may have seen the Prisoner about fifteen times, bringing things and fetching them out again.
Q. What are you?
Jennings. I am a Pawnbroker.
Q. Did he ever come to you in a gold laced waistcoat and ruffles ?
Jennings Yes, he has, he told me he was a hare dresser, but I did not know where he lived then; I took in this hat, Mr. Walker has swore to it three times in his own name, I lent him half a crown on it.
Q. to Mr. Walker. What is the value of that hat ?
Walker. About three half crowns, it cost me a guinea when new.
Q. from the Prisoner. Was the lace, upon the waistcoat gold or not ? you have it now in your possession.
Jennings. It is not right gold.
Q. What do you mean by right gold?
Jennings. It is tinsel.
Q. What did you lend him upon it?
Jennings. I lent him 6 s. upon it.
Prisoner's Defence. I found these things. I never saw the prosecutor's house in my life.




               Guilty, 4 s. 10 d.

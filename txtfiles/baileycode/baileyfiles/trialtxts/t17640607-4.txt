            . On Sunday, the 27th of May, between 9 and 10 o'clock in the evening, going to Cecil-street Coffee-house, in the Strand, I felt a jirk at my pocket; I looked, and saw my handkerchief in the hand of a little boy, and he delivered it to the prisoner: I seized him, and he delivered it to a third person; having nobody to assist me, I could catch none but the prisoner and one of the others. I carried them into the coffee-house, and desired the waiter to search them, but he did not chuse to do it, and I did not care to do it myself, I did not find my handkerchief, but let them both go. The prisoner was taken up afterwards, for picking another gentleman's pocket; then I appeared before Mr. Alderman Nelson, and gave the same account as I have here; upon which, he bound me over to appear: this is the fourteenth handkerchief that I have lost this winter; I have transported three persons, and intend never to forgive any that I can catch.
Prisoner's Defence.
I and another young lad were coming along the Strand: the prosecutor turned round, and took us both by the collar, and carried us into the coffee-house; after that, they found nothing upon us, they bid us go about our business. I never saw that young man since; he is gone to Bristol.
Prosecutor. The other young man struck at the officer, when he took hold of him.
For the Prisoner.

            . I am brother to the prisoner, and live in Cooper's Row, Clerkenwell; I am a gold and silver spinner, so is he: he has worked and lived with me from the death of my mother, which is about a year and a half ago.

            . I was walking up Fleetstreet



, on the 30th of May, about nine at night; there was a gentleman with me: I felt something taken out of my pocket; I turned round, and saw the prisoner, and a boy behind me; I seized the prisoner, and found my handkerchief between his coat and his waistcoat, behind him. ( Produced and deposed to.)
Prisoner's Defence.
I was walking along, and this gentleman turned about; the boy ran away, and threw the handkerchief, and it hit against me, over the coat; I bid him stop that young man, but he got off: I never saw the handkerchief, till the gentleman picked it from the ground.
Prosecutor. I had the handkerchief from between the prisoner's cloaths, not from the ground.

             sworn.
I took up Lyon Abrahams'; I understood then that they were his lodgings; now I understand that they are the prisoner's: I took this china out of these lodgings on the 17th of October. (Producing the china mentioned in the indictment).
WOOD. This china is my property; it was taken out of my warehouse.
Court. Then you discredit the former conviction; the principals were convicted upon the idea of it being their lodgings.

                   KING
               



             sworn.
I went to the house of the prisoner on Monday the 6th of November, between nine and ten in the morning; she was taking a great quantity of china bowls out of a bottom drawer and putting them into a hamper; a porter carried two hampers full away; the prisoner shewed me a cup of such a pattern as this; she said she should like to keep that: she did not say how she came by them.

            . The prisoner was in the house when the china came from Mr. Wood's warehouse; she was a bed when Alexander, Armstrong, and Abrahams brought it in; she looked at some cups and saucers.

The prisoner is the person that took the apartment of me.

PRISONER's DEFENCE.
I am very innocent of what that woman has swore against me.
She called one witness, who gave her a good character.

            . On the 20th of September, in the evening, the prisoner came to Mr. Beloe's shop - he is a linen-draper
 in Clare-street, Clare-market


 - there was another young woman with her; when the prisoner left the shop, I followed, and found under her arm, this piece of ribbon; it might have been a yard, or a yard and a quarter from where she stood; she had not asked for ribbon - it has our mark on it.
Prisoner's. I have no recollection of taking it - a person went with me with the intention of buying a pair of gloves, and some ribbon; I had no thought of taking it till it was taken from me - we had been drinking together - I had it in my hand.
GEORGE BATES. No - it was under her arm, and under her shawl.
WILLIAM BELOE. This is my ribbon; they both appeared sober - I had not sold the prisoner any thing; the other had a pair of gloves; I do not remember what was paid for them.

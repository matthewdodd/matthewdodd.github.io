 to Mr. Lindo, who lives at Canonbury


. On the 25th of October, between five and six o'clock in the evening, this coat was taken from the laundry. I was in the garden, and saw the prisoner come and open the gate with something under his apron. I ran out, missed the coat, and told him to come back and produce the parcel which he had - he denied it - he then shewed me where he had thrown it; I found it over a garden-wall.

            . I caught the prisoner in the laundry, and asked him what he wanted? I told him never to come there again - this was on the 21st, and on the 25th he came again, and asked if I wanted any wood. I am sure he is the man.

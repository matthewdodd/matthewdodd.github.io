. About the 7th of September the prisoner came to my house with a paper, which he put into my hand, and desired me to read; I found it to be a sort of agreement drawn up, without a seal to it. I asked him what he meant, and he said he was about to commence a very extensive job for the Archbishop of Canterbury, and to build two first rate houses, and some store-houses, and as I was in the building line he wished me to undertake it. I took him into the parlour and questioned him about it; he afterwards went away, saying he would call again, which he did on the following Friday; he again asked me to undertake the job, and I thought there might be some truth in it. I gave him some bread and cheese, and gin and water, and he asked if I would allow him to pay his men at my house; I said Yes; he said he had a gang of excavators at work at Battle-bridge; he came on the Saturday evening - he took out a book and began writing in it; he asked me to give him 2l. in change, which I laiddown on the table, and he said he would give me a note for it in a minute, but when I turned round he was gone. I never intended to part with my change till I had got the note.

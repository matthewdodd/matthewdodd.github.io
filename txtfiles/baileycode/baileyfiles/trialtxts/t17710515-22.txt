            . I lived with Miss Matthews, when she removed from Hyde street, Bloomsbury, to Bloomsbury square, the third of April. I went to 
               
                  Jane
                   Dell
               



             to enquire for something we had lost; the prisoner had on a handkerchief that belonged to Miss Matthews, and she produced a handkerchief to me that night to match Miss Matthews's. (The handkerchief produced.) I can swear that this is Miss Matthews's; here is the fellow to it that came of the same piece; she said she bought it, and her cousin had the fellow to it. The justice asked her if she had any thing to say for herself; she said she had nothing to say for herself; we missed an apron we never found.
Q. Did you ever hear what become of it?
Denbigh. Yes; the prisoner when I said I would take out a search warrant said, I was rath. She pulled out the table cloth from under 
               
                  Jane
                   Denbigh
               



            ; the diaper table cloth, which is here (producing it.) She says she bought the handkerchief, she first named one person and then another: and said if she had taken any thing it was a mistake.
- Dewsnap. They brought me a warrant to apprehend her, but it was too late at night; she was not in the house. 
               
                  Jane
                   Denbigh
               



             had a search warrant, and they searched the house and found the diaper table cloth; there was no mark on it; but Jane said she knew it, and would swear to it.

                   Denbigh
               



            . I went to the lodgings of this woman, when the things were missing; the prisoner had the handkerchief; she was in her own room, there was a single handkerchief found in the bag; the prosecutrix went away and fetched a fellow to the single handkerchief; and to the double one. The prisoner said, she believed they were not her own, but she brought them away in a mistake; the great table cloth was found. I was not there.

            . I was present when these lodgings were searched.

            . I am a constable of Hammersmith; I was before the magistrate with her, and she said, that what she had got she took through mistake.
Prisoner's Defence.
I am as innocent as a child unborn; I know nothing of it: I have wore such linen as that handkerchief. I have no more of these handkerchiefs.
For the Prisoner.

            . I was called by one of the Denbighs, to see the table cloth; she was not in the room, she was gone out before the table cloth was found. I lived in the house; the prisoner was not in the room at that time. I am certain I never spoke to the prisoner about it; I never saw the handkerchiefs; these are no better then what servants now wear. They told her husband that she had a child before she was married to him; they came to the room, it was after that they called me to see the things; she was recommended to me as a very sober person; there were things she might have taken from me, if she had been a bad person.

            . The prisoner was servant with me. I live in James-street, Grosvenor square. I am a painter. The prisoner lived with me and behaved very well; she lived about a year with me; it is about a year ago; I trusted her with the keys of all the draws in the house.

            . I have known the prisoner at the bar four or five years; she lived next door to me; she was reckoned a very honest, sober girl, as ever could be. I could have recommended her to any house.
Tahitha Gayer. I have known her them her childhood; she has always had a good character; she was with me twice. I trusted her with every thing I had.

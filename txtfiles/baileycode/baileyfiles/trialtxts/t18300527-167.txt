JOHN PARTRIDGE. On the 1st of May I was in Wardour-street, Soho


, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, and lost a handkerchief from the top of some boots I had been purchasing - I felt a jerk, turned, and saw the prisoner, who let my handkerchief fall; I took it up, and secured him - I saw it fall from him as he was passing it behind him.
Cross-examined. Q. Where did it fall? A. Close at his feet; there was another person passing at my right-hand, but I saw the prisoner passing it behind him - it had been on my left side when the prisoner was close to me; I secured him, but did not take notice of the other, who walked off quick - it is most improbable that he could have robbed me.

THOMAS MEREDITH
. I am in the service of the London and North-Western Railway Company. On 5th Aug., about half-past eight o'clock in the morning, I went into Mr. Mills's office, at the station—it was my duty to open and clean it—a table-drawer had been broken open, and the papers all strewed about.





DAVID STEVENSON
. I am the goods manager's assistant at the London and North-Western Railway. I received information from Meredith, and went into Mr. Mills's office—I have two drawers there—one of them was broken open, and a shilling had been taken from the other, in which the key tad been left—the window had been broken, and raised up—the shutters had been forced, and the blind cut—that would enable a person to get in, and go to the room above, where my drawers were—I found a razor and chisel one floor amongst the papers—I gave them to Mr. Barker, and saw him give them to Mr. Thompson—I had left at seven o'clock in the evening—the station is in the parish of St. Pancras.


Cross-examined by
MR. MEITEK. Q. Are there policemen about there? A. Yes; I think there are a dozen or two on the station, which is about thirty-seven acres—they do not patrol about—some are in the pates and others at point—they cannot have a view of all the premises—I should and think there were any within forty yards of the place that was broken—that spot is not lighted up with gas—business is carried on all night in different parts, but not near there.





THOMAS CUKSTON MILLS
. I am goods manager at the Camden-town station. This office was appropriated to me—on 4th Aug. I left between five and six o'clock in the afternoon, leaving 14l. 2s. 1d. in my table-drawer—there was one 5l. note, and I believe a second, but I am not certain; also gold and silver—I went next morning about nine—the money was all gone but one sovereign, which I found amongst the papers on the floor—Edwanis was the Company's servant fifteen or eighteen months, from the commence. ment of 1847—he knew my office—I always kept a small sum of money there for the payment of petty disbursements.

Cross-examined by
MR. MELLER. Q. Whose property was it? A. The London and North-Western Railway Company's—my table has a drawerm on each side—the left-hand drawer was broken open by the wood being broke: away from the lock—a window was broken in the lower office.

I am out of employ—on 4th Aug., I saw Edwards and Norman against the Stanhop; Arms, Camden-town, about a hundred yards from the goods-station, abort eleven in the morning—they were talking—I knew Edwards by the name of Hocker—I heard him say to Norman, "Tom, I know where we can get some money to-night, if you have a mind to come"—Norman said, "Whereabout is it?"—Edwards said, "In the Company's office, at Camden-town; at the station"—Norman said, "Very well"—Edwards said, "Tom, you have get some tools at home"—Norman said, "I have"'—Edwards left him, and said he would see him about eight, down at the Oxford Arms; that is about two hundred yards from the Stanhope Arms—they parted—I was at the oxford Arms about eight that night, and saw them again—Edwards asked Norman for the tools—Norman said, "Here they are," and gave him an old chisel and a razor—Edwards said, "I will see you up at the Stanhope Arms bye-and-bye"—Norman said, "Very well"—I remained till about half-past ten; I then: went up to the Stanhope Arms—I saw Norman come out of the gates of the Camden-station—he asked me if I had seen Hocker—I said, "No"—I then went into the Hampstead-road, and saw Edwards coming over the bridge-Norman met him there—I went with them down the Hampstead-road—we met three girls, and all went to a public-bouse on the left-hand side, and had some beer—Edwards paid for one pot with a sovereign which he got changed—Norman then called for a second pot, and paid for it with a sovereign which he got changed—we came out, and Norman said to Edwards, "Hocker, you had better give me them notes, and I will put them away for you"—Edwarcs refused—I had seen the notes—just as we came over the bridge Edward showed them to Norman and to me, they were two 5l.-notes—Edwards said-to the girls, "Do you know where we can put these notes away?"—one of them said she would put them away for him to-morrow morning—we then all went to a house in the New-road, and remained there all night—nextmornicc we went to a coffee-shop down a turning on the left-hand side, in Tottenham Court-road, and had breakfast—after remaining there about half an hour, Edwards came out and said, "Come, let us go and get rid of these notes—

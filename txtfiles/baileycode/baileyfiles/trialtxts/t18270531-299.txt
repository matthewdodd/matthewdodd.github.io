WILLIAM THOMPSON. I am a seaman
, and have been on shore about a fortnight. On the 29th of May, about eleven o'clock at night, I met the prisoner in Ratcliff-highway. She asked me home - I went into a house with her. I took out my watch and put it into my pocket. I went to bed with her; in about three minutes, a person came to the door, she called out to that person, then jumped out of bed and ran down-stairs as fast as she could - there was no light - I had not pulled off my clothes; the watch was in my pocket. I got up and missed it - went down and called the watchman. I have not found it; there was a light when I went there, but she put it out before we went to bed.

            . I am a watchman. I saw Thompson, about eleven o'clock at night; he said he had been robbed, and shewed me the house - I found nobody at home, but a candle was burning; he described the girl, and gave me his address - I found the prisoner and took her to him; she has lived in that house about two months - Thompson was perfectly sober.

JOHN LOCKWOOD
. I am a bricklayer, and live in Ironmonger-row, St. Luke's—I was at work at the Standard-gardens, at Hoxton, on the 3rd of May—I laid my coat under a tree about one o'clock—after coming from my dinner about two, I heard some one cry out, "One of you have lost your coat"—I came up out of the sewer, and my coat was gone—it was a white moleskin coat—I have not found it since.





JOHN BUCKLE
. I live in Golden-lane, St. Luke's—about two o'clock this day I was at the Standard-gardens—I saw the prisoner and Lockwood

there—I saw a white moleskin coat under a tree—the prisoner picked it up-and put it under his arm—I am sure he is the man—he walked away to the corner of the street, and then he ran—George Hill ran after him.





GEORGE HILL
. I was at work at some vaults in the Standard-gardens—the prisoner passed by with the coat under his arm—Buckle hallooed out, "Whose coat is that the young man has picked up?"—I looked to see if it was any of my mates that hallooed out—I ran after the prisoner, but could not catch him—I am sure he is the man.

Prisoner. Q. What do you swear to me by? A. By your appearance—you had no jacket on—no one else passed.

Prisoner's Defence. I was at home on Friday when the coat was stolen; I was coming down the City-road on Tuesday when a woman swore that I was the man that took the coat because I was in my shirt sleeves.




GUILTY
.** Aged 21.—


Transported for Seven Years.

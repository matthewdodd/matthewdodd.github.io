             the pawnbroker if such were brought to stop them, he came after this and fetch'd me, he had stopp'd the shift and bed gown and one apron, produced in court and deposed to.

            . My neighbour sent his servant to tell me he had lost such goods, begging I would stop them if brought to pawn, and about 2 hours after the prisoner came with the apron, bed gown and shift; I stopp'd them, they prove to be the prosecutor's property.

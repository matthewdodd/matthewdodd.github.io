GEORGE FREDERICK BULL
. I am a bullion-dealer and money-changer. I have two partners—I live in Cheapside, in the parish of St. Mary Cole. On the 2nd of March, I was standing in my counting-house, about five o'clock, at the back of the shop—I saw the prisoner and another boy standing at the, window—I came forward, and saw the prisoner's hand through a hole which he had cut in the glass, taking out gold coin—I opened the door—he heard the hasp open, and ran off, but I took him five yards off, and secured him—the others got off—I struck him, and he fell down, and as he fell, he threw from him two doubloons, worth 3l. 6s. each.





WILLIAM WILCOX
. I was in the prosecutor's shop. The window was whole before this happened—I saw Mr. Bull run out—I ran out and saw him and the prisoner on the ground—the prisoner threw the two coins over his shoulder.

Prisoners Defence. The gentleman flew out and took me—I had that moment stepped up to the window.




GUILTY
. Aged 18.—

FRANCIS SHEPHARD
. I live in Aldersgate-street. Between eight and nine o'clock on the 15th of September, I had a pocket-handkerchief in my right-hand skirt pocket—I felt a hand in my pocket, and I grasped it—it was the prisoner's—he was so determined to have it, that when he pulled his hand out he had the handkerchief in it—he drew his hand out, and two men took it of him, and threatened to rescue him—I said, "If any body will hold the boy, I will attack you both."

Prisoner He turned and took me to the watch-house, and then he said he had not lost any thing out of his pocket at all. Witness. No, I did not.

Prisoner. There was nobody behind me at all. Witness. Yes, there was





THOMAS BATES
. I am superintendent of the watch. When the prisoner was brought to our watch-house, the prosecutor said he had a charge against him, for stealing a pocket-handkerchief—I searched him, but found nothing—the prosecutor said, two tall men followed very close, and endeavoured to rescue the boy, I said, "Perhaps, we shall have them come outside our watch-house door"—I went outside into the yard—there was one person that Mr. Shephard recognised, and I brought him in—I went out again, and another man. who had been with him before, ran down Little Britain—I pursued him, and he gave me a violent blow with a life-preserver, or something of that sort.





FRANCIS SHEPHARD
. The prisoner had his two hands in my two pockets—he took my handkerchief from one—he took nothing from the other—there were two letters in my inside-pocket, which I suppose he thought were in the skirt pocket.

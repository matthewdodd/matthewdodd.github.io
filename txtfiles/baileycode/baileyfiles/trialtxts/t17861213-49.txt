             sworn.
I live in Little York-street, Bethnal-green parish


; I sell coals
; I lost a half bushel and a peck measure between ten and eleven at night; I saw them about half an hour before; one was standing on the block close to the partition that parts the two rooms, and the other on the coals; me, and my wife, and a boy were sitting talking in the back room, and there was a glass door; and she said, there is some person in the room; I went out as soon as I could, and I heard some person run round the corner of the house; I immediately went out to the street door; I saw Brown and Cropper at different corners, opposite my house; I had no suspicion of Cropper as he was a cripple; I asked him if he saw any body come by, he said, no; he had just come from York-street; Brown came to me, says he, what is the matter? I made him no answer, having a suspicion of him; I went home to put my shoe on, which I did not stay to put on before; and I went after, but could get no intelligence; and I went home again; this was on Saturday night; and on Monday I searched for the measures, and I found them at a sale warehouse in Wheeler's-street; the man told me Cropper's wife brought them; when I took Cropper, his wife and Brown were there; I did not know the prisoners before; there was a lamp just at the corner of my house, and I had a light in my room; it was a corner house with a window on each side; I am quite positive to Brown; I never saw Cropper's wife before.
- GREVILLE sworn.
Last Tuesday was a week the prisoner Mrs. Cropper brought two coal measures to me to sell; the day following the prosecutor came and owned them; I knew him and his wife three or four months before.
(Deposed to.)
PRISONER CROPPER'S DEFENCE.
Brown left the coal measure with me to be sold for him, and my wife carried them to be sold; I have but one leg, and could not carry them so well myself.

            'S DEFENCE.
Mr. Brown brought them to our house, and said, he had bought them of an old woman, and desired me to take them to the sale room.
PRISONER BROWN'S DEFENCE.
I bought those measures of an old woman for half a crown; I live up in Cropper's house.
The prisoner Cropper called one witness to his character.

, the 27th of November
 last. It appear'd by the Evidence, That the Prisoner and the Prosecutor lay together in the same Room, and the Prosecutor getting up in the Morning left the Prisoner in Bed, and when he came home at Night the Clothes and Money were gone; and at the Tune of his being apprehended he had the Linnen, and the Purse in which the Money was, wrapp'd up in a Bundle. The finding the Goods upon him was confirm'd by the Constable, but the Prisoner would give no Account how he came by them. The finding the Goods upon the Prisoner was further confirmed by Mr. Porter; and, that the Purse was taken up under his Chair, where he sat; and, that he said afterwards, if the Prosecutor would not hang him, he should have the Clothes he had bought with his Money, and he would pay him weekly to make him Satisfaction as to the Remainder. This was confirm'd by another Evidence. The Prisoner deny'd the Fact, but he having little else to say in his own Defence, the Jury found him 


               guilty to the Value of 39 s.

WILLIAM DWELLEY
. I live in Tottenham-court-road, and am an ironmonger. About two o'clock on the 2nd of October, I was behind my counter, the two prisoners came in, and I turned to get some tea-pots which they asked for, and a metal cock was missing from the counter—I taxed Wheatley with it, and he took it out of his pocket, threw it down, and left the shop, and ran off—I pursued and took him—the woman went away.

Wheatly's Defence. I did not know what I was doing.

WHEATLEY*—


GUILTY
. Aged 31.—


Transported for Seven Years.

FAIR—


NOT GUILTY
.

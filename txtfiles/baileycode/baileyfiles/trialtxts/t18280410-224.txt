            . I am the wife of Charles Fisher, a gunsmith
, who lives in St. Ann-street, Westminster


. I lost a time-piece from my mantel-shelf, on the 14th of March; I was in my shop, and my daughter was serving a man some with Spanish juice - my daughter ran out, and the man said "She has run up Pye-street." I put my head out, and saw a piece of work; I went up the street, and met my daughter at the corner of Duck-yard; she said,"I have lost sight of him;" we came back, and I saw Timbrell, and spoke to him; he went away, and before he came back, some people came and said, "Your timepiece is on the dung-hill, in Duck-yard;" it was soon afterwards brought to me. I had seen it safe a short time before.
SUSAN FISHER. I am the prosecutor's daughter. On the 14th of March, I was in the shop, serving, and I saw the prisoner in the parlour; I went to ask him what he wanted, and I saw he had the time-piece in his hand - he ran out, and I pursued him; he gave the time-piece to another boy in Pye-street - they went up the street together, and I lost sight of them - I saw the prisoner in custody on the Friday night.

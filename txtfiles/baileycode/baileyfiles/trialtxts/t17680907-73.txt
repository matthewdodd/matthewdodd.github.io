. On the 24th of August the prisoner came into my shop in the morning, about half an hour after six, and asked the price of a doll; the maid shewed him several; the maid came up to me to ask the price of a doll, I was in bed and can give no farther account.

            . I was up in the kitchen, the maid came up to ask me to go down into the shop; I went a quarter of the way down the stair-case, I saw the prisoner in the little room with the maid; he asked her for some water several times; I saw his hand at work, but could not tell what he was taking, but when he went out of the shop he had his right-hand under his coat; he went out of the shop, I followed and took hold of him, and asked what he had there; he said a tea-chest; he gave it me, and desired I would let him go; I took him back, (produced and deposed to.)

            . On the the 29th of January, I was at Pimlico, and saw the prisoners lurking about the prosecutor's shop; the window was broke, and I saw Fry and Barnett go up to it several times; they took something out, ran across and gave it to Bailey. I went up and found the jacket under his arm.

            . I was at the corner of my shop, and saw the prisoner's lurking about the neighbour's window; they had a glaziers' diamond. I sent my lad to watch, he called me, I ran out and found Bailey in custody; I took the other two.

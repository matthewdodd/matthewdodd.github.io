WALTER LEWIS
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
3rd of November, 4 sovereigns, 2 half-crowns, and 15 shillings; the monies of 




John Wood, his master.






JOHN WOOD
. I keep an eating-house in High-street, St. Giles's. The prisoner was three weeks in my service—I owed Mr. Moss, the butcher, a bill—on the 3rd of November, about a quarter to eight o'clock, I gave the prisoner four sovereigns and some half-crowns to pay it, but he never returned—he was apprehended the next week.





ELIAS AVERY
. I live with Mr. Moss. On the 3rd of November the prisoner came there, and said his master had sent him to say he was gone to the baker's to settle the bill, and when he had done that, he would come and settle with Mr. Moss—he never paid any money—I wished him to wait and see master, which he did, and told him the same, in my presence.





WILLIAM ADAMS
. I am a policeman. On the 10th of November the prisoner came to me and asked me to take him into custody for robbing his master, Mr. Wood, of 5l.




GUILTY
. * Aged 18.—


Transported for Seven Years.

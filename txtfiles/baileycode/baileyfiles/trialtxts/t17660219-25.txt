            . On the 6th of this instant, I missed a sack of oats of four bushels out of my barge at Twickenham, and about 10 or 11 o'clock Mr. Freeman came, and told me he had them in his house; I went to his house with him, he shewed me them, they were in a tub: he said the two prisoners brought them to him, between 10 and 11 the night before. I took up the prisoners, they both owned they took them from the barge; that one lifted them on the other's shoulders, and they carried them to Mr. Freeman's house.

             deposed he lived at Twickenham, there had been several barges robbed: the prisoners asked him if he would buy any oats, he gave them room to think he would, in order to detect them; they brought the sack of oats, which had Taylor's name at length on it: that he went immediately to Taylor and told him of it.

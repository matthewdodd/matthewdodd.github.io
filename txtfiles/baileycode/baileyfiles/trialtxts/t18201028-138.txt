            . I am a constable. On the 3d of October I saw the prisoner, in company with others at Brandenburgh House, and watched them. I saw him come from the crowd in haste, with another, and stopped them both. The prisoner said with an oath that he had done nothing. I found this watch in his pocket, with a bad half-crown and two bad shillings. I gave him to a countryman to hold while I searched the other - he escaped from the countryman, I ran and stopped him.
(Property produced, and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I saw a gentleman put the watch under a tree, and I picked it up.

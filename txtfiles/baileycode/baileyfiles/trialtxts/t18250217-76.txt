            . I live with Mr. William Hare, floorcloth manufacturer
, Bishopsgate-street


. On the morning of the 2d of February, I was in the cellar, and heard footsteps in the shop - I went up, and missed a roll of floor cloth, which stood seven yards from the door, packed up in a mat. I ran out one way, and the man another - I found the prisoner in about five minutes, in Catherine Wheel-alley, nearly two hundred yards off, with it on his shoulder. - he was alone, knocking at a door there: he saw me, threw it down, and ran towards Petticoat-lane - I pursued, and took him without losing sight of him.
Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Did you see a man outside the door when you came out? A. Yes; and he was going to send me the wrong way, but a milk-woman directed me down the alley. The prisoner said a gentleman in black employed him to carry it. The person outside had a drab jacket on.

            . I am an officer. I received him in charge - and asked if he was any trade? he said No.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. A gentleman asked me to earn a 1 s. and carry it - I heard a cry of Stop thief! and it fell off my shoulder.

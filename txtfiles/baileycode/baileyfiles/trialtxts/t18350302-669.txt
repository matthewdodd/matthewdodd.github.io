CHRISTOPHER EAGLETON
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
14th of February, 1 pewter pot, value 1s., the goods of 



Edward Carter; and 1 dram-glass, value 1s., the goods of 



Thomas Murray.






GEORGE AVERY
. I am a policeman. On the 14th of February, from information which I received, I spoke to the prisoner in Shoreditch, about half-past five o'clock in the evening—I asked what she had got under her shawl, and at the same time lifted it up, and saw this pint pot—I said, "Where did you get this pot?"—she said, "That is my business"—I said, "Where are you going to take it to?"—"Home, to be sure," said she—I took it out of her hand, and found the glass in it—I said, "Where did you get this from?"—she said, "I will tell you the truth; I had it given to me by Mrs. Carter, No. 9, Hoxton;" who was a woman who stood behind the bar—I went to Carter's, and found out Murray—the prisoner was in liquor.





THOMAS MURRAY
. I am a publican, and keep the King of Prussia, at Hoxton. This glass is mine—I served the prisoner with half a pint of

beer, which she had twice warmed—she went out, and I missed the glass, but could not follow her—this is my glass—it has my name on it.





JOSEPH NEWMAN
. I am a bricklayer. On the 14th of February, between five and six o'clock, I was coming down Old-street-road—I saw the prisoner against the alms-houses—the wind blew her shawl aside—I saw a pot and glass under her shawl—she tried to conceal them—I told a policeman.





JAMES CLUBE
. I am barman to Edward Carter. The prisoner had some porter at our house on the 14th of February—in about half an hour after, I missed the pot—this is it—it has the name of the former landlord on it—she was at our house about twenty minutes after five o'clock.

Prisoner. I had been drinking there three times that day.

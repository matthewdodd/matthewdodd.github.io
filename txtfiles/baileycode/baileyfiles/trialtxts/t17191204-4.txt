 on the 19th of November
 last. The Prosecutor deposed that she let a Lodging to the Prisoners, and let them have the use of a Chest of Drawers, all but one Drawer, which she reserv'd to her self; that going to the said Drawer for her Gown and Petticoat, could not find them there, and looking further mist her other Goods, and the Pillowbears from off the Bed; that she charg'd Mary Pain with them, who told her that her other Goods were in the Pillowbears, and that she should have then again that Night; that she got a search Warrant, and went to two Brokers where Pain said she had pawn'd them, and found her Gown and Petticoat at one Pawnbrokers, and the rest of her Goods at another. Two other Evidences, who were in the Room when the Prisoner Pain pleaded that she and Challenged Pain with them, confirmed her owning them as before. The Prisoner Pain pleaded that she being necessicated at that time, took the Goods and pawned them, with an intent to being them again; and that the Drawer was not lockt but open; that Elizabeth Marshal knew nothing of it. The Prosecutor could not swear that the Drawer was lockt; and no Evidence appearing against Marshal, the Jury 

               Acquitted
             her, and found Mary Pain 


               Guilty to the value of 10 d.

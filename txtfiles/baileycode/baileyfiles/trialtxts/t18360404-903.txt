GEORGE MARSHALL
. I live at Peckham Rye. On the 9th of March I was near St. Mary, Woolnooth—passing Messrs. Payne and Smith's the bankers, I felt a twitch at my pocket, and trued and saw the prisoner in the act of doubling up a handkerchief and putting it into his side pocket—I felt, and my handkerchief was gone—I ran after the prisoner—he threw the handkerchief over the hoarding of Payne and Smith's—I overtook him in Swithin-lane—I brought him back, and gave him in charge at the Mansion house—a person picked up this handkerchief and gave it me.

Prisoner I did not offer move—I picked up the handkerchief at his feet, and he took me directly.





EDWIN BLUNDELL
 (City police-constable No. 2.) I took the prisoner when he was brought to the Mansion-house—the prosecutor and the prisoner in one hand, and the handkerchief in the other.




GUILTY
.* Aged 19—


Transported for Seven Years.

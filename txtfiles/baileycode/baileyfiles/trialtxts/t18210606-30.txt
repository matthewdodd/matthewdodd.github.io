            . I am an officer. On the 15th of May, about eleven o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner, with another person, going down the Minories; I watched them to the middle of the Minories - the prisoner went into a silversmith's shop - he was in there two or three minutes - his companion waited outside. After he came out I crossed over, and followed the prisoner to Sparrow-corner, opposite Mr. Clarance's; while I waited there I saw him speak to his companion - the prisoner then went into Mr. Clarance's shop, and I saw him take the three pieces of print off the counter, near the door, and come out with them under his arm. I crossed over, he got into the Circus, and I secured him. I took him back to the shop, and Mr. Clarance claimed the property. He resisted, but I kept him.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

            . Aged 18.




               Transported for Seven Years

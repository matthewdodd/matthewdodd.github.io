            . On Saturday the fifteenth day of last month, coming from my daily labour through Gravel-Lane



, Armstrong and Simmons called to me, and said they wanted to speak to me; this was about eleven o'clock at night; I listened to hear what they had to say: they took me into a room; there was a fire place; they made me sit down by the fire; then they asked me to give them some money. I gave them two-pence: they inticed me to more wickedness, but did not prevail upon me; then they threw me upon the bed, and I lost my watch; but which of them took it, I cannot say.
Q. What do you mean by saying they did not prevail?
Bowden . They inticed me to go on the bed with them: they threw me on the bed by force.
Q. Was not you able to resist them?
Bowden. I was standing just by the bed; one took me on the one side, and I fell on the bed, and, so falling, the other fell a-top of me.
Q. How long did you stay on the bed after you lost your watch?

             . I rose up directly, and I cried out I had lost my watch, and some of them must have it; and I desired to have it: they said they had not got it, and did not know who had; they said they would call in their husbands; they opened the door, and in came two men and licked me very severely: who they were I cannot tell. I got away, and called the watch; there were no watchmen where I was robbed. I got the watch, but when I came back there was no person there, and there was a lock on the outside of the door. I got assistance , and took these three girls that were in the room with me when I lost my watch. On Monday night Sampson and another man came to me to make up the affair; they were at the Cock and Woolpack in Finch-lane.

            . The prosecutor complained he had lost his watch, and got me to assist him; some people came and wanted to make it up; after that we got together at this Woolpack. Sampson was there , and he spoke to somebody to go to fetch the property where it was. From his so speaking I suspected he had the watch . I talked of searching him; upon that he put his left hand into his pocket, or breeches, and I saw him take the watch out, and drop it in the room; this is the same watch he dropt at that time. (The watch is deposed to by the prosecutor.)

             . I apprehended the three women : a well dressed man came afterwards, and said, he hoped they would be merciful; they were appointed to meet at the Cock and Woolpack . I said I would search them; as I was going to search them, I saw Sampson drop the watch.

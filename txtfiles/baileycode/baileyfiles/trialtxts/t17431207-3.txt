            . The 29th of last Month about 2 o'Clock in the Afternoon, as I was sweeping my Door, I heard the Money-Till drop, I stepped into the Shop, and there was the Prisoner standing by the Counter: What do you want, said I; I want a Roll, says he: Said I, how came the Till down; said he, I did not touch it, and fell a crying: I said, I believe you are the Thief, it could not come out without your touching it. He denied that he touched it till he came before the Justice, and then he owned it. He said the Till was a little out, and in touching it, it fell down. - The Till was in it's place a few Minutes before, and no Body had been at the Till; it locks four Inches under the Counter, that no Body should see the Key.

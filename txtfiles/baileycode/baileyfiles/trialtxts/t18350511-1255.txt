JOHN MCDONALD
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
7th of May, 1 coat, value 5s., the goods of 



John Hayes.






JOHN HAYES
. I live in Philip-street, Kingsland-road. On the 7th of May, I was out with my cart, in which I carry butter—I got out to attend to a lady, and left my coat in the cart opposite Stock's-terrace—I returned in about two minutes, and my coat was gone.





JOHN SEGER HUBBARD
. I am a gardener. I saw the cart stand in the street—I did not observe the coat taken, but I heard a cry of "Stop thief"—I saw the prisoner running and took him with it.





JOHN SURGANT
. I was passing the cart, and saw the prisoner reach his hand over the wheel and move the coat forward; he then took it and ran away with it—I called "Stop thief," and he was taken.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
(The prisoner put in a written defence, stating that he was intoxicated, and had not the slightest idea of having committed the offence.)




GUILTY
. Aged 30.—


Transported for Seven Years.

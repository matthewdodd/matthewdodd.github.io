            . I was the officer of the night; the watchman stopped the two prisoners with two bags of sugar, yesterday morning about half an hour after two o'clock; he brought them into the watch-house.

            . I am a watchman; Spittle and I went home with a man that was sick; coming back, we met the two prisoners, one of them had a bag of sugar, and the other a bag of sugar and a hatchet; we took them to the watch house; they first would have persuaded us it was rice; then they said it was sweepings; then they said the mate gave it them; then they said they found it on board a lighter, (produced in court.) I believe there is better than an hundred weight of it.

             confirmed the account he gave.
Mackey's defence.
I was the watchman on board the lighter; I went on shore to get a pint of beer, and when I came on shore again, I found this sugar in a hammock: we did not know who it belonged to, but were willing to carry it home to return it to the right owner.
Gunn's defence.
We went to get some beer at the Antigallican; when we returned, we found a hammock tied up, and this sugar in it; how it came there, or whose property we could not tell, and we went to take it home for our family's use.

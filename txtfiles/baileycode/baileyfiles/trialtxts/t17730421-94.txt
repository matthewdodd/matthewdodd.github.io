            . I am a clerk
 to Sir

             and Co. I was coming along Cornhill


, about half past eleven o'clock, on the 22d of April; the prisoner took hold of my arm two or three times; I would not go with her; she said she was in a great deal of distress; I gave her a shilling; she was making away very fast from me; I then missed my purse; I went after her and charged her with taking it; she denied it; I took her to the watch-house. While she stood up there to be searched, I perceived a piece of white paper upon the seat, and under it I saw my bag; then she fell on her knees and begged for mercy.
Q. from the prisoner. Whether I pleaded any poverty to you when you picked me up?
Woodrofe. I did not pick her up, nor consent to go with her.

            , the constable, confirmed the prosecutor's evidence, as to finding the money in the watch-house, near where the prisoner had set.
Prisoner's Defence.
The watchmen might convey it there: I am innocent.
She called two witnesses who gave her a good character.
Q. to the prosecutor. Did you find the money right in the bag.
Prosecutor. Yes, exactly.

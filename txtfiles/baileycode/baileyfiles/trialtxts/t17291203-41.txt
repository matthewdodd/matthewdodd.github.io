             thus depos'd, The Prisoner came into my Shop, and desir'd to see some Edging, I shew'd her several sorts, but she seem'd very difficult to be pleas'd, some were not good enough, and some were too dear, so she went away without buying any; soon after she was gone, I miss'd a piece of Edging which I had shew'd to the Prisoner, and which she had in her Hand.

             depos'd, That her Aunt shew'd the Prisoner a great Variety of Edgings, and after the Prisoner went away a piece was missing.

             depos'd, That the Night the Prosecutor lost the Edging, the Prisoner brought a piece to her to sell, the Jury found her 


               guilty to the Value of 10 d.

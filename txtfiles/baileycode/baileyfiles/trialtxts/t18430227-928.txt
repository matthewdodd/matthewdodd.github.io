HENRY MILLER
 was again indicted

 for embezzlement, and that he had been before convted of felony.






RICHARD PAGE
. I am a labourer, and live at Hammersmith. I dealt with Mr. Shore for bread—I took the bread of the prisoner—I knew it was Mr.

Shore's property, and intended the money I paid for it to come to Mr. Shore's hands—the prisoner was his servant—on the 6th of March, 1841, I paid the prisoner 7s., and on the 13th of March I paid him 7s. again, for Mr. Shore.





WILLIAM HENRY SHORE
. I am a baker. The prisoner was in my service—it was his duty to take out bread, and to bring me back the money—on the 7th of March, 1841, he brought me 5s. 8 1/2 d. on account of Mr. Page, for money due for bread—on the 13th or 14th of March he did not pay me any money whatever.

Prisoner's Defence. I took these two customers on my own account, and he told me if I trusted them I should be accountable; I often paid it out of my own pocket on Saturday night, because it should not run back; I have been away from him ever since, but I have been in Hammersmith, and I dare say he has seen me about.





EDWARD FLOWER
 (police-constable T 42.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got at Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person who was then convicted.




GUILTY
. Aged 40.—


Transported for Seven Years.

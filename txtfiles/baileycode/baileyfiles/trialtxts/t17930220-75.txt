I live in Charles-street, Battle Bridge



; I work in the livery lace manufactory
; I kept a house the time the affair happened; it was the 25th of January, Friday morning, about between four and five o'clock; I was alarmed by the watchman, who told me there was a man in the yard, who was this James Barton, the watchman took him in the yard coming from the wash house, with the balls belonging to the water cock, the water cock was affixed over the water tub; I had seen the water come in the Wednesday before, and I am sure it did not over-run.
Q. Had this man any pretence to the house at all, did he lodge in the house? - He did not.
Q. Do you know any thing of these men? - I never saw any thing of them before to my knowledge; the other man, Thomas Barton was in the next yard to him, belonging to the Golden Lion public house, I see him come out of a privy; coming up to this privy, 
               
                  Thomas
                   Barton
               



            , who was inside spoke, and the other James immediately said, that is my brother that is inside there; after he was taken out, one of the watchmen said, suppose we examine the privy,

                   Barton
               



             said, it was no use, for it goes down into the shore; the cock is here.

             sworn.
I am a watchman; on Friday morning about one o'clock, I was going my round, I saw the two prisoners at the bar, and another man with them, standing together close by the gates of the Golden Lion; with that I turned myself round, and they saw me, and they went off as fast as they could; at three o'clock I found the gates open that goes into the back yard, I shut them all then; at half after three, I went round again, and I found them all open the same again, and then I goes up the first street, and I lights of the other watchman Henry Herbert, and I told him what I had seen going forward, and he said, it was a pity, but what I could lay hold of them; with that, I went down again, and I saw one of the prisoners at the bar, I cannot be certain which, taking a ladder down from the side of the wash-house place, with that I slepped up the street, and kept crying the hour till I came up to Herbert's house, and asked him to come down, for I knew that the people were about; with that he came down, and I went round to the gate, and he got over the pails, with that, we searched about the place for some considerable time, with that, we wanted to get upon the pales; there was some old timberthat laid against the pales in the back yard, we got on the top of these, and Mr. Herbert was getting over, and saw

             come out, with the ball of the cock on the side of him; with that, we asked him what he did there? he said, he lodged there; with that, we asked him where he was going out that way? he said, he was going to work; with that, we told him, that was a comical way to come out to go to work, to come over a parcel of pales seven or eight feet high, we demanded him to come over, then we took hold of his shoes to see what condition they were in, and we found his shoes more dirtier than ours, who had been out all night; with that Mr. Herbert gets over, and knocks at the door, to get the person up that belonged to the house; we saw him drop the ball of the cock as he came out of the place, and Mr. Herbert picked it up; with that, he knocked at the door to alarm the landlady, to know if she had any body lodge there, she got up and said no; we got and searched, and saw where the ball was broke off; with that, Mr. Herbert said coming out, you had better look round that corner in the privy, it was belonging to the Golden Lion,

             keeps it; I found the door was fast.
Q. Did that public house communicate at the back to Mr. Batterbee's house? - The yard did, only the paling parts, and we found the other prisoner in the privy, 
               
                  Thomas
                   Bunn
               



            , he had nothing with him, with that, we took them away to the watch-house.
Q. Are you sure you had seen these two men lurking before? - Yes, I am sure these are the two men.

             came out of the wash-house, with the ball in his hand, and I immediately hallooed who are you, what are you doing there? says he, I lodge here, I am going to work, I said it was a comical place to get over to go to work, he comes to the pales and drops this down, and I took it up, I compared it with the piece that was left on the cock and it fitted; so he got over the pales, and I said, let us look at your shoes, and he put his shoes up, and I said, your shoes are dirtier than mine, that has been out all night, and I knocked at the door, and they said nobody lodged there, and I told the man, and he got up; with that, I looked in two or three privies, to see if I could find any body else, coming out I said, look into that necessary, perhaps there is somebody in there, and he went to the door, and put his hand against the door, and he said, there is somebody here for it is fastened on the inside, James makes answer, and says, it is my brother that is in there; so then he opened the door, and there he was in the privy, I asked him what he was doing there? he said, he went in there and he was asleep, he said, he did not hear any noise when the rattles sprung, for he was asleep; we took them both into custody, and had them to the watch-house.

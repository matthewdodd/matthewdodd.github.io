            . I am head-hostler at Mr Waley's in Wood-street




; my great-coat was hanging upon a nail in the stable; I met the prisoner coming away with it; I stopp'd him; I ask'd him where he had it; he said it was his own; I brought him to the book-keeper, and then before the sitting alderman the next day, there he own'd he took it, and said he was drunk.
Prisoner's defence.
I found that coat lying in the yard; he took hold of me and said, what coat is that; I said if it is your's you may take it.
He called four witnesses; the first had known him about thirty years; the second, twenty; the third, about forty; the fourth, about four; who all gave him a good character.

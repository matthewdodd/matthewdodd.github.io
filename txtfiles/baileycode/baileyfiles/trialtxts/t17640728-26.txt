            . The prisoner's wife is servant to me: he is a seaman
. I am a victualler
: he came to my house on the 20th of July; the spoons were then in the one pair of stairs room, where I lie; and at nine o'clock at night we miss'd them; and by enquiring about, got knowledge of the spoons being at a pawnbroker's in Nightingale-lane, where I found them: and when I found him, he acknowledged he had stole them, and was sorry for it; and desired I would prosecute him as far as the law directs.

            . I am a pawnbroker, and live in Nightingale-lane: the prisoner pledged these spoons with me on the 20th of July, betwixt twelve and two o'clock; the prosecutor came afterwards and owned them.

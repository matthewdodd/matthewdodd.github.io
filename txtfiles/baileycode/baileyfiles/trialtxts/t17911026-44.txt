             sworn.
I am a butcher, I saw the prisoners come out of Mr. King's house between nine and ten in the morning, one of them had the property; I had seen them pass the door for a month before frequently. I heard Mr. King enquiring about eleven or twelve after; Millan had the things; the other had nothing, he was with him. The things were never found. I saw a knife case and a tea caddy.
The prisoners called two witnesses, who gave them a good character.

JOHN PARTRIDGE.
 I live at Highfield-villas, in the parish of St. Prancras. On the 5th of March, about ten o'clock at night, I fastened all my doors and windows, and went to bed—I got up about five minues to four in the morning. went into the front kitchen, and found everything in confusion—the pantry window, which had been secured and nailed in the night before, was totally wrenched out, the shelves broken down, and the food and dishes scattered all over the place—I found the back door had been opened from the inside—somebody had got in by taking the pantry window out—I could not find the window at all—I missed a great deal of property—I called in a policeman, and in two or three minutes five or six policemen came from the station—they had just taken the prisoner—all the property now in Court is mine, and was safe when I went to bed.





HENERY WHEELER
 (police-constable S 324.) On the 6th of March, about three o'clock in the morning, I met the prisoner alone in the Kentish Town-road, with a bundle containing the articles produced—I took him to the station with it.

Prisoner's Defence. I picked the things up coming from Highgate.




GUILTY. Aged 17.—

            . I am a butcher
, in East-street, Lamb's Conduit-street. On Saturday evening, the 25th of February, about eight o'clock in the evening, I was walking along New-street, Covent Garden


, and when I came to the corner of Rose-street


, I felt a twitch at my pocket; I saw the prisoner by the side of me, and nobody near me excepting the prisoner; a young woman three or four yards off, pointed to the prisoner; I seized the prisoner, and with the assistance of a gentleman, took him to the watchhouse. The young woman told me he gave the handkerchief to his companion, who ran up Rose-street with it, and a lad come and said he saw him give my handkerchief to another man that was with him.

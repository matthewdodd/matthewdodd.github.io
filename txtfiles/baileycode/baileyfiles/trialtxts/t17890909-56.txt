             sworn.
I am a peace officer of the City; on the 16th of August, on Sunday morning, I saw the prisoner on the ruins in Grub-street, with a bag on his shoulder; when he saw me, he ran down Baptist-head-alley, and threw the bag down; and returned back, and ran towards the brew-house; I got up near him; he was about twenty yards before me; I knew him before; I jumped over the bag and took him; I said, is this Gostick? he said yes, and hoped I would forgive him, for he was only going to make a parish grate; I took him back to the brew-house, and the hoops to my house.



                  JOHN
                   NEGUS
               



             sworn.
When I saw him, he desired Newman and I would let him go back to the brew-house, to make every thing fast, before we took him into the Compter; we went to the place where the hoops were taken from, and locked the door; then we went to the brew-house, and looked round that; he locked the door; and he put the keys in the watch-house, with my brother Negus; then we took him to the watch-house.

             sworn.
I am cooper at the brew-house; I was ordered to cut some hoops for the bricklayers, for the use of the work then going on, in building a new copper in the brew-house.


                  JOHN
                   OVERY
               



             sworn.
I am horse keeper at the same brew-house; I went into the watch-house about eleven at night, and saw the prisoner there; about three, after being asleep, the prisoner said he was dry, and went to get some small beer; and I saw no more of him.
- BEADMORE sworn.
I am cooper to Mess. Calvert and Co. at eight in the evening, it is his business to take the keys, and lock up the gates, after all the drays are in.
(The hoops produced and deposed to by Mr. Overy.)
PRISONER's DEFENCE.
I cried the hour of four in the morning; and going down Baptist-head alley; and going over the rubbish in Grub-street, I saw the bag lay, and I picked it up; and was taking it home to make a parish grate: I then had two children down with the small pox; I know not how the bag came there; that morning the fire happened at the brew-house.
The prisoner called five witnesses who gave him a good character.

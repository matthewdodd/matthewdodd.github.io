FANNY PERRY
. I am the wife of George Perry of Perry-green. On 10th March I was on Tower-hill with Mr. Parker, my uncle—we were going to look at Punch and Judy, when a little boy told me something; I turned round and saw the prisoner walking away from me—I went after him, asked aim for my purse, and told him he had been picking my pocket—he said, "I have not picked your pocket, I had it given to me," and produced it—I smacked his face, and a constable came up and took him—this is my purse; it contains half a crown, 2s., and three sixpences.





GEORGE HYDE
 (City policeman, 516.) On 11th March I saw the prisoner at the end of Lower Thames-street, running towards me—when he saw me he ran back again—I saw Mrs. Perry slap his face—I immediately went up and asked what was the matter, and took him into custody—he pretended to cry, and said, "Let me go"—Mrs. Perry gave me this purse.





HENRY PENNY
. I was on Tower-hill on 11th March, and saw the prisoner pot his hand into Mrs. Perry's pocket—I gave her information.




GUILTY

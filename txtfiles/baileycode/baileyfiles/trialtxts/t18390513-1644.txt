ANN BROWN
. I am a servant. On the 2nd of May, I and my sister were in Lower Chapman-street, St. George's, looking at some chimneysweepers—I had two half-crowns and a shilling in my pocket—as I was trying to get out of the crowd, one of the witnesses told me something, and I found my money was gone.

Cross-examined by
MR. DOANE. Q. Had you felt it safe while you were in the crowd? A. Yes—I had bought an orange just before, and while I was in the crowd I felt, and my money was safe.





WILLIAM HENRY LOEBER
. I live in Church-street, St. George's. I was at this place—I saw Martin go to the prosecutrix, lift up her gown, and put his hand in her pocket, then he, Smith, and another, all ran away—I had not seen the prisoners talking together.

Cross-examined. Q. Had you ever seen these boys before? A. No—I told the prosecutrix she was robbed.





THOMAS DEFERY
. I was there—I saw Martin lift up the prosecutrix's gown two or three times—he put his hand into her pocket, and got something out, and then they all ran away—Martin and another boy asked me what I was looking at—I said I was not looking at them.





JOHN YOUNG
. I live with my father, who is a surgeon. I saw the prisoners—I heard Martin say to Smith, "Let us have a try;" and then I saw Martin put his hand into the pocket of a lame woman with a

curtch—that is the prosecutrix's sister—then Smith tried—then Martin went to the prosecutrix, and put his hand into her pocket.

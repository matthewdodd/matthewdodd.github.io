JAMES JONES
. I am clerk to Mr. Bishop, who keeps a newspaper-office. About 10 o'clock in the morning of the 16th of September, I was in Fenchurch-street, and saw the prisoners watching several gentlemen's pockets, and feeling them—I felt in my own pocket and missed my handkerchief—they were close behind me at the time—I turned back and went down Mincing-lane—I saw them together and ran after them—I collared them and asked them to deliver up my property, which was a yellow silk hand kerchief—they denied having it—I insisted on it that they had it—I searched them and found my handkerchief in Crow's trowsers, at the flap—they were both together—I gave them in charge directly.





HENRY SPINK SWIFT
. I am a clerk. I was passing along Mincing-lane—I saw the prosecutor holding both the prisoners, who denied having his handkerchief—Crow was very anxious to have his coat searched—the fall of his trowsers was down, and I saw the prosecutor draw the handkerchief from there.

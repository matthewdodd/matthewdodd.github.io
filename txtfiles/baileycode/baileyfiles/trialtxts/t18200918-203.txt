            . I am a merchant
, and live in the Adelphi. On the 9th of July, about ten o'clock at night, I was coming along the Strand


, felt something touch my pocket, looked round, and caught hold of the prisoner, who was immediately behind me, and took a handkerchief from his waistcoat, which was not mine. A person came up, and said, in his hearing, that he saw the prisoner give my handkerchief to another. I gave him in charge.

            . I am a sword-cutler. I was going down the Strand, and saw the prisoner in company with another. I saw the prisoner take the handkerchief from the prosecutor's coat-pocket, and give it to one of the others, who ran across the street. The prosecutor turned round, and I secured him. I saw it distinctly.

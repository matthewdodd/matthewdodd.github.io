THOMAS JOHN PITT
. I am a ship's steward, and live in John's-place, Stepney. About three o'clock in the afternoon of the 14th of Oct., I was walking in Cannon-street—the prisoner passed me—a boy hallooed out to me loud enough for the prisoner to hear, "Hoy, hoy, sir!"and informed me that the prisoner had robbed me of my handkerchief—I missed it, and ran after him—he ran up a wheelwright's yard, and I found my handkerchief on the ground, nearly a quarter of a mile from where I missed it—I gave it to the policeman—this produced is it.






EDWIN FREDERICK CLOKE
. I was in Cannon-street, and saw the prisoner take the handkerchief out of the prosecutor's pocket.





EDWARD BURGESS
 (policeman.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction—(read)—he is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 24.—


Transported for Ten Yean
.
The prisoner had only been a fortnight out of prison.

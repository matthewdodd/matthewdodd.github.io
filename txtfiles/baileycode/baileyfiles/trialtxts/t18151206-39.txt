             was again indicted 


               for stealing, on the 9th of November
, one pocket handkerchief, value 9d. the property of a certain person unknown
            .

            . I first observed Wilson at about half past eleven, in Guildhall yard


; he was then employed in company with another, in attempting to pick every pocket he came near. He went behind a gentleman, and put his right hand into the gentleman's left hand pocket, and took out a red handkerchief. (Producing a pocket handkerchief.) I believe this is it; he put it into his breeches before he quitted the gentleman. I got up to the gentleman, and tapped him on the shoulder, but he said, d-n the handkerchief; it is of no consequence.

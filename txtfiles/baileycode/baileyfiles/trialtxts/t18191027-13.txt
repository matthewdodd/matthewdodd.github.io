            . On Sunday, the 3d of October, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, I was in Aldersgate-street, at the corner of Long-lane


; I was hustled by two or three persons all at once - the prisoner was right facing me, he put his hand before me, and drew my watch out in a moment; I said I was robbed of my watch, and started after him, and came close up to him - he was stopped just he had got round the corner, and brought back to the public-house at the corner. I never lost sight of him. I am sure he is the man. I have never recovered my watch.

            . I am an officer. I heard the cry of Stop thief! and stopped the prisoner; I searched him, but found no watch.

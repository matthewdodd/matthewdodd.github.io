SAMUEL POLAIN
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
16th of August, 17 yards of corduroy, value 12s.; 14 yards of cotton cloth, value 6s.; 430 buttons, value 4s.; and 3 oz. weight of thread, value 8d.; the goods of 



William Kilby; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






WILLIAM KILBY
. I am a tailor, and live in Gibraltar-walk, Bethnal-green. On the 16th of August I was going along Sun-street, and met the prisoner—I had known him previously, but had not seen him a great white—he said he was in great distress—I took him into a public-house, and gave him a pint of beer—we came out, and he offered to carry a bundle that I had, containing the articles stated—I allowed him—before we got to Church-street I gave him 6d., to relieve him, as he told me a pitiable story—I then said, at the corner of Brick-lane, that before we separated, we would have a pint of ale—I went into the public-house, and while I was giving the order, he was gone with the bundle—I have not seen it since—he was taken on the Saturday following.

Prisoner. Q. How can you swear to me? A. I cannot be mistaken in a person I knew three years ago, and who walked so far with me—I have not the slightest doubt that he is the man.

Prisoner. I knew him about three years ago; and did not see him till he accused me of the robbery.





THOMAS SPURGEON
 (police-constable 175 G.) I went with the prosecutor, and found the prisoner—he denied ever having seen the prosecutor in his life before.





JOSEPH COLLISON
 (police-constable R 136.) I produce this certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the man who was convicted.




GUILTY
. Aged 28.—


Transported for Seven Years.

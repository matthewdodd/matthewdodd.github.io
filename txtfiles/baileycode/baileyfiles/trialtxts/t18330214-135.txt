             (Police-constable E 39). On the 26th of January, about six o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner in company with two others in Cleveland-street


 - one of the other two went into the prosecutor's, fetched out this oil-cloth, and gave it to the prisoner; I took the prisoner with it - a gentleman came up, and asked if I wanted any help - I said Yes; one of the others knocked the gentleman down, and the other two escaped, but I detained the prisoner.

            . I am a broker
. This is my oil-cloth, and was on a chest of drawers in my shop.

            . I am an apprentice to Mr. Brind. I was in the kitchen. The maid called me down, and asked me to wash my hands, and hold her stockings while she ironed them. I heard a woman upon the stairs. I ran up: there was the prisoner. She chucked these things, mentioned in the indictment, my master's property, over the banisters, out of her apron, and ran away. She was soon taken near the door. (The things produced and deposed to.)

I was going along, and a boy called Stop thief! another woman ran by, and they stopped me.
Duglass. I had hold of the prisoner's gown, and never let go off her. As she got out at the door, a boy was coming along, and he stopped her; then I caught hold of her waist.

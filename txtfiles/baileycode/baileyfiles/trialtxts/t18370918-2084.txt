EDWARD RICKETTS
 was indicted

31st of August, 1 printed book, value 11s., the goods of 




Thomas Bumford.






JOHN BUMFORD
. I live with Mr. Thomas Bumford, a bookseller, No. 6, Holborn-bars. I was not at home when this happened—I know this book to be his—I saw it safe about eleven o'clock, and when I came back, about three o'clock, it was gone—it is my father's book—the ink on the label is smeared.





CHARLES BURGESS GOFFER
 (police-constable L 31.) I fell in with the prisoner in a street leading to Tavistock-street—he was with a young man

—he crossed, as it appeared to me, to avoid three policemen, and I followed him, and asked what he had got—he said, "a religious book"—I found it was this—I went to different booksellers, and found the prosecutor—it is the whole works of the Rev. William Romaine.

Prisoner's Defence. I did not avoid any policemen—I crossed the road in my way to deliver the book—I had it from my brother, and was going to take it to my sisters.




GUILTY
.* Aged 25.—


Transported for Seven Years.

CHARES ELLIOTT sworn.
I am an officer; I apprehended the prisoner on Thursday the 16th, I believe it was about four o'clock in the afternoon; I saw her near Litchfield-street office door; I searched her, and this sheet was pinned to her petticoats by her pocket-hole, in a long bundle, it came down to her heels almost.
(The property deposed to.)

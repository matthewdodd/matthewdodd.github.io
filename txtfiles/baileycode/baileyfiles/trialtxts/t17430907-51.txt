            . On the 22d of July
, I was near Bear-Key between ten and eleven in the Morning, I perceived somebody rushing strongly after me, and saw it was the Prisoner; I suspected he had picked my Pocket, and directly catched hold of his Arm; he had then my Handkerchief in his Hand, and I saw him throw it under the Horses on the outside of the Posts; the People would have me have left him to them; said I, If I leave him to your Mercy you will whip him to Death, or drown him; said I, Lad, if you have got any Friends, I will send you to them, and they shall correct you; he said, he had some Friends in Rosemary-lane, and that his Name was Johnson, his Father was a Shoemaker.

             came by at the same Time; said I. this little snotty Boy
 has picked my Pocket, if you will go along with me I will pay you for going, and take him to his Friends; but I found it was not for my Safety to go so far, so I secured him. 


               Guilty 10 d.

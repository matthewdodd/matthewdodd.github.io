JOSEPH PENMAN. I am a cabinet-maker and broker
. I live in Church-row, Bethnal-green


. I lost five brass weights off a table outside my door; I had seen them an hour before. I went out and a lady pointed out the two prisoners to me. I got my weights from Lawrence.

            . I saw Upcraft take the weights off the table, and put them into his pocket. Lawrence was close by, but I cannot say that he saw him, they had not gone many yards when they were taken.

            . These boys were brought to the watch-house. I found the weights on Lawrence; he said the other put them into his pocket.
LAWRENCE's Defence. I saw the other prisoner - he asked where I was going, we walked together; he saw the stool and gave the weights to me to put into my pocket and I would not.
Prisoner UPCRAFT. It is false my Lord.

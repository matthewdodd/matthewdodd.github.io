            , who are hatters

, and live in the Poultry


. On the 1st of May, I was at the back of the shop, and heard that a person had stolen a hat. I went to the door, and Warren said a man had taken the hat. We went towards Cheapside, and overtook the prisoner, about one hundred yards from our house, with the hat in his hand. I seized him, and took it from him. He said that he found it-that he was drunk, and a poor man, and hoped we would let him go.

            . I am a tailor. I was coming along the Poultry, and saw the prisoner try several person's pockets; he then went into the shop, took the hat off the counter, and went away. I called the shopman out and we pursued him; we collared him, and took it from him. I never lost sight of him.

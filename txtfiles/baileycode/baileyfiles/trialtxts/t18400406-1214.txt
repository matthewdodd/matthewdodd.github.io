ELIZABETH DAVIS
. I am the wife of Henry Robert Davis. On the 8th of April, about eleven o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came to take an apartment—I showed him one up stairs, and then we proceeded to the parlour—he asked for a pen and ink to write his address, and then asked for a glass of water—I took a glass, and went to the back parlour to wash the glass—I heard him at the mantel-piece—I looked, and saw him put something into his pocket—I then came into the parlour, and saw him put something into his hat—I heard a knock at the street-door, I went, and it was a gentleman applying for apartments—I said I had only one room—he wanted two, and went away—I returned to the parlour—the prisoner gave me his direction, and went away—I followed, and saw him running up Stanhope-street—I pursued him up another street, and then I kicked against this apron and pinafore—I stopped to pick them up, and then followed the prisoner—I lost sight of him at the bottom of Wild-street, and in a few minutes I saw him in custody—I missed a cloak, a child's pinafore, an apron, and two ornaments—these are them—(looking at them.)

Prisoner. Q. Can you swear I took them? A. Yes, because they were in my parlour when you went there—I did not see you throw them away.





SAAH WRIGHT
. I was in Princes-street, and saw the prisoner throw some china out of his pocket—the fu of this little cloak was sticking out of his bosom, and Mrs. Davis was calling "Stop thief."





DAVID COOPER
 (police-constable G 125.) I was on duty, and saw a crowd—the prisoner was stopped—I took him, and a woman brought this

child's cloak, and said to him, "You have just dropped this cloak"—which he did not deny.

ARTHUR HARVEY
 was indicted

for stealing 1 bed, value 2l. 10s.; 2 blankets, 7s.; and 1 rug, 3s.; the goods of 



William Fearn; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






WILLIAM FEARN
. I keep the White Lion beer-shop, White Lion-street, Pentonville; the prisoner lodged there. I was told of something, and missed from his room a bed, two blankets, and a counterpane—they are here—I can positively sweat to them.

Cross-examined by
MR. PAYNE. Q. How long had he lodged with you? A. From the 14th of May—his father and mother lodged there from Oct.—I missed these things on Monday, the 19th of May, about half-past eight o'clock.





SAMUEL FROST
. I am a pawnbroker. The prisoner pawned those things with me on the 19th of May.

Cross-examined. Q. Are you sure it was him? A. Yes—I had seen him before.






THOMAS TYLER
 (police-constable N 275.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction at this Court—(read—Convicted on the 27th of Feb., 1843, and confined two months)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
.— Aged 20.—


Transported for Seven Years.

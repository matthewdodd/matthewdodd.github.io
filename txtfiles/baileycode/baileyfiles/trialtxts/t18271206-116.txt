JOHN HENRY FREEMAN. I am mate of the Woodport
. On the 8th of November she was in the West India Docks, at Limehouse


; I left my watch hanging in the captain's state-room - I missed it at ten minutes past one o'clock; I was not absent from the vessel; I had not seen the prisoner on board, but I was under the bowsprit.

            . I am a salesman. On the 8th of November the prisoner came and asked me to purchase a duplicate of this watch; I sent for it, but finding it not worth more than had been lent on it, I sent it back. The prisoner is a seaman, and lives in the neighbourhood. I have known him five years, and believe him to be an honest man.
The prisoner put in a written Defence, stating that he had met a shipmate named Roberts, who asked him to pawn the watch for him, and gave him the duplicate to sell for him, being in want of money, as he was going a voyage.

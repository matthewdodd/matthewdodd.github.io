RANDAL SUTTON sworn.
I am appointer of the weighers in the King's warehouse upon Tower-Hill


; I was going round the warehouse, on the 12th of March, and saw the prisoner in a dark part of the warehouse, taking up some leaf tobacco; Mr. 
               
                  Henry
                   Stone
               



             is the keeper of the warehouse




; the prisoner used to carry beer to the men in the warehouse from a neighbouring public-house; I asked him what he was doing there; he said, he was taking a little tobacco; I took him by the arm, and he pulled what is in this bag (producing it.) from behind him, and some out of his breeches, which were unbuttoned at the time; I told him to go along, and I should mention it to my superior officer; he begged very hard that I would not; I told him I certainly should; and I went immediately, and acquainted my superior officer; there was a great quantity of tobacco lying in the warehouses out of their proper package.
TIMOTHY OSBURN sworn.
I am controuling surveyor of these warehouses; the last witness acquainted me of this business; Mr. Gordon, the principal surveyor, went out in pursuit of the prisoner, and he was brought back to the warehouse door; just without the door, I met Mr. Gordon and the prisoner, the prisoner was kept within the gates, and the constable was sent for; Mr. Gordon then went with the constable to the prisoner's house; I followed them very soon after, and went up to the room, which the people of the house said was Stuart's bed-room, and there was a box in the room which he had the key of, it was open, and there was a small -
Court. I don't see how we can connect this with tobacco taken somewhere else.
Witness. He said it was some he had taken for his own use.
Prisoner's defence. I only had a little bit in my hand, about an ounce or two, and they put the rest to it; I had lived in the house three years, and never did any thing bad in my life.

            . I am a patrol of Bow-street
. On the 9th of November, I was at the fire in Duke's-court, assisting the sufferers in Broad-court


; I had my truncheon under my arm. The prisoner laid hold of my watch, and drew it out; I flung my hand back, and caught his hand with the seals in it. I secured him, and took him to the top of the court; there was a whistle, and a cry of rescue. I shoved him into a shop, and got assistance. I took him to the office.

            . I am a special constable. I assisted in securing the prisoner, and saw Stowell take the watch from him.

            . I am a gardener
, I live at
Hammersmith


; the prisoner had been my servant
 for some years, I discharged him in March last. In consequence of something that passed on the 27th of September I procured a search warrant, I and the constable and Mr. Dawson went to his lodgings, his wife was at home, he was at his work; we opened the door; went up stairs, the door up stairs was padlocked, which the constable broke open. In the room I found the sieve, the cloths and a bag of seed, with my wife's hand-writing; I went down in the cellar, I found the two forks there, they are marked in my own names the shears I lost six years ago.
Prisoner's Defence I did not take the things home to make a property of them; we took them home sometimes when it rained very hard, and sometimes we took a fork home to make sure they should not be lost.

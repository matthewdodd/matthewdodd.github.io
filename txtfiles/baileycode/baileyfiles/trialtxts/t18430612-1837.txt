ELIZABETH PATMORE
. I am the wife of Peter George Patmore. The prisoner was in my service for one week—I lost four decanters and other things—I can swear these are my decanters—they have been in my possession for years—this spoon I can swear to by the initials, and this other spoon I have no doubt is mine.

Prisoner. Q. Did you not say the day after I entered your service, that another servant robbed you of some wine glasses? A. Yes.





JOHN CHARLES CUTBUSH
. I am a pawnbroker. These things were pawned by the prisoner on the 22nd, 24th, 25th, 26th, and 27th of April—these are the duplicates of them.





ANDREW WYNESS
 (police-constable D 43.) I opened the prisoner's box—the key was taken out of her hand—I found in the box some duplicates corresponding with these the pawnbroker has produced.

Prisoner's Defence. The duplicates belong to me.




GUILTY
. ** Aged 33.—


Transported for Seven Years.

(There was another indictment against the prisoner, who has been repeatedly in custody.)

            . I am a coachman
 to Mr. Ray, who lives at Richmond


; I lost my master's box, on the 26th of April, and my own blue livery-waistcoat; they were taken out of the stable-yard; my master had some hand-bills distributed, in consequence of which I found the waistcoat at the Wilkes's head at Old Brentford. (The waistcoat produced, and deposed to by the prosecutor.)

            . I am a waterman and lighter-man, at Old Brentford; I was at the Wilkes's-head when the prisoner came in with a bundle, and wanted a boat to go to London; he offered to sell me this waistcoat, which I bought of him for 18 d. he said he had redeemed that and some other things out of pawn, at Richmond; he had besides in the bundle a great coat, which he offered to sell.
Prisoner's Defence.
I went to sleep under a hay-rick; I found this waistcoat concealed under the hay.

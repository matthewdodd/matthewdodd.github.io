            . I was in Cheapside on he 19th of December, going towards Cornhill, about a quarter past six in the evening; I crossed about Friday-street


, within about four or five dos of Wood-street


; I had not gone above three or four steps before I missed my handkerchief; I turned about and saw the prisoner delivering my handkerchief to another young man; he ran across the street, and I followed him, and stopped him and charged him with picking my pocket; he denied it; I took him to the Compter, and charged a constable with him; on the Tuesday following I took him to Guildhall; he there told me he would get me my handkerchief again or the worth of it, if I would let him go.
Prisoner. He said he would clear me in case I would get him the handkerchief.
Q. What sort a handkerchief was your's?
Prosecutor. It was a white one with a red borer; I had taken it out of my pocket as I crossed the street, and just put it in again before I missed it.
Prisoner's defence.
I was going across the water, I never saw the handkerchief; when the gentleman laid hold of me I was on the other side the way.

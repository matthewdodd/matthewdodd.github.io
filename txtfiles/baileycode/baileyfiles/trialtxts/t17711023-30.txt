. The prisoner came into our shop on the 11th of October, at about seven at night; he cheapened a great many stockings; he asked the price of one pair of stockings, I told him four shillings and six-pence; he said very well, and gave them to a man in company with him, who ran away; I pursued him, but he got quite away.
Q. from Prosecutor. Had not I six shillings and six-pence in my pocket?

Davidson. The constable searched his pocket; he had nothing but buttons in it.
Prisoner's Defence.
I work hard for my living; I intended to pay for the stockings; I went to the door to see after the other man and he was gone; I felt in my pocket and found it had been pick'd; I went after him. I am quite innocent.

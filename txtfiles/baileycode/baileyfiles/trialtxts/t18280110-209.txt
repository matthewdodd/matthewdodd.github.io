            . I am waiter at the King's Head public-house, Old Jewry


, which is kept by Joseph Alexander. On the 4th of January, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner going into the coffee-room - I asked who he wanted - he said, "A pint of half-and-half;" he gave me 1s. - I gave him the change; a gentleman, who was dining in the room, called me soon after, paid me, and left; while I was clearing the table, the prisoner asked if the same person kept the house as kept it three years ago - I said Yes; he then asked if we let beds - I said, No; I put the table-cloth on the shelf, with four others; I left the room, and returned in about an hour, but missed nothing then, but between nine and ten o'clock I missed two of the five table-cloths - several gentlemen had been there after the prisoner left.

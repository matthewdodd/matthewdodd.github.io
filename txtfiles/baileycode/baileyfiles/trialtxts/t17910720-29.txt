I am steward to Mr. Wyatt, I lost five geese out of twenty-seven; I sent some men after them, and found three at Mr. Thomas's house, they are my master's; I missed them the 2d, and found them the 12th. The prisoners were taken on the 11th on suspicion. I know the geese by a foot mark, a slit in the web of the right foot.

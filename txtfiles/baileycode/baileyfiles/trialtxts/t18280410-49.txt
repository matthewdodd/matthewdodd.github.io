ROBERT SMITH, Esq. I live in Brompton-row, Knights-bridge. On the 11th of April, about three o'clock in the afternoon, I was in St. James'-street


 - I felt a pull at my coat-pocket: I turned round, and saw the two prisoners with another young lad close behind me - I caught hold of Blake, and saw him pass my handkerchief to James; I let go of him, and seized James, who immediately dropped it on the ground - it was picked up, and they were both secured; my brother was with me.

CAROLINE STOREY
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
29th of May, 9 yards of bombazine, value 12s.; 4 jackets, value 16s.; 1 pair of trowsers, value 5s.; 1 pair of breeches, value 5s.; 1 pair of boots, value 2s. 18 pairs of shoes, value 1l. 5s.; 1 sheet, value 2s.; 1 blanket, value


3s.; and 2 pillows, value 5s.; the goods of Nicholas Crowder; and that she had been before convicted of felony.





ELIZABETH ANN CROWDER
. I am the wife of Nicholas Crowder, and let ready-furnished lodgings, on Great Saffron hill. The prisoner occupied a room there for seven weeks—in consequence of suspicion, on the 29th of May, I went into her room, and found the things were gone, and discovered some of the tickets—some of the property is lost altogether—she paid 4s. a week.





JOHN FLAHERTY
. I am a pawnbroker. I have three jackets, a sheet, a flat iron, and blanket—I cannot swear who pawned them—whether it was a man or woman—they are in the name of Smith—these are the counter duplicates of the articles.





NATHANIEL SIMMONS
. I am a pawnbroker, and live in Baldwin's-gardens. I have a pair of breeches—I do not know who pawned them—this is the duplicate.





JOHN FREDERICK SIMMONS
. I am shopman to a pawnbroker in Liquorpond-street. I have two pillows—I do not know who pawned them—these are the duplicates of them.





WILLIAM STEWART
. (City police-constable. No. 133.) I found all these duplicates in the room which the prisoner occupied.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

Prisoner's Defence. I had some tickets to mind for a young person. I neither stole the property or pawned them. I was not aware that the property was the prosecutor's.





JOHN DAVIS WHITE
 (police-constable. G 46.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office——(read)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 22.—


Transported for Fourteen Years.
(There was another indictment against the prisoner.)

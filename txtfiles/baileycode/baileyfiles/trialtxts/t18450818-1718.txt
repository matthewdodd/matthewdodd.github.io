HULL† pleaded 


GUILTY
. Aged 19.—


Transported for Seven Years.






JAMES JONES
. I had a copper on the 30th of July in High-street, Highgate—I saw it safe between two and three o'clock, and missed it the game day—this is it.





JOHN FARR
 (police-sergeant S 6.) I took the prisoner Hull, and fetched this copper from the prosecutor's house, one of the witnesses had taken it back there.





GEORGE SAUNDERS
. I found Hull carrying this copper, about half-past three o'clock that afternoon, and Withers was with him—I took the copper back—the prisoners were given into custody—Withers said if I swore to him I should hear of it afterwards.

Withers. I said if he swore to me he would take a felse oath.





JOSEPH LEAMAN
. I was with Saunders—Hull was carrying the cop-per, and there was another with him, but I cannot swear that it was Withers—I took the copper from Hull—Withers was taken in about half an hour afterwards.

Withers. I was going to work, and in coming from Finchley the policeman took me, and said it was for stealing a copper; I said I knew nothing about it.





JOB UNDERWOOD
 (police-constable S 67.) I took Withers—I said he was wanted—he said, "What for? I know nothing about the copper; I never touched it"—Saunders saw him in the station, and said he was the person—Withers said, "I know nothing about it; if you swear to me you will hear of it afterwards."

WITHERS—


NOT GUILTY

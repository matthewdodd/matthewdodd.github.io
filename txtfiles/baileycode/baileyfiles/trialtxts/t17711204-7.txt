            . I lodge at the three butchers in Hungerford-market


. The prisoner laid in the same room; I lost the things mentioned in the indictment, on the 11th of November. I had them at night when I went to bed, and missed them and the prisoner in the morning. (a gold ring, a waistcoat, and a shirt produced, and deposed to by the prosecutor.) These things of mine were found upon the prisoner.

            . The prosecutor told me he was robbed, and suspected the prisoner. I met the prisoner afterwards in the street; I saw Aldin's waistcoat under his arm; I charged him with having robbed the prisoner; he desired I would make no noise about it, and let him go. I took him before justice Kynaston; there he was searched, and the prosecutor's shirt and gold-ring were found upon him. The prisoner desired I would go to a man that was in company with him when I took him, and desire him to come and assist him. I went after that man; as soon as he saw me he run away. The prisoner said at the justices that that man was not concerned in the business.
Prisoner's Defence.
These things were given me by that man.

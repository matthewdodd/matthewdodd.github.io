Smith. I lost 15 s. 6 d. out of my Trunk. The Prisoner had lodg'd with me all the Summer. I went out in the Morning, the 1st of September, and left him a-bed; and when I came home, my Trunk was broke open, and my Money gone. The Prisoner was taken the 26th, and confessed the Fact before Justice Frazier, but would not sign any Confession. I saw it in the Trunk, and told it before I went out that Morning.

Upon Smith's telling me that he had lost his Money, I went after the Prisoner to several Places, and at last found him on Walham Green : He owned he took the Money, and begg'd Pardon, and said, he was willing to work it out. I never knew him guilty or any Thing like this before .

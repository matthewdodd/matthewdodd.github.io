Q. Was the prisoner in your employ - A. Not at that time. On the 11th of August, between four and five o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner coming out of my counting house window, I called to him, upon which he ran away, I pursued him and took him; we afterwards brought him back into the yard, we searched him and found two five shilling papers of halfpence, and some loose ones; he said they were his own.

On the morning of the 11th of of August I was sent for by the prosecutor; when I came to the yard I found the prisoner in custody; the halfpence that were found on the prisoner I had them the evening before in my possession; I found the two locks in the desk broken open, and the halfpence gone.
Prisoner's Defence. On Thursday evening I went up to the Adam and Eve public house, Tottenham-court-road, I changed a one pound note, they gave me ten shillings in halfpence. I was locked out, I went and slept in a cart; in the morning I was going down Cheney Mews, two men came and stopped me.

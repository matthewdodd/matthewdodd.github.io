                  Joseph 
                  Stennett 
               




             , D. D. 
Dr. Stennett. About six weeks ago Mr. Morris and Mr. Warburton, two strangers to me at that time, came and inquired whether one 
               
                  Mary 
                  Paul 
               



             had been my servant, saying, they believed I had been robbed by her, and another person, and that some of the goods had been sold to them. As to the linen I can't pretend to know any thing of it; but there are three prints that I can be positive to. ( Three prints of the duke of Marlborough's battles produced in court.) These I know are my property.
Cross examination.
Q. Where were these prints found ?
Dr. Stennett. I am not certain where, they were brought to my house.
Q. Did you miss them out of your house?
Dr. Stennett. No, I did not; I had been at the Bath.
Q. Was this 
               
                  Mary 
                  Paul 
               



             left in trust in your house?
Dr. Stennett. She was, but there were many goods lock'd up.
Mrs. Stennett. Last year about the 5th or 6th of May, upon the account of the Doctor's health, we went to the Bath, and the prisoner Paul had not been long in my service then; we left her in the house with the whole care of it, and put out the plate and other particular things. We staid longer than we intended, for going to our house in Wales we were detain'd, so that we did not come home till the begining of Oct. When we return'd I found her by herself. I did think of discharging her immediately, by reason of the extravagancy of her bills, but the Dr. desir'd I'd keep her a little longer. I had not been at home long before I missed a little linen, sheets, table cloths, napkins, and the like. I was very solicitous, and inquir'd of my own maid, and sometimes I suspected my own memory, thinking I might have misplaced things, rather than accuse her, for fear she should lose her character; I still missed more and more, for the robbery was not all done while I was out of town, but (as they have confessed) it was committed when we were out on a Sunday. I never knew what was become of the linen till some of it was brought to me, which I knew, because it was mark'd by me; Mr. Morris and Mr. Warburton gave us the first intelligence. I have missed much more, but have mentioned nothing in the indictment but what were brought back (a parcel of linen produced in court.) I am sure these are my property, all mark'd by myself, except one sheet. The first parcel was brought by Miss Overal, the second by Mr. Morris, and the third by Mrs. Tisey; here is in the last an under-petticoat, a breakfast cloth, and two towels; they had overlook'd one of them, and mark'd it for own, but here is my mark, an S upon it, was being in white silk they had not observed.
Cross Examination.
Q. Did you not give Mary an' a good character?
Mrs. Stennett. I thought honest, and I gave her a character that I did not charge her with dishonestly.
Q. Did she own she took the things away?
Mrs. Stennett. I heard her own before justice Fielding that the old woman took them out of the house, and she gave them to her.
Q. In what words did she own first?
Mrs. Stennett. Justice Fielding who took these goods out of Dr. Stennett's house 
               
                  Mary 
                  Paul 
               



             said, Mrs. Field did ( meaning the said woman;) the justice said who gave them to her, she said, I did.
Mr. Morris. Last July was twelvemonth. 
               
                  Mary 
                  Field 
               



            , the elder of the prisoners at the bar, brought a parcel of linen to my house, and told me she had them to dispose of for a friend; upon inquiring whose property they were, she hesitated, but upon my insisting upon knowing whose they were, she made use of a gentlewoman's name, Miss 
               
                  Ann 
                  Overal 
               



            . I had some knowledge of her person. I have known the prisoner upwards of 5 years, she had nursed my wife in 2 or 3 lyings-in; during which time I thought her honest, and not suspecting the truth of what she had told me, I purchased the linen, which consisted of 2 odd sheets, a night shirt and dresser cloth, for which I gave 16 shillings.
Mrs. Stennett. The coarse shirts are not here.

Morris. In Nov. following she brought some more linen, which she said came from the same place, consisting of 2 shirts, a damask table cloth, and 3 damask napkins; for this parcel she asked more than my wife was willing to give; she said the price was set upon them by the owner. She carried them away, and in about 2 or 3 days after she brought them again, and said the person was contented to take the price offer'd, which was 22 s. 6 d. so I paid for them, and to my great surprise, about two months ago, the servant maid who liv'd with me at that time, and with whom all the three prisoners were acquainted, came and inform'd me that the linen I had purchased was stolen from out of the house of Dr. Stennett.
Q. What is her name?
Morris. Her name is 
               
                  Rachael 
                  Atkerson 
               



            ; then I sent my wife to inquire of Miss Overal, who declared she had never given Field any such things to sell. Then I waited on Dr. Stennett and told him the whole affair; and upon this the prisoners were taken up.


                  Rebecca 
                  Morris 
               



            . The prisoner 
               
                  Mary 
                  Field 
               



             brought this linen to our house, but there was another sheet and shirt, which are not here.
Q. When did she bring them?
R. Morris. I can't say as to the day of the month. The last parcel she brought I think was in the Nov. following. I had such an opinion of her honesty that I recommended her wherever I could.
Eliz. Tisey. I bought some things of 
               
                  Mary 
                  Field 
               



             some time last summer was 12 months, but can't say the exact time; she said they were a friend's of her's that wanted to dispose of them. I look'd them over, and said I was not a judge of them, but I would send them to a friend that was. I had them 2 or 3 days; she asked me 16 s. for them; my friend valued them at 15 s. After that she sent her daughter Ann, whom I told they were valued at 15 s. She said she dare say the person whose they were would not stand for a shilling. So I bought them (I think there were 4 napkins and a table cloth.)

                  Atkerson 
               



            . 
               
                  Mary 
                  Paul 
               



             told me about 4 months ago that she was very uneasy, and beg'd of me not to be drawn in by Mrs. Field, who had advised her to rob her master's house, and said she must discover it if I did not. She told me also there were some pictures in Mrs. Field's room that came from Dr. Stennett's house. I asked Mrs. Field's daughter where they came from, and she said they were bought in Moorfields.
Mrs. Stennett. Mr. Morris gave me an account of these pictures being in Mrs. Field's room.
Mr. Morris. I saw these 3 pictures in the lodgings of 
               
                  Mary 
                  Field 
               



            , and after that I was told by 
               
                  Rachael 
                  Atkerson 
               



             that they belonged to the Doctor.
Q. to Atkerson. Do you know the prints again?
R. Atkerson. I saw these pictures in 
               
                  Mary 
                  Field

                  Overal 
               



            . I purchased 3 sheets, a table cloth, and a shirt, of 
               
                  Mary 
                  Field 
               



            , in July last.
Q. What did you give her for them?
A. Overal. I gave her 30 s. for them. She told me they were a lady's that had more than she had occasion for, and she had a mind to dispose of them.
Mrs. Stennett. 
               
                  Sarah 
                  Field 
               



             own'd she took one bundle out of the house.
Mr. Morris. I heard 
               
                  Sarah 
                  Field

I did not take any thing out of the house.

                  Mary 
                  Paul 
               



             asked me to go and drink a dish of tea with her on a Sunday in the afternoon; then she asked me if I would take a bundle and carry to my mother's. I said what is it, she said it was linen for my mother to mend; so I took it, and carried it to my mother's room, and never saw it afterwards. She came once to our room and left a bundle with me, the outside was an under-petticoat.

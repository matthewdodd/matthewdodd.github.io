             took it into the Room. When I had taken a Drink of Beer, they both went away; but while I got up to shut the Window, I saw 
               
                  Mary 
                  Bell

That at last, when he could not find the Money, he said he was robb'd of two or three Guineas. So Mary Bell and he went up again together, and he said to me and the Prisoner at the Bar, if we could find it, he would give us a Treat. While we were talking together, this

 for stealing, on the 
7th of January, 1 snuff-jar and cover, value 3s. 6d.; and 2oz. of snuff, value 8d.; the goods of 




George Corner; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






MARY SHELTON CORNER
. I am the wife of George Corner, we keep a snuff shop, at No. 34, Clipston-street. I missed a snuff-jar—it was taken from the counter—this is it—(looking at it)—I missed it on the 7th of January, about half-past five o'clock in the evening—I do not know the prisoner.





THOMAS CARTER
. I am a policeman. I was on duty, and met the prisoner in Bainbridge-street, St. Giles's, three quarters of a mile from the prosecutor's—he had got a bundle in a handkerchief—I asked what he had got—he said, "A jar"—I asked him to let me look at it, and found this jar—he said he picked it up in the street, and there was some snuff in it—when I took him before the Magistrate he said he took it in Cleveland-street.

Prisoner. I own I took it, and I told the policeman so—I wish to go to the Penitentiary—I have no friends.





HENRY NEWMAN
 (police-sergeant F 18.) I produce the certificate of the prisoner's former conviction from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—I was present at the trial—the prisoner is the same person that was then convicted,

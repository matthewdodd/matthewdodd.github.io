ANN DUNN
 was again indicted

 for stealing, on the 
5th of Dec., 1 cloak, value 4s. 6d.; and 9 dead roach, 6d.; the goods of 



Catherine Rowland, from the person of 



Jane Allen Rowland.






JANE ALLEN ROWLAND
. I am eight years old. I know what will become of me if I tell a falsehood—I am the daughter of Catherine Rowland. On the 5th of December I was going along near the Angel at Islington—I met the prisoner—she said, "Halloo, Jane, how do you do?"—(I did not know her before)—she then asked me where I was going—I said, "To my cousin's, to take these fish"—she said, "She is not at home, I have just been to your cousin's, and in a quarter of an hour I am going again; shall I take your fish?"—I said, "Yes"—I then went on to the corner of Hopkin's-street, and she took my cloak, and said, "Your mother said you was to have it braided"—she took it, and said she would bring me the cloak, and a shawl, and a coral necklace—this is my cloak that she took, and this other cloak is one that she had—she said she was going to ask my mother if I might have one like it.





WILLIAM WEIBLER
. I produce this cloak—it was pledged by the prisoner on the 5th of Dec.




GUILTY
. Aged 20.—


Transported for Ten Years.

(There was another indictment against the prisoner.)

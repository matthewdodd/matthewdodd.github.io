            . I am a constable. On the 17th of July, I saw the prisoner put his hand into four or five women's pockets. I watched him, and at the corner of Bridge-street, saw him put his left hand into Hobcroft's pocket, and hold the pocket up with his right hand, and take out the purse. I told the prosecutrix, and secured him.

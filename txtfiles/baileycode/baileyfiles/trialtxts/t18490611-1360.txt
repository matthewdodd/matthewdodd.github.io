JOSEPH STAPLES FLEMING. I

On the morning of 4th June, I was awoke by a policeman, and found the wash-house window open, which was shut the night before, at eleven o'clock—it is attached to the house—I missed a great-coat, silver table-spoon, and some tea-spoons; these are them (produced.)

JAMES WILLIAM CROUCH
 (policeman, R 361). On 4th June, about five o'clock, I took Ryan, and said I wanted him for breaking into Mr. Fleming's house with Corbett, and taking some things—he said, "I did"—I searched him, and found this glazier's knife, razor, gimblet, and knife on him (produced.)





CHARLES REVELL
 (policeman, L 175). I produce a certificate of Corbett's conviction—(read—Convicted Nov. 1846, having been before convicted, confined six months)—he is the person.

DENNIS HENAGAN
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
17th of October, 2 pewter pots, value 1s. 6d., the goods of 



William Stodgell; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






WILLIAM BRIGDEN
. I am son-in-law to William Stodgell, who keeps the old Red Cross public-house. The prisoner came about nine o'clock on the 17th of October, and asked for half a pint of beer—he went out, and left a Pint pot at the bar—I went into the tap-room—the half-pint pot was gone—I went after him, and found it in his pocket—he was taken to the station-house, and another pot was found in his hat.





WILLIAM DICKINSON
 (police-sergeant H 11.) I searched the prisoner, and found this pot in his hat.

Prisoner. I had been out all night, and coming home, there were some women, one of them shoved the pint pot, and it cut my foot—I took

it up, and said, "What do you mean?"—"I beg your pardon," said they—I took it up and put it into my hat—I thought it belonged to a house further down, and when I was going past this man's door I went in to get a drop of beer, as a man had given me 6d. just before—I sat in the taproom, and drank it—he followed me in—he took up something, and went out—I then was going out, and saw two young women—one wanted some water, and I took the pot to get the water at the pump.





CHARLES SMITH
 (police-constable K 137.) I have a certificate from Mr. Clark's office of the prisoner's former conviction—(read)—he is the man.




GUILTY
. Aged 66.—


Transported for Seven Years.

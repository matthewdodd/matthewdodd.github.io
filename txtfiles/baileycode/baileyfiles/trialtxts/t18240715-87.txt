            . I was at the review in Hyde Park


 on the 10th of this month, and had a purse, with some silver, in my trowsers pocket; I heard an alarm from the officer - I felt, and it was gone.
ANGELIUS BERTRAUN. I was at the review, and saw the prisoner standing close by the side of Mr. Andrews and as the horse soldiers were backing the people I saw him puthis arm against the prosecutor, and take something from his right hand pocket - I collared him, and he dropped the purse on the ground.

            . I am an officer. I saw the prisoner with four more half an hour previous to the robbery; when they saw us they dispersed - I saw him take the purse from Mr. Andrew's pocket, and afterwards drop it from his right hand - I picked it up.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I went to the review - while I was in the crowd this officer stooped and picked up a purse by the side of the prosecutor, and asked him if I took it from him - he said he could not tell, but it was his purse - they then took hold of me.

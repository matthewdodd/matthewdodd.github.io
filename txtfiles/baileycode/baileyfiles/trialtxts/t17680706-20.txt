            . I am a gangsman belonging to Bear-key; on the 15th of June I went up into the warehouse between twelve and one, and met the prisoner with some sugar in a handkerchief, and some in his waistcoat-pocket; I secured him, there was about eight pounds of it, there was a hogshead of sugar near him that had been pilfered, it was of the same quality.
Prisoner's defence.
I happened to go into that warehouse; a man there desired me to carry this sugar out for him, and they came and stopped me.

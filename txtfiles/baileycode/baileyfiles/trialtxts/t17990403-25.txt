             sworn. - I live at Mile-End Turnpike: On Wednesday the 13th of March, I was informed that there were two men supposed to be breaking into the buildings; I went up the stairs leading to our warehouse.
Q. Were is your warehouse? - A. At Galleyquay


; I called a man to assist me; we went up three pair of stairs, and there I saw the prisoners, one of them, Connor, was filling his pockets; and the other had his hat in his hand, which he dropped; I immediately seized Connor, and asked him what he was doing; he attempted to throw the sugar, that he had about him, about the room that he was in; I then pulled him from that room to the loop-hole, there I called out for assistance; while I was standing with him there, he attempted to throw me out of the loop-hole down stairs, and in the struggle we both sell together upon the stairs, and he was trying to throw me over his head; but the other person, who had got the other prisoner in hold,

                   Deare
               



            , assisted me; and I detained him till I got more assistance; an officer came up, and took charge of both the prisoners; as soon as the officer had taken charge, I tried the lock, and found it had been picked; the lock had been, at different times, opened in a way that I could not account for; the officer took a knife out of Connor's pocket, with a kind of matter that would pick a lock, something in the shape of a horse-picker, in the handle of the knife; I saw the officer unlock the lock the next morning with it; there was about four pounds of sugar in Connor's pocket; and in the hat, which Busted dropped, I found five pounds of sugar.
Q. Who did this warehouse belong to? - A. All the goods are under our locks: Joseph Sabine, Robert Waghorn, John Sabine, Thomas Knight,

             sworn. - On Wednesday the 13th of March, I was standing upon the Quay, between three and four o'clock, when Mr. Deare called to me; I followed him up three pair of stairs, and then I saw Mr. Deare had hold of Conner; Busted had just passed Mr. Deare, when I laid hold of him; I turned round, and saw Connor taking sugar out of his pocket and chucking it out into the Capsail-room; the boy, Busted, begged of us to let him go; I told him I should do no such thing; Connor resisted Mr. Deare very much, and had got him down upon the stairs; he would have chucked him over the stairs if I had not got hold of him.
Q. You are sure that is the boy? - A. Yes.(The constable produced the sugar and the knife.)
Mr. Deare. This is the same sort of sugar that was in our warehouse; we weighed the hogshead, and found half a hundred and sixteen pounds deficient.
Connor's defence. I was at work in the warehouse, I saw the door open, and I went in and took a bit of sugar.
Busted's defence. I was at work in the warehouse, but I did not take any of the sugar.
Busted called five witnesses, who gave him a good character.

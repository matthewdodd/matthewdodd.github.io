Michael Crew. I live in the parish of Stanmore


, and am a farmer
. On the 10th at night, or 11th in the morning of this instant I lost several hens; but three of them were very remarkable. They were found upon the prisoner, and I know them to be mine.

            . I am servant to Mr. Scot. Coming from his mills I saw the prisoner on Hounslow-Heath, picking some fowls. I went and examined him how he came by them, but he would not tell me. He had got eleven fowls and two geese. I took him before the justice. Going along he said, he'd give me and my partner a shilling and all the fowls to let him go: but we would not. Then he ran from us, and we after him, took him again, and carried him before justice Bulstrode.

            . I saw the fowls taken upon the prisoner. Some of them were my property. I can swear to one of them, which was a black one. I had lost six.

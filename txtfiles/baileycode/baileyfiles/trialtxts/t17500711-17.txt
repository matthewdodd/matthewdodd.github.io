            . I lost my hat and wig out of my kitchen on the 28th of June, about eight o'clock in the morning. I am a baker
 and was below doing my business. I went into Rosemary lane when I missed them, to request, if such things should be brought there, that the person might be stopped who should offer them to sale. The prisoner was afterwards stopped and I sent for; I took her before Sir 
               
                  Samuel 
                  Gore 
               



            . The next witness can give a fuller account of the matter.

            . I live in Rosemary lane. About seven o'clock, June 28, the prosecutor came to me and described the hat and wig, and desired me to stop the person who should bring such. After this the prisoner came with the wig. I asked her the price; by the descriptions given by the prosecutor I knew the wig. I stopped her and went to the prosecutor, who lives in St. Catharine's lane


, so we took her before Sir 
               
                  Samuel 
                  Gore 
               



            .

GEORGE TAPLING
. I live in Wood-street. On Monday morning, 4th April, I was in Aldersgate-street about 9 o'clock, and saw the two prisoners—they followed close at my heels, and Burns trod on my stick, which fell out of my hand—I picked it up again, and Dimmock gave me his pocket handkerchief to wipe it with—I immediately felt, and missed my handkerchief, which I had seen safe about ten minutes before, and told Dimmock he had taken it, which he denied—I took him by the collar, and ran of with him into as very small court, where I overtook Burns—they both turned out their pockets, and I found my handkerchief underneath Burns's coat—this (produced) is it—I gave them in charge.





GEORGE TAYLOR SWAN
 (City policeman). I took the prisoners, searched them, and found on Burns a purse, and 5 1/2 d., and upon Dimmock a tobacco-box, a sixpence, and two halfpennies—the prosecutor gave me this handkerchief—I did not see it taken from Burns

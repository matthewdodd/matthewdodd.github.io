            . I am a Baronet
. On the night of the 5th of January, 1830, I was disturbed from my bed after twelve o'clock, and in consequence of some communication from the persons who came to me, I went to an enclosed preserve in a particular part of my ground, where I saw seven or eight men armed with guns and bludgeons - my men were ten or twenty yards in front of them; I seized the gun of one of the men I saw, and struggled with him - I was thrown down, and my hat was knocked off; a great deal of violence was offered to me while I was on the ground - I was struck several times, and one very severe blow was aimed at the side of my head with a bludgeon; it just grazed my head, and, I believe, I have the bludgeon by me now - if it had struck me it must have killed me; it was a very thick bludgeon - there was then a general battle - several guns were levelled at me, but I cannot swear to one being fired; I was before the Magistrate when the prisoner was taken - he said he was in a state of gross intoxication, did not know what he did, and he had been seduced by the others - we identified eight of the men, and they were tried.
COURT. Q. Was this in your own park? A. Yes, in Stanwell-park.

            . I am footman to Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Gibbons
               



            . On the night of the 5th of January, 1830, I went to the preserves; we met eight persons armed with guns and bludgeons - the prisoner was one of them; I had my arm broken in the affray by a man named Hooper, who was in company with the prisoner and the others - I was struck several times, and had several bruises - the prisoner had a gun with him.
COURT. Q. Did you see any gun pointed at Sir John Gibbons? A. Yes, and I saw the fire from the flint and steel - it was only about two or three yards from Sir John: ashed in the pan - this was in the park, just outside the preserve; I did not hear from the party what they came for - the preserve is in Stanwell parish.
SIR

             re-examined. Some of them said they had only taken two or three pheasants that night - they were just then beginning.
Prisoner. If I am found guilty I hope Sir

. He ordered this cask of Holland gin to be put on board a vessel at his wharf, for the use of the captain. It was taken from out of the vessel. A day or two after he went and searched the house of one Jennings at Stepney; at first he was refused, but at last admitted, and found the cask, which was produced in court empty.

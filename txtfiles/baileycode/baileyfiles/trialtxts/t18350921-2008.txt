JAMES ANDERSON TUCKER
. I am a shopman to a grocer. On the 12th of September I was in Lawrence-lane, Cheapside, about twelve o'clock in the day—I felt somebody at my pocket—I felt and my handkerchief was safe—I took my hand away and immediately afterwards heard a cry of "Stop thief"—I then found my handkerchief was gone—I saw the prisoner running away with it in his hand—I ran after him, and called "Stop thief"—I saw him throw it on the pavement, and picked it up—a gentleman stopped him till I got up—I never lost sight of him.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

Prisoner's Defence. He said at Guildhall, he did not know that it was his. I know the handkerchief was thrown, down but I did not have it.

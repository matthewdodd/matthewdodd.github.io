            . The Prisoner was a journeyman to Mr. Applebee the printer
. On the 13th of Feb. there came an order from Mr. Nourse, to deliver a thousand Royal English Grammars. My master not being very well, the order was brought to me; and upon telling them over I found 300 short of the number. I went immediately and told my master the number was short; and from that time the Prisoner absconded my master's service. My master took him in Lincoln's-inn fields, and he owned before Justice Poulson, that he took the books out of the house. [Some of the books were produced.]

Joyner. There were only the prisoner, and the watchman was fast asleep all the while.

            . I saw twenty casks of sugar put on board a lighter at Galley-key





 on the 19th of November; I left my brother to go down with the vessel, it was my lighter; the sugar was to be shipped on board the King George, Capt. Harper master, bound for Rotterdam.

            . I was on board the lighter on the 20th of November, going down to put the sugar on board the King George, between two and three in the morning; the prisoner and evidence made an attempt to come on board, when near Lady Parsons's; I desired them to keep clear; they did; the next time the prisoner came first, and Joyner after him; Joyner knocked me down, and threatned if I offered to make any resistance, to throw me overboard; they were resolutely bent to take some sugar; the prisoner stood over me some time, and said if I offered to stir he would throw me overboard; then they went to work at cutting the casks open; I was down in the lighter, and dared not hold up my head to see them; they took out what quantity of sugar they pleased, and put it into a bag, and put it into a boat, and went away with it; I was afraid to stir or move one way or another; I looked at the hogshead after, and imagined there might be an hundred and a half gone, it was a very dark morning; they were a great while on board the lighter.
Prisoner's defence.
Joyner got on board the lighter and knocked the man down, and said he would have his life unless he would let him have the sugar; I told the man not to resist, for the other was a resolute fellow, and would have his life.

            . The prisoner did bid me not to make any resistance, for the other was a very resolute young fellow; I believe if I had made any, I should have been thrown overboard.
Q. Did the prisoner offer any violence to you?
Grimes. I cannot say he did after Joyner knocked me down.

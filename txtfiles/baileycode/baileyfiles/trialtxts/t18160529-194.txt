            . I am a shoe-maker
; I have a shop at No. 10, Little Turnstile, Holborn


. I lost these things on the 8th of May, in the morning, at about three o'clock. The shop was secured the over night; I did not live over it. I was alarmed about three o'clock, and on going to my shop, missed the greater part of my property. The padlock and staple had been forced. After that, I went to St. Ann's watchhouse, where the prisoner was in custody; I saw some boots there, which were my property.

            . I am a watchman. On the 8th of May, about three o'clock in the morning, I perceived the prisoner coming down Little Compton-street; I was with another watchman. We had a suspicion of the prisoner, and in consequence stopped him; he had a bundle in his right hand, which contained a parcel of boots and shoes, to which the prosecutor swears. He ran away when we took the property from him, but we afterwards secured him.

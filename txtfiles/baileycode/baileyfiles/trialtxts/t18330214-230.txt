             (Police-constable N 139). I was in the Green-lanes on the 2nd of February; I stopped the prisoner with a bundle, and asked him what he had got - he said he did not know; I asked where he was going to take it - he said to Mr. Clifton, salesman, Newgate-market, and he had brought it from Mr. Mattherson's, at Enfield, where he said he was ostler, and had been so four months; I took him - in going to the station he jumped away; I jumped after him - I fell down, and lost him; he was taken on Wednesday evening.
CATHERINE WHITAKER. These are my things; I lived at Mr. Mattherson's - the prisoner did not live there, but was-post boy
 at Mr. Ryder's, and used to come there every night, and go back every morning.
Prisoner's Defence. A young man overtook me with this bundle, and asked if I was going to London; I said I was - he asked me to take this to the Peacock, at Islington for him; he said, "I live at the George Inn, Enfield"- I said, "I do not think you do; I was there five or six months ago, and you did not live there then" - he said that person was gone away, and he said, "If you will take it, I will give you sixpence;" I said I should be stopped, and so I was.

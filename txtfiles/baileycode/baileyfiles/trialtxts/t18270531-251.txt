I am foreman at these premises - I saw the prisoner lurking about there for about twenty minutes - I afterwards met him with an apron, with these tools covered with shavings - I watched him for a mile, and every turning he came to he made a bolt to run - I at last collared him, and brought him back; the prosecutor claimed the tools.

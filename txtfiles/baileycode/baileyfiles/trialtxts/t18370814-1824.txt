ELEANOR PHIPPS
. I am the wife of John Phipps, an attorney's clerk, living in a street in the Whitechapel-road. On the 8th of July, I was in Whitechapel—I found a hand in my pocket where I had a purse containing tills money—I accused the prisoner of having taken it, as I missed it—she

denied it, and then she said if I would go into the road she would give it me—she then called to one of the fishwomen, but she did not come—she went on to Osborne, street, and then got away—I saw her throw some—thing to one of the women—I had my money safe about three minutes before she came up—I have not the slightest doubt about her being the person.





EDWARD DAVIES
. I was present on this occasion—I saw the prisoner trying to get away from the prosecutrix—she gave her several blows on the arms and got from her and run off—I pursued and gave her in charge.

Prisoner. I was going along, and this lad came and said I had robbed a woman, and I was taken back, but I had not seen this woman before—I know nothing of it—at the watch-house she said it was 9s. 6d.—she was tipsy at the time.





JAMES TESTER
. I am constable of the night—I produce this certificate of the prisoner's former conviction from Mr. Clark's office (read)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY

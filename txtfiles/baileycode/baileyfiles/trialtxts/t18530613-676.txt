JOHN CLARKE



, stealing 1 handkerchief, value 5s.; the goods of 



William Shepherd, from his person.






WILLIAM SHEPHERD
. I am a grocer, of Whitechapel. On 20th May I was on Tower-hill, looking at some pensioners being drilled—Nash spoke to me—I put my hand in my pocket and missed my handkerchief, which I had in my pocket not a minute before.





RICHARD WEDD NASH
. I am a carman, living at No. 4, Old George-street, Bermondsey. I was on Tower-hill with my horse and cart, and saw the prisoner, who I knew, having often seen him before, take a white pocket handkerchief out of Mr. Shepherd's pocket and pass it to another man—I told Mr. Shepherd, followed the prisoner, and pointed him out to a policeman—I am sure he is the man—since then I met the man who took the handkerchief; he saw me, and ran away.





JOSEPH BRAY
 (policeman, H 49). I took the prisoner, who was pointed out to me by Nash—he said Nash was a false-swearing man, it was not him at all—I have known the prisoner for eight or nine years in that neighbourhood.




GUILTY
. Aged 27.


It was stated by George Chitsey, an officer of Bridewell, that the prisoner had been under his charge for picking pockets nineteen times since 1840, besides once for assaulting the police.





Transported for Ten Years.

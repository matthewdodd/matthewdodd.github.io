            . I am an ironmonger, and live in Bury-street, Bloomsbury. On the 5th of May I met the prisoner in Bury-street, with an umbrella and a hat -I stopped him - Mr. Molineux came up and claimed them; he was taken into custody - he wanted me to go up the street, and said he would point out the person who gave them to him.

            . I am a coach-wheelwright
, and live in Little Russell-street


; I came up while Mr. Todd had hold of the prisoner, who was scuffling to get away -I knew the hat and umbrella immediately, and gave him in charge; I had seen them in my passage half an hour before - my house is two hundred yards from where he was taken.

            . I live at No. 19, Lawrence Pountney-lane. On the 26th of July, about seven o'clock in the evening I was in the City-road, near the vinegar-yard


 - I had a silk handkerchief in my outside pocket: I felt Bennett's hand in my pocket. I turned round, and laid hold of him; I saw Grady close behind him, and the handkerchief was on his breast, as if it had been thrown from one to the other. My brother and myself secured them both.

            . I was with my brother and heard him call out. I turned round, and saw him attempting to secure the prisoners, and take the handkerchief.

            . I am a fishmonger, and live in the City-road. I saw a crowd, and went to see what was the matter, and Mr. Saunders told me he wanted an officer; I took the prisoners into my shop, and sent for a constable - I took the handkerchief till the officer came, and then gave it to him.

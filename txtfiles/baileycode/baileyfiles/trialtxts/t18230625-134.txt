            . I am a solicitor
, and live in Hampton-street, Gray's Inn-road. I was at the fire in Featherstone-buildings


, between ten and eleven o'clock, and had my pocket picked of my pocket-book, but did not miss it till I got to my chambers. The officer brought it to me next day.

            . I am a constable. I was at the fire, and do not recollect seeing Mr. Butt; but saw the prisoner with another man, in the thickest of the mob, in the act of picking pockets. I observed him for quarter of an hour, followed him out of the mob, seized him, and told him I had seen him take a pocket-book out of a gentleman's pocket, which I had; but cannot say who the gentleman was. I found this pocket-book in his left hand pocket, with Mr. Butt's address in it - he said he picked it up.

             was indicted for

            . My husband is named Thomas, we live in Brown's Gardens, near Monmouth-street, the sign of the Bull and Butcher, a public house


. On Good-Friday, at night, our house was broke open; I was up at twelve, all was safe then, and went to bed; when I got up at eight, I found the cellar door unbolted, and the things mentioned in the indictment missing, (mentioning them by name.) About three weeks after, I,

            , and 
               
                  Ann 
                  Cox 
               



            , went to take a little walk in the fields; the prisoner and his wife were sitting on a bank, (she had used our house for about a fortnight every day) I spoke to them in a familiar manner; she had her child at her breast, she shewed me its face, it having had the small pox. I observed, as she turned by the cardinal, it was mine; I took hold of her, and charged her with the robbery; she and her husband denied it; they said they would go and shew me where they bought the cloak; when we came near St. Giles's church, the man ran away as hard as he could; we brought his wife home to our house, then we went to Justice Fielding; she said her husband gave her the cardinal; after that the prisoner was taken up for much such another fact; I went to him in New Prison, there he told me one of my gowns was at Mr. Pain's in Bow-street, the other at Mr. Burch's in Fox-Court, but the last could not be found. I asked him how he got into the house? he said he got in at one o'clock, the devil put it into his head; and he lifted up the flap of the door, where the beer goes down, and got in, it was not very strong. it might easily be open'd with a chissel; when he was in the cellar he could easily get up into the house. (I found the till, in which the money was, on the floor.) He owned he took the things out of the house. (A gown and cardinal produced and deposed to.)

            . I am servant to Mr. Pain; to the best of my knowledge the prisoner at the bar pledged this gown with me, it was in the name of

             confirmed that of seeing the prisoner's wife in the field with the cardinal on, and hearing the prisoner own he did the robbery.

That very Saturday morning I got up a little before four, to go to work over the water, at the brick-fields at Newington. I went to ease myself under one of the arches in the old ruins, there I found these things tied up together in a bundle.

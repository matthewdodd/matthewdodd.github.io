            , a pawnbroker
. On the 23rd of November the prisoner came into his shop while the lad was busy taking down articles, and folding them up on the counter - I was busy at the end of the counter; I turned, and saw the prisoner -I said, "What do you want?" she said, "Do you take in beads?" I said Yes - she said, "I will go, and fetch them;" I had seen her two or three times in the course of the day, and suspected her - I looked through the window, and saw something under her pinafore; I sent the lad to bring her back, and found this fifteen yards of shirting under her pinafore - she told me a woman had given it her to pawn for 1s.; I know it to be my employer's property.

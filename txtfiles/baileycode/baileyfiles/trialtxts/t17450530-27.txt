            . I am a barber and perriwig maker






, I keep a shop at the corner of the Bell Inn, in the Hay Market


; and a boy lies in the shop: but my house is in Panton Street. About two or three years ago, upon a Sunday evening my apprentice came home fuddled; the shop was broke open and robbed, and he was found lying upon the bed drunk, and his buckles taken out of his shoes, and the hat off his head, and the goods mentioned in the indictment were lost. One opera night, a chairman came to me, and asked me for something for bringing home my boy; said I, I suppose you are the man that robbed the shop; if you want any thing, here is a broomstick for you, that is the best way of paying you, I have paid enough already. About a fortnight or three weeks before last sessions, some gentlemen came, and asked me what I was robbed of, I told them, and went to Sir 
               
                  Thomas 
                  De Veil 
               



            , and gave him an account what I was robbed of.
Q. What gentlemen were they, that came to enquire of you?
Anthone. I can't tell.
Simms. They are thief takers, my Lord: pray did you ever see me?
Anthone. I never saw you. You sent to me to desire me to make it a single felony.

            . About three years ago, I was pretty much in liquor, and two men, as they told me, brought me home in a chair. The next morning about four o'clock, I awaked, and I found my self upon the bed in my clothes, and the boxes all about the shop, the shop was broke open and my master was robbed of nine wigs and a coat; and I lost a coat and waistcoat, a pair of breeches and a hat.

             by a Constable of Covent Garden parish, for an assault which he had committed the night before, in the house of one Mrs. Coggin: That upon examination it appeared, he had broke out of New Prison Clerkenwell the same night; and it being fully proved upon him, he then desired to speak to Sir Thomas and his clerk in private, for he could make large discoveries: upon which Sir Thomas told him, he would hear what he had to say, and therefore desired all the people to withdraw, which they accordingly did. That Sir Thomas advised him to be very cautious what he was doing, for if he declared any false thing it would turn upon himself. That he took his information, which was made voluntarily, and without any promise of pardon or reward, and then Sir Thomas swore him to it: t hat after he had taken his information, which he signed voluntarily, he took his confession, which was also signed freely and voluntarily.

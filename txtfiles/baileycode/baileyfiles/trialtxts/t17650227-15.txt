 in Turnmill-street, Clerkenwell


: the prisoners went into her shop together; one of them pulled off his coat, and wanted eighteen pence on it, on the first of this instant February, at seven at night. They were observed to be looking at a cloak under a lamp, about an hundred yards from the shop: a cardinal was missing, they were taken with it. (Produced, and deposed to.)

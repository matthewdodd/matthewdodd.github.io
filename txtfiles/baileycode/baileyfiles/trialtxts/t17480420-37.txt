            . The Prisoner came into my master's shop about ten in the morning, and asked for some check; she took this piece of long lawn off the counter; I saw the ticket of the piece of lawn hang lower than her cloak, and I took it from her; she had the piece under her arm, and held it pretty tight.
Prisoner. I am a stranger here, I am a Norwich woman, and for the sake of my poor children I desire you would have mercy upon me.

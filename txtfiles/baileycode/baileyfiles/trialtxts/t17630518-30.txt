. On Saturday was se'nnight the prisoner came and asked for work, I set her to mending some stockings; I had then my spoon in my drawer, and when I went to look for it at dinner time it was gone; I charged the prisoner with taking it; she denied it, and stripped herself naked, but I did not particularly examine her cloaths; she staid till night, then she went away; I did not see her till the Monday night, when the spoo n was stopt.

            . The prisoner came to me on that Saturday night between 9 and 10 o'clock, and offered to sell this spoon (producing it) for 6 s. I thought she stole it, it being worth more money; I stopt her, and put her in the Round-house; on the Monday she owned before the Justice she took it from Mrs. Turner. (Produced and deposed to.)

She lent me the spoon to make away with, because her husband was short of money.

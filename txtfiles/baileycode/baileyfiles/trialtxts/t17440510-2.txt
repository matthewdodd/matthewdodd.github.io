            . I had put this linen into a pan ready for ironing, and set it upon the counter; I heard somebody come into the shop, and run out again; I went into the shop, and missing the linen, run out, and cried I was robbed; upon which

            . I was looking out at a one pair of stairs window, and heard my aunt cry she was robbed, and somebody said here is a boy with a bundle of linen. I went up to him, and he laid the bundle down and run away, I run after him, and took him, and he called out several times for his case of pistols to shoot me; whether he had any gang with him I cannot tell, but I saw nobody but himself; it was pretty dark, I believe it was between eight and nine in the evening.

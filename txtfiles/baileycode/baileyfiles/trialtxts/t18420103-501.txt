JOSEPH HENRY GREENSLADE
. I am servant to William Underwood, a woollen-draper, No. 151, Oxford-street—I know the prisoner's person—he came to our shop on the 28th of December, and brought this written note—I delivered it to Mr. Underwood, who opened it, and. a pattern of new cloth was enclosed—I did up 2 3/4 yds. of cloth in a parcel, gave it to the prisoner, and he went away with it—I am sure he is the person—(read)—" 125, Oxford-street. C. Haes Kell would feel obliged if Messrs.

Underwood would send by bearer, or immediately, 2 3/4 yds. of fine ladies' cloth to match pattern, C. A. not having it by him;—he will send the money this afternoon."





CHARLES JOHN HAES KELL
. I did not send the prisoner with this note to get the articles mentioned in it—I do not know him at all—it purports to be signed by me—it is not my writing, nor was it written by my authority—I never had the goods.

Prisoner's Defence. I have been out of work some time—the notes were offered to me to deliver—I was to receive payment for them, which I did.

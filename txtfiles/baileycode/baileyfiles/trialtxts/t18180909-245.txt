             Carter's brother; he is a butcher
, and lives in Gray's-inn-lane-road. On the 31st of July I was coming up stairs when the officer brought the prisoners and the umbrella in, which was safe in the shop just before.

            . I am a constable. I watched the prisoners through Pentonville and Somers'-town and back again. Their conduct excited my suspicion. I saw Mason go into Carter's shop. Cluff stood close by. He came out in about three minutes with the umbrella, and went up to Cluff. Taylor and I secured them.


                  GEORGE 
                  TAYLOR
               



            . I was with Cadby. We watched the prisoners in company together for an hour. Mason went in and brought the umbrella out. We took them.

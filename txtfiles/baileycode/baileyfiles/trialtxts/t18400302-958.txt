CHARLES SMITH
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
2nd of March, 1 waistcoat, value 4s., the goods of 



Thomas William Bluett.






FRANCIS GODDEN BLUETT
. I live in Brewer-street. I saw this waist-cost safe on the 2nd of March, about two o'clock in the afternoon—I was told it was stolen, and I went, by direction of the witness, about ten doors up the street, and overtook the prisoner—I told him he had got a waist-cost of ours—he said he had not, and he opened his coat to show me—I brought him back, and this waistcoat was given out of a shop.

Cross-examined by
MR. PAYNE. Q. It is your brother's waistcoat, is is not? A. Yes—his name is Thomas William Bluett—the prisoner came back easily with me—I was nearer to him than the other witness, but I did not see him throw away the waistcoat.





JAMES VENN
. I live in Brewer-street, Somers'-town. About a quarter to three o'clock, on the 2nd of March, I was standing at our shop-door, and saw the prisoner and another go to the prosecutor's, which is nearly opposite—the prisoner took the waistcoat, put it under his coat, and went off—I went and told of it—the witness went after him, and just before he got to him I saw the prisoner take the waistcoat from under his coat and throw it into a grocer's shop—I saw that it was a green waistcoat—I am sure the prisoner is the person—the grocer's young man gave the prosecutor the waistcoat.

Cross-examined. Q. How far were you from him when you saw him? A. On the opposite side—the street is about thirty yards wide—the other person who was with the prisoner walked the other way—my master is a clothes-salesman.





ROBERT ECCLES
 (police-constable S 73.) I took the prisoner, and received the waistcoat from the prosecutor—the prisoner said he knew nothing about it.

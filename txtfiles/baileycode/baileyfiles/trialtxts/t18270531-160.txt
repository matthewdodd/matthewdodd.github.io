GEORGE CHALTON ELDERTON. I am master of the Endeavour of Shields
. On the 16th of May, I went into the Coach and Horses public-house, Shadwell


; I was not quite sober, but am sure I had my watch; I laid my head on the table, being fatigued - I had more drink there, and fell asleep; when I awoke, I found the prisoner fawning about me, and felt her draw the watch out of my pocket - I did not see it in her hand; she ran out before I could get round the table; an officer was sent for who took her.

            . I was at the Coach and Horses, I saw the prisoner take the watch, and run off with it.

            . I am a beadle. I was sent for, and received information; the prisoner came into the Coach and Horses about an hour after - I took her and searched her, she said, "Don't be indelicate" - I made her loosen her clothes; 9s. 6d. was found in her bosom; she said at the watch-house, that she had taken the watch to the North Pole public-house, and given it to one Ryan for this 9s. 6d.; she was quite sober.
Prisoner's Defence. It was my own money.

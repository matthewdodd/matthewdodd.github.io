            . On the 25th of March, I was at the top of Provost-street, City-road


, with my mother. The prisoner looked me in the face, and snatched the veil off my bonnett-it was fastened - He tore it away. I am sure he is the man. We ran after him - He was secured before we lost sight of him; he was removing it from his bosom to his hat when he was taken.

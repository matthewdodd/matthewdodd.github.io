. I went to the Round-house, and ask'd the Prisoner about it, and he beg'd for mercy; and the Justice was so good as to offer him favour on condition of his going into some garrison abroad, and he consenting. a serjeant was sent for, but the Prisoner proving to be an Irishman, he was refus'd.
Prisoner. I was coming from Tottenham-court, and went into a passage, and saw the pipe at my feet.

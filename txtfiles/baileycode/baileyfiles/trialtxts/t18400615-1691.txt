1691. 




CHARLES WATSON
was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
8th of June, 1 necklace, value 5s., the goods of 



William Hawtin, from the person of 



Elizabeth Hawtin the younger.






ELIZABETH HAWTIN.
I am nine years old—I go to church, and know the necessity of speaking the truth. On the 8th of June, I was in a street near Finsbury-square, drawing a chaise, with a little boy and girl in it—I had a necklace on—I saw the prisoner—he came and tied a string round my waist, and tied me to the chaise—I thought he was at play with me—he then took my necklace off and ran away—he was taken directly.





GEORGE YOUNG.
I live in Finsbury Market. One of the neighbours gave an alarm, I ran out and pursued the prisoner about one hundred yards—I took him—I cannot tell what became of the necklace—it is lost altogether.





ELIZABETH HAWTIN.
I am the wife of William Hawtin. The witness is my daughter—I sent her out with a coral necklace on of four rows of beads—it is quite lost.




GUILTY.*Aged 15.—

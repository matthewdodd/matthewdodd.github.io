ROBERT TAYLOR. I am servant
 to Matthew Robinson, Esq., of Dulwich. On the 23rd of March my great coat was lost - I missed it when I got up behind the carriage; I had seen it ten minutes before - it is now in Court.

            . My father is an officer. I was near Regent-street


, and saw the prisoner put his foot on the step of the carriage, and take the coat; he went a little way, and tried to put it on, but dropped it - a soldier picked it up; I followed him till I saw him stopped.

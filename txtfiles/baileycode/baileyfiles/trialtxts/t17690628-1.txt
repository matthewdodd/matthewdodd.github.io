            . I live in Thames-street, opposite St. Dunstan's-hill


. Last Saturday seven-night in the morning, as I was standing at my door, talking to a captain of a vessel, Mr. Emes told me my pocket was picked. I felt and missed my handkerchief. He had stopped the prisoner. My handkerchief was found on the ground, about two or three yards from my door.

            . I was going along Thames-street and saw the prisoner take a handkerchief out of the prosecutor's pocket. I seized him, and called to the prosecutor. The prisoner dropped the handkerchief behind him; and the prosecutor came and took it up. (Produced and deposed to by the prosecutor.) The prisoner was endeavouring to hide it under his waistcoat.

It was another boy that took it. I saw him drop it. He got off, and they directly laid hold of me. I was going about my business.

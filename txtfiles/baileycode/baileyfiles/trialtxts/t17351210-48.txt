            , were indicted with

            , not yet taken, for 


               stealing three Gowns, three Petticoats, a Camblet Cloak, a Jacket, two Shirts, four Shifts, and an Apron, the Goods of 
                     
                        
                           Sarah

            , November 19

                     Weston 
                  



                
            , was indicted for 


               receiving four Shifts, and one Shirt, part of the said Goods, knowing them to be stolen
            .


                  Sarah 
                  Ackers 
               



            . At five in the Evening, I locked my Stair Foot Door (but not the Street Door) and went over the way. I returned about six, and found my Stair Foot Door open, and a Gown upon the Stairs. Coming into my Room I mist my Goods, and found a Man's Hat upon the Floor. I was informed that Sarah Miller (who buys and sells in Rag Fair) had pawned such Goods as I had lost. I met with her, and she told me she had them from Belmosset, and Sears. I found some of them pawned at Mr. Martins, against White Chappel Church. Some she sold to the Prisoner Weston. The Constable went with a Warrant to search for the rest, at the three Blue Balls in Mansell Street in Goodman's Fields, but the Pawn-broker would not let him search.

                  Robert 
                  Sears 
               



            , and 
               
                  Jane 
                  Stone 
               



            , came into Well-street, Rag-Fair, at seven or eight at Night, and desired me to sell these Goods. It was too late to sell them, and so Belmosset gave me and Jane Stone a Shilling a-piece to pawn them. I sold four Shifts and a Shirt for four Shillings, to he Prisoner 
               
                  Mary 
                  Weston 
               



            , who keeps a Lodging House. Some I pawned at Martins, and 
               
                  Jane 
                  Stone 
               



             pawned the rest at 
               
                  Peter 
                  Harrison 
               



            's - I think his Name is Peter - a Pawn-broker by the New Play-house in Goodman's Fields - He would not let us search for them - afterwards, though we had Justice Farmer's Warrant. *

            , above
Mr. Brain. I took Miller and Belmosset. He drew a Knife upon me, and swore D - his Blood he would not go with me - I told him he was charged with breaking open a House in Wapping. He said I need not tell him that, for he knew what it was for.

            . I had a Warrant against Sears, and - Orchard, for another Fact, and they were carried before Justice Farmer, but no body appearing to prosecute, they were discharged. But this House being robbed, the Justice sent me to enquire for these Men, and 
               
                  Martha 
                  Weston 
               



             - I happened to see Belmosset just as Mr. Brain had seized him, and so I assisted to secure him. He swore D - him he had nothing of the Goods, but an old Cloak, and a Shilling. We went to Martin the Pawn-broker, and he readily shewed us what Goods he had. But Harrison refused to let us search, though we had a Warrant; and he told us, if the Justice himself was to come he should not search his House.
Belmosset was found 


               guilty to the value of 4 s. 10 d.
             but Stone and Wheston were 

               acquitted
            .

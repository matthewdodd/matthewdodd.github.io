JOHN WILLS
. I am a hosier, and live in Oxford-street. On the 23rd of May, between five and six o'clock, the prisoner came to my shop—my shopman showed him some silk handkerchiefs—1 saw him put three into his pocket—I detained him in conversation while I sent for a policeman, who searched him, and found these three in his coat pocket-they have my own handwriting on them.

Prisoner. I took out my own handkerchief, and it dropped on the counter—I took up these with it without knowing that I had them. Witness. My shopman gave me information, and I stood at my counting-housedoor, and saw him take his handkerchief, and lay it over my goods—1 then held up another, and blinded my shopman; and then took his own up, and these three with it.





WILLIAM PICKFORD
 (police-constable E 25.) I found these handkechiefs in the prisoner's great coat pocket with this other one.

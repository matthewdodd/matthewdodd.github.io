            . I am a hatter
, and live at Islington


. On the 16th of October, about a quarter past eight o'clock in the evening, I went into the parlour adjoining the shop, and heard the screams of my boy - I ran into the shop, found the door open, and my boy gone out; I went out - he said a fellow had run into the shop and took two hats off the shelf. I ran up Park-street, and saw the prisoner turn the corner, running at full speed, I cried Stop thief! - he was stopped - I collared him and brought him back.

            . I am eleven years old. I was sitting in the shop - the prisoner came in and took two hats off the shelf, ran out, and threw one into the road - I jumped into the road and picked it up; my master came out and followed him calling Stop thief! a gentleman stopped him. I am sure he is the boy.

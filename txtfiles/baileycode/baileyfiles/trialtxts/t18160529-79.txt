                  POTTINGER
               



            . I lost my watch between four and five o'clock in the afternoon of the 17th of May, at the Grapes, at the corner of Round-court, St. Martin's-le-grand


. I called for a glass of liquor, and the prisoner got me round the waist, and would not let me go until she got my watch out of my pocket. I did not feel her take it. I never gave her the watch to go with her because I had no money.

            . I wait in the bar at the Grapes. The prisoner came in, and began talking to the prosecutor, and he bid her be off, and keep her own company, for he was very ill, and not in a fit state to talk to her; and she immediately pulled up his frock, and said she would feel for some halfpence.

            . I had a description of the prisoner, and apprehended her. I accused her of stealing the watch, and she said, it was underneath the step of the door, where there was a gully hole. I took her there, and she put in her hand, and pulled it out, and gave it to me.

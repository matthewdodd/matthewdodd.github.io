            . I lost the things mentioned in the indictment on the 13th of Sept. where I lodged in Harp-alley


. I found the gown at a pawn broker's and the handkerchief and stockings the prisoner had got on when taken.
Q. How came you to take the prisoner up?
Crookshanks. He desired I would let him be in my room till mistress came home, (I had known him some time.) I went down and left him alone for about an hour, when I came up again, he and these things out of the drawer were missing.

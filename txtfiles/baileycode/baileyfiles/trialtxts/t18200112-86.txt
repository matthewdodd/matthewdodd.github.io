            . I am in partnership with 
               
                  Aaron 
                  Sammell

            ; we are wholesale shoe manufactures and leather-dressers


, and live in Hatton-garden


; the prisoner was our servant
. On the 30th of December I had information that a piece of linen had been offered for sale, and saw it at Jobbins's - it belonged to a box of sixty pieces, which was in the front warehouse. I sent for Limbric, who took the prisoner in charge - she had lived about four years with us as cook, and had no business in the warehouse, but she could get there. I saw duplicates of other property found on her - it was principally linen. She said the property pledged in the duplicates were her master's.

            . I am a baker. A piece of linen was left at my house with my wife, who is not able to attend. I know the prisoner.

            . I am an officer. I apprehended the prisoner, examined her, and found a great quantity of duplicates on her - a great many were for linen; she begged for mercy, and said she would not tell what induced her to do it; that she pledged the things herself, and they were her master's. Jobbins gave me some linen, which she said she took from her master.

            . I am a pawnbroker, and live in Fleet-market. I have some linen, wearing apparel, and a pair of shoes, which were pledged at different times, by a woman, named Hewitt, No. 34, Cursitor-street - they were pledged on the 25th of March, the 10th of June, and the 20th of July. The prisoner has pledged things at our house. I cannot say she pledged these things - the duplicates are mine.

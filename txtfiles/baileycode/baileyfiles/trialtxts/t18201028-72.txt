. On the 30th of September, about three o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came to my shop with another woman. I came home, and found them there; I suspected them, and went after them; I brought them both back, and charged them with stealing two pair of shoes and a pair of boots - the prisoner ran into a public-house, and was taken.

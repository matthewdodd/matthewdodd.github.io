1649. 




GEORGE PEARCE
 was indicted

 for stealing 1 handkerchief, value 2s. 6d., the property of 



William Coulter, from his person; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






WILLIAM COULTER.
 I live in Davis-street, Berkley-square, and am a carpenter—about nine o'clock on Saturday night, the 3rd of July, I was in Oxford-street—I missed my handkerchief—I walked towards my home about a hundred yards—I then came back and saw the prisoner and two others—I watched them for some time—I then went to Marylebone station, and got an officer—he took the three persons—my handkerchief was found on the prisoner—this now produced is it—it was about nine o'clock when I lost it—it was found on the prisoner in seven or eight minutes.






GEORGE THORNTON
 (police-constable D 109.) I took the prisoner to the station—between his trowsers and his thighs I found this handkerchief—the prosecutor said it was not his—I put my hand in another part of his trowsers and found this other handkerchief—neither of these are the prosecutor's—I put my hand between his legs and found this handkerchief, which is the prosecutor's—I then put my hand in his pocket and found this other handkerchief.

Prisoner's Defence. I met a man who asked me to buy a handkerchief—I gave him 2s. for it—I then gave him 7s. for these other three hankerchiefs.





JESSE JEAPES
 (police-constable C, 146.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction at Clerkenwell by the name of John Davies—read—(Convicted 18th August, 1846, and confined six months)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY.†* Aged 20.—


Transported for Seven Years.

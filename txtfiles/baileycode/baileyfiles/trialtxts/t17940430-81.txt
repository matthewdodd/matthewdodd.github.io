She came to me about the 14th of November, as near as I can recollect.
Q. Did she always keep the key of her own bed-room? - Yes; I had missed the coat that is now upon my back, and there were some drawers kept in that room which she laid in, and I found the coat in the room; I put the coat on my back and thought no more of it; she goes to bed that night, I heard her unlocking the door, and going into the room, and shutting the door of her own own room, in the morning when I came to call her, I found no answer, I run into my own room, and says to my wife, I cannot make the girl hear; her room door was left a jar; I then goes into the room, when I came into the room, fromthese drawers which I had locked in the day before, all the things were gone; the articles in the indictment are only what was found again, but there were other things gone, which were never found; the Monday morning, the 30th of December, I went to Bow-street, and gave information to the office; the clerk of the office advised me to have same hand bills printed, and carried round to the pawnbrokers, and said that the expence would be seventeen shillings and sixpence, I had them printed. On the 24th of last April, I happened to meet the prisoner accidentally in the street.
Q. Did you find the prisoner before you traced any of your things? - I did. I met her in Monmouth-street carrying some liquor, she lived then at the Yorkshire Grey, in Little White Lion-street, Seven Dials; a public house; when I met her, I followed her up to the door and asked her, where do you live now? she made answer and said, who are you? I said I will go home with you; she said she would not go home; I then took her to Bow-street, and there she denied that she knew me, or any thing of me; I I went home, and my wife came, and two or three of the customers, and they knew her likewise; there was some of the property on her when she was searched. a handkerchief about her neck.
Q. Was it a silk handkerchief or a muslin? - I am not a judge, but the property is in court.
Mrs. Thomas. It is a muslin handkerchief
Q. To Mr. Thomas. Was any thing else found on her besides this muslin handkerchief? - Not of my property.
Q. She lived with you some time; have you any doubt at all about her person? - Not the least at all; for the other things there is a person that the magistrates thought proper to commit as a receiver, but we could not get the indictment this sessions.

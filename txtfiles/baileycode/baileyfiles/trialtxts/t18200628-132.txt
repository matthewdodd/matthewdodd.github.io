            . I lodge at the Nag's Head, in Carnaby-market


, and am a tailor
. On the 13th of June the prisoner came and took a bed for the night - he slept in the same room with me and went to bed first. When I went to bed I had 17 s. 6 d. in my pocket, and a new pair of breeches laid on the table. A soldier, who slept with the prisoner, awoke me about five o'clock, and asked me if I knew when the man went away? I said No, and immediately missed my money and the breeches. A few days afterwards I saw him in custody; he offered me a silver watch and other things if I would let him go - I refused.

            . The prisoner slept with me on the night of the robbery - I am certain of his person. I missed him at five o'clock. There was nobody else in the room.

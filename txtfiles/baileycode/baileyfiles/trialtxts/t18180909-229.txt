             JOHNSON. I am servant to his Grace the Duke of Gordon. On the 3d of July, I found the lead cut off the roof of the water-closet adjoining Park-lane


, it was wrapped up in an apron, and put in the water-closet.

            . I am a watchman. About a quarter after four o'clock in the morning, I was in Park-lane, under the Duke of Gordon's wall, and heard somebody moving; I looked up and saw the prisoner - I asked who was there? he made no reply, but went away whistling in a low tone. I sprung my rattle, the patrol came to my assistance; he got into Green-street, and concealed himself behind a doorpost. I took the prisoner and put him in the watch-house. I returned to the premises, and saw the lead cut off, but could not find it; it was taken off the roof of the water-closet, and put inside, rolled up in an apron. The prisoner was just by the water-closet-door, and looking over the wall when I saw him. I am sure he is the man.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I was returning from Chelsea, stopped to tie my shoe up, and was taken.

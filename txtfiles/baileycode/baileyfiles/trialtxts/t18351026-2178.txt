 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
25th of September, 1 coat, value 30s., the goods of

John Trevett.






WILLIAM COWDEROY
. I am a coach-proprietor. I borrowed a great coat of Mr. Trevett, on the 24th of September, at nine o'clock in the evening, when I met him in the Edgeware-road—I returned that evening about eleven o'clock, and left it in the chaise in my coach-house—the prisoner was a servant on the premises—the next morning I sent my female servant down, and the coat was gone—the premises was the first to come there in the morning—he always came before the other men—I accused one man and then another as the thief.





JOHN TRAVETT
. This is my coat. I lent it to last witness.





GEORGE BROWN
 (police-constable D 90.) The prisoner was given into my custody. I found five duplicates on him—one referred to this coat.





JAMES REARDON
. I am a pawnbroker. I produce the coat—I do not know who took it in, but this is the counter duplicate—it tallies exactly.

Prisoner's Defence. I picked up the duplicates in Chapel-street, Edgeware-road,

on the Saturday before I was taken—I meant to have gone to the pawnbroker with it, when I was taken.




GUILTY
. Aged 42.—


Transported for seven years. There were two other indictments against the prisoner.

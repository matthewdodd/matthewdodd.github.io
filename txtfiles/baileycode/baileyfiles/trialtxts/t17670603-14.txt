                  , in a certain boat on the river Thames, kept for preserving of fish
            , the property of

            . I sell fish by commission
, for Mr. Cole of Ely; he sends me up eels, pike, and perch; I live by London-bridge water-works


; we have a well-boat there all the year round, we call it a store-boat, with four wells in it; it lies always there, and they are locked down with great locks, and when any gentlemen or fishmonger want any fish, we supply them; sometimes we have two thousand weight of eels, sometimes seven or eight hundred jacks; as there is a demand in London I send word, and they send up what is wanted. On the 3d of May, between five and six in the morning, I went and found she was taken away from the great chain she was fastened to; she was found a little above Black-friars bridge, with every well broke open; she was brought to me on the Sunday morning about nine o'clock; I took out what eels were left, and ordered the boat to be mended. I think the four well hinges were taken off, and some of the staples drawn; I believe fish were taken out of every well; as nigh as we can guess, there were about 130 pounds of eels taken out; they were safe in the boat between nine and ten o'clock on Saturday night; we sold fish out of her from morning till dinner time that day; I went to Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            , and asked the clerk what method I should take to find the people out: when I came home, I heard a young fellow named Elliot, in White-street, should say he saw two men with a large quantity of eels, about four or five o'clock on Sunday morning; I went to see for them, and met Harris on London-bridge (I had been told their names were Harris and Saunders;) I was not sure Harris was one of them; I passed him, and went on to White-street, but did not meet with them: I took Harris on St. Margaret's-hill on the Tuesday; he openly confessed to me he filed the lock, while Saunders towed away with the boat; he owned they took the eels out, and hoped I would not send him to goal; I told him I would do him all the justice I could; he directed me to Saunders, and I took him in bed about two hours after, in Kent-street; Saunders confessed he helped to break open the wells, and take the eels, and some they sold, and some they gave away, and some they eat, they both confessed the same; I never got any of them again.

                  Elliot 
               



            . I saw the prisoner at Mr. Jones's, the Falcon in White-street, on the other side the water, on a Saturday night; they went out about twelve o'clock at night, and said they were going to work (they were strangers to me.) On the Sunday morning they came into the room where I lay, between three and four o'clock, with a basket full of eels; I looked at them, and said they were Dutch eels; they said, no, they were river eels, and they caught them last night; I said, I imagine you have been foul on some Dutch boat's stern and cut them away; I said, I should be obliged to them for one for my breakfast; they gave me one, and I eat it; I told Mr. Fenn of it, and said, I did not believe they came honestly by them.

            . The two prisoners lodged at my house, the Falcon in White-street; they used to tell my wife to call them up at eleven o'clock; they used to catch flounders. They went out on that Saturday night about twelve o'clock, and about five on the Sunday morning they came and knocked hard at the door; I went down and opened it; they had a long basket; they brought it in very heavy; I saw some eels in it.

            . I am a constable. Mr. Fenn desired I would go along with him to see if we could take the two prisoners; we took Harris; he acknowledged he and Saunders were concerned in taking the eels; he said they had taken away the well-boat, and towed her up to Black-friars bridge; he said there were two watermen, that they did not know with whom they left the boat; he desired we would go and take Saunders, saying he was to be found in Kent-street; we went to the house he mentioned, and took him out of bed; when we got him to Mr. Fenn's, he confessed the same as Harris had done.

            . I am servant to Mr. Fenn. In the evening between the 2d and 3d of May, the well-boat was taken from her moorings; when I found her the next day between eight and nine, her wells were broke open, the hinges were ripped from the well heads; there were eels taken out, but I know not by who; I found her just above Black-friars bridge, hauled in between two lighters and made fast.

            . I heard Harris say he filed the lock and broke the bulk head, while Saunders towed her up.
Harris's defence.
I know nothing of it; I bought the eels and paid for them, of a young man that was going to the salt water, and then I went to that house; the young man asked me to give him one, and I gave him one; after that I was going to Billingsgate to buy fish, and they took me up.
Saunders said nothing in his defence.

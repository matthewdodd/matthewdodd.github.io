            . I am a wine merchant

            . I am servant to Mr. Bill; I was at the wine vault last Tuesday; I saw the door was open, and the prisoner came out of the vault. I asked him what he went there for? he said, he went there for some baskets. I saw he had some wine; I took it from him, and carried it down into the vault again. I desired a linen-draper to stop him while I returned; but when I came again, he was run away?
Q. Did you know him before?
Pulley. I never saw him before, to my knowledge; there were two bottles of white port, and four bottles of sack; after he was taken, he owned to me he did take them.
Prisoner's Defence.
I found the bottles by the side of the vault, and I was going to carry them into the cellar.

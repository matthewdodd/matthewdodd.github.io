            . I am a Bow-street patrol. I took this coat from the prisoner at a quarter before twelve o'clock at night, on the 30th of May; he was running from the carriage, and about three yards from it - I did not see him take it.
Prisoner. Q.Where did you first see me? A. At the corner of Russell-street, with four or five others - I saw a man get on the wheel, take it, and give it to you; this is the coat - I called to stop the other man.
Prisoner's Defence. I was returning home - there were seven or eight persons behind a carriage, and in a moment this coat was thrown upon my shoulder; the gentleman took me, and ran after another person, leaving me with the officer.

            . These things were taken from my lodgings; the prisoner lodged in the same room. I got up as usual at four o'clock in the morning of the 7th of March, and I know I left my things safely locked up. When I returned that morning about eight o'clock, I found the prisoner gone. I found my box broken open, and all my property was taken.

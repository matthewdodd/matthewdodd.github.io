            . I am a single-woman
; I live at No. 7, Orange-street, Liecester-fields. I lost my shawl at about half past eleven at night, on the 15th of January
, opposite to St. Clement's church in the Strand


. I met the prisoner, and he gave me a violent push, and I felt my shawl go off my shoulders; I looked round immediately, and saw the shawl in the prisoner's hand. I did not lose sight of him; he ran away, and I ran after him, and called stop thief; and Mr. Cocks stopped him.

            . I am inspector of the Bank of England. On the night of the 15th of January, at about twenty minutes before twelve, near St. Clement's church. I heard the cry of stop thief; the prisoner rushed by me, and from his manner, I thought he was the person wanted; I pursued him about twenty yards, and secured him.

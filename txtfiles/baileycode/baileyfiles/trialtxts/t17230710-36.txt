             , of St. Buttolph without Bishopsgate

               feloniously stealing 5 th of Yarn, value 12 s.
             the Goods of 
               
                  
                     Thomas

            , the 26th of May

 last, and James Saunderson for 


               receiving it, knowing it to have been stolen
            . It appear'd by the Evidence, That William Pyeman had formerly been Servant
 to Mr. Monk, and married his Maid, and that his Wife's Sister was then Servant to Mr. Monk. That he frequently coming under Pretence of seeing his Sister-in-Law, did take the Opportunity of stealing the Goods. Being suspected and examin'd, he own'd the Facts, and that he had sold the Goods to James Saunderson. And one Evidence depos'd, That Saunderson had own'd he bought the Goods of William Pyeman, but they both deny'd it at the Bar. The Fact being plainly prov'd on Pyeman, the Jury found him 


               guilty to the Value of 10 d.
            



               Transportation
            . And 

               acquitted
             Saunderson.

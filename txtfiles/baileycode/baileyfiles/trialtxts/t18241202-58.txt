JAMES WOOLLAMS. My wife is employed by Messrs. Pryor and Co. On the 18th of November, about eight o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came to our room, where I was at work, and a quarter of an hour after she was gone I missed an umbrella.

            . I am the last witness's wife. The prisoner came to our room and asked some questions about having an umbrella made; she walked up and down the room, and after she was gone, I missed an umbrella from a chair at the back part of the room. I immediately went to the pawnbroker's, and found her in a court in Long-lane, and next morning found it in pawn. She denied it.

               Mr. Blackburn
            , a pawnbroker. On the 18th of November the prisoner pawned this umbrella for 2 s., between seven and eight o'clock in the evening.

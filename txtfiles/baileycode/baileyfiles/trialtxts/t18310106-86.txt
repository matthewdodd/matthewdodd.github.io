            . I am the wife of 
               
                  George 
                  Andrew Turner
               



            , a corporal in the Life Guards

. The two prisoners came to lodge at my house on the 28th or 29th of last October; Stevens took the lodging, and said she was a dress-maker
, and Jones was her servant
 - they went away last Sunday three weeks, without notice; they would have owed me 14s., for a fortnight's rent, on the Thursday following - I went into their room on the Friday; they had locked the door, and taken the key; I then missed three blankets, a pair of sheets, and a pillow - the duplicates were left in their room; I had lent them 2s. 6d.

            . I am a pawnbroker, and live in London-street. I have two sheets, but I do not know who pawned them - I gave this duplicate, in the name of Turner for them.

                  OSBORNE
               



            . I am a Police-officer. I took the two prisoners on the 28th of December, at No. 2, Tudorplace, Tottenham-court-road - I found nothing on them; I informed Mrs. Turner I had taken the prisoners, and she gave me the duplicates.

            . I am assistant to a pawnbroker. I have three blankets and a pillow; I am not confident who pawned them, but I have seen Jones in our shop at different times - these are the duplicates given for the articles; the three blankets are in the name of Brown, and the pillow in the name of Richardson - they were pawned at different times.
ELIZA TURNER. These articles are mine - the prisoners lived together, and had one bed.
Stevens' Defence. Whatever fault I have committed, was through distress - I did not know the consequence of the law; I expected to receive some money on the 8th of this month, and it was my intention to send it to Mrs. Turner, and to go and beg her pardon: this is my sister-in-law - I have had her to support from a child: I was in distress.

               stealing, on the 28th of December

                  Rogers
               



            ; we live in Tudor-place, Tottenham-court-road



. The two prisoners came to lodge in my house on the 21st of December - Stevens took a room, she said she was a dress-maker, and kept Jones to carry out work; they had been there but one week when the officer came and took them - when he came Jones took from the mantel-piece five duplicates of my property; they both begged forgiveness, and said they had pawned them - there were one pair of sheets, a small blanket, an iron, and a pillow.

            . I am a pawnbroker. I have two sheets, but I cannot say who pawned them - I gave these duplicates.


                  WILLIAM 
                  OSBORNE
               



            . I took the prisoners - Jones laid the duplicates on the table, and I took them - they both fell on their knees, and begged forgiveness.
Stevens' Defence. We begged Mrs. Rogers to forgive us, and she said she would if the things were got out; they were not pawned with intent to defrand, but to keep us from starving - had that evening gone over I should have received two sovereigns, if not more, from a friend, to whom I had written, when I would have sent to Mrs. Turner, to see if she would forgive me; I should then have settled the rent where I was, and returned to my former lodging - I did it, because I would not submit to throw myself into the street; I always worked while I had it to do, and would do it.

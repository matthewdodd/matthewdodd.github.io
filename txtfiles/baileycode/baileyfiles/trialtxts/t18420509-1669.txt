JOHN HIGGS
. I am a shoe-maker, and live at Woolwich. On the evening of the 19th of April I heard the door open, went and found the prisoner in my shop—he asked if Mr. Porter, the tailor, lived there—and a very few minutes after he was gone I missed the boots.





WILLIAM LEECH
. I am shopman to Mr. Booth, a pawnbroker, at Woolwich. On the 19th of April the prisoner offered these boots in pawn—he said he brought them from his father—I lent him 3s. on them.





ALFRED JOHN FINN
 (police-constable R 81.) I took the prisoner at his father's house—I told him it was for stealing boots from this shop—he said there was another boy with him, his brother, and that he pawned them at Booth's.

Prisoner. The other boy stole them and gave them to me to pawn; he waited at the door; he used to go to the same school as me. 


GUILTY
. Aged 14.—


Transported for Seven Years.—Convict Ship.

             - they are tobacco-manufacturers

, and live in Whitecross-street; the prisoner was in their employ as a porter
: last Friday he came out of the warehouse - I was behind the counter and desired him to show a person some tobacco; he turned his back towards me, and I saw some tobacco in his pocket - I went to him, and said, "Christian, how can you rob your masters?" he said he did not know how it came there - he said it was the first time.

            . I am an officer. I went and took the prisoner, then went to his lodgings, and found these six dozens of cigars there; he denied the cigars, but not the tobacco - he said he bought the cigars, but did not say where.
Prisoner. The cigars do not belong to them; the tobacco I do not deny.

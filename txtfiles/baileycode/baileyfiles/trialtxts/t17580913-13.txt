             Mason. The prisoner was my servant
, she absconded, after which my wife missed the goods mentioned in the indictment. I went and took her in the afternoon, and found one of the linen gowns under a bed in the same house where I took her, she delivered a handkerchief and apron out of her pocket to my wife. She is ill and cannot attend the court. I carried her before justice St. Lawrence, there she said she was guilty of the fact which I charged her with ( that was, with robbing me of these goods.) (The goods produced in court and deposed to.) She gave an account where she had pawn'd the other gown, and I went and took it out.

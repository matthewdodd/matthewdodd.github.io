WILLIAM WARD
. I keep the Red Lion in Rosamond-street. This fender is mine—I lost it from a shed at the back of my house—I had seen it secure three weeks ago—the prisoner was brought to me with it.





GEORGE HINE
. On Monday evening, about seven o'clock, the prisoner and two more were about there—I saw the prisoner go to the shed door and wrench it open with a stick, and then shut it too again—he went in again, and brought out this fender, which I stopped him with—I have seen him there two or three times—he said if I would let him go, he would not do so again.

Prisoner I am very sorry, if you will let me go this time, I will not do so any more.




GUILTY
. *Aged 13—


Transported for Seven Years.

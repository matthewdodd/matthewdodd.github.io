CHARLES HENRY CLIFFORD. I keep the Coach and Horses, at Shadwell




. The prisoner was my barman
 - on Saturday evening I make it my rule to clear the tills every hour - on the 2nd of August I went to his till and took out 1s. 6d., which was all I thought there was in it; but in taking it out a piece of wood caught my hand, and I saw a half-crown, which I thought was in a wrong place - I marked it, and left it there - I afterwards missed it - I called him into a back room, and told him of it - he denied it - I desired him to show what money he had - he pulled out some money - I asked if he had any more - he said he had, and he pulled out a sovereign and two half-crowns, one of which was the one I had marked - the officer found 3l. 12s. 6d. more on him - he had been with me about eight months, and had 12l. a-year, board and lodging - I received a good character with him - his box had several valuable things in it - I had missed a sovereign the Saturday night before.

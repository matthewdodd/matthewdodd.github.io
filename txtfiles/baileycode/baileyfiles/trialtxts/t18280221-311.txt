            . I am carman to William Griffin, who lives at Woolwich. On the 20th of February, I had a paper parcel, containing these things, in the cart, in 
               Watling-street
            ; I received it from Messrs. Leaf to take to Woolwich; I saw the prisoner put his hands up and take it out of the cart; I ran and caught him; he got from me, and said something; I do not know what - I ran and called Stop thief! he turned two or three corners and came round to Watling-street again; I kept sight of him till he dropped it: he was taken a few steps further on - I am certain he is the man - master was answerable for it.

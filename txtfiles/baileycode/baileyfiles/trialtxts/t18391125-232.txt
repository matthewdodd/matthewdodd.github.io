SARAH ROTTE
. I lire, with John Hannen, a labourer, in Gower-place, Whitechapel. I have known the prisoner four years—on Saturday, the 16th of November, I saw her at the Hampshire Hog public-house—she called me Mammy Rotte, put her arms round me, and 1 began to kiss her—I asked if she was hungry, and took her home, and John Hannen went for a pot of beer—he had some shirts and trowsers, and other things, which I saw safe between five and six o'clock on the 16th—I missed them the next morning—on the Monday morning, between nine and ten o'clock,

I found her with my shawl on, and this old handkerchief in her hand—she had taken every thing out of the box—I only found the shawl and the handkerchief, which are mine.





WILLIAM LEACH
. I am a policeman. I produce the handkerchief and shawl—I took the prisoner on the Monday to the station-house—she was searched, and nothing found on her—she made no reply to the charge.

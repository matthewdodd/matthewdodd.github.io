 on the 3d of August, between eight and nine in the evening, I missed my handkerchief; I turned round, and saw it in the prisoner's hand; he dropped it immediately as he saw me turn round; I pursued him, and knocked him down in the kennel, and then I charged a constable with him.
The handkerchief was produced in court, and deposed to by the prosecutor.

When the prosecutor knocked me down, there were two fellows, that said, I dropped the handkerchief; he called to them to be witness; they ran away; they were more ragged than me.

             depos'd, That her Lady being dead, and before the Corps was carried out of Town, her Master ordered her to put up her Apparel, Rings, &c. safe in Boxes; that one of the Locks of the Boxes being faulty, her Master order'd her to send for the Prisoner's Father, who was Smith to the Family, to put on a new Lock; that the Prisoner coming instead of his Father, put on a new Lock, and the Goods were Lock'd up safe; and he being left in the Closet to mend some other Things that wanted mending (as it afterwards appear'd) found an Opportunity to open the Box, and took out some of the Things of Value, some of which were found where he had pawned them. The Fact being plainly proved, the Jury found him 


               Guilty to the Value of 39 s.

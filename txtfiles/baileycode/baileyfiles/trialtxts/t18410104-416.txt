WILLIAM CORBIN
. I am a drayman, in the service of Charles Barclay and others, brewers. I was delivering beer on the 24th of December, at half-past five o'clock, at Mr. Coley's, in Brick-lane, St. Luke's—we left this chain and rope on the dray we had, and went into the public-house to get our note signed—we came out in about five minutes, and they were gone—I saw the chain again on the 29th—it has master's initials on it.





JOHN JONES
. I keep a marine-store shop in Brick-lane. About seven

o'clock on the 24th of December, the prisoner brought this chain to me, and asked me to buy it—I said I would buy it if it was a thing I should buy—he pulled it out—I asked how he got it, he said he found it coming up Holborn—I looked at it—the officer came in, and I handed it to him.





THOMAS JONES
 (police-constable G 112.) I had information, and went to different shops—I saw the chain on Jones's counter—I went in, and the prisoner was there—J asked Jones who brought it, he said the prisoner—the prisoner said he found it coming down Holborn.

Prisoner's Defence. I was coming from my father's, and at the top of Farringdon-street picked up this chain.

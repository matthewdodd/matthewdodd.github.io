JAMES WILD
. I am a policeman. On the 20th of April, I was at Greenwich fair in plain clothes—I saw the prisoner, and several others sounding people's pockets—I at last saw the prisoner take this handkerchief from a gentleman's pocket—I took him, and asked the gentleman if the handkerchief was his—he said it was—he went to the station, but refused to give his name and address—I do not know who he was.

Prisoner. While I was in a crowd looking at a show, I felt the handkerchief at my feet—I took it up, looked at it, and put it into my pocket—the officer then came up in plain clothes, and I thought it was his—he took me to the gentleman, who was ten or twelve yards off—he said it was his—but he would not prosecute as I had not done him any injury.




GUILTY
. Aged 18.—


Transported for Seven Years.

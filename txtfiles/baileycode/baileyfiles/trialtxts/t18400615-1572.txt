1572. 



JOHN SMITH
and 




GEORGE PICKERING
were indicted for

stealing, on the 
16th of May, 1 shilling, the monies of 



Jane Steel, from her person.






JANE STEEL.
I live in Chapel-street, St. George's, with my parents. On Saturday night, the 16th of May, I was in Whitechapel-road, looking at a man writing on the pavement—there was a crowd—the policeman asked if I had lost any thing—I took my money out of my pocket, counted it, and missed a shilling, which was safe twenty minutes before.





GEORGE TRUE.
I am a policeman. I was on duty about half-past six o'clock in the evening, in private clothes—I know both the prisoners, and thought it right to watch them—I saw them attempt several females' pockets, both of them, especially Pickering—I saw them at last come up to Steel, opposite the London Hospital, and saw Pickering put his hand in her pocket—the other saw me and gave him a nudge—they both came away—I caught hold of them both, and Pickering dropped a shilling—I went to the prosecutrix, and asked if she had lost any thing—she felt, and missed one shilling—while Pickering was trying the different pockets, Smith was standing behind him covering him.

Smith's Defence. I met the other boy at Whitechapel church; he had one shilling, and said he had two shillings when he came out, but had spent one since he was out.

Pickering's Defence. I had three 3 shillings and sixpence in the morning, and was going to buy some paints with the remainder.

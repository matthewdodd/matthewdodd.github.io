            . I live in Great Dean-street, Westminister. This coat was taken from my chaise while it was standing in Leicester-square


, on the 10th of June, at a linendraper's shop, about eight o'clock in the evening - the master of the shop had left the chaise in care of one of his young men; no notice was given to me, but on my return home, and going from my house to the stable I missed my coat - I saw it again on the 11th of June.

            . I live with the linen-draper - my master gave me the care of the chaise; two men came by, and the prisoner, who was one of them, took the coat and ran away with it - he was in the road; I followed him, and he threw the coat away at the end of the square - I still followed, and he was taken in Green-street; he begged to be let go, as he said he took it from poverty, and two soldiers who then had him, let him go - I went up to him, and he said it was for want; he ran on, and I followed him again - the Policeman took him in St. Martin's-lane; I had lost sight of him, but I swear he took it.

            . I am a Police-constable. I saw the prisoner running, and heard a cry of Stop thief! I pursued, and took him in St. Martin's-lane - the witness identified him as the man who took the coat.(Property produced and sworn to.)

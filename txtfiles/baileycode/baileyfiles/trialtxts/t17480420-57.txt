            . The Prisoner was servant
 to Mr. Collins, and lay with me. I went out to work on the 29th of Feb. at six in the morning, and left him in the room; I was sent for, and when I came home, I missed upwards of fourteen pounds, a silver stock-buckle, and a pair of chrystal buttons.
Q. Did you get your money again?
Lawrence. I got twelve pounds five shillings.
Mr. Clarke, the Portsmouth carrier produced the money, stock-buckle, and buttons; and the Prosecutor said, the buckle and buttons were in the box with the money.

            . The Prisoner went down to Portsmouth in my waggon on the 29th of Feb. The boy seemed pretty free upon the road, and my servants thought he must wrong his friends or some other person; and acquainted me with it, I examined him, and he confessed he took it from this young man, at Mr. Collins's, at the Castle, in Eastcheap, and I brought him up to town




               Guilty of the felony, and acquitted of stealing in the dwelling-house
            .

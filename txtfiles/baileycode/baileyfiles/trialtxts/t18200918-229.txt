            . I am a shoemaker
, and live in Samuel-street, St. George's in the East


. On the 27th of July, about half-past five o'clock in the morning, I hung this watch by the fire-place and went next door, leaving my door open, but kept my eye on it, and saw the prisoner come along the street smoking his pipe. I came out in a minute and a half, and saw him about twenty yards off; I went in, missed my watch, and saw some tobacco on the boards smoking. I ran out, he saw me, and ran. I called Stop thief! a constable collared him, and I took the watch out of his right-hand pocket - the shawl was found on him.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

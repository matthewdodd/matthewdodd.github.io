WILLIAM BATEMAN
. I keep a poulterer's shop in Tyrer-street, St. James's—on the 20th of February, I noticed the two prisoners near my shop, about eight o'clock in the evening—I then saw Cullen push Rowe against the window—I had seen my fowl safe the minute before, and one of them took it, I cannot say which—I went out, and they dropped it between them—they then separated, and attempted to escape in different directions—they were taken within a few yards of my door.





JAMES POWELL
. I am a policeman—I took the prisoners, and have the fowl—I found two duplicates, a key, and a knife, on Rowe—they denied all knowledge of each other—when before the magistrate, Cullen said be believed it was Rowe took the fowl.

Rowe's Defence. I was out looking for a place—there was a cry of "Stop thief," and a man took me.
(Cullen received a good character.)

            , of St. Dunstan at Stepney




, were indicted, the two former for 


               breaking open the House of 
                     
                        
                           James 
                           Hewet 
                        



                      
                   in the Night-time, and taking thence 26 Yards of Hair and Worsted Stuff the Goods of 
                     
                        
                           Lewis

                  ; a Hat, and Childbed Linnen the Goods of James Hewet
            ; and Mary Witherly for 


               receiving the same, knowing them to be stole
            . The Prosecutor deposed that the staple was forc'd off and 26 yards off Plush cut out of his Loom, and his Hat and Linnen taken away. His Brother confirm'd the same. 
               
                  Henry 
                  Leach 
               



             deposed that Delmee, Harwood, and himself coming down Monmouth Street in Spittle Fields







, and seeing no Light up one pair of Stairs, and the Street-Door being open, went up Stairs, broke the Staple of the Lock, and took the Goods, and carry'd them to Mary Witherly in Southwark to sell for them; that she knew them to be stole. and had sold some Goods before for them. The Prosecutor's Hat was found on Harwood's Head and produced and swore to in Court. Delmee said he knew nothing of the matter; Harwood, that he bought the Hat of the Evidence Leacb ; and Witherly that she knew nothing of it. It appear'd that it was not the Prosecutor's own House, as laid in the Indictment, he being but an Inmate; and the Fact charg'd upon Witherly to arise in Surry, the Jury 

               Acquitted
             her, and found Delmee and Harwood 


               Guilty of Felony only

, and Mary Witherly for 


               receiving them, knowing them to be stole
            . It appeared that the Prosecutor's Chamber Door was broke, and the Goods gone, and that Harwood pawn'd one of the Coats for a Crown to Mrs. Lee in Bisbopsgate street, which was produc'd in Court and sworn to by the Prosecutor; but the Evidence not being sufficient to fix the Burglary on him, nor to affect the others, they were 

               Acquitted
            , and Harwood found 


               Guilty of Felony only

                  Witheryl 
               



             were again indicted, the former for 


               privately stealing a piece of Blak Callimancoe, out of the House of 
                     
                        
                           George

, on the 13th of November





 last; And Witherly as Accessory for 


               receiving the same knowing it to be stole
            . The Prosecutor deposed that he lost a piece of Callimancoe which was just come from the Hot-Pressers; that Henry Leach being taken up, told him that John Delmee had taken it: whereupon he got a Warrant and a Constable and went to search after Delmee and his Goods, that they found him in Bed, and the Callimancoe over the Bed's Tester; that Witherly had slipt her Gown on. The Constable and another confirm'd the finding Delmee in the Bed, and the Goods upon the Bed's Tester. Henry Leach deposed that Delmee went into the Prosecutor's Shop and took the Goods. The Evidence not being sufficient against Witherley, she was 

               Acquitted
            , and Delmee found 

               Guilty
             of the Indictment. 


               Death. But he died in Newgate on Sunday, so could not receive Sentence with the rest
            .

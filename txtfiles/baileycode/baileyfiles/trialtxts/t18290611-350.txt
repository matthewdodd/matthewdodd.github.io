            . I live in Moorfields, and am a porter
. On the 28th of May, at twelve o'clock at night, I shut up my master's shop in Westmoreland-buildings, and was going home to my father's; the prisoner caught hold of me - I told her to let go, as I was going home; she wanted me to go into a house, but I would not - I gave her 2d. to get rid of her; I then missed three half-crowns from my breeches pocket, and told her she had them - she began swearing, and I said she should not go till the watchman came; he came up and took her - I did not go up any alley, or to any house with her; I cannot say what pocket I took the 2d. from - she had been behind me; three half-crowns were found on her.

            . I am a watchman. I was on duty twenty minutes after twelve; the prosecutor cried Watch! I went up, and he said he had lost three half-crowns - I took the prisoner to the watch-house, and the officer found some halfpence on her; she then squatted down on the floor, and put the three half-crowns out of her mouth into her hand.
Prisoner's Defence. He gave me the three half-crowns and asked me to go and take a glass of liquor - he wantedme to go up a court, but I would not; he then took hold of me, and said he had lost three half-crowns.

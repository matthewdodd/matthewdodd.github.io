             deposed that he was at the Royal Oak; that he gave the mistress of the house a nine-shilling piece to change; that she weighed it, and found it light; that he went to his lodgings to fetch a guinea; that he took it to the Cart and Horses; that after having been there some time he laid the guinea down on the table; that the prisoner came and snatched it up and ran away with it; that he found out where the prisoner lodged, but he had absconded; that he afterwards took him in company with byland; that the prisoner then confessed having stolen the guinea, and offered to pay it at so much per week.

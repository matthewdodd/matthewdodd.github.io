            . I live in Welbeck-street. On the 13th of December, at twelve o'clock, I was passing up Nottingham-street. I saw the prisoner, Macmahon, go down the area steps of Mr. Cooke's house, and returned in about three minutes, with a bundle before him; he came up, and gave it to Chadaway; I pursued them into the New-road, and from thence into Northumberland-street, calling stop thief. Chadaway threw the coat down, and I took him, and afterwards took Macmahon.

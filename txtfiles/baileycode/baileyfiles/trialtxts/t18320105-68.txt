MARY CUMMINS. I have a room in Golden-lane


 - there are two beds in it. On the 13th of December the prisoner came to the door, and asked me for a night's lodging, for which she was to pay me 3d.; I never saw her before - she lodged there that night, and asked me to let her lodge there the next night - I did so, and when she went out she had a bundle; she did not return - I found her in a public-house - the blanket has not been found; it was safe when she was there, and she had nothing but what she had on when she came in.

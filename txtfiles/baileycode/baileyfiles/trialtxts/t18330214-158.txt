             (Police-constable E 49). I live at No.7, Bury-street, Bloomebury. On the 31st of January, about twenty minutes before six o'clock, I saw the prisoner in Regent-street begging; I searched him, and he gave me this pair of boots from his hat - he said a gentleman gave them to him for his wife.

            . I am in the employ of Mr. David Lloyd, of Great Portland-street


, haberdasher; he deals in shoes
. On the 31st of January, the prisoner came into the shop - Mrs. Lloyd gave him a pair of stockings and a pair of Wellington boots for himself; the officer came to our shop the same evening, and we missed this pair of boots from a side shelf of the shop, near which the prisoner had sat while he put on the stockings - they are Mr. Lloyd's, and had not been sold; I am certain these were not given him.
Prisoner. The lady gave them to me; I did not steal them.

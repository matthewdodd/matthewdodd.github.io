SAMUEL SADLER. I keep a ready-made linen warehouse
, in Fleet-street


. On Monday, the 12th of May, between seven and eight o'clock in the morning, I went out, and shut my door - I was not gone more than a minute-when I returned I found it open, and a quantity of handkerchiefs taken off the counter near the door. I am confident that I shut the door. I immediately went out. When I got to the corner of Shoe-lane, I saw the prisoner going up the lane with the handkerchiefs under his arm. He turned into the passage of the Globe tavern. I secured him, took them from him, and gave him in charge - I did not know him before.

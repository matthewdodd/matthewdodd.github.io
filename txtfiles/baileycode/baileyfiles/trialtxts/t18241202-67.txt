             was indicted for 


               stealing, on the 21st of November

                        John 
                        Perring
                     




                  , from his person
            .
JOHN PERRING. I am a hatter
, and live at No. 413, Strand. On the 21st of November, about seven o'clock inthe evening, I lost my handkerchief, between Windmill-street


 and Panton-square


. I had it in my hand a few minutes before, and I am sure it was safe in my pocket; it rained very fast. I had an umbrella in my left hand. I felt some one at my right-hand pocket. I turned round suddenly, and missed it, I saw the prisoner close upon me; he looked rather confused, and ran across the road to the opposite side of the way. I pursued him, and took hold of his collar; he was alone. I accused him of having taken it; he said, he had just picked one up; if it was mine I might have it. I then lifted up a blue apron which he had on, and discovered my handkerchief with my initials on it, and the mark of the Steam Washing Company; he resisted very much; but I got the assistance of a person, and took him to the watch-house.

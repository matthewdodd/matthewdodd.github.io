            . I am a ticket-porter
. On the 8th of January, 1764, I went in at the Bell, in the Old Bailey, where I was drinking a pint of twopenny by myself. Two women were fetched in, 
               
                  Anne 
                  Baker 
               



             and 
               
                  Anne 
                  Hill 
               



            .
Q. Had you seen them before?
Porter. I had, two or three times, but never was in company with them. They sat down and said to their companions, we wish you would give us a dram. Said the woman, this gentleman will give you a dram, no doubt. I was pretty well dressed. I said, I would give them a dram of gin: they said they never drank gin, they drank rum. I said, call for a quartern, I'll pay for it. A man came in with a sort of rattan, and fell a laying upon Baker with it. I said, that is very bad usage; if she has done any thing amiss, you should take her to another place: upon that, the son-in-law to the woman of the house, said to me, Mr. Porter, come into this room: then the man fell a laying upon me. When I was out, he advised me to go home. I went out with that intent. I had not got past two doors from the house, before the two women came running after me, and said, now sir, you have seen us righted: if you will go to the King's Arms, in the Fleet-market, we will bring some men to see you righted. We went there; there was the prisoner at the bar. The woman said to him, 
               
                  John 
                  Wright 
               



            , such a one has used Mr. Porter very ill, for taking our parts. Who are they, said he, and one Doleman. D - n them, we will see him righted. Said Wright, before you go, call for a pot of half and half, to put us in spirits before we go. I had a pot of half and half; then up we went to the Bell again; there they fell to writing, and asking one's name and another's name. I said, it does not signify, I have got no matter of damage, let them go. Said they, we must have something to drink: said I, what will you have: they said, a quartern would be too little, so I gave them a pint of rum: then the women said, we have seen you righted; we beg you will see us home, and as you are pretty well dressed, no body will meddle with you; they said they lived in Whitecross-street; at that time I did not know where Whitecross-street was: then we set out, and they went to Lingard's, at the King's Arms: there the prisoner and Doleman borrowed some money of me. I had known the prisoner on board the Africa, Captain Wood. He was a foremast man. I said I would stay no longer. I paid for all. We went out, and when we came to the White Hart, by Turnagain-lane, they said, this is the last house that will be up, let us drink here: they went in all four of them; I followed and treated them there with a pot of beer. There they fell to fighting one among another. There came in 8 or 10 watchmen. The prisoner and Doleman went away; then I and the two women went out, and up Turnagain-lane. When we came to the Blue Anchor, they said, where are you going? I said, I'll go no farther with you. They said, you shall go with us to Whitecross-street. At the time we were disputing, came 5 or 6 watchmen, and took us all three up to the watch-house, by St. Sepulchre's. One of them, named Chamberlain, knowing me, they let me go, but said, pray what women are these? I said, God knows. I know nothing of them no more than the dead. I know no ill of them. They let them go. 
               
                  Anne 
                  Baker 
               



             said she was a captain's lady, and if I would go home with her, I should have a bottle of fine cordial, that her husband brought from the West Indies, and I need not be gone above a quarter of an hour. I went to the bottom of Fleet-market, and into Field-lane, then into Chick-lane, then into a dark dirty place, which I found since to be Blackboy-alley




. When we were 2 or 3 yards in it, I said, I do not understand this part of the town: they said, they would shew me the way to Whitecross-street. Are you afraid of this place more than us? I said, if a woman is not afraid, I need not. They turned on the left till they came to the second door; they knocked at the door, and I heard a whistle immediately in the court. I was immediately surrounded by three men, and the two women. The prisoner was one: he took a truncheon from under his coat, and said, you old blackguard, have we got you here at last? Mrs. Barnsley opened her door, with a candle in her hand (I found the house the next day.) They swore they would have my life, money, and cloaths, before they left me. I said, for God's sake have mercy, I'll freely forgive every one of you. They laid on me with a great stick. The blood ran down me, and I was in a miserable condition. I held by the women; they pinched me to make me let go. At last, one of the men catched me by the heels, and hawled me down; they drawed me to the next door, and from thence to the dunghill: there I catched the prisoner's hand in my pocket, with a handful of money. I held it. I can swear very safely to him. The man that pulled me down was a tall man, neither Doleman nor the prisoner. I lost a guinea, and 12 s. 6 d. after he had taken that, Doleman came and cut my pocket out; saying you old dog, here is your money, and totes. I heard it rattle. So the prisoner had not all, the watchman came crying the hour 12, then they quitted me, and ran away; the prisoner came back, and made a push at my hat; I got hold of him, and hawled him out into Chick-lane, and begged the watchman would assist me: he said he durst not, for if he did he should be murdered, there was such a gang of them; then came the other two men, and two women up, and rescued him.

             is executed. (See No. 175, in Mr. Alderman Bridgen's mayoralty.) Anne Hill is since transported for another offence. (See No. 545, in Sir William Stevenson's mayoralty.) Doleman is since transported by another name.


                  John 
                  Hailey 
               



            . I took the prisoner at Kingsland-green, in last sessions time; I brought him in a coach to Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            's: he told me going along that he should be glad to be admitted evidence, and said he was concerned with 
               
                  Anne 
                  Baker 
               



            , who was executed for the same, in robbing one Mr. Porter, in Blackboy-alley. I then had never seen Mr. Porter in my life.
Q. What was the prisoner taken up upon?
Hailey. He was taken up upon stealing a box of dollars, and an ingot of silver, out of a cart.
Q. Who did he want to be evidence against?
Hailey. Against one Eggleston, and said he was concerned with him and 
               
                  Anne 
                  Baker 
               



            : he gave the whole account of the dollars, and after that he ran away from us; I knew him before, and have drank with him at the Bell, in great Eagle-street.
Prisoner's defence.
This evidence has made his brags of what he shall have for casting of me, I have some evidences here.
For the prisoner.

            . The day that 
               
                  Jack 
                  Wright 
               



             was taken up, I went to the Justice's; there was the prosecutor and Hailey: the Justice asked the prosecutor whether he knew this 
               
                  Jack 
                  Wright 
               



            .
Q. Did you know the prisoner before?
A. Page. I did, he worked for my brother, a brick-maker, in the brick-fields, last summer, about 3 or 4 months. The prosecutor pointed to a man in a fustian frock, who was taller than 
               
                  Jack 
                  Wright 
               



            ; then the Justice said, if you know him, go and touch him; then he touched the other man, and said that is the man. Mr. Hailey told the prosecutor coming out, that that was the man that sat at the corner of the bench, in a plush coat.
Hailey. The prisoner had not a plush coat on, neither was that woman in the office at the time Sir John asked the question. I do not believe she was at Sir John's at all.


                  John 
                  Biddle 
               



            . The prisoner worked for me last summer, at brick-making; he behaved very well the time he was with me, which was about two months, near Battle-bridge Wells.

            . I keep a public house, the Greyhound, in Red-cross-street, in the Greyhound Inn back gate in the Borough; the prisoner used my house for almost a year and a half, he always behaved well, and paid very honestly.
Q. to prosecutor. How do you know you lost 1 l. 13 s. 6 d?
Prosecutor. I lost more, but I chuse to swear to less.



               Acquitted

            . The goods mentioned in the indictment are my property, I packed them up on the 30th of November last, and sent them from my house in Bristol to London; they were in a box, directed for 
               
                  Robert 
                  Salmon 
               



            , Barbican, London: after which I had a letter from Mr. Salmon, that the box was not received.
Q. Who did you send them to the waggon by?
Wiggan. By my servant, 
               
                  George

            . On the 30th of November, I carried that box that my master delivered to me, by his order to the carrier; it was a little deal box.
Wiggan. The carrier's name is

                  Salmon 
               



            , Barbican, London; I know it was on a Wednesday night, in December. I had been round to divers places with goods; going round by Moorfields




 I had a large case of books to deliver in at the
Foundery




, when we came up to the door, I ordered the carman to give me the case of books out; I then saw the box in the cart, the last words I said to the carman when I was going in with the case of books, was to take care of the cart. I came out again, and was going to Barbican to deliver the box; and the carman told me he had lost the little box: I asked him where he had been, he said he had been only in at the Foundery door, to look for his whip; then I ordered him to turn about and go home. I never saw the box since.

                  Powell 
               



            . I am a carman to the Swan-inn at Holborn-bridge; I was with the cart with these goods to Vine street, to Thames-street, and other places: we had a little square box with us. When we came to Moorfields the porter left me with the cart, while he took out a large case, and carried it in at the Foundery; I jumped out of the cart, and made up my tail rope, then I wanted my whip; I went and looked in at the two doors, and found I had set it in at the last door. I came and got up into the cart, and missed the little box; I had seen only two women near the cart, and they past by as I was bothered about my whip. I was not from the cart two minutes.

                  Smith 
               



            . I have here some part of the broad pieces of gold brought to me, (produced in court.) I believe they are antient coin; the woman at the bar brought them, and wanted me to buy them: this was on the 10th of December. I examined her how she came by them, she said she found them near a patten-maker's in Smithfield, at a corner; I told her I had a warning from Goldsmiths-hall of such things that had been stolen, and I must insist upon her going along with me to the persons they were consigned to, that was Mr. Hammond and Carter, part of the goods were for them; she went along with me to their house in St. Martin's-Le-Grand. Mr. Whitehead had information I had stopped a woman with some broad pieces of gold, he came to me and brought an officer; we took her to Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            , there she said her name was 
               
                  Jane 
                  Evans 
               



            , and gave us a wrong account of the place where she lived; but it happened there was a man there that knew her, he gave Sir 
               
                  John
               


             an exact account where she lived; he granted a search warrant to search her lodging. I, Mr. Whitehead, and two constables went, and in a drawer in her room we found this pint mug, (produced in court;) it is French plate. and this bag of dollars, between the bed and sacking. (produced in court) there are 47 of them; we carried them to Sir John, then he granted a warrant to take the two Wrights; 
               
                  James 
                  Wright 
               



             lived with her. We went back to the house, expecting he would come home, but he did not; then we were informed 
               
                  John 
                  Wright 
               



             lodged at Islington; we went there, and found John and 
               
                  James
               


             both in bed with a woman: we searched the room, but found nothing there; but in John's pocket we found 13 guineas, one 36 s. piece, and one dollar. He said the money was nothing concerning the gold and silver, that it belonged to Mrs. Allcock, upon a ticket he had delivered to her, to receive some prize money for him. The constable tied them both together, and took them to Bridewell.


                  John 
                  Hailey 
               



            . I being a constable, was at Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            's with a prisoner, the woman was having a hearing: I said she is a neighbour of mine, that she lodged in Red Bull yard; Sir John gave me a search warrant. I went with Mr. Whitehead and the others, and in a drawer in her lodging we found this pint mug, and the dollars were found under the bed, on the sacking, and delivered to me, I being constable: we carried them to Sir John; then he issued a warrant to apprehend the two men. We went to the house in Red Bull-alley, and staid till between 1 and 2 in the morning; then we were informed 
               
                  John 
                  Wright 
               



             lived at Islington: we went there with a watchman, and knocked at the door, no body answered. I saw by the watchman's light the key was on the inside the door; we broke the door open, and the watchman fell on his back in the room: I stepped over him, and went to the bed; there were the two men at the bar, and a woman in bed together. We searched the room, but found nothing: in one of 
               
                  John 
                  Wright 
               



            's pockets I found a dollar; then he pulled out 13 guineas, and a 36 s. piece, and said he had it of Mrs. Allcock, in Cow cross, on a ticket to receive some prize money. Before Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



             he was charged with this fact, and he denied it. He was taken to the Gatehouse; after that he was brought to Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



             again: I was there, the keeper said he had opened all the affair; then I heard him own he had hid the ingot of silver in the Spaw-fields: we went there, and it was found; but I was then on the other side of the field. He had told me at Sir John's door, he was going to look for a bar of silver, that he and James had hid there, and desired me to go with him, (13 Guineas and a half, a 36 s. piece, and a dollar, produced in court.) These I found upon him, and he gave us information where to find a person that had two other dollars; we went and got them, (produced.)

                  Wright 
               



             was committed to the Gatehouse; I found it was for a robbery of a capital nature. He called for a pint of wine, and seemed to be a little flush in money. I found one 
               
                  James 
                  Wright 
               



             was concerned with him, I said to him perhaps the other person may make a discovery, and if you will, I will do to the uttermost of my power to get you made an evidence: he said he would. I called a coach, and took him to Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            , and told Sir John he was willing to discover all, if he could be admitted evidence; Sir John said he should have all the encouragement he could give him, provided he told the truth: the first thing he mentioned was, that one Eggleston was concerned in the robbery. We went to a court, and by his direction took Eggleston; he was lodged in New Prison; then the prisoner told us one Eadey, an old man, whose son keeps a public house near Clerkenwell, had 12 guineas and a half in a purse, to keep for 
               
                  James 
                  Wright 
               



            , till it was wanted: we went and found him, and asked him if he had such money; he said he had, and pulled it out of his pocket, and delivered it to us: then I asked 
               
                  John 
                  Wright 
               



             what step we must take next. He said there was an ingot of silver buried, just on this side Sadler's Wells, in a dunghill; by this direction it was found, I was there: then we went to the London Spaw, there he told us there were several silversmiths in the Borough, where he had parted with some dollars and silver coin. We agreed to meet the next morning by eleven, at Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            's: we did, and went out, and 
               
                  John 
                  Wright 
               



             with us again; we found the man at the Cock and Bottle in Crooked-lane had bought some pieces of coin of him; we went there, and the man delivered them up, (produced in court) 12 or 13 dollars, and a louisd'or, he acknowledged buying those of the prisoner, in the prisoner's presence. then Wright took us to most of the silversmiths shops, and most of them confirmed him in what he said; but some had melted them down: then we went to a tavern at St. Margaret's-hill to dine, coming out I was going to get a coach; I had not gone above 10 yards, but I heard the cry, stop thief: I looked about, and lost both Mr. Whitehead and he. Mr. Whitehead had ran after him, but he got clear off. Mr. Whitehead went over Westminster-bridge, and I over London-bridge, and he got to Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



             before me.

            , I am partner with Mr. Hammond, in St. Martin's-Le-Grand; part of the goods were consigned to us: we had warnings printed, in order to get intelligence of them. In a few days Mr. Smith stopped the woman at the bar, and brought her up to our house, in the mean time Mr. Whitehead being apprised of the affair, came to our compting-house; we took her in a coach to Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            's: she said she lived with a brewer's servant, at one Cox's, in Aylesbury-street, but the constable knowing her, confronted her, and said she lodged at one Wayling's, a chairman in Red Bull-yard; there we went, and found this pint mug, and a bag of dollars, 47 of them: then we got a warrant to apprehend John and 
               
                  James 
                  Wright

             sent his wife to my house in Cow-cross, to let me know he wanted to speak with me. I went with her to her room up two pair of stairs, in Sharp's-alley; he asked me what he owed me: I said 8 l. he had got some foreign money, and wanted to pay me. I said I do not care to take it: said he do not be afraid, I found them in a box in Moorfields. I said I will give you my debt, rather than take them; by his persuasion I bought 7 l dollars, and some gold of him, for betwixt 22 and 23. He bid me sell them any where, for he found them honestly.

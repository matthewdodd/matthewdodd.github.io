            . On the night of the 8th of February I was going house, along Thomas-street, towards London-bridge


; I saw the prisoner and another woman - the prisoner took hold of my arm, and asked me to treat them; she then left me - the other woman came and asked the name; they followed me to the steps of the new bridge- I then felt a pull at my pocket; I turned, and saw the prisoner with my handkerchief in her hand - I seized her, and desired her to give it one; she would not - I gave charge of her, and it was taken from her bossom.

JOSEPH NICHOLLS
. I live in Coleman-street, and am an ostler. On the 11th of December I was there, Mr. Marshall came and desired me to send this carpet-bag to No. 3, Cross-lane, St. Mary-hill—the prisoner came there with a man to help to unload, and I gave him 1s. to carry the bag.





SAMUEL TILLETT
. I keep a public-house. The prisoner came that day, and put down this bag, and asked me to take care of it—he came again it the afternoon and asked for it—I told him he had three pints of beer to pay for—he said, "Give me the bag, I will bring the money"—I hesitated about letting him have it—he then asked my permission to come into the bar, and take some articles out of the bag—he came and took a pair of trowsers and a pair of boots, and went and pawned them—while he was gone, I sent for an officer, who took him.

Prisoner. Q. Did not you open the bag with the poker? A. No.





WILLIAM FAULKNER
. I took the prisoner, and found the duplicate on him.





WILLIAM DAVIS
. I am butler to Mr. George Marshall. The bag and clothes are his.

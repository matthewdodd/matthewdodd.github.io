            , who is a widow - the sheets, and apron were in a back-room in the house. On the 18th of January about ten o'clock in the morning, the officer brought them to me - I had not missed them before - I have often seen the prisoner about the house; his sister was the servant.

            . I am an officer of Worship-street. On the 18th of January, about ten o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner and two Jews together in Worship-street - the Jews had each a bag - the prisoner appeared to be bargaining with them; they saw me, and parted immediately, as they knew me; the prisoner also knew me - I secured him. He had four sheets, and an apron; I asked him where he got them? he said they were his own, and that he lived at No. 17, Craven-street. I asked him if he kept the house? he said No. He then said he had a sister, who lived servant there, and he had been concealed in the night-house all Saturday and Sunday, when he went into the back-room, and took the things - I went to the prosecutrix, and she claimed them.

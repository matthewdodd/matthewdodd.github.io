, the 5th of November
 last. The Prosecutor's Boy deposed the Prisoner came to his Master's Shop to sell a Ring, and and would afterwards buy another; and took the Opportunity to put 2 Bath-Metal Rings in the place of the 2 Gold Rings, which she carried away. The Prosecutor deposed he took her afterwards selling one of the Rings at Mr. Marlow's Shop. The Prisoner in her Defence acknowledged she had 2 Bath-Metal Rings, and did leave them and take the Gold ones by mistake. Several appeared and gave her a good Character for Honesty and Industry, saying that they believ'd it was her first Fact; but she might probably have been drawn away of late by a Person who was with her. Upon the whole the Jury found her 


               guilty but to the value of 10 d.

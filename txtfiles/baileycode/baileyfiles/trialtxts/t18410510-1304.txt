RICHARD BROWN
. I live in Bedford-street. On Wednesday night, the 7th of April, I was at the Black Bull public-house, Holborn—I had been cleaning the paint—after I had done it I had some bread and meat and porter—the prisoner came in, and asked for relief—I gave him some of the bread and meat and beet—he then went and sat down by the fire, by the side of which was a cupboard, containing my coat, with some letters in it—he sat a bit, and then went away—in half an hour I missed my coat—I did not know who had taken it, but seeing the prisoner come in without a bundle, and go out with one, I went in search of him—I found him on Saffron-hill—the letters which had been in my coat were found in his pocket, but the coat was gone.

Prisoner. Q. Did you see the coat in my possession? A. No—I saw you with a bundle—you had no bundle when you came in.

Prisoner. I had. I went in for half a pint of beer, and sat down by the fire. I found the letters in a piece of paper by the fire.





NOAH STONE
 (police-constable G 56.) I took the prisoner, and found these four letters in his pocket, which the prosecutor identified the moment I took them out—I asked the prisoner how he got them—he said he found them in the street.

Prisoner. You came to me at Hatton-garden, and said, "If you had the coat, if you give the man money, I will let you go." Witness. I did not.

Prisoner's Defence. I never went to the cupboard. I never knew there was a cupboard there. I picked the letters up in the tap-room.

Transported for Seven Years.

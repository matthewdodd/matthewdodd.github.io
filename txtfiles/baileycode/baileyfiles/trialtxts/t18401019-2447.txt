GEORGE SMITH
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
24th of September, 1 waistcoat, value 1s., the goods of 



Joseph Hosier.






JOSEPH HOSIER
. I keep a clothes-shop, in Plummer-street, City-road. I had a waistcoat hanging inside of the door on the 24th of September—I saw it safe about ten minutes before five o'clock, and it was brought back a few minutes after—this is it—(looking at it.)





JOHN COTTRELL
. I live in Plummer-street, opposite the prosecutor's. About five o'clock, on the 24th of September, I was in my front shop, and saw the prisoner hook the waistcoat off with a little whip—he put it on the ledge of the window, stood before it, and turned his back to it—he then saw every thing was clear, and popped it under his jacket—I followed and took bold of him—a policeman was passing—I told him to take the waistcoat from under his jacket—it appears the prisoner did not do it for want.





BENJAMIN BULL
 (police-constable N 75.) I took the prisoner, and found this jacket and 2s. 9d. on him, and this picture, which is a caricature of a policeman.




GUILTY.* Aged 13.—


Transported for Seven Yean—Ship.

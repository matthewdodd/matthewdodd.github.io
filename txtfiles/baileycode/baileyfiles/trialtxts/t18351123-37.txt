GEORGE TIMBRELL
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
7th of November, 1 handkerchief, value 3s., the goods of 



Joseph Howse, from his person.






JOSEPH HOWSE
. I live at Cirencester—I lodged at Cooper's Hotel. Bouverie-street. On the 7th of November, I was in Wood-street, passing along—on arriving at a place where I was stopped by a carriage, I was informed something had occurred, and missed my handkerchief from my pocked—I looked round, and saw the prisoner in custody—while I turned round, some one handed my handkerchief to me—It has my initials on it.





JOHN HOWELL
. I live in Aldersgate-street. I was in Wood-street that into the prosecutor's pocket, and take the handkerchief out—I secured him with it in his hand.

Prisoner. I had no handkerchief in my hand when he took me. Witness. He dropped it the instant I took him—I secured him the moment his hand came out of the pocket with the handkerchief in it.

Prisoner. He struck me on the forehead. Witness. I deny that.

Prisoner's Defence. I went after a situation, and on coming along wood-street, that gentleman took hold of my collar, and said I had picked a gentleman's pocked, and had got the handkerchief about me—I never saw any handkerchief till I was at Guildhall.
(Alexander W. Glasse, Type-street, Finsbury, publican; Mary Conolly,

Ropemaker-street, news-vender; and Jane Wiggins, Arthur-street, Goswell-street, gave the prisoner a good character.)




GUILTY
. Aged 17.—


Transported for Seven Years.

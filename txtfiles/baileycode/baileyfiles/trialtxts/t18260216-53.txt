            . I am wife of John Price, who lives in Park-street


, and is a green-grocer
. I knew the prisoner by seeing him in the neighbourhood. On the evening of the 6th of February, a person came to the door and called my husband - he went into the shop, and found the prisoner behind the counter - he called me, and I saw the prisoner standing near the till - he said he came for a half-penny worth of stale fruit - my husband told him that was not the place for it - he said he had dropped his halfpenny, and came there to look for it; I then took the candle, and found the till nearly out; I had put in seven sixpences there, and one was very much battered - I missed some sixpences, and among the rest the battered one; my husband then went to fetch an officer, and left the prisoner>with me - he made one step to the right, and I heard some money fall - I took hold of him, held him fast, and told him he should not stir a step till the officer came - the officer found this money on the floor, and the battered sixpence is among it.

WILLIAM FOREMAN. On the 22d of July, I was going up Broad-street, St. Giles'


, between twelve and one o'clock in the morning - I had spent the evening out with some friends - three or four females came up and asked where I was going; the prisoner then came up and took my handkerchief; I made a snatch at it - he drew it from me and ran off; I pursued him thirty or forty yards, and overtook him at the corner of Middle-row, but my handkerchief was not found.
Prisoner. Q. What part of Broad-street was this? A. A few yards from George-street; I was not accusing the girls of taking it; I gave charge of him.
Prisoner's Defence. I had been up late settling some business - I was returning home, and saw the prosecutor pulling three girls about, and accusing them of taking his handkerchief - I passed on, and soon heard the cry of Stop thief! I turned round, he came up, and accused me of taking it; if I had, it must have been found on me or in the street.

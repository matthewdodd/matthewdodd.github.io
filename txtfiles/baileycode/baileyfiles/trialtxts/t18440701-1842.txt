1842. 




RICHARD SUMMERS
 was indicted

 for stealing 1 shawl, value 6s., the goods of 



Ann Sophia Lay; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






THOMAS GOLDSMITH
, linen-draper, High-street, Shadwell. About nine o'clock on the 26th of June, I was standing in my shop—a lady came in and gave an alarm—I missed a dress shawl—I ran out and saw the prisoner about eight doors off—he was running away—I ran after him, and he took the shawl from under his jacket and dropped it—I picked it up and gave information—the shawl belongs to Ann Sophia Lay—I am sure the prisoner is the person—he was lurking about the door previously.





MICHAEL M'DONALD
. I am an umbrella-mender. On the night of the 26th of June, I saw the prisoner running, and Goldsmith following him—I called out, "Stop thief," and saw the prisoner drop the shawl—I am sure he is the person—I have known him for six months.





WILLIAM LEE
 (police-constable K 268.) On the night of the 26th, the prosecutor spoke to me—I found the prisoner outside the White Hart, in Shadwell, a little after ten o'clock—I said, "I want you about a shawl"—he said, "I know nothing about it; I have been in the White Hart drinking, the whole evening"—but I had looked into the White Hart half-an-hour previous, and he was not there.

Prisoners Defence. On this night, I was at work till seven o'clock at the London Docks; I then went into the White Hart, and stayed there; I'saw Lee come, and look into the passage; I stopped there till nine, and as I was going home, he came and said, "I want you on suspicion of stealing a shawl."






GEORGE WILLIAM GRAVE
. I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner it the person.




GUILTY. Aged 30.—Recommended to mercy by the Jury and Prosecutor.—





Transported for Seven Years.

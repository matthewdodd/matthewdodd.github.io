            . I am a labourer in the East India company's warehouse
. On July the 2d, between one and two in the morning, I met 
               
                  Sarah 
                  Stone
               



             and 
               
                  Sarah 
                  Atkins
               



            , in Bishopsgate Street, the corner of Sun-street; they asked me to give them something to drink; I went into a court, and gave them a glass each, of peppermint; I got change for a pound note ten shillings in silver, and the rest in half-pence; I put the halfpence in my handkerchief; I went with these two prisoners, to a room in a Court in Angel Alley


, directly. I got there, they pulled the handkerchief out of my hand, spilt the half-pence about the room; in a few minutes, Wise came up, she abused the other two girls for bringing me there and while she was taking to them she came up close to me; I perceived my watch go from me; I said, give me that watch again; then Levi and Walter came in the room; they came between me and Wise, I requested the watch; a man came in and knocked me down; I tried to rescue myself from the man, and got him down, when the whole of the prisoners pulled me off, beating me at the same time; they got me down, and I expected they were going to take my life away, I cried out and begged for mercy; he got up in the mean time these girls got out of the room. I being fatigued got up, and instantly he shoved me down stairs; I waited in the Alley near three quarters of an hour by the door; finding nobody come, I thought it was dangerous waiting there any longer. I went towards Bishopsgate; there I saw the five prisoners coming up the court; I fancy the prisoners saw me, they returned back again, and went into a gin shop, near Sun-street. I saw the watchman, and requested that he would take the whole of them; he informed me he was off his duty; I told him I had been robbed and ill used. He then took them all up to the watchhouse; they were searched, and about seven shillings and odd were found upon them in copper.
Q. Were you sober - A. I had been drinking porter. I knew what I was about; I am sure that

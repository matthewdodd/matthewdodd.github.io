                  , from his person
            .
JOHN GALE GARRETT. On Sunday, the 19th of June, I was in Hanway-street


, going to Tottenham-court-road; I observed the prisoner behind me, and felt a tug at my coat pocket about two minutes after; I turned round and saw him taking his hand from my coat; he ran away and got behind some Hampstead coaches, and then into Tavistock-street; I there saw him throw something away - I followed and kept him in sight till he was taken in Bedford-square: I did not get the handkerchief again; when I gave him in charge I said.
"This man has been picking my pocket;" he said he was very sorry, and begged my pardon, and hoped I should not do any thing to him.
Prisoner. I said I hope you will forgive me, as I am innocent. As I was in Tottenham-court-road I looked at a dog, whom I thought was going to bite me: I kicked him - a coachman came up and struck me with his whip; I asked him what he did that for; he said he would do it again - I then struck him and he struck me, and I ran away.



               GUILTY

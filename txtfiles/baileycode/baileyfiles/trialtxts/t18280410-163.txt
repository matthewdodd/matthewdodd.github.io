JOHN WARNER. The prisoner was in my service as errand-boy
 for about four months. In consequence of information which I received from the last prisoner, I had this one taken into my back shop, and searched him - he kept saying he had done nothing, and had got nothing, till I found some combs; I then sent for the officer, and gave him in charge - I had taken him from the Refuge for the Destitute.

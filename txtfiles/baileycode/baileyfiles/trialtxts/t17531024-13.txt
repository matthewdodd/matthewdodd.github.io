            . I am servant to Mr. Richardson, he is an agent
, and lives in Downing-street, Westminster


: the prisoner was servant
 to my master likewise, and lay in the same room that I do; on the 15th of October we missed seven guineas out of the desk in the Office.
Q. Who kept the key of that desk ?
Barber. I did, we having miss'd money since the prisoner was with us, I suspected him, so we took him up, and before justice Ledland, there he confessed he took the seven guineas out of the desk the night before.
Q. Was the desk lock'd over night ?
Barber. It was, and the key was in my pocket; he confessed he took the key out of my pocket when I was asleep, and opened the desk and took the seven guineas out, and lock'd the desk and put it in my pocket again.
Q. Was there any more money in the desk at the time?
Barber. There was one hundred and six pounds, sixteen shillings and ten-pence in it, the prisoner delivered back the money again.
Q. Is this office part of the dwelling-house?
Barber. It is.
The prisoner had nothing to say, and called no witnesses.

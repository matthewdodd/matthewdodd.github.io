We live at Greenford


. My father is a farmer
. On the 14th of November, about twelve at night, I heard a noise in the cart-house, which is about forty yards from the house; I got up to the window, and it ceased; then I went to bed again, and I heard a noise of fowls; I told my brother; we went armed to the cart-house, and Guyatt was on a ladder, with a fowl in his hand; we took him, and afterwards we found Carter concealed by a cart; there were three hens and a cock found within a yard of him, dead; I am sure they were my father's. The next morning, we found seven hens, two cocks, two ducks; and a drake, all dead; and a chissel and a bag lying by the side of the hedge secreted.

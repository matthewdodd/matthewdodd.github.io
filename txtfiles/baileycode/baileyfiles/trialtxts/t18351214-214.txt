EDWIN HOYE
. I am in the service of John Davies, a silk-mercer, in Dover-street, Peccadillo, in the Parish of St. George, Hanover-square; it is his dwelling-house, On the 8th of December, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, I heard a noise in the parlour abjoining the ware house—the noise appeared to be in the warehouse—I immediately went there, and found the prisoner, who was a perfect stranger to us—he had a a roll of silk—I asked him what he was doing there—he said he wanted Captain Johnson—I said no such person lived there, and took him into custody—he threw the silk into the place he had taken it from—when I first saw him, he had it in his hand—I fetched a policeman, leaving the prisoner in the custody of a young man—the silk is worth 8l.

Prisoner. Q. Where was I standing at the time I had it in my hand? A. Close to where you had taken it from—you had it in your hand.





JOHN GIBLING
. I am a policeman. I took the prisoner, and have had the silk ever since.

Prisoner's Defence. It was not in my hand—he cane in, and said, "What do you want?"—I said, "Captain Johnson"—he said, "he don't here," and shut the door, and fetched a policeman—I went there, being out of employ for nine weeks—I met a gentleman I knew, who said Captain Johnson might take my son into his employ, and that he lived in Dover-street—I unfortunately went into this gentleman's house, and asked for the Captain—he said he should take me into custody for attempting to steal; and when the policeman came, he gave the silk out of the rack; the policeman said, "You had better charge him with stealing."

(William Parrot and William Stevens gave the prisoner a good character,)

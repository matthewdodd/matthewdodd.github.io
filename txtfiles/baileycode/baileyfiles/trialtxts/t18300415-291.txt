            . I am a Police-officer. On the 7th of April, at a quarter before five o'clock in the morning, I met the prisoner on Stepney-green, with this duck wrapped up in a smock frock - I asked what he had got; he told me nothing - I found this duck, and then he said he had bought it half an hour before, of a sailor for 1s. 6d.; I found nothing else on him.

            . Mr. Edward Sadler lives at Laytonstone


 - I take care of his place, and had the fowls and duck in a hen-house; they were all safe and locked up on the 6th of April, and when I got up the next morning they were all gone - I missed eight fowls and this Muscovy duck; I know nothing of the prisoner - they had taken the tiles off, and got in at the top of the house; I know this duck very well, and he knows me.
Prisoner's Defence. I had it tied up in my old smockfrock - I said it was a Muscovy duck I gave 1s. 6d. for.

            . I am a smith
 in the Little Old Bailey


; the prisoner worked with me: on the 16th of August I went to the other end of the town; I stopped to drink with an acquaintance in Holywell-street in the Strand, and saw the prisoner go by with two bars of iron on his shoulder: they are bars for the stair-case of the New Sessions House; I went out and stopped him. A gentleman asked how I knew they were mine; I described them by the thickness and length, and they answered to a quarter of an inch; there is no particular mark upon them; he acknowledged he took the bars, and said he was going to break the grating of a window; I said if he would make any confession of any other bars I would be as favourable as I could.
Prisoner's Defence.
I did not take them out of the shop; I had them five weeks before when I carried out a parcel for him. When he took me he said he would not hurt a hair of my head, and bid me run away.

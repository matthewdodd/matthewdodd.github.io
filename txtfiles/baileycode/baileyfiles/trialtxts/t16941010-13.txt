                  Mary 
                  Morrell, alias 
Cambridge Mall




            , was tried for 


               picking the Pocket of 
                     
                        William 
                        Andrews
                     




                   of 42 s. and a Purse, value 1 d.
             Andrews swore, That as he was going along Shoe-lane


, the Prisoner, and some more women, came near him, and shoved him into an Alley, and pickt his Pocket, and she owned to have had the money. The Prisoner alledg'd that she was innocent, and that one Hancock pickt his Pocket, when she drank with him at the Crooked-Billet in Shoe-lane; but Andrews declared that he never drank with her. O my Lord, says the Prisoner, he will say any thing: 'Tis very sad, my Lord, that I should suffer for that which another woman did. Another Evidence for Andrews, was a woman that happen'd to be near him when his Pocket was pickt, declared farther, that she saw the Prisoner, and another woman, take the said Andrews into the Alehouse, and that she had always been an ill woman and said that she had told the Constable that she lived by picking of Pockets, and she believed she had picked a hundred Pockets in her time. She was found 

               guilty
             of Felony.

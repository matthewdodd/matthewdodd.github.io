            . I am shopman to Mr. George Muir, hosier
, on Fish-street-hill


. On the morning of the 11th of November, between half-past nine and ten o'clock, these stockings were about a foot within the door, with a ticket on them. I had been up stairs, came down, and saw a youth; cast my eye on him, and saw him hand them to the prisoner, who put them into his lap and turned down a court about twelve yards off. I laid hold of him with them, and gave him in charge.

            . I was going towards Webber-square


, between one and two o'clock in the morning of the day in the indictment, perfectly sober; my brother, 
               
                  John 
                  Houndle
               



             was with me; we were overtaken by the prisoners, two came and pushed me on one side, and a third stumbled before me; my brother-in-law immediately said, he is picking your pocket. I then caught hold of one of them, and my brother exclaimed, stick to him, I have got this one; the third was then coming towards me, when I seized him; we secured them all three, and they turned out to be the prisoners at the bar.

            . I was behind, and saw Ayres put his hand into my brother-in-law's pocket, and take out the handkerchief, containing the halfpence. The watchman came up, and we secured them all three.

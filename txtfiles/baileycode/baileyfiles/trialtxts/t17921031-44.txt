Mrs. M'DONALD sworn.
The prisoner was a lodger of ours twice, about three months in the whole; I let him a bed but not a room; I missed the things in the indictment; I saw them at the office; I had not seen them for six weeks before; my daughter made the bed.

             sworn.
I am a pawnbroker; I produce a pair of sheets, a quilt, and a blanket, which, on the 21st of September, I took from the prisoner; he said he was the son of Mrs. Taylor, of Whitechapel; I am sure of the boy
; I never saw him before. (Produced and deposed to.)
PRISONER's DEFENCE.
The prosecutor keeps a common lodging house
, and the very night before, his wife came up, or his daughter least-wise, threatening to turn me out of the bed; we pay every night; being out of work, I was almost starving, and I took the sheets, and I pawned them with that gentleman.



               GUILTY
            .
Tried by the second Middlesex Jury before Mr. Justice HEATH.

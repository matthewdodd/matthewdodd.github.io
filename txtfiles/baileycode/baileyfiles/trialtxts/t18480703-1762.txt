, stealing 18 pints of ale, value 9s., and 12 bottles, 1s.; the property of 



Abraham Cowley and others; Wright having been before convicted.






WILLIAM ROBINSON
. I am cellarman to Mr. Abraham Cowley and others, ale-brewers, of Lambeth. On 26th June, at half-past seven o'clock, I found the gates of their wharf open—they had been shut over-night—I found two bottles of ale, wrapped in a handkerchief, on the foot-board of the van—I locked the gates, and got a man to look and see who fetched them away—I went to the cellar under the dwelling-house, and twelve bottles of ale were gone.





ANTHONY BABBAGE
. I was set to watch, and about ten o'clock I saw Wright come over the bridge to the van—he put his foot on the van, and was reaching-for the bottles—I caught him, and said, "You are the man I have been waiting for "—he said "What is the matter V and he said if I did not let him go, he would break my legs—I opened the front gates, and got him out-Cannon was with him—they beat me and kicked me, and threatened to smash me if I did not let him go—I kept Wright, Cannon got away.





CHARLOTTE ROBINSON
. About six o'clock on that Sunday night I was in my house—I saw the two prisoners in a boat, on the water—they tied the boat to a barge—at ten at night I saw Wright get into the boat, and go into the wharf—Cannon went into the wharf on the other side.





WILLIAM ATLEE
. I produce a certificate of the prisoner Wright's former conviction at this Court—(read—Convicted August, 1845, confined one year)—he is the man.

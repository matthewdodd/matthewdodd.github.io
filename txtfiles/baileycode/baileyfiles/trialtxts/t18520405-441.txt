 (policeman, R 180). On the evening of 11th March, between 6 and 7 o'clock, I was in London-street, Greenwich, and saw the prisoner and two others passing to and fro Mr. Kershaw's shop—I watched them, and followed them to Mr. Shewall's, linen draper, in High-street, Deptford—the prisoner placed himself beside the window with a bag, or something under his arm, and there was another man with him—the prisoner remained there about twenty minutes, the other man passing to and fro the shop—I then saw the other man go up and take two pieces of gingham off a packet; the prisoner held the bag, and the other man put the gingham into it—I seized them both, they struggled, and the other escaped—I took the prisoner to the station, and charged him, and he said, "Very well"—this is the property (produced)—it was in the lobby of the shop, inside the doorway.

FREDERICK BENNETT
. I live at Mr. William Gaines's, in Covent Garden-market. I was going down stairs, on the 5th of September, be tween eight and nine o'clock in the evening, and saw the prisoner put up his hand and take this bottle of pickles down—I ran after him and caught him at the corner of James-street, found them under his coat, and gave him in custody—this is my master's bottle.

Prisoner. I was walking along, and a boy came and pat it into my hands.





RICHARD MOORE
. I am an officer. I took the prisoner and the pickles from the last witness.





FREDERICK BENNETT

re-examined. I saw no one else but him—there were four of them round the shop the evening before.





THOMAS PERRING
. I am an officer. I produce a certificate of the prisoner's conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office-(read)—the prisoner is the person who was tried and convicted.




GUILTY
. Aged 18.—


Transported for Seven Years.

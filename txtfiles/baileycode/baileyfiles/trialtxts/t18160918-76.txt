            . On the day in the indictment, in consequence of information, I missed the property in question from the door, and I pursued after the person I understood had taken it; I pursued up Well-street. where I got farther information, and went up Berner-street; I saw a man running, and I hallooed stop thief, and he dropped, the property in question. That man when stopped, was the prisoner at the bar; it was he who dropped the bundle. He gave the young man that stopped him a most dreadful kick in the bowels. We took him to Marlborough-street, where, after I had gave my depositions against him, he gave me a terrible thump on the face.

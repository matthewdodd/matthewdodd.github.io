WILLIAM JONES
. was indicted

5th of November, 11 pairs of stockings, value 11s., the goods of 



Thomas Delarue Kipling.






CHARLES CRISP
. I am shopman to Mr. Thomas Delarue Kipling, a hosier, of New-street, Covent-garden. On the 5th of November, about half-past five o'clock in the evening, I missed eleven pairs of lambs-wool stockings from within about a foot and a half inside the door—they were tied up with a ticket on them—I saw Hoy with them next day, and the ticket still on them—when we sell goods we take the ticket off.

Prisoner. Q. What do you swear to them by? A. By the tie and the ticket—I cannot swear to the stockings themselves, but they are what I saw in the bundle.





JOSEPH HO
. (police-constable F 95.) On the night of the 5th of November I saw the prisoner running across Seven-dials into Great St. Andrew-street, with a bundle under his jacket—I followed him, and when I got near him he threw it into the gutter—I caught him, and took up the stockings and the ticket lying by the side of them—I asked him if the shop opposite the corner of New-street was the shop he took them from—he said it was—I asked him if he was in distress—he said, "No," but he wanted money d—d bad, and said I might as well let him have them, as the person belonging to them knew nothing about it.




GUILTY
. Aged 20.—


Transported for Seven Years.

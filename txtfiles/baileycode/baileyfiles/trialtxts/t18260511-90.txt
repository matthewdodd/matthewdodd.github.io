            . I live with Mr. Moore, of St. Martin's-court


. About seven o'clock in the evening of the 25th of April I saw the prisoner near the shop; he looked in, and I suspected him. I went to the back of the shop, and saw him take this umbrella from another, to which it was attached by a bit of string, and hung in the window; I saw him put it down, look round, and then take it away; I ran out, and the constable, who had been watching him, had just stopped him.
Cross-examined by Mr. ADOLPHUS, JUN. Q. These were in the window, for people to look at, and to handle? A. Yes, but he took it off the hook; I saw him in custody in two or three minutes - he appeared to be in liquor. The place is much frequented - he might have been seen by twenty or thirty other persons. It has Mr. Moore's name inside - he did it quite openly, as a man takes his own umbrella.
COURT. Q. Is it an usual course of dealing for people to ask the price, or to walk off without asking? A. They generally ask the price.

            . I am a constable. I was passing the court about seven o'clock, and saw the prisoner take this umbrella from a hook - he put it down by the side of the stall-board, then took it, and walked away with it. He certainly was drunk.(Property produced and sworn to.)

                   JOSEPH BIRD
               



             sworn.
I live in Great St. Andrew's-street, St. Giles's


; my house was broke open; I was not at home; 
               
                  John
                   Smith
               



             was in the house; I was the house-keeper at that time; my father had it before he died.


                  JOHN
                   SMITH
               



             sworn.
I am servant to the prosecutor; on the 27th of August, I was in his house at work, in the shop which communicates with the house by two doors; one into the parlour, and one into the passage; my master is a gun-smith; and as I was at work, I saw two young men come in at the street door; I thought they had been going into the house about business, to some of the lodgers; but the gentlewoman over the way giving an alarm, I came out of the shop directly, and saw the two prisoners coming down stairs with bundles in their hands; when they came a little nearer to me, I seized the prisoner Williams by the collar; he dropped one of the bundles he had in his left hand, and made his escape; I am quite sure I saw him drop it; I pursued him about twenty rood, hallooing to stop him; and a gentleman put his foot, and threw him down; then I came up, seized him by the collar, and desired the gentleman to assist me; I did not see the other prisoner taken; I never saw either of them before to my knowledge.
Court. Can you be positively certain these are the men? - Yes.
Can you be sure the prisoner Davis was the other man? - Yes.
Was Williams ever out of your sight? - Not half a minute.
Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. As there are lodgers, they let themselves in and out, I suppose, by the same door that these people went in at? - Yes.
That door is occasionally left open? - It was upon the latch.
You was minding your work? - Yes.
You do not know it was fastened in any way? - I heard the latch shove up.
But whether it was fastened, you cannot positively swear, to your knowledge? - No.
THOMAS FOLDMAN sworn.
On the 27th of August last, I was at work in Neale's yard; I heard the cry of stop thief; and I saw one of the prisoners coming very fast, and I chucked up his heels, and collared him; then this young man came and said he had robbed his master's house; that was immediately after I took him; going to Litchfield-street, I took these keys out of his pocket (produces a large bunch of keys); I had seen him before; I know him now.



                  JOHN
                   BURFORD
               



             sworn.
I live in the same-street: with the prosecutor; and I heard the cry of stop thief, with a very strange and powerful voice; and I stopped the prisoner Williams, who was running as fast as ever I saw a man run in my life; he was running very hard; I stopped him, and had a long tussle; and sprained my shoulder; this bundle he had under his left arm; he never got from me; I have kept the bundle ever since; I dried the things because they were wet.

                   MORGAN
               



             sworn.
I saw Mr. Burford run and seize this prisoner Davis; I assisted him; that is the same man.

             sworn.
I was looking out at my three pair of stairs window, on the 27th of August last, between four and five; and I saw the two prisoners taking the linen off the line, out of Mr. Bird's house, the one pair of stairs room; I live opposite; I never saw either of them before to my remembrance; the line where the clothes hung was close to the window; the windows were open; I am quite sure the prisoners are the men, because I hastened down to give the alarm; and I saw the prisoners come out at the door; one had a bundle; that was Williams; the gentleman that stands next to me.

             sworn.
(Looks at the things.) Here are an apron and five handkerchiefs of

                   Steward
               



            's; four handkerchiefs and three aprons of

                   Steward
               



            's; the handkerchiefs are marked, but not the aprons; we have had them often to clear-starch; I know them, and one apron and two handkerchiefs of my mother's; them I know; and one handkerchief of 
               
                  Mary
                   English
               



            's, that was sent to be clear-starched.
Court to Smith. Who picked up the bundle in the house? - A gentlewoman in the one pair of stairs; she is not here.
Prisoner Davis. I leave it entirely to my counsel, Mr. Garrow.
The prisoner Davis called four witnesses who all gave him a very good character.

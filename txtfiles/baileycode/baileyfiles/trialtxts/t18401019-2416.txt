GEORGE ALEXANDER BRIMMER
. I am a printer. On the 25th of September, about half-past twelve o'clock, I was on Holborn-hill—the prisoner accosted me, and followed me—I refused her all I could—she asked me to accompany her down Field-lane, and attempted to pull me down there—I kept walking on, and told her to go away—I broke away

from her—she still continued to walk by my side—directly after I missed my handkerchief, I accused her of it, and she denied having taken it, or knowing any thing about it—the policeman came up, and I gave her into custody—the inspector, at the station-house, said he would search her, and she then produced the handkerchief from her person.





WILLIAM BOWERMAN
 (City police constable, No. 249.) The prosecutor charged the prisoner with having taken his handkerchief, she denied it—she was taken to the station-house—the inspector said she should be searched, and sent for the female searcher, and then she produced the handkerchief.

Prisoner's Defence. The prosecutor accosted me, and took me to a door-way, and I said, "Will you go to a house?"—he said he had but half-a-crown, and would get change, and give me 1s.—he gave me the handkerchief to hold till he gave me the shilling—as I was going along he saw the policeman, and gave me in charge for stealing it—I said I would not give it to him till he gave me 1s.




GUILTY
. Aged 21.—


Transported for Ten Years.

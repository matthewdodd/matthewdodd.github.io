WILLIAM THOMPSON
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
22nd of July, 7 shillings, the monies of 



Joseph Salmon; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






WILLIAM WEBB
. On the 22nd of July, at half-past two o'clock, I saw the prisoner near the prosecutor's shop with another young lad—I saw them stand talking together—the prisoner went in and walked round the counter, opened the till, and took some money out—he came out and ran away, and when they came to Mr. Gravenor's, the prisoner dropped a shilling—he picked it up again—he said to the other, "Will you take the lot?"—he said, "No, I will not take the lot, as I shall be in for it as well as you"—they both ran away, and were taken in a quarter of an hour—I am sure he is the same boy.





SAMUEL COLE
. I am in the employ of Mr. Joseph Salmon, who is a baker. I was in the passage, and saw the prisoner run out of the shop—there was another boy at the step of the door—I came into the shop, and saw the till open—it had been shut before he came in—the policeman brought him back—I do not know what was in the till—I missed 9s. or 10s.—I had seen it a short time before shut and safe—I was not absent more than a minute.





WILLIAM LEA
. I am a police-constable. I saw the prisoner and another running—I took the prisoner—the other made his escape—I told him I took him for stealing the money from Mr. Salmon's till—he said

he did not know any thing about it—I found three shillings and three thimbles on him.





THOMAS WITTINGTON
. I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 17.—


Transported for Seven Years.

A witness. I am a watchmaker and work with Mr. 
               
                  William 
                  Addis 
               



            , the prisoner was our errand man
; I was at breakfast and saw him very busy near the watches, I gave charge to the boy to see if he missed any, the boy looked in the book and missed a watch.
Q. Where was the prisoner then?
Answer. He was gone out, I had sent him of an errand.
Q. What book is that?
Answer. We set all the watches down as they come in to be mended, and scratch them out as they go out again; I went after the prisoner through Bishopsgate, and turning down old Bedlam I saw him come out of a watch-maker's shop, I called to him, and then accused him with taking a watch, he soon owned he had stole it, and that he had sold it in that shop; I took him with me, and went in and there found it; he had sold it for 27 s. he returned the money and I took the watch.
Q. How long had the prisoner been with your master?
Answer. He had been with us a month the very day that he committed the crime.
Prisoner's defence.
I own myself to be in a fault, I had the foul disease four years ago, and I am so bad that I can hardly crawl along.

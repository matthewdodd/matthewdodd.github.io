Archer. Stamford and I stood to look if any body saw us. After we had brought the Yarn pretty near to his House, he run to get his House open, which he did: We Went into the Entry, and threw it down the Cellar. As soon as he carried it as far as he had a Mind, Mr. Swift carried it; then James Stamford; when he was tired, I carried it upon my Shoulder: Mecum carried it as far as Goswell-Street, then he ran home to get his Door open to put it down his Cellar.
Q. What became of it?
Archer. It was sold to Gordon for 20 s. but I never had but 3 s. and Mr. Smith owes me now 18 d. of the Money.

            (to the Prisoner.) Now what have you to say in your Defence?
Prisoner. Please you, my Lord, I was at Mr. Lane's, an Alehouse, where we had something for Supper, and there Archer and I had a Quarrel, and he does this out of Revenge, &c. This Witness was took up for murdering his own Father: I never was in no Gaol 'till they brought me to it.

Q. Do you know any Thing particularly of this Yarn?
Pinchin. No otherwise, my Lord, than I happen'd to go and see this Archer in Bridewell, and I ask'd him how he came to do this Thing to these Men; I said I know you to be a Reprobate Fellow, but I never knew you to be a Thief; so he d - d me, and said will you give me a Quartern of Gin, which I did; said he I was persuaded to do it, and I have done it once, and I must do it again.

Worral. I know so far, please you my Lord, that I give 900 l. Security for my Place; the Prisoner has gone along with me sometimes; the Prisoner and Arther happen'd to be at one Mr. Lane's, so there happen'd to be a Quarrel.

Q. When was it? I say, when was it? Was it a Month ago, or two Months, or is it three Months ago?
Worral. 'Tis eight or nine Months ago, I believe; it was just when Archer's Father sent him to Bridewell. I did not keep an Almanack in my Head.
Court. You say that Archer and Mecum were at Lane's nine Months ago; what was then done, and said ?
Worral. We had some Steakes, and I eat a Bit with them; there was Sop, and Archer throws it into the Prisoner's Face, so Mecum hit him with the Candlestick, and Archer d - d him, he would hang him right or wrong.

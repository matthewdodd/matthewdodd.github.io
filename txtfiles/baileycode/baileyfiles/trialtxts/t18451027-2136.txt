SAMUEL AXFORD
 was indicted

 for stealing 3 pairs of drawers, value 7s., the goods of

EMMA SMITH
. Iam servant to Samuel Hitchcock, of Broadway, Dept-ford. On the 10th of Oct., about three o'clock, I was in the shop—there were trowsers, shirts, and drawers standing outside the shop—I saw the prisoner pass by and take some drawers off the box that they were on—I went to the door—he ran, and dropped them—I am sure I saw him take them.

Prisoner. You said you were in the back parlour eating your dinner. Witness. I was in the back parlour, but I saw you take them and drop them; the people were running up the place, and you dropped them.





CHARLES ARMITAGE
. I went in pursuit of the prisoner, who was running—I took him—he had these three pairs of flannel drawers—I put a mark on them—Mr. Hitchcock said they belonged to him—I did not see them taken.





WILLIAM LYNES
 (police-constable R 238.) I produce these drawers—I took the prisoner—I know Mr. Hitchcock's name is Samuel.





THOMAS BRADLEY
 (City police-constable, No. 269.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction at this Court—(read—Convicted 7th of April, 1845, and confined six months)—he is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 21.—


Transported for Seven Years.

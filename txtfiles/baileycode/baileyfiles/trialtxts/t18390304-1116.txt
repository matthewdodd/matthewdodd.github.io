1116. 




GEORGE RAY
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
13th of february, 1 half-crown and 1 shilling, the monies of 



Martha Ray: and that he had been previously convicted of felony.






MARTHA RAY
. I live in Powis-street, Woolwich—the prisoner is my brother, and lives at home—he does any work he can get to do. On Ash Wednesday I put half a crown and a shilling into a tea-caddy, and locked it I missed it that morning—my brother had been at home on Tuesday night—the caddy was not broken open, but the money was gone—there was 8s. more, which was left.





CHARLES STEWART WARDEN
. I am a constable of Woolwich. I received information from the prisoner's mother, and took him into custody—I told him he was accused of stealing a half-crown and a shilling—he repeatedly declared he had never taken it—I found 4d. on him, which he said was all he had, and he had earned it the previous day—I found a half crown in his neckcloth afterwards.





JOHN RILEY
. I am a cheesemonger. The prisoner changed a shilling with me on Wednesday morning.

Prisoner's Defence. I was at work Monday and Tuesday carrying a play-board—on Tuesday night a gentleman asked me to take some tickets—on Wednesday morning he gave me 4s. 2d. for two days and a night's work—I put half a crown and 1s. 6d. In my neck handkerchief—I had 4d. in my pocket—I got supper with it, and paid a young chap some money I owed him.





MARTHA RAT

re-examined. He saw me put money into the caddy on Saturday night—I never permitted him to take my money—he asked me to lend him 6d. on Saturday night.





JOSEPH BUTTERFIELD
. I am a policeman. I have a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from the Clerk of the Peace for the county of Kent—(read)—he is the person.




GUILTY
.* Aged 19.—


Transported for Seven Years.

Before Lord Chief Justice Tindal.

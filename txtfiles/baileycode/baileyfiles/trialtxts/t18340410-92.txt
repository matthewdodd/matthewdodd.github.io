ABEL SIMNER. I felt my pocket picked on Saturday night last in Cheapside


 - I turned, and saw the prisoner in the act of taking his hand from my pocket - he ran down Lawrence-lane, and I pursued him - I saw him run with my handkerchief in his hand - he fell down, and I took him myself - I brought him up the Poultry, and gave him in charge - when he gave me the handkerchief back, he asked me to let him go; but I said he had better wait for the officer - the handkerchief was dropped at the corner of King-street, and lost.

1777. 




EDWARD LOVELL DWYER



, feloniously being at large before the expiration of the time for which he had been transported.


MR. METCALFE
conducted the Prosecution.






HENRY MOUNT
. I was formerly a sergeant of police. I produce a certificate—(read—Central Criminal Court, 30th March, 1846; Edward Lovell Dwyer, convicted, and transported for ten years)—I was present at that trial—the prisoner is the person described—I apprehended him before that trial.





JOHN JONES
 (policeman, S 210). On Saturday, 21st Sept., I found the prisoner at the Black Bull public-house, Hammersmith—he came there respecting a badge—he had been a conductor on the Brompton-road—I recognised him, and took him into custody—I told him I recognised him, and he said he had received a free pardon, and afterwards that he had received a pardon on conditions not to leave the country he was transported to—he did not produce any discharge.
(The prisoner, in a written defence, admitted that he had been transported, but stated that he had received a conditional pardon, and, being urged by his affection for his mother, he returned to this country.)




GUILTY
. Aged 26.—



Confined Twelve Months, and then 


Transported for



Seven Years.

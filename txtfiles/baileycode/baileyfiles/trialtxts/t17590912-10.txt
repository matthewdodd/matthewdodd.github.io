                  Edward 
                  Young 
               



            . The prisoner was my apprentice
; on the 27th of August the prisoner absconded from my house, about a quarter before six in the morning.
Q. How long had he liv'd with you?
Young. He lived with me between three and four months; the silver watch was hanging in the kitchen, and it was missing when he was.
Q. What are you?
Young. I am a breeches-maker
, and live in Coleman-street


; we suspected the prisoner had the watch; we made search after him, and found him on the Sunday evening following; his father-in-law had taken the watch from him; I examined how he came by it; he was very sullen; I charged the constable with him and he was taken to the Compter; there was no business done on account of the Fire of London; so on the Tuesday he was carried before Mr Alderman Nelson, who committed him to Newgate; he confessed to me, his father-in-law, and others, that he stole the watch from me and he had torn it to pieces; but I could never get him to tell where he sold the other part of it.
Q. How old is he?
Young. His father says he is sixteen years of age. (The movement and part of the dial-plate produced in court) This is all I have got of it; I had it from the prisoner.
The prisoner said nothing in his defence.

            . I work for Mr. Gould, within two doors of Mr. Adams. I saw the little boy playing about the door, he is four years old. I saw the prisoner go behind the child, take the necklace off its neck, and run away with it; I followed and took him with it.

            . I am a brass-founder. I saw the prisoner run by, the child cried out for its things. I stopped him, he kicked me, and tried to get away. I saw the necklace in his hand - he dropped it.

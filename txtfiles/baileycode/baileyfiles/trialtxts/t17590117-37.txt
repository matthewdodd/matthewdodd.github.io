            . I am a Perriwig-Maker; the prisoner came to work with me on Friday last, and yesterday morning he took an opportunity of slipping away; I desired my apprentice to examine the wig-boxes; he found two wigs missing, the property of my customers, but I do not know the owners christian names; when we took him up in Middle-Row, we found six upon him; they all belonged to customers of mine and were taken out of my shop; but I only know the christian name of Mr. Foster, his name is John.
Q. What was his wig worth?

            . That was worth ten-pence.

            . I stopped the prisoner in my shop in Middle-Row, and sent for the prosecutor. The prisoner was charged with stealing six wigs out of his shop; the prisoner confessed he did.
The prosecutor's apprentice confirmed that of his master.
Prisoner's defence.
As the wigs were found upon me I have no more to say, only I beg pardon.




               Guilty 10 d

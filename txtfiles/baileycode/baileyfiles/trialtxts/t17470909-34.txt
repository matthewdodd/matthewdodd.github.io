            . I live in Spitalfields


. I lost my Work out of my Shop, seventeen Yards of Velvet, the Goods of Mr Dallbiack.
Q. What Reason have you to think that the Prisoner took it?
Lesever. Because she pawn'd it: She own'd she pawn'd it the Monday, and I lost it on Saturday; she pawn'd it to one Page in Shoreditch. The Prisoner has had lodgings with me almost three Years.

            . The Prisoner at the Bar, on Saturday the 1st of August, brought this Piece of Velvet to me. I ask'd her whose Velvet it was? I said, 'tis not your's she said, No. Says I, You must fetch the Owner; but she did not return. The Monday I advertised it; about nine o'Clock, this Gentleman came to my House to ask me if I had it, and I went to his House, and I found it answer'd to the Notches of the Velvet, and found it was the same; when I came there she was in the one Pair of Stairs Room, and I said, that was the Woman that brought it, and this is the Velvet; I have had it in my Custody ever since.

            . This Lesever works for me; and a Boy, and this Woman's Husband, works for me too, but they were all gone out when this was done, but the Velvet is my Property.

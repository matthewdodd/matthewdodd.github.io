JEVON HARPER
. I live in White Lion-court, Cornhill. On the 5th of July I was walking down Aldersgate-street—I did not feel any thing, but the officer told me something, and I missed my handkerchief, which I had had a short time before—this is it.





JOSEPH HAWKRIGG
. I am the inspector of Aldersgate-street ward. A little before nine o'clock that evening I saw the prosecutor in the street—I saw the prisoners go behind him—Stivens took his handkerchief from his pocket, and gave it to Kidman, who ran to Aldersgate-building—I ran and seized him—he dropped the handkerchief, and while I was getting that he ran away.





ROBERT TYRRELL
. I am an officer. I was in company with Hawkrigg and saw both the prisoners following the prosecutor—I did not see the handkerchief taken, but Stivens ran over towards me—I took him, and brought him over to the prosecutor.

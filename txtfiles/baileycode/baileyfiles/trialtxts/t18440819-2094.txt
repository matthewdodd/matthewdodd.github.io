WILLIAM BRADSHAW
 was indicted

 for stealing 2 tame geese, price 5s., the property of 



Henry Benjamin Tilt; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






HENRY BENJAMIN TILT
. I live in York-street, Westminster, On the 8th of Aug. I lost two geese—I saw them safe on the 7th of Aug., about the middle of the day, and missed them the next morning—I saw two at the station, which I have no doubt were mine, but geese are so much alike I did not swear to them.

Cross-examined by
MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. Where were they? A. Running about the yard—I had nine geese—they are generally much alike.





THOMAS TUNSTALL
 (police-constable B 96.) Between one and two o'clock on the morning of the 8th of August, I saw the prisoner come out of the prosecutor's yard with two geese wrapped up in a top coat—they were quite warm, and had just been killed—I took him and them to the station.

Cross-examined. Q. What did you say? A. I first inquired what he had got—he said, "Geese"—I swear I saw him come out of the premises—I was waiting twenty minutes for him, because I had heard the geese moving behind the gates—he said the reason he was taking them at that hour was, he wished to make a present to a friend, and he did not want his wife to know about it—he must have got in at the rear of the premises—there is a wall at the back of the prisoner's house that he might have got over.





FREDERICK SHAW
 (police-constable A 29.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the man.




GUILTY
. Aged 37.—


Transported for Seven Years

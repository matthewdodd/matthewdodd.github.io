I was passing, and saw a number of persons looking through the ballostrades - I saw the prisoner and another push in between the people, and they had the tail of a coat up between them - I saw a handkerchief pass from the coattail into the prisoner's trowsers; I seized him, and took the handkerchief from him - the other got away.(Property produced and sworn to.)

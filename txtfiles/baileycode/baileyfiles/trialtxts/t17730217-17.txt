            . I am a widow and live in Long-alley


. The prisoner came into my shop the second of this month, about half after one o'clock, and took the till out; I did not see him come in, I saw him go out; I was in the next room: I had just sat down to dinner; seeing him go out in a hurry, I went out, and cried stop thief! there is a glass door between the room and the shop; I saw him through it as I sat by the fire side; when I came into the shop he ran out. This gentleman stopt him, and took the till from him.

Q. Are you certain that is the same person you saw run out of the shop?
Snipp. Yes; I lost 15 s. and upwards, two in silver and the rest in half-pence.

            . I saw the prisoner run by my door with the till in his hand.
Q. How near to Mrs. Snipp's shop?
Lewesly. About 20 yards; he turned round the corner of my house; I run after him; before I came to him, I saw him stopt.
Q. Had he the till at that time?
Lewesly. Yes; I ran up to him and catched hold of the till; he let it go into my hand.
(The till produced, and deposed to, by the prosecutrix.)

Not guilty, my Lord: I know nothing of it; I work for Squire Grey, a brick-maker

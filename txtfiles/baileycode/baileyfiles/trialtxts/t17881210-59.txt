             sworn.
The prosecutor and me live in the same house; on Sunday night, between twelve and one, I heard a noise below; I looked into the area, and I saw two people busy; I heard one say to the other, you make haste in again, and get all the shoes you can, and all the working tools; I called out what are you about; the other man ran away immediately; then I called out, stop thief, and watch; and the watchman came immediately.

             sworn.
I am the watchman; I took the prisoner the upper end of Black-Jack-alley, by the prosecutor's door; the man was concealed in a little place, just by the door; the coat was spread, and the articles were in it.
(The things produced and deposed to.)
PRISONER's DEFENCE.
I was coming along that night, and I was very much disguised in liquor, I laid down, and I dropped asleep; and when I awaked, it was with the noise of calling the watch-man; he asked what I was doing there; I did not know what to do.

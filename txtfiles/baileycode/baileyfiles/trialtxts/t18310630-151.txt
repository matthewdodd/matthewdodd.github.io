            . I am a Policeman. On the 15th of May, about twenty minutes past ten o'clock at night, I met the prisoner in Nelson's-court, about fifty yards from Mr. Brown's warehouse, with a bundle under his arm: I stopped him, and asked where he came from - he said he had brought it from Mr. Roberts', two doors beyond Shadwell church, which is a mile and a half off; I took him to the station, and about one o'clock Mr. Brown came there.
JOHN JOSEPH BROWN. I am a coach-builder
 - my premises are in the parish of St. Mary, Whitechapel


. I left them safely locked up about ten o'clock on Sunday night, the 15th of May; this property was then on a shelf in the counting-house - I returned in about ten minutes, and found the warehouse door unlocked; I am certain I had locked it - the lock must have been picked; I found the prisoner at the station about one o'clock that morning, with the property; he is a stranger.
Prisoner. Q.On your oath, did you lock the door? A. I did - my boy was with me; he got there about a minute before me - he had not time to unlock it.

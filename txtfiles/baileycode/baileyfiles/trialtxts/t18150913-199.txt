            . The prisoner came into my master's shop, at about five o'clock in the evening, of Saturday, the 7th of August; she bought some articles; there were other customers in the shop. After she was gone, I missed two shawls; they had been inside the window, and she could have reached them were she stood whilst in the shop. I went out immediately, and stopped her about twelve yards from the door. When searching her in the shop, one fell from her apron, and the other was thrown back into the window. None of the other people who were in the shop are here. They might have seen her, but they did not tell me. It is my master's shawl.

RICHARD BARNETT
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
24th of April, 1 coat, value 2l. 15s.; 1 shawl, value 4s.; and 1 pair of gloves, value 6d.; the goods of 



William Daldy; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






WILLIAM DALDY
. I am coachman to Mrs. Elizabeth Gray, of Great George-street. I was in my mistress's stable, in Down-street, on the night of the 21st of April—the prisoner was at the door, assisting me—I hung my great-coat on the stall-post in the stable—I was going out, and I told the prisoner to shut the door after me—he said, "Yes, how long will you be gone?"—I said, "About ten minutes"—he shut the door—whether he remained or went away I do not know—I went back about half-past eleven o'clock, and the coat, and gloves, and shawl, were gone—the prisoner returned, and I asked him about them—he said he knew nothing about them.





JOHN ROBERTS
. I am a pawnbroker, and live in York-street. I took this coat in pledge of a lad about the age of the prisoner and his size—I could not swear to him—this is the duplicate I gave—(looking at one)—I lent him 10s.—the coat was tied up in this shawl.





SAMUEL GOODCHILD
 (police-constable A 36.) I went to the stable, and found the prisoner there—I found some money on him sewed up, and the duplicate of this coat.

Prisoner's Defence. It was not me that took it—as I was going out a young man was going in.





JOHN JARVIS
 (police-sergeant C 13.) I produce a certificate which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 16.—


Transported for Seven Years.

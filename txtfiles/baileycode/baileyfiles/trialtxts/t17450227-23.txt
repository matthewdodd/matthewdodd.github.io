; my wife and I went out and left her a cleaning the lower room; when we came back the door was locked up, she was gone, and had taken the things with her. I found her about a month afterwards at one Mrs. Paradice's in French Alley Spittlefields - She sells old clothes. I got a search warrant, but found nothing there: the Prisoner confessed afterwards that she took every thing except the stays.

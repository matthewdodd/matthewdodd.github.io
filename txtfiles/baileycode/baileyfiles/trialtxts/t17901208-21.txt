             sworn.
I am another servant to the prosecutor; on the nineteenth of November, in the morning, about seven; I went to the warehouse; I found the door wide open; I told my master.

             sworn.
I went to the warehouse; I found the doors open; I discovered the next day, that two squares were broke in a window, and a sash thrown up; we missed some pieces of carpeting, three feather beds, and a Persian pattern carpet; in consequence of information, I went to Mrs. Kirvin's house, in Honey-suckle Court, Grub-street; Clarke, one of the Marshalmen, went with me, one of the feather beds was found there, in a turn-up bedstead; my mark was on it at that time; on the same evening about half past six, we took the prisoner, at the Swan and Hoop, at Moorgate; Mr. Clarke asked the prisoner, if he had a father; he said he had; he would not tell what he was; he said he lived at the other end of the town; we enquired after the prisoner; by the name of the one-ey'd gunner; he was known by that name; his father lived in a court, in Grub-street, within three hundred yards of the place where he was taken; we had his father in custody, at that time; the prisoner did not know it; when he was accused of the fact, he said he sold it to Kirvin; he swore he would not turn evidence; he said he found it at Bethlem Wall, about seven in the morning, without any wrapper on it; it was a very wet morning; it is impossible it could have been found there, for it was neither wet nor soiled.
Prisoner. I wish him to look, and see if the bed is not dirty.
(The bed produced, quite clean.)

I am a porter at the brokers; about half past five in the evening, of the nineteenth; I was going through Honey-suckle Court; a person said there was a nice bed going into No. 9; I had seen a hand bill, and I gave information to Mr. Russell; I went with him, and took the bed from Kirvin's; it could not have been under Bethlem Wall; it was quite clean.

I got the bed that was found at my house, of the prisoner, on this day three weeks; he brought it there between four and five in the afternoon, of the nineteenth; I was to buy it, but had net the money; and the bed was left there till I could pay him for it; Mr. Russell came in the evening to my house, and took the property away.

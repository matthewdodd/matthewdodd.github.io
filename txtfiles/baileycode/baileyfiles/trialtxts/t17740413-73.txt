            . On the 3d of March, as I was going along St. Paul's church yard


, I saw the two prisoners; the big boy was pushing on the little one to pick pockets; I kept my eye upon them: at last I saw the little one take this handkerchief (producing it) out of a boy's pocket; before he could give it to the big boy

 a gentleman laid hold of him; the least is about seven or eight years old.

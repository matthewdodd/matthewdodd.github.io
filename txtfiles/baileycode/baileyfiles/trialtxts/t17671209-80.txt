John Brown. I keep the King's-arms inn, Holbourn-bridge




; on the 4th of December, about ten at night, the prisoner, two other men, and a woman, came in and called for a pot of beer; they drank three pints; the prisoner went last out of the house; after that my maid told me she saw him run down the yard with a half gallon pot, and either a quart or pint pot besides; I ran out immediately, and at the end of Field-lane I met the prisoner with a two quart pot, and a three pint pot, my property.

            . I saw the prisoner take the pots from off a shelf in Mr. Brown's house, and told Mr. Brown of it (the pots produced and deposed to)
Prisoner's defence.
As that woman swears she saw me take the pots out of the house, I have nothing to say; I am a founder by trade, and worked for Mr. Elgar in Redcross-square last.

            , JUN. I saw my father's breeches safe five minutes before they were taken. The prisoners were then playing upon a heap of dung with another boy, When my mother missed them, I saw the prisoners going along the footpath; my father went after them, but did not catch them. I saw them last Wednesday, standing at a sadler's door, and my father secured them. Richardson then had the breeches on.

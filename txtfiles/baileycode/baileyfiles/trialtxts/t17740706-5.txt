            . On the 16th of June I saw the prisoner leaning over a bale at Ralph's Key


; I bid him go about his business; I recollected myself and ran to the bale and found something was taken out of it; there was a vacancy in the bale then that was not there when I landed it; I sought for the prisoner but could not find him till the afternoon; when I saw him at the further end of the key, I asked him what he had done with the silk he took out of the bale; he denied it; I observed he kept his hands about his belly, I put my hand into his bosom and took out the silk.

As I was standing Hughes came and bid me go about my business; I saw two men going up the gateway; they dropped this, I did not know what it was; I took it up and put it in my bosom; Hughes struck me on the head, and said if I did not surrender he would have my life.

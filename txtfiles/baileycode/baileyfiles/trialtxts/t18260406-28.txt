, 1 tea-pot, value 15l.; 1 table-cloth, value 31s. 6d., and 3 sheets, value 30s., the goods of

                  , her master
            .
MR. SCHOOLEY. We missed these articles the day after the prisoner left; the sheets were taken from every bed in the house. I lost 40l. worth of property; I never gave her authority to pawn any thing.

            . This tea-pot was pawned with me, in the name of "Mary Jones, for Mr. Schooley," for 6l. - it is worth 8l. - (looking at a duplicate) - this is what I gave the person, but I do not know who she was.

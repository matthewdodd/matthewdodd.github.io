1947. 




THOMAS MATTHEWS
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
20th of May, 1 ham, value 10s., the goods of 



James Bedell; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






JAMES BEDELL
. I am a cheesemonger, and live in Tooley-street. On the 29th of May I hang a ham outside the shop—it was safe at eight o'clock in the evening—I missed it at a quarter to ten.





THOMAS WALKER
. I am a fellmonger, living in Taylor's buildings, Bermondsey. I know the prisoner by sight—on the 29th of May I saw him take the ham from Mr. Bedell's door, and run away with it—I am sure he is the man—I gave information the same night—I have had no quarrel with the prisoner.

Prisoner. If you saw me, why did not you stop me? Witness. I did not give it a thought.

JURY. Q. What o'clock was this? A. Nine o'clock—it was not very dark—I am sure he is the man—I have known him a good while.

Prisoner's Defence. From half-past eight till a quarter after nine o'clock I was with my father and brother, drinking at the Rose public-house, and then I went straight home.





RICHARD CROOK
 (police-constable R 278.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from the Clerk of the Peace for Surrey—(read)—the prisoner is the same person.




GUILTY
.* Aged 23—


Transported for Seven Years.

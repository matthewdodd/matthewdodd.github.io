             sworn. I live at the Golden-lion, Cannon-street, St. George's


. On the 19th of July, the prisoner came to my bar, he asked for half a pint of porter, it was drawn him, he stood at the bar and drank half of it, he went into the tap-room to drink the remainder of the half pint, he then walked towards the door, the pint pot was standing on the table, I saw him stoop down and put it in his breeches, he wore a canvas apron which hid the pot. I stepped up to him, and said, what have you got, he said nothing, I unbuttoned his small clothes and took out the pot, he begged very hard to let him go, he said it was his first offence. I sent for an officer and gave charge of him, he searched him, and in his coat pocket he found another pint pot; that was mine also.
- Fox sworn. I am a constable, I produce the pots.
Prosecutor. They are both mine.
The prisoner said nothing in his defence, call two witnesses, who gave him a good character.

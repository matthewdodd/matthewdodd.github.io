CHARLES SHEPHERD
. I am a carpenter, and live in Britannia-street. This saw and jacket, now produced are mine—I had left them in an unfinished building in King-street, Holborn, on the 6th of August, at half-five o'clock, when I left off work—I missed them at six next morning, when I came to work—they were in the hands of the police.





JOHN SIMS HANDCOCK
. (police-constable E 38.) I heard a noise in the ground-floor of an unfinished building in King-street, Holborn, on the 6th of August—I saw the prisoner on the first-floor—he came down stairs, and came towards a fence which encloses the building, and which is about seven feet high—he got over it—I went up to him, and asked what business he had there—he said he had been to see a servant girl—I said I should take him into custody—he run away—I overtook him—he had on

a flannel jacket, when I first saw him in the building, and when he came out, he had the prosecutor's jacket on over it—I searched the premises, and found the saw placed about three inches from the door, inside, so that it could he taken from under the door outside.
(James and Catherine Hendry, of Chichester-rents, deposed to the prisoner's good character, hut admitted that they were aware of his having been in custody; James Hendry was committed to Newgate.)

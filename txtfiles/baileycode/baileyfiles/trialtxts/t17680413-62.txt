 in Bishopsgate-street


. On Tuesday the 12th of this instant I happened to be in a back-parlour, I heard a noise, I went out; my servant had charged the prisoner with stealing a him; he brought her in, she begged for mercy.

Mr. Burkett. I was informed a person had got a ham, supposed to be my master's; I went out, and found the prisoner with one in an alley, about three doors from our house; I knew the ham to be my master's property, it was taken from off the bulk at the door.
Prisoner's defence.
I never saw it.

            . I am a Police-constable. On Sunday evening, the 2nd of May, I was on duty in Bethnal-green-road, and saw my brother officer with the prisoner in custody - I followed him towards the station-house, and as they were going, he leaned on one side, spoke to a female, and said he gave the duplicate to the ostler in Drury-lane, opposite the theatre, and that the watch was pawned in Drury-lane; I went there the next morning, and found it- the prosecutor's father gave the prisoner into custody.

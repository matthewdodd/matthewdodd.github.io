            . I am a stone mason, No. 2, Portland-road, Marybone. On the 1st of June, I came out of Holborn, crossed Bloomsbury-square, into Great Russell-street


. I saw a man standing on an iron grate, letting himself down into the area. When I came farther on I saw the prisoner stand on the area rails with the lead in his arms. I said to him, halloo, what are you doing there; he threw the lead down directly, and jumped on to the pavement. This was about half past two, on the 1st of June, in the morning. He endeavoured to get away. I seized him in Bloomsbury-square, by the iron rails. The watchman came up; we took him to the watchhouse. The watchman and I took the lead out of the area, and took it to the watchhouse.
MR. DORRINGTON. I am a watchman. I heard the cry of watch between two and three o'clock on the 1st of June. I took the prisoner into custody, and assisted Mr. Coles in taking the lead to the watchhouse.

            . When the lead was taken to Marlborough-street office I assisted in taking it to Mr. Jones's house to see whether it corresponded; it did.

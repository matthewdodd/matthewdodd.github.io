GUILTY
. Aged 9.





JAMES CARN
. I keep a butcher's shop in Kingsgate-street, Holborn. I missed this piece of beef on the 28th of December—I saw the prisoner Joseph in Fisher-street, running as hard as he could, and James Pizey running—I laid hold of Joseph, and brought him back to the shop, and James was brought in by another person, with the beef—Joseph said he knew nothing of it.





WILLIAM PHILLIPS
. I live in King-street. About eleven o'clock in the morning I was near Mr. Cam's shop, and saw the two prisoners together talking, as I thought—I saw James take the beef—the butcher was coming

out—I told him—James went down Kingsgate-street—I followed him, and took him with the beef—Joseph went down Fisher-street.

Joseph Pizey. I was not in company with the other boy, and did not speak to him—I was not in Kingsgate-street that day, till I was taken there by the butchers—I made no attempt to get away. Witness. They were together, and both started together—they were as close as possible when the beef was taken.

JOSEPH PIZEY*—


GUILTY
. Aged 20.
Both 



Transported for Seven Years.

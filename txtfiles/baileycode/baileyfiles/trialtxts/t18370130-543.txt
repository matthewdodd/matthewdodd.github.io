WILLIAM BRYLEY
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
25th of January, 15 tame pigeons, value 15s., the property of 



Henry Adolphus Fisher.






HENRY ADOLPHUS FISHER
. I keep pigeons shut up in an upper room—I missed fifteen on Wednesday the 25th of January—some time after I found two of them alive—I positively swear they are mine—these are them—the value of the whole is 15s.—the other thirteen I never recovered—I have had them a length of time—I swear positively to them, this one in particular—it has lost one feather—I kept the room door locked, and keep the key myself—it was not broken—it was opened by a false key, I suspect—I have seen the prisoner about the neighbourhood for years—I do not know how he gets his bread.





CHARLES KETT
. I am a pigeon-dealer, and live at No. 8, Clubrow Spitalfields. I bought these two pigeons of the prisoner on Wednesday morning, the 25th, about half-past eight o'clock—he brought four into my shop—I bought these two—the other two did not suit me—I did not know Mr. Fisher had lost any, till he came and found them—I gave the prisoner 1s. 3d., the full value of them—I would have sold them for less then 2s.

Prisoner. I declare I never saw that man till he came to Union-ball, and do not know where he lived—I am innocent as a child. Witness. I had not seen him before, but am certain of his person—I paid him the money, and talked to him about them—he said he wanted 1s. 4d. for them—I gave him 1s. 3d.





HENRY ADOLPHUS FISHER

re-examined. Charles Kett described the man who sold them to him, and the prisoner answered the description he gave—the prisoner knew that I kept pigeons—he lived close by formerly, but I do not know where he lived lately—the street door is regularly locked, but there is a string outside the door, and I suppose some person got in that way, and picked open the door of the room.




GUILTY

Transported for Seven Years.

            . I live in Mount-street, Grosvenor Square


; the prisoner was my servant
 from the 18th of February; and on the 22d of March, my wife, in looking up her linen to wash, missed some; she told me of it, and on the Sunday following, she asked to go out; her pocket appeared pretty bulky; my wife insisted on seeing what she had got; she said she would not be examined without a constable; but when we were about sending for one, she pulled out of her pocket the things mentioned in the indictment, (mentioning them by name.) She came to me as a single woman, but in carrying her to the watch-house, we met a man whom she owned to be her husband.
Ann his wife confirmed the account he gave.
Prisoner's Defence.
I don't deny but that I had the things in my pocket: my mistress had the key of the room in her pocket, so that I could not carry them into the room as I intended.

            . On the 25th of May, about half-past nine o'clock in the evening, I was going up Hatton-garden


 with these things tied up in a silk handkerchief; just at the corner of Charles-street


 some one came behind and snatched it from me. I saw a man running down Charles-street towards Field-lane with it; I called out Stop thief! and he dropped it. I found the prisoner in custody at the watch-house in about twenty minutes.

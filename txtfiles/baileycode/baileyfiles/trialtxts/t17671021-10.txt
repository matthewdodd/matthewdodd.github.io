; I had lost things several times; on the 8th of this instant, the prisoner came to ask for a saucepan to dress some muscles; I said if you will dress them yourself, my servant shall help you to it; she dressed them, and had a pint of beer, then moved from that box to another; then about half an hour after ten she was going away; I asked her for the money; I put my hand under her capuchin, there was my saucepan; and on her left side I found a pewter pint pot of mine; the next morning I found another pint of mine in her room, and some pots of other people's.

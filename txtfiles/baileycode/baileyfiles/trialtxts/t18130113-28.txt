            . I keep a public-house
 in Turnmill-street


. The prisoner lived servant
 with me three weeks and four days. She left me about eleven o'clock on the 21st of December. She was putting up the shutters. She put up four, and left one not put up. On the next morning, we found twenty-five shillings in copper gone. We heard of her in the evening, and took her, and found the gown on her at the same time.
- HASELTINE. I am an officer. I apprehended the prisoner in Shoe-lane. I found this gown on her back. She was wearing of it. She said, going down to Peter-street the strings of her pocket broke. The prosecutor was with me. She wanted to know how much she had taken. She said she was drunk when she took it; she did not know how much it was. This is the gown.

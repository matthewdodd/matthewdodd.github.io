                  GEORGE 
                  WRIGHT
               



             sworn. - I am a sailor
: I was in company with the two prisoners on the 22d of last month, at the George, in George-yard, Whitechapel


, between eight and nine o'clock in the evening; we had half a pint of gin to drink; then after that, we had another; then she took me round the neck, pretending to kiss me, and put her hand into my right-hand pocket and took out a brown purse.
Q. Did you perceive her put her hand into your pocket? - A. No; I had just before taken the purse out of my breeches pocket, to get change, to pay for half a pint of gin, to Mrs. Sherwood, the landlady; she would not give me change; she said I had smaller moneyin my pocket, and I gave her a seven-shilling piece to take for it; she gave me a dollar, a shilling, and four-pence in halfpence; I then put my purse into my right hand waistcoat pocket; 
               
                  Sarah 
                  Rumbold
               



             was sitting by the side of me.
Q. How soon after this was it she put her hands about your neck? - A. I suppose in the course of about five minutes; Jackson went out almost directly, and she allowed in about five minutes; I did not miss my purse till Mrs. Sherwood wanted me to leave my money with her; that was directly after 
               
                  Sarah 
                  Rumbold
               



             went out; I felt for my purse, and found it missing; it contained a 2 l. note and a seven-shilling piece; when Mrs. Sherwood laid down the dollar, Rumbold took it up before my face.
Q. Did you not quarrel about it? - A. That I said nothing about.
Prisoner Jackson. Q. Do you charge me with the money you lost? - A. No, only your receiving it of 
               
                  Sarah 
                  Rumbold
               



            .
Jackson. Q. He wanted to fight and quarrel with me all the time we were in the house? - A. No such thing; I said if the girl liked to go with him he might go with her; if not she might go with me.


                  ELIZABETH 
                  SHERWOOD
               



             sworn. - My husband keeps the George.
Q. Do you remember the night of Jackson and Rumbold coming together into your house? - A. Yes, the d of last month; they had either three or four half-pints, I cannot say which; Wright was somewhat the horse for liquor, but very little; he asked me to take payment for the gin out of a 2 l. note; I refused changing it, telling him he had smaller change; he then gave me a seven-shilling piece; I gave him a dollar and shilling, and fourpence; Rumbold took the dollar before his face and mine.
Q. He did not object to that? - A. No he did not.
Q. Where did he put the 2 l. note after you refused to change it? - A. In a small purse in his right hand waistcoat pocket, Jackson went and spoke to him at the bar, was rather the worse for liquor, but not drunk; he not pay any part of the gin, he said he was going me to get a fire for 
               
                  Sarah 
                  Rumbold
               



            , for she was going to stay with George, then Sarah Rumbold went out in less than ten minutes I asked 
               
                  George 
                  Wright
               



             to see me his 2 l. note that he might not lose it, when ting his hand in his pocket he found it was gone; instantly went out to the Office myself; it was between eight and nine; I got a couple of Officers, and her searching several public-houses we found them at the Black Swan, going to bed; it was at the first house down Rose-lane, and they were taken into custody.
SUSANNAH MILES sworn. - I was in Sherwood's tap-room on the 22d of November last; I saw Jackson, Sarah Rumbold, and Wright, there; they were ing at the same table and I opposite to them; I saw 
               
                  Sarah 
                  Rumbold
               



             put her hand about his neck, with a ence to kiss him, and took a little bag out of his left hand pocket, and give it to Thomas Jackson; Jackson went out almost directly after; Sarah Rumbold t out in about five minutes.
Q. What did you do? - A. I sat where I was till Sherwood challenged me with it, and then I told her.
Q. How near did you set to Wright? - A. A great off, I suppose the length of this table.
Q. When you saw a theft of this sort committed, how came you not to take notice of it? - A. Because I did not wish to trouble my head with it, if I could help it.
Q. What are you? - A. An unfortunate woman.
Q. Do you know either 
               
                  Sarah 
                  Rumbold
               



             or Jackson? - A. Yes, I have known them a good bit; I never knew any harm of them before.
Q.(To Mrs. Sherwood.) Do you know the last witness? - A. Yes; by using my house, the same as the others.
Q. She did not sit at the same table with these people? - A. No; she sat on a bench towards the fire, about two yards from Wright.


                  THOMAS 
                  GRIFFITHS
               



             sworn. - I am an officer belonging to Lambeth-street, Whitechaple.
Q. Do you remember Mrs. Sherwood sending for you? - A. Yes; on the 22d of November she came down to the Flying-horse, Lambeth-street; I called Nowlan, my brother officer, and we went in search of the prisoners in different places, and next door to the Black Swan, in Rose-lane, Spitalfields, we found them; we went up one pair of stairs, we knocked at the door some time before they would open it, it was bolted on the inside, I believe; when I opened it, 
               
                  Sarah 
                  Rumbold
               



             was sitting on one side of the bed undressed, and Jackson at the foot of the bed with his clothes on, he rather flew in a passion, and wanted to know what business we had there; I told him we came to look for a two pound note, and a seven-shilling-piece; I looked about the bed and found 
               
                  Sarah 
                  Rumbold
               



            's pockets, lying on the bed; in her pocket I found the eleven shillings and sixpence in silver, ten shillings, and three sixpences, and eight shillings in penny-pieces and halfpence, I turned them out on the table, and counted them; Nowlan searched Jackson, but found nothing upon him; I then asked him how he came by that money, I mistrusted they had changed a two pound note; Jackson said, no, it is money that I gave her; 
               
                  Sarah 
                  Rumbold
               



             immediately said, it was not his money, it was her's; we then searched the room, Jackson knocked the candle out once or twice, he was very obstinate, he said the house should not be searched, they had nothing there but their own; we then got a light, and searched the house again, but found nothing more, we then took him into custody; on the road going to the watch-house, I asked Jackson how he could be such a fool to get into a hobble to rob this poor sailor; he said, he was very sorry, and if he had not been drunk he would have had nothing to do with it; we then took him to the watch-house, and in the morning, when we took them out, he begged to go to his master, and he would get the money, and make it good to the sailor.
Q. On the over-night, did he appear to you to be drunk? - A. Yes; Jackson was very much so, Rumbold was not; I asked Rumbold in the morning where she had changed the note; she said she could not tell; I then asked her what she had done with the remainder of the money; she said she could not tell, that was all she had; and she could not tell whether it was a one-pound note or a two-pound note.
Prisoner Jackson. Q. Can you say, positively, I had any of that man's money? - A, No.
Rumbold's defence. That gentleman sent that young woman to me, and she came to me before I was out of bed and said 
               
                  George 
                  Wright
               



             wanted to see me, at theGeorge; I went up, and she was sitting by him by the fire; he called for a quartern of gin, and parted it between that girl and me; he asked me if I would go abroad with him in the Royal George, lying at Gravesend; we were all drinking together, he was so much in liquor he did not know whether he gave the money or lost it; the officer came to my room and took out one pound six shillings, and two duplicates.
Q.(To Prosecutor.) Had you seen this girl in the morning? - A. Yes.
Q. The other girl with her? - A. Yes.
Q. You had some gin then? - A. Yes.
Jackson's defence. I drank some of the liquor with them, but I never handled a farthing of his money.

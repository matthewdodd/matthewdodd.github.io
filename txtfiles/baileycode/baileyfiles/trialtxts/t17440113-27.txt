            . On Tuesday the 27th of December, about seven o'clock in the evening, there came one to our house to know whether Mrs. Wild lodged in our house, and if I said she lodged in my house, he was to desire my wife or I to come directly to him. He shewed me some clogs that he had bought, he asked me if they were mine, I told him yes. I asked Mr. Pardue whether he had any more, and this young man Matthews went up and brought down what he could find, which was five or six pair more - The Prisoner was afterwards stopped.
Q. Who stopped her?
Buck. Mr. Pardue the pawnbroker stopped her; I went with her before the Justice, and she confessed the taking the clogs.

                  Matthews 
               



            . I am servant to Mr. Pardue, the Prisoner brought these clogs to my master's shop, my master asked her several questions, and among the rest he asked her where she lived; she said she lived in the country, and that she brought these clogs to town with her to sell. She brought two or three pair one day, and another pair at night, and the next day more, and my master thought by her bringing so many, that she did not come honestly by them, and I went after her to the place where she said she lived, so we came to find it out.
Q. Did the Prisoner live in your house?
Buck. She did lodge in my house, and her husband may be there at this time for what I know.

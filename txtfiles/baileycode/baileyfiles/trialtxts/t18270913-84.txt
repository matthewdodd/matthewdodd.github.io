GEORGE POCOCK. I was going across Clements'-inn


 on the 27th of July, a little before ten o'clock in the evening; I felt something at my pocket - I turned and saw the prisoner dropping this handkerchief from him - it was about half way between his hand and the ground when I saw it. I took hold of him, and had a great difficulty in taking him - in going down Pickett-street, I met a person, who tried to assist me - the prisoner struck at him, and he retreated; the prisoner then struck me violently, and made my nose bleed; he got from me for a moment, but was taken at the coach-stand, and the watchman came up.

            . I am a constable. I assisted in taking the prisoner from a tobacconist's-shop, where the prosecutor had taken him - he struggled very much.
Prisoner's Defence. The prosecutor turned round, and said I had taken his handkerchief. I said I was not there - he then struck me with his umbrella, and he first said there was a mark on the handkerchief, but there was not - there was a boy five or six yards from me - he passed him to come to me - he took the handkerchief off the ground - I had not had it.
MR. POCOCK. I thought at first there was a mark on it, but it is washed out; I have not the least doubt of its being mine.

            ; I took the prisoner in to live with me as a servant
; she came on the 30th of May; she went away without my knowledge. I had missed things several times; by an accident I found out a pawnbroker's she used; I found a shift there; she came there again the next day, and the pawnbroker stopt her; she then confessed taking all my things; she owned that she had sold the gown to a Jew for seven shillings.
(The pawnbroker produced the goods the prisoner had pawned, which the prosecutrix deposed to.)

I intended to go into the country, and I had no money.

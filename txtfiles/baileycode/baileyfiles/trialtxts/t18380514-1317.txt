Solomon Solomon, his master.






SOLOMON SOLOMON
. I live in Cartwright-street, Rosemary-lane. The prisoner was in my service—on the 25th of April I sent him with my son to get some salt—I gave them 17s. 6d. in silver, and 20s. in copper—I put it into the cart—my son returned alone, and gave me information—I did not see the prisoner again till he was in custody.





NATHANIEL SOLOMON
. I went in the cart with the prisoner—as we ware going along, one of the papers of halfpence broke, and he said, "May I put them into my cap?"—I told him he might—he did so, and then put them into the cloth—when we got to the City Basin, I went to order the salt—I had to wait there, and while I was waiting there he ran away with the money.
(The prisoner received a good character.)




GUILTY
. Aged 17.—


Transported for Seven Years.

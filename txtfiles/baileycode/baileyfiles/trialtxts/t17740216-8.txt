             . I am coachman to Mr. Lockwood, in Edward-street, Cavendish-square


. On the 16th of January I brought the coach from the stable to my master's door; I left my coat on the box, and went back to lock the stable. I was not gone above a minute and a half; when I was about five or six yards behind the coach, I saw the shadow of a man by the coach; I went to the box directly, and missed my coat; I looked round and saw a man run round the corner toward Cavendish-square; I pursued him and took him with my coat under his arm. I took him to my master, and then he said he was not the man I took the coat from; (the coat produced). My master's name was wrote on the lining of the pocket by the man that made it.
Prisoner's Defence.
I found the coat by the side of the coach as I was going along.

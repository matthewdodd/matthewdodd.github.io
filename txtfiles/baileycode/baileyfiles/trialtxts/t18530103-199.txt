conducted the Prosecution.






BERNARD JEWILL
. I live at No. 79, St. George's-street, opposite the London Docks. On Saturday night, 18th Dec., I had been at my brother's house in Mile End-road—I left there about half past 12 o'clock—in returning home I had to go down Neptune-street—when I passed right opposite the Cock and Neptune public house, I saw Carr, Chesney, and several others—Carr shoved me with his arm, which caused me to go off the pavement into the road—he did not push me off, I went off of my own accord—on turning round, I do not live above six doors round the corner, when within three doors of my own house, Carr and Chesney came after me—Chesney threw his arm round my neck, and another one from behind put his arm tightly round my throat, and pressed my windpipe—I could not scream, I was obliged to haw—they pressed me in that way that they almost took my breath—while this was doing, Chesney was hitting me in the eye with his fist, and every blow that he took fire flew from my eye—I suppose he struck me half a dozen times—with that they must have been disturbed—I had my hand on my watch, which was in my right hand waistcoat pocket, to hold it with both my hands—they tore the guard chain from my watch—they held my head up in this way, and one of them pinched my hand with his nails, it is scarcely better yet—they were disturbed, or probably they might have rifled my pockets—they threw me in the mud, and ran away and left me—they took nothing from me but my guard chain—I saved my watch by pressing my hands against the pocket—they tore the chain off the swivel—it was a swivel chain round my throat—here is the swivel to the watch now—I did not know either of these men before—I saw Carr and Chesney at the public house door—it was Carr that had his arm round my neck at the time of the robbery.

Cross-examined by
MR. BALLANTINE. Q. Two of these young men have said that they were not the persons? A. I do not know; I did not hear what they said at the police court—I had some hesitation in knowing these men because they have different dresses on—I am sixty-eight years old—I use glasses when I write or read—I had not my glasses on that night—I had not been using any other glasses that night—I had not been rather convivial—I never take spirits or wine except on very particular occasions—I am a tailor and outfitter—there is generally a crowd of these kind of men opposite the public house.

MR. W. J. PAYNE. Q. You were perfectly sober? A. Yes—I am certain of these two men.





JOHN SULLIVAN
. I live at No. 2, Queen-street, Wapping. I recollect the night of 18th Dec.—I recollect being in Neptune-street, round the square, near the Cock and Neptune—I saw the last witness there, and Carr and Chesney came one on each side of him, and looked at him—I knew him before by going to his house—I asked Carr and Chesney to buy a box of lucifers of me—there were 500 in a box—they told me to run away home, or they would give me in charge of a policeman—there was a policeman near the Sailor's Home, and then seeing him, they let the old gentleman pass them by—I went to a pair of large doors and hid myself—it was before he passed the Cock and Neptune that these men went and looked at him—it was up in the square, a lonesome place, very dark—I hid myself and watched, and I saw Carr put his arm round his neck to choke him, and Chesney hit him in the eye—I saw Swanton there—he took hold of Mr. Jewill's coat to pull him back—a gentleman and lady were coming down the street, and they disturbed

these men, and they chucked the old gentleman down on the ground and ran away—before they threw him down there were four men, and I saw the fourth man putting his arm round Mr. Jewill's neck, and he pulled the guard up—it was a gold guard—I should know that fourth man if I were to see him—he succeeded in getting the chain—he pulled it up, the man who is not here.

Cross-examined. Q. You do not seem to be very great friends with these men? A. No Sir, because they are rogues—they do not sell lucifer matches—one of Chesney's pals said she would take my life—I have a mother—I know I must not tell lies—I would not tell a lie for anybody—I know Mr. Jewill—I am sure I have no quarrel with Carr—I was only locked up once—a man hit me and I hit him again, and they locked us both up, but they let us go again—I was thirteen years old last New Year's day.

COURT. Q. Who did you offer the lucifers to? A. To Carr and Chesney—they were then in the square, that was just as Mr. Jewill passed.

MR. BALLANTINE. Q. What made you offer them to them? A. Because I thought they were drunk or something, and that they would buy some—they were not drunk—they told me to be off home, or they would give me in charge of a policeman.

COURT. Q. You had not known this third man before? A. No; I did not see him do anything, only pulling his coat.





WILLIAM SPECKMAN
 (policeman, H 56). I took Swanton and Carr in custody—I told them what it was for—Carr asked me what time they said it was done—I said I did not know—I took them on Sunday the 19th, in Well-street—they were both together—I had not seen them together before—Swanton did not say anything—I told them I took them for assaulting and robbing Mr. Jewill.





DANIEL KIMBERLY
 (police sergeant, H 32). I took Chesney, on Sunday the 19th, facing the Cock and Neptune—I told him I wanted him, for assaulting an old gentleman—he said, "You are mistaken this time"—I told him I did not think I was—he said, "What time was it done?"—I said I did not know—he said he was in bed, and he said afterwards that he heard something about it, and he came down on purpose to see.
(The prisoner's statements before the Magistrate were here read, as follows:)—Carr says, "I was going home and met this young man (Swanton) who asked me where he could get a lodging; I told him, and I went home; I was awoke by a girl, who told me Catharine Carthy was locked up; I went, and saw Swanton—I know nothing of this occurrence; I have witnesses to prove that I was in bed"—Chesney says," I went to a public house in Front-change, no Sunday morning; the publican said that sergeant Foay had asked him where I lodged, and the publican said he did not know; I had not been in; he said Foay wanted me, on suspicion of a robbery in the highway; I have witnesses to prove that I was in bed at the time—Swanton says nothing.

Witnesses for the Defence.






ANN FARRELL
. I know Carr—I lodged as servant at the same house where he lodged, No. 2, New-court, Gravel-lane—I slept in the same room that night—Carr came home about 12 o'clock that night—I cannot say exactly the time for two or three minutes—I saw him go to bed—I did not go to sleep—Carr afterwards awoke up, about 2 o'clock—he had been asleep between 12 and 2 o'clock—he asked me whether Catharine had come in—I went out to the corner shop, about three minutes before Carr came in, to see what time it was—I went because the girls were out so late—it was about 3 or 4 minutes before 12 o'clock.


Cross-examined by
MR. PAYNE. Q. You cannot say exactly what time it was? A. No, not exactly—when I was at the corner shop it was 3 or 4 minutes before 12 o'clock—I went there for a candle—I am servant at that house—girls stop in it—there was no man there but Carr—I remember the night—he was in the night before, about 12 o'clock—I do not know how he gets his living—he came home this night about 12 o'clock, and went to bed, not with me—I kept awake—I lald down by the fire, with my head on a pillow, because I was expecting the girls home—there was nobody there but me and him, but there was another girl upstairs—the girls did not come in that night; they were locked up—I went to sleep—I dare say it might be 4 o'clock when I went off to sleep—I dare say that house is half a mile from the place where the man was robbed—I know where the Cock and Neptune is—that cannot be far off what I said, half a mile from this house—those girls generally sleep in that room, and this man Carr—I never saw him do anything either honest or dishonest—I have not been long living there—I do not know a boy named John Sullivan—I did not say I would have his life—I am not the woman that said that; I am certain of it.





JOHN SULLIVAN

re-examined. Yes, this is the woman that said she would have my life. Witness. No, I did not.

COURT. Q. Did any woman say it in your presence? A. No; the woman who was with me did not say it, to my knowledge—there were two women with me, Mary Willis and Catharine M'Carthy; they were outside—nobody spoke to this boy, to my knowledge—I went down twice—I mean to swear on my oath that neither I nor any of these women told this boy they would have his life—I do not know what they said about it, but they said they knew that the chaps were innocent, and it was a shame they should be taken up—it was 4 minutes to 12 o'clock when I was in the corner shop—I came in doors, and lit the candle, and sat down on a chair for about an hour and a half afterwards; and after Carr had gone off to sleep, and had been in bed about an hour, I took a pillow from his bed—I found him in the house when I came in from the corner shop—I am certain he was not in when I went out, and he was in when I came back—I was servant in the house—I had a shilling a week, and my victuals and lodging—I now live with Catharine M'Carthy—she lives with Carr—she is a woman on the streets.





RICHARD WILLIS
. I live at No. 11, New-court, New Gravel-lane. I know Carr and Swanton—Carr did live at No. 2, in the same court—Swanton has got no place at all—I remember both Carr and Swanton coming to my house on the 18th, between 8 and 9 o'clock—they had some supper with me, and Swanton slept at my house that night—he went to bed about 5 minutes past 10 o'clock—he went away in the morning, between 10 and 11 o'clock—he was there all night to my knowledge—I saw Carr leave my house between 10 and 11 o'clock—I could not say rightly where he went to—I know he left the house.

Cross-examined by
MR. PAYNE
. Q. What are you? A. A labourer; I work at the Docks—I have not worked above two months at the Docks—and then I only get a job occasionally, like a good many more—I really do not know what Swanton is—he is a labouring man—we had a bit of bread and cheese for supper, and a drop of threepenny beer—me and my wife, and Carr and Swanton—we sat at the table—we had no tablecloth—we had nothing but bread and cheese—it was Dutch cheese—we had one pot of beer between us—it began a little before 10 o'clock—we were talking from between 8 and 9 o'clock, till a little before 10 o'clock—I did not go before the Magistrate—I was spoken to about coming to give evidence about a week ago.


Q. But how can you fix on that particular night? A. Because I am speaking the truth—He that sent me into the world gave me the truth to tell—I know that Carr lived with a woman of the town—Swanton lives with nobody that I know of—I knew that Catharine M'Carthy was a prostitute—Swanton slept in a bed up stairs by himself, no one with him—he went to bed a few minutes after 10 o'clock—he did not come out till the next morning, between 10 and 11 o'clock—he had no breakfast—I went to bed about 11 o'clock; I slept down in the front room along with my wife—I know he did not go out, because I always lock the door at 12 o'clock—he went to bed at five minutes past 10 o'clock—he did not go out—I went in his bedroom three or four times to see if everything was right—I did not expect anything wrong, but I always go upstairs—I went up first about half past 10 o'clock, the second time about a quarter of an hour afterwards—I do not know what made me go up—I went up the third time, just before twelve o'clock—I left my warm bed, and went upstairs to see if every thing was right—I did not go a fourth time—when I went the first time he was asleep, the second time he was asleep, and the third time he was asleep—I cannot say that he was snoring—I went three times between five minutes past 10 o'clock, and a little before 12 o'clock, and found him asleep each time.

COURT. Q. Who locked the door that night? A. Myself; I went to bed at 11 o'clock, but I got up again, and locked the door—my house is a lodging house, no one slept in the room with Swanton, but there might be lodgers come in; I have four rooms beside my own—there was only a young girl lodged there that night, who was in the next room to him—she went to bed a little before 12 o'clock.

Q. How came Carr to be supping at your house that night? A. Being a neighbour—he is not a companion of Swanton's to my knowledge—they came together that night—the girl was not there when we had supper—I do not know how old the girl is—I do not know her name—that was the only night she lodged there; I let her myself—I do not know who she was.

JURY. Q. What have you lived on since you left your Docks? A. One thing or another, I sometimes sell a little vegetables—I take in any girl to lodge if the house is not full—I cannot inquire of every one.





ROBERT GOSNELL
. I live at No. 7, Gower's-row, Whitechapel. I know Chesney by his lodging at the same house that I do—he slept in the same room with me—he slept in the same room on Saturday evening, the 18th—I have slept in the same room five weeks, ever since he has been lodging there—I went to bed at 12 o'clock that evening; he went to bed at the same time—we went up at the same time—I did not go to sleep directly, I might lie awake about a quarter of an hour—I found Chesney in the room when I got up; he was asleep—I did not hear any disturbance in the night; all was quiet—he could not have gone out without the landlord and landlady knowing it—he must come down and pass through the room where they slept—I slept in the same room with him, not in the same bed—the door is fastened inside—it is not a noisy door.

Cross-examined by
MR. PAYNE. Q. What are you? A. A labourer; I work at the wharfs, or anything I can get—I worked on Saturday at Customhouse Quay—I live in Gower's-row—I know the Cock and Neptune, but never was in it; it is a mile, or a mile and a half from my house.

Q. On your solemn oath, is it a quarter of a mile? A. I never was in the house—it is more than half a quarter—I could not walk it in two minutes; I do not think I could walk it in two minutes—I do not think I could walk it in three—I am a little lame—I do not know whether a person

who could walk could do it in two minutes—Chesney did not sup with me—he had no supper—I do not know what he is—I never ask any questions of anybody in the house; I hare no acquaintance with anything—I go out in the morning and come in at night—I have not the least idea how he gets his living—a young man, named Green, was in the room that night—I have nothing particular to recollect that day, but that was the day this man got in trouble—I was not present when he was taken—I cannot tell you what time he went to bed on the 17th nor on the 16th, nor any night in that week, but I can tell that night because he was with me—I slept very soundly that night—I came home at 12 o'clock and went to bed—I might he awake a few minutes—I awoke about 6 o'clock in the morning—I believe I was fast asleep all night—whether anybody went out while I was asleep I cannot tell.

COURT. Q. Did you come in at 12 o'clock? A. Yes; I came in with him—I had been to have a pint of beer at a man's of the name of Salter, a beer shop in Back Church-lane—Chesney came in at the same time with me, and a young man named Green—we had been at the beershop an hour or an hour and a half—it wanted 10 minutes to 12 by Mr. Salter's clock when the potman said it was time to go, and our beer was gone and we went—I should think it is half a mile from the Cock and Neptune to Back Church-lane—I saw this boy, Sullivan, down below—I did not speak to him; no one did in my presence—none of the women did in my presence—I can swear that—I have seen no one—I did not put my fist in his face, and say I would serve him out—I did not see any one do it—I did not hold my fist up at him at all.





JOHN WILLIAMS
. I live at No. 7, Gower's-row, Whitechapel. The last witness is a lodger of mine—he goes by the name of Robert; I do not know his other name—I know Chesney—I know he was taken up—I know he came to my house on the night before, on the night of the 18th, and went up to bed before the clock struck 12—I observed he was just in time—I cannot say that I saw him in the morning—he sleeps in the one pair room with four other men, five altogether—I sleep down-stairs myself, so that no one can come in or go out without my seeing them—there is not a passage; the door comes in the room from the street—they go through the room in which I live, the lower room—if he had gone out after I went to bed he must have come through my room—I never let any one out after I go to bed—I put the key in my pocket—I am the first up in the morning—I unlock the door—I did so that morning—the door was locked when I unlocked it in the morning—I unlocked them both—there is a kitchen at the bottom of the garden—my room does not open into any other room—there are steps from the stairs that go out in the yard.

Cross-examined. Q. How many persons lodge in your house? A. Eighteen; five in one room, four in another, and there is a room for married people, three couples sleep there—I do not require to see the marriage certificate—my lodgers are mostly men that work in the Docks—I have heard that Chesney is a person that drives a van—I never saw him do so—when a person goes out at 6 o'clock in the morning, and comes in at 12 o'clock at night, I never inquire about him.

Q. Who came home with Chesney that night? A. Gosnell, nobody else; he came in and went straight up to bed—he was taken the next day—I did not go before the Magistrate—the officer came to my house, and asked me the description of the person—I said there was such a person lived there, and he was in bed the night before—I cannot say that I saw him go away on Sunday morning after I unlocked the door; those that sleep in the house go out what time they think fit—my wife sleeps in the room with me, and all

the persons pass my room to go out—they all sleep upstairs—Chesney had not a wife—four single men and himself sleep in that room.

COURT. Q. Then there were four other persons slept in that room? A. Yes; Robert and Chesney, that was two—the other three are not here—one was named Watson, one James, and the other Wilson, nobody else—Chesney and Gosnell came in together—there was nobody with them.

Q. Was there a man of the name of Green slept in that room? A. Yes, there was Green.

Q. Why did not you mention that before you told me there were only five before; were there six slept in that room? A. No; yes, there were six that night—Green slept there, in one end of the room.

Q. Will you undertake to swear that Green did not come in with them? A. I only saw Robert and Chesney come in together.

Q. If Robert has said that Green came in with them that is not truth, is it? A. I cannot say that I saw the third one come in, he might have come in before—I made an observation to him that he was just in time—he was as late as he could be—I have not been in company with the other witnesses outside, there is none that I know—I did not hear anything pass with that boy Sullivan—I did not hear any of the women speak to him.

MR. PAYNE
to
JOHN SULLIVAN. Q. Do you recollect Ann Farrell saying anything to you down below? A. Yes; she swore that she would have my life if they got anything done to—there were two other women with her, one had a black eye—I saw the man Gosnell, and another man down below—they said they would have the boy, or else the policeman would have their life—Gosnell held his hand up—the woman said she would have my life; she would kill me if anything was done to these men.





GIBSON GARRETT
 (policeman, H 213). On Monday afternoon I was in the hall of this Court—I saw Farrell, and eight or ten men and women there—I saw this boy there—I heard Farrell say to him, "I will have your life before we have done with you"—I heard her say them words myself—I heard this man (Gosnell) say, "We will have him away from the b—before we have done;" and he said he would have his b—head off, by shaking his fist in the boy's face—that was in presence of Farrell—they were all in company, eight or ten.

COURT
to
RICHARD WILLIS. Q. In this deposition Carr says he was awoke up at 2 o'clock, and then he went and saw Swanton; did he come and see Swanton? A. I swear he did not come into my house that night—he came the next morning between 10 and 11 o'clock, and Swanton and Carr went out together.

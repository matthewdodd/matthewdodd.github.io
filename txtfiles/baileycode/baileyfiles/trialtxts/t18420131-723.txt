FRANCIS EDWARDS
. I am a tailor, and live in Newgate-street. On Saturday afternoon, the 29th of January, in consequence of information I received, I ran into the street, and overtook the prisoner Smith, with a coat

belonging to me, marked 21s.—I found him in the archway of St. Bartholomew's-hospital—he was concealed in one corner of the archway—the coat was on his arm—in taking him to the station the prisoner Brown came up, and I asked the policeman to take him also—Smith said at the station that Brown had taken the coat and given it to him to run away with—Brown said nothing whatever.





JACOB SIMMONS
. I live at No. 3, Lamp-alley, Sun-street, Bishopsgate—I am fifteen years old—I was in Newgate-street, opposite Mr. Edwards's door, and saw the two prisoners take two coats off a block, and drop one—one of them took the two, I cannot tell which, they were both together—they dropped one on the floor, and went off with the other—a little boy picked up the coat that was dropped, and took it into the shop—I went in and gave information, and then I ran after them—the prosecutor followed me, and on turning into Giltspur-street, I saw both the prisoners—Smith went up against St. Bartholomew's hospital, and was found just within the gateway—Brown followed him, and joined us when Smith was taken—I pointed him out—I am sure they were together when the coats were taken, and they both ran away together.





HENRY GARDINER
 (City police-constable, No. 527.) I took the prisoners, and produce the coat.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

BROWN†—


GUILTY
. Aged 17.—

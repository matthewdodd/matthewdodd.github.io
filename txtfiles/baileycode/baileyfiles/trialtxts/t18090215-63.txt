            , junior, and myself; our warehouse is in William street, Bridewell hospital


.
Q. On the 4th of February was the prisoner in your employ - A. He was.
Q. You had reason to suspect the prisoner - A. I had.
Q. Had you a servant
 of the name of Conelius Walker - A. I had.
Q. From any information that 
               
                  Cornelius 
                  Walker
               



             gave you did you observe any thing of the prisoner - A. I merely observed that he was going to dinner about one o'clock, I called him back and asked him if he knew of any person that was robbing of us; to which he answered, no; I then asked him if he robbed us himself; he denied it. I sent for a constable.
Q. Where was this - A. In our private accompting house. And having information where the oil was concealed I desired the constable to search his beeches. The constable found a cannister containing some spermacetroii concealed apparently under the waistband of his breeches; it was in a tin cannister made flat for the express purpose of concealing the oil.
Q. Had you oil of that description in your warehouse at that time - A. A great quantity of oil like that.
Q. I believe you cannot swear to the identity of this oil - A. No; only we had some oil like that.
Q. How long had he lived with you - A. I am not quite certain - from four to six months.


                  CORNELIUS 
                  WALKER
               



            . Q. Were you in the employ of sir 
               
                  Charles 
                  Price
               



             on the 4th of February last - A. I was warehouseman.
Q. Were you directed by Mr. 
               
                  Ralph 
                  Price
               



             to watch this man - A. Three or four days previous I was. On the 4th I was directed to observe him and to inform Mr. Price when he went out of the yard; I observed him, through a key hole, to go up into the loft after he was clean.
Q. Was it customary for persons in his kind of employment to go there after they were cleaned - A. I conceive they have no occasion to go there after they are clean. I immediately gave information when he was going out of the yard.

                  WHEELER
               



            . I am a constable. On the 4th of February I searched the prisoner, I found this tin cannister upon him, I took it from his small clothes, under his apron.
Q. Was it inside of the waistband or outside - A. Rather inside, covered over with his apron; I took it out from that part; the cannister contained two quarts and better than half a pint of spermaceti oil; the tin cannister of oil was was kept up by his small cloathes, and covered over with his apron. There was another accused as well as him; he was discharged by the magistrate. The prisoner did not say any thing as I observed.
Mr. Price. The cannister contains sperm oil, such as we have in our premises.
Prisoner's Defence. My lord and gentlemen of the jury, I am now truly sensible of my error, and hope that when your lordship and the gentlemen hears my case, you and they will have mercy on my unfortunate situation. The oil for which I am here was, as I am led to believe, among the men in the warehouse, a perquisite that they in general had themselves, it was the drainings of every returned cask; my wages being little, and my wife and young child being dangerously ill, I unfortunately took the oil to keep a light for them; and that down to this time I always bore a good character for honesty and sobriety. I have a wife and three children. I crave the clemency of the jury.
Mr. Price. The oil is good oil, it is not drainings from the casks; I never heard of such a thing as perquisites in my life.

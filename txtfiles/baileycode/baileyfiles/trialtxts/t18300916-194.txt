            , of the Poultry


. On the 30th of July the prisoner came into the shop with another young man; his companion asked for a silk handkerchief; I was behind the counter serving him, which took my attention, but I saw the prisoner take the handkerchief, and put it into his pocket; it was on the counter close to him; I laid hold of him, and charged him with the theft; he denied it; I drew the handkerchief out of his pocket myself; his companion immediately walked off, without waiting for the handkerchief I was serving him with; the prisoner said he had bought it; he had not asked for one himself.

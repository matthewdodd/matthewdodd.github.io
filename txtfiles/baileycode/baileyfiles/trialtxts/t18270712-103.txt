            . I am the wife of Thomas McKell, who has been in the Army
, but is now superannuated. On the 26th of June I was moving, and employed the prisoner to move a box, containing linen and other things - it was not locked, but corded; she had seen me put the things into it. I soon afterwards saw a shawl concealed inside her gown - it was my grand-daughter's, and had been in the box. I afterwards saw her intoxicated - I went to the box, and missed the linen and shoes.
Prisoner. Q. Did not you take me into a public-house, and give me some gin? A. I did in the morning, and sent for some early in the morning; I only took her to one public-house.

            . I am a constable. I searched the prisoner - she denied all knowledge of the property. I found five duplicates on her, which do not relate to this property; I asked if she had any more - she said No, but I found two in her bosom, which relate to the property; she was nearly drunk, but McKell was quite sober.

            . I am shopman to Mr. Perkins, a pawnbroker. The prisoner pawned a remnant of linen, for 2s. 6d., and a pair of shoes, for 1s. 6d., at differenttimes, on the 26th of June, in the name of Leonard - she appeared sober.
Prisoner's Defence. She gave me them to pawn, and we spent the money in gin.

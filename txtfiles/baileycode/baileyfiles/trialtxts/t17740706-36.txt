Thomas Lane, I am a sawyer

; as I was coming home on Saturday the 11th of June I met the prisoner in Rosemary-lane; she asked me to go home with her; I was a little in liquor, I went with her; I had the money mentioned in the indictment in a purse.
Q. Did you make any bargain what you was to give her?
Lane. Sixpence.
Q. Did you go to bed with her?
Lane. I lay upon the bed, I did not go into bed, I lay upon the bed with her about two minutes, then she ran down stairs and said she would get a light; she never came up again, and immediately I missed my money.
Q. Was it a dark or light place that you picked her up in?
Lane. A dark place, but I knew her before; I took her up the next morning, but I did not find any of my money upon her.
Prisoner's Defence.
I never saw the man before in my life.

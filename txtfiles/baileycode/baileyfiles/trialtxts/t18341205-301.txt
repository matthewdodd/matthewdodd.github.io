MATTHEW PEAK
. I am an officer. On Monday, the 8th of December, I was in Chiswell-street, at a quarter past five o'clock—I saw the prisoner, in company with another boy, on the opposite side of the way—I saw something under the prisoner's coat—I crossed, and asked what he had got—he said, "Nothing"—I laid hold of him, and took the snuff-box from under his coat—I said, "Where did you get this?"—he said, "I found it down Milton-street"—I then took him to the station-house, and then before the magistrate, but as we could not find the owner, he was set at liberty—I then found the owner, and took him again.





THOMAS WILSON STRUDWICK
. I live at No. 35, Noble-street. This is my box. I did not miss it till the policeman brought it—it is worth 15s.—it is one I kept in the window, and it must have been taken from there.





MARY HARRIS
. I saw the box safe between one and two o'clock, in the window.

Prisoner's Defence. I was discharged, and the magistrate told me to come on the Saturday for the box—I was going, and was taken.




GUILTY
. Aged 17.—


Transported for Seven Years.

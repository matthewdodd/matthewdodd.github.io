, with a wheelbarrow, with a box in it; I asked for the key of it, he felt in his pocket, and said he could not find it - I broke it open and found this blue coat and this bit of canvas; the prisoner said he did not know how they came there, nor what they were; he afterwards said some man whom he did not know, gave him 1s. to take it out.

GEORGE WILLIAMS
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
26th of June, 65 yards of printed cotton, value 30s., the goods of 



John Goss Fleay.






JANE SMITH
. I am the wife of Samuel Smith, and live at Lewisham, in Kent. About four o'clock on the 26th of June, I was near the shop of John Goss Fleay, and saw the prisoner and another standing at his door, and presently the prisoner had this bundle—the other, who was a very respectable looking man, took it off a bundle of prints in the lobby, and gave it into the prisoner's apron—they went off, one, one way, and the other, the other.





JOSEPH JAMES WALTERS
. I am a coachman. I was standing at the Centurion about four o'clock that evening, and saw the prisoner come along with a bundle—soon afterwards I saw the prosecutor's young man and the policeman—I gave them information, and took the prisoner with this bundle—it contained this print.





JOHN CARTLEY
 (police-constable R 85.) I took the prisoner—the bundle was by his legs on the ground.





CHARLES AUSTIN OWEN
. I am shopman to John Goss Fleay. These are my master's—(looking at them)—I missed them when I received information.




GUILTY
. Aged 20.—


Transported for Seven Years.

Before Mr. Sergeant Arabin.

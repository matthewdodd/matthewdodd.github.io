            . I am servant to Mr. Sanders. On the 30th of July, about two o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came to the window and asked the price of a piece of bacon. My mistress told her it was 6 d.; she went away, and we missed the duck off the board. I overtook her, and asked if she had got it - she said, No. I felt it between two cloths in her apron. I followed her, and she threw it at me and it went into a ditch. I picked it up, and followed her to Globe-row, where she was taken.

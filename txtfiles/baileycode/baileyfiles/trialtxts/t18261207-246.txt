            . I am a constable. On the 9th of November, about three o'clock in the afternoon, I was in Bridge-street, Blackfriars


, and saw a gentleman on the pavement, looking at the Lord Mayor's carriage - I was with the carriage, and saw the prisoners walking along, and trying several persons' pockets - they then came to this gentleman, who stood on the pavement, and drew out a silk handkerchief - I believe Munday drew it out, but Davis was close to him - they saw me, rolled it up, and dropped it - I took it up, and asked the gentleman if he had lost his handkerchief - he felt in his pocket, and said Yes, and claimed it. I took one of the prisoners, and Charles took the other. The gentleman went with us to the Compter, and then said he would not prosecute, and would not give his name.

             sworn.
How old are you? - I am ten the 16th of January.
Have you taken an oath before? - Yes.
What will become of you, if you swear what is false? - I shall go to hell. I was sent out of a Thursday, about a quarter after five o'clock in the evening, and the lady gave me the things; there was some white cotton twist and some yarn, and some mixt-coloured cotton twist, and four wooden bobbins, and some white thread; I took them from Newgate-street, No. 5; I saw the prisoner before he took my bag; I was coming strait home, and a man said, will you go for a coach, my boy; yes, says I; says he, I will give you sixpence; he gave me sixpence, and took my bag; leave your bag behind you, says he; no, says I, I would rather take it up; I took it with me, and went for the coach, and when I came back that man was not there, but another man, shamming drunk, in a smock frock; says he, my lad, where is the coach; says I, here it is; and he offered me the sixpence in my hand; and thisprisoner, about half a minute after, came and put my hat over my eyes, and took away my bag; he put my hat over my eyes first; I halloo'd out, stop thief! he ran up Angel-court; I pursued him, and lost sight of him about a minute and a half; there was a watchman just by Break-neck steps that stopped him with the bundle, coming down Mr. Clark's stairs; I found my bundle at Mr. Ashmore's, a brush-maker's, on Snow-hill; I should know the bag again; I know the prisoner very well, I am sure he is the man; when he knocked my hat over my eyes, he was before me; I had no suspicion of him before that, but I know him by his hat, and I know him by his face; he run up Angel-court, and this was the corner he ran before me, and then I saw his coat.

            . I live in chambers in Goodman's Fields


; on the 9th of November, between one and two, the neighbours called to me, and said a woman had taken something out of the window. I asked her what she had got, she said, nothing of mine. I took her into the house, and searched her, and found the things upon her: then she said a good woman had put them into her lap.

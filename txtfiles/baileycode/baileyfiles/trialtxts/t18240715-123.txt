                  , from his person
            .
JOHN HENRY WILKINSON. I live in Canterbury-place, Lambeth. On the 11th of June, I was returning from the City, down Holborn


, and had occasion to use my handkerchief just before I got to Shoe-lane


. I had not got many yards further before I felt a jerk at my pocket, and found the handkerchief was gone - I turned round, and saw the prisoner, in company with another young man, who was discharged at Guildhall. They were the only persons near me - I suspected one of them - I walked after them, and charged them with it; the other man denied it, but the prisoner said nothing. I secured them myself as it was near the watch-house, and the handkerchief was found on the prisoner.
Prisoner. Q. How could you swear it was your handkerchief - I had one like it round my neck - A. I am certain it is mine, your's is a lighter colour.

            . I am a day patrol. The prisoner was brought to the watch-house; I took the handkerchief out of his right hand coat pocket; the prosecutor claimed it; the prisoner said he had picked it up, he did not say it was his own.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

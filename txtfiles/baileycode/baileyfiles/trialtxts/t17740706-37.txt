            . I was going past the Horse Guards on the 22d of June; the prisoner asked me if I would give her any beer; I said I would if she was thirsty; we had three pints of beer at a public house; I said if she was hungry I would give her some bacon and veal I had in my pocket; we went and eat it together; after that I went home with her to her apartments; we went to bed there, when I went into the room I said don't take my money because I have a bill to pay; she promised me she would not take it; I locked the door and put the key upon the mantle-piece; when I waked the prisoner was gone and I missed my money; the door was open and the key was upon the ground; there was no one in the house but she and I; she was taken up on the 24th.
The prisoner in her defence denied the charge, but did not call any witnesses.

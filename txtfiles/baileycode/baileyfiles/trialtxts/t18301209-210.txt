            . I am a Police-officer. On the 6th of December I saw the prisoner run by me very quick with a bundle under his arm; there was a blue apron tied round it - he said it was a cloth pelisse; I said I would examine it - he then said it was a lady's cloak; I took him to the watch-house, and then found the prosecutor, who keeps a silk-mercer's shop at the top of Tottenham-court-road, and it was at the bottom that I took him.

            . I cut this coat out, and made it for Mr. James Pincott - I can swear to my own work.

            . I hung this cloak at Mr. Pincott's door, about eight o'clock in the morning of the 6th of December - a young man gave me information, and I missed it.

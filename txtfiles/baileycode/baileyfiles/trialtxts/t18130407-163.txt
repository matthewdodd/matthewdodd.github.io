            . I am a carpenter. On the 12th of March, about ten at night, I was going to bed; (I live opposite;) I saw the prisoner rolling up the lead. I asked him what he was doing there. He said putting the things to rights. I went down stairs, and called the watchman. We went to these houses; the prisoner came down by the rafters, and jumped out of the one pair window; we took him to the watchhouse. This is the lead. At the watchhouse, he said he had left his coat in the building; he came back and got it.
Prosecutor. It is my lead.

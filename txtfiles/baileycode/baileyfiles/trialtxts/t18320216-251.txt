            . I am a Policeman. On Thursday, the 19th of January, I was in the Strand, and saw the two prisoners following the prosecutor - I saw Nash put his right hand into his pocket, draw the handkerchief out, and give it to Law - I secured them both; Law threw it down; there was another with them, who escaped.
Cross-examined. Q. Had you known Nash before? A. I have seen him with others.
The prisoners received a good character.

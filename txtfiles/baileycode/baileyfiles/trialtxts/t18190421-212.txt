            . I am a plumber
. On the 12th of April, about half-past eleven o'clock at night, as I was returning from Stepney, I was surrounded by a gang, the prisoner was one - he ran against me, and drew my watch out - I collared him as he was doing it. He gave the watch to another. As I was taking him to the watch-house, the gang came and splashed me all over with mud. I never let him go. I have traced the watch to a pawnbroker's.

            . I am an officer. I was sent for to Mr. Jacobs; he told me he had been robbed by his servant. I asked the prisoner what she had done with the things that she had taken out of the house; she said, she had not taken any. I began to search her; she said, I will give you no further trouble, I will shew you where they are; she took me to a woman's apartment, No. 16, George's-court, Wapping; the woman delivered me all the things. I produce them.

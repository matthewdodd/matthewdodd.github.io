            . I am servant to Mr. William Thomas Thornton, who lives in Devonshire-street


. On the 19th of May, about one o'clock, I saw the prisoner peeping his head twice out of the front kitchen door - I then went to the kitchen door, and saw him with master's great coat in his hand; I do not know where it was before; he threw it down, ran out, and I after him - I gave an alarm and he was stopped, without my losing sight of him. He must have come down the area to get it.

            . I am footman to Mr. Thornton. The cook called me from the pantry - I ran out and saw the prisoner running from the area; the coat had been put in a chair in the kitchen. I secured him about 100 yards off, without losing sight of him - it is a livery coat - I found it five or six yards from the chair, close by the door.

Prisoner's Defence. When I was taken a gentleman came up and said he was a Magistrate, and demanded to know what was the matter - he asked if she saw any thing in my hand, and the woman said she did not.

                  Jane

            , Wife of 
               
                  Richard 
                  Staples 
               



            . Three Weeks ago, last Monday, I lost 23 Guineas out of 2 Drawer, in the Room where I lay. I taxed 
               
                  Elizabeth 
                  Parsons 
               



             with it, she is my Apprentice
, I asked her how she came to take them, or who persuaded her to it; she stood very strongly in it, from Monday Morning till Tuesday Night, that she knew nothing of them; then she confessed she took them, and that 
               
                  Elizabeth 
                  Millinton 
               



             persuaded her to it, and that Mrs Millinton should say, let me put my Hand into the Bag myself, and then you can say you did not take it. And at this Juncture 
               
                  Ann 
                  Wright 
               



             came and cried out, oh! have I caught you; whereupon Millington said, we must give Wright a Guinea, or else she will blow us; and she had a Guinea.
Q. Did you make her any promise of showing her Favour, if she confessed.
Staples. I told her if she spoke the Truth, I believe it would be the better for her. - I could make her no Promise. - Dawson proved she confessed it before Justice Dennet. 


               Guilty, 39 s.
            

Millinton and Wright 

               acquitted
            .

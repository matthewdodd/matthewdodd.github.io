I live at Chelsea; on the first of February, about four in the afternoon, I lost two shirts, and a handkerchief, in the King's-road


; they were hanging out to dry.
When did you see them again? - At Justice Hyde's office, and the prisoners at the bar were then in custody.
Do you know of your own knowledge of the prisoners taking the things? - No, I went to my washer woman's, and found her much confused, she said she had been robbed, and had lost some of my property; I immediately went to Justice Read's, and informed him I was the person who had lost the property, which was then in possession of the constable; the next day I saw the linen at Justice Hyde's.

The first Thursday in this month I hung the linen out to dry, a shift of mine, and a shirt of my master's; I hung them out in the garden about ten in the morning;the prisoners took them off the line, and tied them up in a bundle, and ran away.
When did you see the things? - About two days after at the Justice's.

I live at Chelsea; on the 1st of February, I was going out with my milk in the afternoon, a little girl was standing at the door, and said a man and boy had run away with all her mammy's linen; I followed them; I lost sight of them in a very short time; I asked a woman if she saw which way they went; she said down that yard; I went to the necessary, and found Edsell in the necessary, and gave him to a soldier while I pursued the other, and took him, and about two yards from him, there lay a ruffled shirt.
Court. Did you see it drop from him? - No, I asked him whose shirt that was; he said it was his own; I asked him how he came by it; he said a boy dropped it, and he picked it up; I took him to the other boy, and he said that boy Edselle dropped the shirt, and he picked it up.
Court. What became of the shirt? - I gave it to the washer-woman; her name is Lange; the boys were running.

I live in the King's-road, Chelsea; my husband is a hair-dresser; on the 1st of February, I washed some things, and hung them out to dry.
What did you hang out? - Two ruffled shirts, and a handkerchief of Mr. Dolman's.
What time did you hang them out? - About half after two in the afternoon.
Was there any thing else hanging in the garden? - Yes, some linen belonging to Mrs. Walker; I missed the things between three and four; my little girl came and alarmed me, and I came down and alarmed the neighbours; and Mr. Wise was coming by, and I begged him to run after the boys, which he did.
Did you see the boys, the prisoners? - They were running as hard as they could, Mr. Wise and I pursued them, and they run into Castle-yard, Mr. Bates's yard; we caught the prisoner Edsell in the yard, and found nothing upon him, and brought him out of the yard, and gave him to Winterbottom; then Wise went after the other in Castle-yard, and found him between two casks, and took him, and saw the shirt behind the rain water tub; he was standing with his back against the shirt; Mr. Wise asked Edwards if he knew any thing of the shirt; he first said he found it, then he said he had it from the boy Edsell; when Wise brought out the prisoner Edwards into the road where Edsell was, he said that was the boy he had the shirt from.
What became of the shirt? - A little boy went and fetched the shirt from behind the water-tub, and gave it to Wise, and Wise gave it to me; I kept the shirt in my apron till we came to the constable, then the bundle was brought with two shirts and shift, and handkerchief, to me at the constable's house by a man, Serjeant Sutherland, who is here; I opened the bundle, I found the other shirt ruffled, and handkerchief.
Did you know the shirt? - Yes, it belonged to Mr. Dolman, and a shirt belonging to my lord lord, and a pocket handkerchief is Mr. Dolman's.
Court. Was this shirt hanging in the garden at the same time with the other? - Yes.

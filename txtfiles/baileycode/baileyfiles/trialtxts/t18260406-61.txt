WILLIAM GOOD. I live with Messrs. Waithman, of Bridge-street. On the 23d of March I was in Smithfield


; my handkerchief was safe a minute before; I felt a pull at my pocket; I had an umbrella up, and on turning to the right I missed it; the prisoner passed me on the left, and got about a yard before me; nobody else was near me. - I laid hold of him, and told him he had robbed me; he produced it from under his coat.
Prisoner. Q. How far was I from any body? A. Fourteen or fifteen yards - nobody else was near me. The ground was very dirty, and the handkerchief was quite dry.

            . I am a constable, and was sent for. I found the prisoner at the Ram inn; Good produced the handkerchief - I found another in his hat, marked R. S. R., and about 5s. on him.
Prisoner's Defence. A. young man was following him round the corner of Smithfield-bars - he turned, and went back. I picked up the handkerchief just behind him.

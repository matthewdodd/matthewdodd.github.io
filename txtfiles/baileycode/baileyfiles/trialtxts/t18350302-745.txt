MARTHA ALLEN
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
11th of February, 1 knife, value 10s., the goods of 



Mary Ann Edwards.






MARY ANN EDWARDS
. I lost a silver-handled knife from my kitchen, at No. 6, Pleasant-row, Pentonville, on the 11th of February. I employed the prisoner on that day as a charwoman—she came about eleven o'clock—I went to market, and returned about three o'clock—I did not miss the knife then, but a gentleman who lodges with me, sent her out for some porter for dinner with a sovereign—she did not return with the sovereign, I was obliged to go to the station, and the handle of the knife was found on her—the blade had been broken off—I then went home, and missed it.





WILLIAM BARNARD
. I am a policeman. I took the prisoner for the sovereign—this handle of a knife was found in her pocket.

Prisoner's Defence. The first thing she set me to do was, to go for a quartern of gin—she then went out with a friend who had recommended her to me, and did not return for two hours—she then came home, and as she had been drinking, I did not tell her about the knife which I had broken—she appeared pleased with what I had done, and sent me for another quartern of gin—I told her a gentleman had called to look at the apartments, and I told him I believed they were let—she said, why did not I have him in, and get 5s. of him; and when she wanted some tea, she sent me to get some from the lodger's room.





MARY ANN EDWARDS
. I keep a very respectable lodging-house—the gentleman who sent her with the sovereign is a solicitor, and did not like to attend himself—he lodges with me still.




GUILTY
. Aged 40.—


Transported for Seven Years.

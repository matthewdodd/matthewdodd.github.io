            . I live in the house of Mr. Fry, at new Brentford


. On the 13th of March I went over to my father's: while I was there, a message came to me that my room was robbed. I found my drawers and money in the custody of 
               
                  John
                   Monday
               



            , who took the prisoner.


                  John
                   Monday
               



            . I went up to the Market-house to see what it was o'clock, I heard something make a noise, I peeped through, and saw the prisoner sitting in the hay lost, with the box in his hand telling the money, and saw a hole made out of the lost into the prisoner's room. I called to some of my fellow workmen, and took him.
The prisoner said nothing in his defence.




               Not guilty of breaking and entering the dwelling house, but guilty of stealing the goods
            .

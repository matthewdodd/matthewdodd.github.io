CHARLES KEEL
. I am patrol of St. Sepulchre's. I was in King-street, Snow-hill, on the night of the 21st of September, and saw the prisoner loitering about the street all the evening—I kept a watchful eye on him—there was an exhibition at the top of the street, and he went there—I was on the other side of the way, and observed him draw this handkerchief from the prosecutor's pocket—I ran just in time to collar him by the time this gentleman turned round—I found the handkerchief partly in the prisoner's hand, and partly in the prosecutor's—it had been entirely taken from the pocket, and the prosecutor caught hold of it.





CHARLES CAZIMER RENULT
 (by an interpreter.) I was walking along the street and looking at a carriage, and felt the boy's hand in my pocket—I turned round and seized him by the collar—the boy dropped my handkerchief.

Prisoner. I did not see the handkerchief till I got to the station-house—he took and the hit me. Witness. No, I did not.

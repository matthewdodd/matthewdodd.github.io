 for stealing, on the 2nd of January, 1 cloak, value 10s. 6d., the goods of

JOHN MARGESUM.
I am assistant to Samuel James Nichols, linendraper, Chiswell-street. On the evening of the 2nd of January, at halfpast five o'clock, I was behind the counter, and observed a cloak go off the line in the shop—I jumped over the counter, ran out, and saw the prisoner outside tucking the cloak under his coat—I pursued him to Finsburysquare, and stopped him—he dropped the cloak—I took it up, still followed,

and took him—I lost sight of him for a moment, while he turned the corner of Wilson-street—when I turned, he was in custody—he had a leather cap and apron on when I first saw him, but he dropped the cap in running, and tried to get the apron off, but I am sure he is the person.

Prisoner. Q. Did you see me with the cloak? A. Yes, it was about half-past five o'clock, it was quite light enough to see you.





THOMAS THURLOW.
On the evening in question I was passing through Finsbury-square—I saw the prisoner running fast, I ran and caught him—he said, "What do you want? " and the officer came up and took him.





JAMES JOHN EMES
(police-constable E164.) I took him—he had this apron on, he undid it and dropped it—a man took it up and gave it me.

Prisoner. You laid hold of both my hands. Witness. No, I saw you trying to do something to the string of your apron.

                  Sirdefield
               



            . On the 28th of April last, between three and four o'clock, the prisoners at the bar came into my shop and desired to see some cottons for a gown; our apprentice was selling a man a handkerchief at the time; then Ishowed the women some gowns myself; when my apprentice had done with the man he came to the prisoners and I left him; he shewed them the cottons; I went to the other part of the shop, and was called by him, on his discovering that one of them had taken something; we took it from them and I saw it.
Q. What did you take - A. Twenty one yards of cambric from 
               
                  Ann 
                  Powell
               



            , it was under her petticoat.
Q. Did they come in together - A. They did, they appeared to be in company together; when I talked of detaining of them 
               
                  Ann 
                  Powell
               



             made a great resistance; when a customer came in we sent for a constable.
Q. Now sir, the cambric are you sure that is your property - A. Yes.
WILLIAM WATSON. I am an apprentice to Mr. Sirdefield. I was engaged at the time these women came in cutting a man off a handkerchief; directly I was disengaged I came to the women; I shewed them a quantity of prints but none of them seemed to take their fancy; they asked me to go to the window to see if there was not something pretty to take their fancy, which I did several times; the prints that I brought from the window did not seem to please them, and they being rather difficult I thought I would not shew them any more; I turned the same goods over again, thinking that might persuade them to take some of the goods I had shewn them before; there was one pattern in particular which I had shewn them, and which I was looking for, which they seemed to like better than any of the rest; I looked for it and could not find it; I observed 
               
                  Ann 
                  Powell
               



            's gown more bulky than before; as an excuse I leaned across the counter, and asked 
               
                  Ann 
                  Powell
               



             to let me see the quality of her gown, as she was rather particular she might like something of that quality; and looking at the quality of her gown, I felt something like a piece of print; I then went on the side of the counter the woman were on, and looking at the ground I saw one end of the print rather below 
               
                  Ann 
                  Powell
               



            's petticoats; I then called Mr. Sirdefield to let him see that I took it from her, and when I took it from her it was quite warm; I gave it into Mr. Sirdefield's hands immediately.
The property produced and identified.
Powell's Defence. I went into this shop to look at a gown; the young man brought a great quantity of patterns on the counter, one of them fell down; I was going to pick it up; the young man jumped over the counter and said I was going to steal it.
Joseph's Defence. I went into Mr. Sirdefields, I asked for a bit of cotton for an apron; he shewed me the print; I bid him the money; he said he could not take it; I was going out, the gentleman jumped over the counter and said she was going to steal a print; as to this woman I never saw her before in my life.
Powell called no witnesses to character.
Joseph called two witnesses, who gave her a good character.

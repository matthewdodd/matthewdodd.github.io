            . I am a brewer
 and live at Chelsea


, and am in the partnership with John Lyall and another - we have a warehouse, which we call the malt-house; this malt was stolen from there; it adjoins the yard of the Old Swan public-house - we have a window which opens into their skittle-ground - this malt was in a bulk in the malt-house - we have two doors, one leading close down to the river, and the other towards land - we unload barges at the door next the river. On the morning of the 6th of September, in consequence of the report of my men, I went to the malt-house without an officer, and then went for an officer - I found the window looking into the skittle-ground had two or three iron-bars removed from itand a sufficient aperture made for a man to enter - the bulk of the malt was diminished to the amount of about forty quarters - the door leading to the river was in the same state as before. I afterwards went with the officer to search for the malt, to a place up the river, called the Broom-house dock, which is about half a mile on this side of Fulham-bridge, on the Middlesex side - it is between two and three miles from our premises - on arriving there, we saw some malt close to a wall near the river - it was scattered about, apparently as if dropped from sacks which had been pitched there, before they had been put into carts, as I suppose - it was near the Thames. I picked up some of it; it is in the possession of the officer - I have a sample taken from the bulk of the malt. I saw the prisoner Richard Parsons at Battersea that day, after I had been to the dock - there were several watermen there - he came forward alone, and the officer who was with me took him; he was taken to our counting-house - he said something to the officer when he was taken, which I did not hear. I asked him, at the counting-house, where he had been the preceeding day - he said he had been to one public-house only, which was the Yorkshire-grey. I desired him to recollect himself - he then mentioned three other public-houses, but omitted the Swan. I recollect one house was the Cricketers - I afterwards asked if he had been to Dodson's house, (who keeps the Swan) - he said he did not know the house. I again asked him, and after considerable hesitation and prevarication, he admitted that he did know Dodson's, and that he had been there - he was then taken on board the Police-ship. On the following day I continued my search, in company with another officer; we were going along the Fulham-road, and arrived at Mr. Poole's malt-house, which is about a mile and a half or two miles from the Broom-house dock; there is a road from the dock to Poole's malt-house. I knocked at the door of Poole's malt-house, but it was not opened; the flap of a window was suddenly raised, and then let fall again, as soon as I knocked at the door - the malt-house door was not opened to me. I then went to Mr. Poole's private residence, and Mr. Poole accompanied me to the malt-house; he had no key - he went to the neighbouring house, to the wife of Jefferies - there is a communication from that house to the malt-house. I did not go through - Mr. Poole went through, and opened the malt-house door to me; I then went in, and there were nine sacks of malt unground, and one sack ground. I cannot say whether any name was on the sacks - (my malt was all unground) - the malt was all removed to our premises. I believe the malt found there to be ours, and part of what we lost - neither Mr. Poole or any body attempted to hinder me from moving it. I saw a woman in the house adjoining the malt-house - she said she was Jefferies's wife; about an hour after I discovered the malt I found Thomas Parsons in custody in the Fulham-road, in a gig, being conveyed to our counting-house; he was taken there, but nothing passed in my presence - the value of the malt stolen is about 120l. I have been experienced in grain this seven or eight years; I was not entirely bred up to the trade. I have seen the samples of malt which are here, and compared them with the bulk; they appear to be the same.
Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Your father is one of your partners? A. Yes; his name is John, only; the door of our premises appeared the same as the night before - the malt could have been moved to where we found it by land, in carts; there were three or four other watermen with Richard Parsons; I do not know that he made use of any expression; he advanced towards us; I did not tell Richard Parsons what he said would be used against him, or that he need not say any thing without he liked; I saw Thomas Parsons in the gig, in custody - that was a quarter of a mile from the malt-house; I know nothing of his previous habits; my father is not here; I heard nothing pass between him, and any one else; the officer was not present when I questioned Richard Parsons.
MR. BODKIN. Q. Was there room for a person to have got the malt through the window into the skettle-ground, and from there to the water? A. Yes.
COURT. Q. How was the door? A. It is fastened by a lock and two bolts; I am told by my servant that it was locked and bolted that night - I did not notice it myself - the end of the skittle-ground comes down to the Thames.

            . I am a Thames Police surveyor. I was stationed on board the Thams Police-ship, off Arundel-stairs, Strand; on the 6th of September I went to Mr. Lyall's, Chelsea; I went to the malt-house, and saw a wire window, which looks into the skittle-ground of the Old Swan, had been bent inwards, so as to admit a person in; we then went down to the river - there were two or three carts there; I then went into a punt, which laid just off the door of the malt-house; I could step from the door to the punt; it is a cabin-punt, and there were muddy foot-marks on the top of the cabin; I stepped from the door to the punt gunwale without treading on the bank; there was one naked foot-mark very plain on the punt cabin, and some marks of feet in the mud; there is a cause way from there to the skittle-ground of the Old Swan; I then went up the river, with Mr. Lyall, in search of the malt; I saw Dawson, a lighterman, and from what he said, I went to a wall, close by the water side, and there picked up some malt, near to Broom-house dock; I have preserved it; I then went to Chelsea, landed Mr. Lyall, and then went in search of a barge, of which I had received information; I found it, and went on board - the name of "Waight, Chelsea," was on it; the oars were locked - it was at Mr. Batcock's wharf, near Cheyne-walk-terrace, about one hundred yards from Mr. Lyall's; I found under the head-sheets some loose malt, which appeared to have fallen through the cracks; I took it up, and have it here; while I was in the barge I received more information, and went in search of Richard Parsons; I found him, and took him; I asked if he had the key of Waight's punt; he said No; I asked if he had not borrowed her yesterday; he said Yes, he had borrowed her, and shifted her out of the hole where she laid afloat; I then asked if it was not to do a job for Mr. Mead; he said No, that when he came back after shifting the punt, the person, who hired him, told him he did not want him to do the job; he said the person was a stranger to him; I asked if he knew where he lived; he said No; he said he believed he lived at the top of the hill, but he did not know where; I took him at Battersea; there is a Mr. Mead, a colourman, who has some water-side premises there; I asked him what he was to have done; he said to fetch some wood up from Milbank, he believed: I took him, and said if he would come up to Waight, he wouldhear some more, but Weight was gone up the river; I then took him to Lyall's; I went to Chelsea, and took Thomas Parsons; I afterwards went into Richard Parsons' boat, and found a small quantity of malt under the burthen-boards, which are boards used to step upon when the barge is loaded; I then went to Thomas Parsons' boat, which laid aground alongside the causeway at Battersea; I there found nearly the same quantity of malt, at the bottom of the boat - I have preserved all those different parcels of malt, and have them here - their names were on their boats; I then returned to Mr. Lyall's, and, as Waight had not returned from Richmond, I took Richard Parsons on board the Police-ship, and left him in chage of Mitchell, the officer. I went next day, with Mr. Lyall, to Mr. Poole's malt-house; I left Mr. Lyall there, and returned to the Broom-house; I then went to Battersea, and on returning, in a gig, Thomas Parsons was pointed out to me by Bell; he was a good deal in liquor, and had a girl under his arm - he was not above five minutes walk from Poole's; we took him to Mr. Lyall's counting-house; when we had been there about an hour, he got a little sober, and I asked what he was doing at Fulham; he said he had been to Jefferies' to inquire about his brother Dick, that his mother gave him 6s. to take to him, and he meant to spend one of them before he took it; he then said, without my asking him any question, "As to Wednesday night, I slept at home." I had not then told him what I took him for; I said,"Where did you sleep on Thursday night?" he said, "I slept at home also:" he then jumped up, took a pen, and said, "No, I did not sleep at home; but, if you will give me some ink, I'll tell you where I did sleep - I slept with that girl you took me away from:" before the ink could be fetched, he hove down the pen, and said, "No, I shall tell you nothing about it - you may find it out." Mitchell afterwards came there with some malt in a cart; Thomas Parsons then began crying, and I came away.
Cross-examined. Q. How long have you been a surveyor? A. About twelve months - I have been a constable nearly ten years - there were three examinations before the Magistrate; the prisoners were present at them all.
Q. Upon your oath did you say one word about the asked foot-mark to the Magistrate? A. I was never asked it - I do not know that I did mention it - I did not mention that I asked Richard for the key, not that he had said he borrowed the punt, and set her afloat - I said I asked him if it was to do a job for Mead - I did not state he said it was to fetch wood, nor that he said he did not know where the man lived - I was not asked about it - I did not tell him he need not answer questions without he liked, nor that it would be used against him; I did not caution him - my deposition was taken by the clerk, and read over to me, in the presence of the prisoners and the Magistrate - I stated what I was asked - it was but a short deposition - I think I stated to the Magistrate that I asked Thomas Parsons what he had been doing at Fulham - I did say he told me he had been at Jefferies' to inquire for his brother Dick - I think what I said was taken down - I did not tell Thomas Parsons he need not answer any questions without he liked, or that it might be used against him - I supposed it might - I will not swear whether I told the Magistrate he had said he slept at home on Wednesday night.
Q. On your oath, was not the man drunk when he answered? A. He was, but he had got a good deal soberer than at first - I cannot say he was drunk; he knew what he was talking about - I did not state about his taking up a pen to write - my deposition was taken very short - I will not say that I stated he said he had slept with the girl, or his afterwards refusing to write any thing.
Q. On your oath, was he not at the time he was crying beastly drunk? A. No.
MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Is this deposition signed by you? A. Yes, it is signed by me - there were three examinations.
Q. Was not the greater part of these three days' examinations occupied with other persons than the prisoners? A. Yes, three other persons were indicted with the prisoners - one person was there who had part of the malt in his possession, for I was examined about that affair.
The witness' deposition being read, did not in any degree differ from his evidence, except that it was not given so fully.

                  MITCHELL
               



            . I am a Thames Police surveyer. On the 6th of September I was on board the Police-ship off Arundel-stairs - late that evening I saw Richard Parsons on board, in the hold, but I was not there when he was brought on board; when I saw him he was asleep - there was no other person there - I overhauled his shoes, which were off, and the only shoes there; and found this grain of malt in one of them (producing it) - I awoke him, and asked if he had been at work among any corn - he said No - I said "There is a grain of corn in your shoes - do you know how it came there?" he said he did not know, without it had been put there. On the following day I went with Lyall and Isbester to the Fulham road - I left Mr. Lyall at Poole's malt-house, and I want on to the Broom-house - Mr. Lyall came and fetched me back - I went into Poole's malt-house, and found nine sacks of malt unground, and one sack below ground - Poole's name was on all the sacks - after the malt was found I was left in charge of it till the dray came, and while there I saw Thomas Parsons, walking backwards and forwards, opposite Poole's malt-house, in company with a woman - I did not then know him - I afterwards saw him in Isbester's custody in the house, and recognized him as the person I had before seen with the girl - I went that evening to Walham-green, and there took two men, named Lake and Evans, into custody - I found two carts in Lake's shed with some grains of malt at the bottom of them - Bell, who was with me, took them - I took Lake before the Magistrate, and from what he said I went to a man named Higgs, at Pimlico, and found twenty-seven quarters and a half of malt, which I have now in my possession - I saw Thomas Parsons at Mr. Lyall's counting-house the same evening; he certainly was not sober - I had brought the malt there from Poole's - Thomas Parsons said he wished to speak to the elder Mr. Lyall, who took him up stairs, and I followed them - Mr. Lyall asked what he wished to say to him, and he said, "Oh, my poor brother, my poor brother! I do not care for myself, but for his wife and family" - he was not sober certainly - he was not beastly drunk - I will not swear it, but I think he knew what he said.
Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did you carry away Poole's sacks as well as the grain? A. I did; there was no malt but that I brought away.
Q. Whether it had been mixed with any other malt you cannot tell? A. No; Thomas Parsons was not cautioned before he said any thing.

            . I am a lighterman, and live at Chelsea. I know both the prisoners - they are watermen

, and each have boats of their own; I have a punt. On Wednesday morning, the 5th of September, Richard Parson asked me for the loan of it; I asked what he wanted it for; he said, to fetch some timber for Mr. Mead, of Battersea, from Messrs. Campbell and White's, at Milbank: I told him if he wanted her, he might go home and get the key, as I was going to Richmond - the key was to unlock the cars; he told me he could not tell positively when he wanted her, as he had to go to Battersea, and he did not know whether he should want her or not before he went over to Battersea: I went to Richmond, and returned about nine o'clock; the key had not been fetched - it still hung in its place; I do not know where my punt was then; I saw it next morning, at Mr. Batcock's wharf, where she had been the might before, but she had been moved by some one - my name is on her: I did not see it searched - I was at Richmond that day; I have had her twelve months last April; she was never used to convey grain to my knowledge: I took her down on the Tuesday, and had her loaded with coals; I saw Richard Parsons on the Tuesday, in the parlour of the Swan - he came in from the skittle-ground.
Cross-examined. Q. How long have you known Richard? A. All my life - I never knew any thing against him; I have no knowledge of his having taken the punt - some one had her, for she was moved: he told me if he wanted her, he would come and let me know in an hour, but I went away to Richmond; he might have had the key if he had wanted it - I told him so.
MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How could a person get the punt along without the oars? A. By another pair of oars, or it might be towed along.


                  WILLIAM 
                  MEAD
               



            . I am a colour-maker. I never dealt with Campbell and White, and never had any wood from them; I never had any conversation with either of the prisoners about fetching wood from there: I have employed them occasionally to fetch coals, some months before the 6th of September.


                  GEORGE 
                  WILSON BELL
               



            . I am a waterman, and live at Chelsea. I was present at a conversation between Richard Parsons and Waight - he said he wanted the punt; I heard Waight's statement, it is correct: I saw the two prisoners together the same day, between twelve and one o'clock, opposite the Yorkshire Grey public-house, which is not far from Lyall's brewery - I think it was on a Tuesday or Wednesday: I went next day to Battersea, with Mr. Lyall and the officer - the officer took Richard Parsons into custody; I saw the officer search both the prisoners' boats, and there was malt under the burthens of each boat - they were the boats the prisoners worked in, and had their names on them; I saw Thomas Parsons at Mr. Lyall's when the dray came - I was in the counting-house; Isbester went out to speak to Mitchell; Thomas Parsons began crying, and said he was not sorry for himself, but for his brother's wife and family.


                  CHARLES 
                  DAWSON
               



            . I am a waterman. On the night of the 6th of September I went up with half a score of coals to Broom-house dock - I got up there at one o'clock in the morning; the water was not high enough for me to get into the dock; I laid-too, and a barge came dropping up; I hurried, for fear it should get before me - there was the name of Waight or Wick, or some such name, and "Chelsea," on it - there was one man in her; I did not see him using any oars - he appeared to me to be using a staff to get round the bank, there were some sacks in her: it came into the dock - there was room for us both: I said to the man,"Fellow-servant, are you going to unload here?" there was another man sitting on the bank - I cannot say whether either of the prisoners were the men; I saw a wherry pulling over from Wandsworth, with two men sitting in her and one rowing - they landed on the causeway; they were close to the punt; I did not see them do any thing, or say any thing - it was then between two and three o'clock; I saw three sacks carried out of the punt, and placed against a wall - what they contained I do not know; I afterwards saw a punt in the possession of the officer, and have not the least doubt of its being the same.
Cross-examined. Q. Did you ever say they appeared to be tall men, six feet high? A. I said they appeared less than six feet; they appeared to be taller than the prisoners.


                  JAMES 
                  WHITE
               



            . I am a lighterman, and work on the Thames. I was out in the night between the 5th and 6th of September, walking along the Cheyne-walk, near Battersea-bridge, about two o'clock in the morning; I saw Waight's punt go up the river, from London, towards Battersea-bridge - it went through the third or fourth arch; I knew the punt before; I saw a person towing her up in a wherry - I think I saw some sacks in the punt; it was a hazey morning; the person in the wherry looked like Richard Parsons, but I cannot swear it was him; I speak from his rowing; I cannot swear it was him, or form any judgment about him. I know Lyall's brewery - it was going from the brewery, towards Broom-house dock.
Cross-examined. Q. How far were you from it? A. I might be from eighty to one hundred yards; I cannot swear that it was Richard Parsons'; I knew them both as very honest men.


                  JOHN 
                  WESTON
               



            . I am clerk at Swan-wharf. I saw Richard Parsons playing at skittles between two and three o'clock that afternoon, there,


                  JOHN 
                  STOAKS
               



            . I am a carpenter. I saw Richard Parsons in the Swan-yard skittle-ground, on Wednesday, the 5th of September, between three and four o'clock; there were several in the ground - I did not see him come in or go out.
Cross-examined. Q. Do you live at Chelsea? A. Yes; I did not know him before.


                  SAMUEL 
                  POOLE
               



            . I am a malster, and have a malt-house in the Fulham-road - Jefferies had the key of my malt-house; I had no malt there at the time in question - there was none there with my knowledge.
Cross-examined. Q. What sort of a man is Jefferies? A. About five feet nine inches, I suppose - he is taller than either of the prisoners.


                  ALEXANDER 
                  MITCHELL
               



            . Here is the sample I received from Mr. Lyall; this is the grain taken from the shoe, and this is taken from Higgs' brew-house, and here is a sample of that found at Poole's.


                  WILLIAM 
                  ISBESTER
               



            . I produce the malt found on the ground at Broom-house dock, that found in Richard Parsons' wherry, and that found in Thomas Parsons' wherry.
MR. CLARKSON. Q. In what state was Richard Parsons' wherry when you took it from there? A. The burthens were a little wet, but Thomas' was dryer.
MR. LYALL. To the best of my belief these samples are parts of the same malt; this one grain is the same sort; malt is dried in different manners.
Cross-examined. Q. How is it dried? A. In a kiln: we dry ours pale; all pale malt would have the same appearance, if dried from the same quality of barley; this has no particular appearance, except that it is pale; the single grain appears the same; all pale malt is similar, certainly - if it got wet at the bottom of the wherry it would be more difficult to distinguish while wet, but when it got dry it would resume its former state.
MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. One man's pale malt, made the same way, and dried with the same degree of heat, would appear like another man's? A. Yes; we had pale malt in our possession that night: this resembles ours in quality of grain and mode of manufacture, the spears not being suffered to grow very high.


                  WILLIAM 
                  HAMLIN
               



            . I am an agent to brewers and malt-factors, and have been so this thirty years, and have had great experience in the quality of malt. I have no doubt these samples are all of the same malt; the description of grain is the same, and the degree of heat appears the same: if I was in the market, and received one of these samples, I should have been satisfied to receive the rest.
Cross-examined. Q. Will you swear to that single grain? A. Certainly, from the circumstance of the working of this malt - malt is dried differently.
RICHARD PARSONS' Defence. I know nothing about it- they have mistaken the men.

Courtney Williams. I am an attorney
; on the 9th of this month, coming down Holbourn


 about half an hour after four in the afternoon, going to cross the way, a young fellow came and told me my pocket was picked; I felt and found my handkerchief was gone; he pointed to the prisoner, and said he had taken it; I went and asked him for my handkerchief; he told me he had none; after that he told me it was down an area; I went and took it up where he said it was, with the point of my stick; then I took him to a constable, and gave charge of him.

            . I was going along Holbourn, I saw the prisoner put his hand into the prosecutor's pocket two or three times, and the last time I saw him take a handkerchief out; I followed the gentleman, and told him of it; afterwards I saw it down the area, but did not see the prisoner throw it down.
Prisoner's defence.
Going along the gentleman swang his stick about, the end of which drawed the handkerchief out of his pocket; it fell on the ground, and I took it up: I work in the brick-fields in the summer time, and sell muffins in the winter.

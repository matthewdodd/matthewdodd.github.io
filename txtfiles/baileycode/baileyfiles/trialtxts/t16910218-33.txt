                   of a Dutch Ducket, and a piece of Gold and 7 l. 10 s. in Mony
            . The Evidence was very possitive against Cole, and he did not deny but that he took the Mony, but said he was in Drink, and knew not what he did. The Evidence did not affect the Woman so much as Cole, so she was 

               acquitted
            , but the Man was found 

               Guilty
            .

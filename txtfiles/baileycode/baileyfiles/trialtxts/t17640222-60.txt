                  Dolan 
               



            . I know Sampson, the boy at the bar; he was with me, picking pockets, between four and five months ago; he brought me to the gentleman's house, (meaning the other prisoner) the night before we were taken up; we got eleven handkerchiefs of people passing along the streets, and went and pawned them to him. We carried handkerchiefs to him, sometimes three times a week, and sometimes twice a week: he lives in Tyburn-road, but I do not know the name of the street; he never asked us where we came from, or how we came by them. He would lend us a couple of shillings upon a good silk handkerchief, about a yard wide; and a linen one, with no holes in it, he would lend us a shilling upon it; or a white one, with a red border, he would lend us 14 d. if they had holes in them, perhaps not above 3 d. or a groat. Sometimes we have carried six, sometimes four, or three, or two; eleven were the most we ever carried at one time.
Q. How old are you?
Dolan. I am going into 13 years of age, and Sampson is going into 12.
Q. Did Mr. Hodson never express any surprize at your coming at these handkerchiefs?
Dolan. No. When we came before Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            , he said, we told him, we got them on board a French prize, out of the hammocks. I never was on board a ship in my life; I don't know how to describe a ship. (He takes eleven handkerchiefs in his hand of different colours.) Here are two very good silk ones. The prisoner and I both went together, and pawned them with Mr. Hodson all at one time, the night we stole them.
Q. How long had you used his shop?
Dolan. About five months.

                  Wright 
               



            . I took this boy, Dolan, and asked him, where he used to dispose of his handkerchiefs? he said, he did not sell them, but used to pawn them. Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



             desired me to go with the boy, in order to redeem them: the boy went, and called for the handkerchiefs; Mr. Hodson brought these eleven down, and I took and tied them together, as they are now. Mr. Hodson said, he knew the lad very well. I took them to Sir John, and desired Mr. Hodson to go along with me. He said, it was common to take things in pledge; Mr. Hodson knew me very well, and told me, he stopped a cardinal, that he suspected to have been stolen, and delivered it to me, to carry with the handkerchiefs.
The two prisoners said nothing in their defence.

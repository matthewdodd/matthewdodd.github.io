ROBERT BBNTLEY
. I was in the service of Mr. George Dawson, who is now dead—on the 20th of November he had one partner—the prisoner lived servant there—I assisted in searching her boxes when the officer came—these two umbrellas, and all the articles stated, were found there—I know some of them to be my master's property—they were bought with a stock which they bought half a year ago—I had seen them, but I cannot say when—there had been another partner, who left about two months ago, and since that we have made the bills out in a different manner—I cannot swear to all the things—I know most of them—these umbrellas have the shop mark on them.

Cross-examined by
MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You believe these to be Mr. Dawson's? A. Yes; they were bought with a stock at No. 21 and 22, Shoreditch, five or six months ago—there were three partners—since that Mr. Simpson has left—I do not know that stock has been taken, or any settlement made since Mr. Simpson left—I cannot fix any date at which I had seen these things safe.

COURT. Q. To the best of your belief Mr. Dawson had only one partner on the 20th of November? A. Yes; I believe Mr. Simpson left about two months ago.
(John Sheen, Ann Sheen, and Honora Sheen, (the uncle and aunts of the prisoner;) Catherine Murphy, and Garret Joyce, a labourer, gave her a good character.)




GUILTY
. Aged 22.—


Transported for Seven Years.

Before Mr. Serjeant Arabin.

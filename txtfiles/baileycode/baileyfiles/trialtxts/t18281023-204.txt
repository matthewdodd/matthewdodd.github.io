                  , from his person

GEORGE WILLIAMS. On the 16th of September, I was in Whitecross-street


, between six and seven o'clock in the evening - I put my hand to my pocket, and missed my handkerchief, which I had had about two minutes before; the officer then came up to me, and I saw it found on Jessop - I had not seen the prisoners before.

            . I was on duty at a fire in Whitecross-street, and saw the prisoner Copping put his hand into the prosecutor's left-hand coat-pocket, and take the handkerchief, and give it to Jessop - they rushed into the crowd; I ran and laid hold of them both - I took the handkerchief from under Jessop's arm; I am sure Copping took it - I knew his person before, and I had watched them for half an hour.(Property produced and sworn to.)
COPPING'S Defence. I was standing close by the prosecutor - the officer came and took hold of me: I had never seen the other prisoner.

JESSOP'S Defence. I was going up Whitecross-street, and saw a great number of people - there was a fire - I went to see it, and picked up this handkerchief, and put it in my bosom.
Jessop received a good character.

JOHN SULLIVAN
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
18th of August, 1 watch, value 2l.; 1 watch-chain, value 6d.; and 1 watch-key, value 2d.; the goods of 



William Nelson Wilson, from his person.






WILLIAM NELSON WILSON
. I am a carpenter. On the 18th of August I was nearly opposite St. George's church, in the Borough, between one and two o'clock in the morning—I had been out on business—I had been drinking, but was sober—the prisoner and three females were standing talking—as I passed, the women spoke to me—I turned round, and had no sooner turned, than the prisoner snatched my watch out of my pocket, and had it in his hand—I snatched it from him again, as he held it up by the chain—he then ran away some thirty yards, and ran down a little passage, which is no thoroughfare—he returned—I collared him, and gave him to the officer.

Prisoner. Q. What did the woman say? A. She scarcely spoke to me, when you had the watch out.





JOHN MAYNARD
. I am a policeman. The prosecutor gave the prisoner into my custody—the prosecutor had been drinking, but he was capable of taking care of himself.

Prisoner. I went up the turning, and when I came back the prosecutor seized me, and gave me in charge, for attempting to steal his watch—he had been rolling about, and the girls were larking about with him, as he was rolling in the gutter.




GUILTY.* Aged 19.—


Transported for Ten Years.

Before Mr. Common Sergeant.

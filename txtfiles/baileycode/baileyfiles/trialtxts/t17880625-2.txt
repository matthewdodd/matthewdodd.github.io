             sworn.
I live at No. 5, Camden-row, Bethnal-green


, in the dwelling-house of 
               
                  Ann
                   Hibdin
               



            , my mother; on Friday night the 6th of June, I was alarmed with the cry of thieves, about half past ten; I was sitting in the back parlour; I immediately went up stairs, and the garret appeared to have been stripped of several articles; there was a neighbour and a watchman standing in the gutter, on the leads, at the garret window; the neighbour's name is Foster; he is not here; I went to the watch-house, where I found the prisoner, and a bundle, which appeared to be my property; the wearing apparel were the property of my mother; there were these things the property of Mrs. Hibdin; the other things I cannot swear to with certainty; the prisoner did not say a word at the watch-house.

             sworn.
I live at the house of Mrs. Hibdin; I went up stairs to turn down the beds, and I heard an alarm; I looked out of the window; then I went into the garret, and found that our house had been robbed; I found my box was stripped of all my clothes; the sheets off the bed, which were the property of my mistress, and a pillow and pillow-case, and a green curtain which hung at the window; the next house but one was empty.

             sworn.
On Friday, the 6th of this month, I had been to take a walk to Bethnal-green, coming back, I saw the prisoner and his companion come out of an empty house with a bundle under his arm, and his partner says to him, D - n your eyes, come along; and I immediately suspected it was a robbery, and I made an alarm; the watchman was too quick for me; he ran away to shew me the man; and the prisoner was brought back directly, in about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, as near as I can guess.
Was there a good light? - It was the 6th of this month; there was very good day-light; I am sure the man that was brought back was the man I saw with the bundle; I am positive of it; he had not the bundle with him then; when he came out, I might be half a yard from him; I saw his face.

             sworn.
I was taking a walk on the 6th of this month, and I saw a man coming out of an empty house; I was with the last witness.
Were you near enough to know either of them? - Yes, the prisoner was one of them; I am sure of that, because I went to the watch-house directly and saw him again; the prisoner had a bundle; I did not see his face when he came out; I judged him by his height; the other man was taller than this; I can swear he was the same man; he was brought back directly; the prisoner had light clothes on, such as he has on now.

             sworn.
I am a watchman; I pursued with the officers; I first saw the prisoner running down the lane with the officers; there was nobody with him, only people after him; Mr. Philpot stopped him; the bundle was brought in by one Isaac Willett into the watch-house; I went out in the morning, and there was a pair of leather shoes and buckles missing that night from the property; I picked them up; and coming along at half after three, I picked up a pair of womens pumps with copper heel-pieces, and a pair of silver buckles in them; at about fifty yards furtherI picked up this iron crow; I found the shoes and buckles near the turning to the blind beggar; he ran about five or six yards from the corner; he was taken beyond the corner; the shoes and buckles are in the bundle; I had it from the officer of the night.

             sworn.
I am the officer of the night; between ten and eleven I heard the alarm, and immediately ran down the lane that leads to Bethnal-green; the prisoner was in custody; Philpot and two other gentlemen resigned him to me; and I brought him to the watch-house; and in about two minutes, a bundle was brought in by 
               
                  Isaac
                   Willett
               



            ; nothing was said by the prisoner; we immediately opened the bundle, took an inventory, tied them up again, and they were delivered into my care; they are the same as they were; then the watchman went his round; at three returning back, he brought me the shoes and buckles.

                   WILLETT
               



             sworn.
I was a supernumerary man that night; this man and woman gave me the alarm of thieves; they said there were two men gone a head, with bundles, about a hundred yards; I immediately pursued, and met the other watchman upon duty; he said what is the matter; says I, theft; he immediately pursued the prisoner, I saw the bundle was dropped, but I could not tell by whom, I saw it before it was dropped; the man that had the bundle seemed to be in dark clothes; two men were running, one in dark clothes, the other in light clothes, I picked up the bundle, this is the same, I carried it to the watch-house.

             sworn.
I watched on the road, and saw the prisoner with a bundle under his arm, and saw him drop it; there was another man with him in dark blew or brown clothes, each of them had a bundle about the size of a peck measure, it never was found, I did not see the prisoner stopped, I am positive he is the same man that dropped the large bundle; I told willet to pick up the bundle, while I pursued the prisoner.
Prisoner. What do you mean to swear to me at that time of night, being a very dark night? - That was the man, I had a stick in my hand about a yard long; and as he threw away the bundle it hit my leg, or else I should have had him, bundle, and all, I suppose it was a quarter of an hour before he was brought back; I returned to the watch-house, and there was the prisoner.

             sworn.
I stopped the prisoner, I saw him running, he had nothing when I saw him, there was nobody with him.

Prisoner. I have nothing to say, I did not expect my trial on so soon, or else I should have had somebody to my character.

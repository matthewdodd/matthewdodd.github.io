I did go out with the prisoner; I was in liquor; I had the articles mentioned in the indictment; I fell asleep; I awoke; I was disturbed by the prisoner putting her hand into my waistcoat pocket; I missed my things; I went to the watchman without a hat and handkerchief; the watchman went with me; I found a coat tied up in a silk handkerchief, and another handkerchief; I gave it to the constable; he has kept it ever since.

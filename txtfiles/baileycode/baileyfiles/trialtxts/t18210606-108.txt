            , who lives in Welbeck-street


. About two o'clock, in the afternoon, I found the prisoner at the pantry door, with things in his hand, he had come down the area, and took them from the pantry, and had them in a handkerchief; I asked who he wanted, he said, a gentleman named Hanson, and he had a parcel for him, which a person in the street gave him to bring; I said, he did not live there - I heard the candlesticks rattle, and took them from him.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. A man gave them to me, told me to go down and ask for Hanson, and if he was not there, to bring them up.

                  Q. 
               


            (to Cliffington) What have you to say against the Prisoner?
Cliffington. Between Twelve and one o'Clock I was call'd up by the Watchman, who told me I was robb'd; when I came out I found 
               
                  John 
                  Williamson 
               



             with the Prisoner in his Custody.


                  Q. 
               


            (to Williamson) What do you know of this Matter?
Williamson. I am a private Watchman for the Gentlemen
: I went home with a Gentleman that was a little in Liquor; as I was going along, it was darkish, I saw two Men that went to run away.
Q. What had they in their Hands?
Williamson. The latter of the two had a long white Pole; I spoke to the Prisoner and said, Hoy, where had you this? Which was a Water Cask; he said at Tower-Hill; said I, why 'tis my Neighbour's Water-Tub; I laid my Hand upon his Collar and said I believ'd he had stole it; he said let me go, I'll run after them that are gone away, perhaps they may know something of it; I said, no I will hold you.

Prisoner. I was going home from the Night-Cart, I never touch'd the Cask.



               Guilty

WILLIAM WOOLMER. I am a carman
, and live at Stamford, near Ongar, Essex. I had to carry 8lbs. of butter to a gentleman's house, and when I got into Sun-street


 I was taking the horse into the stable, and was told somebody was robbing my cart; I missed 1lb. of butter from a parcel containing 8lbs. Casborn produced the prisoner with it - he had undone the parcel, and taken 1lb. out.

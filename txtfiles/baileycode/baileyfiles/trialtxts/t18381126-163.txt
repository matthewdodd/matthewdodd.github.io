HANNAH ROBERTS
. I am the wife of William Roberts, and keep a

linen-draper's shop in Paul-street. On the 28th of November, I had a shawl exposed for sale in my window-in about an hour after I saw it I missed it—I had one like this in the window—(looking at one)—I cannot swear to it.

Prisoner Manley. Q. Did you see me about? A. No.





JOHN WINGROVE
. I live in Paul-street. About a quarter past ten o'clock, on the 28th of November, I stood opposite the prosecutor's house—I saw four boys—the two prisoners were two of them—they were walking along, and Bolton went into the shop-another, not in custody, stood at the door-Manley and another walked on, and stood two doors higher up-Bolton was in the shop about a minute or two—he then came out with a shawl, and gave it to the other, who covered it with his apron, and they all walked on—we ran, and three of them ran off, and one stood back.





GEORGE WINGROVE
. I was standing nearly opposite to the prosecutor's, at my father's shop-four boys passed the prosecutor's door-Bolton went in, and Manley and the biggest of them walked on-Bolton came out in a minute or two with the shawl, and they walked on to Bath-street, and then three of them ran on—the other one stopped, as if he knew nothing about it—they ran on to Charlotte-street-Manley there dropped the shawl, and I took it up.

Manley's Defence. I heard a cry—I came back to the mob, and one of them had got Bolton—one of them said I was one of them—I said, "What do you mean?"—he said, "One that dropped the shawl"—I had stood in the crowd three minutes. MANLEY*—


GUILTY
. Aged 18. 


Transported for Seven Years.

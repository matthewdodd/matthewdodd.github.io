            . On Saturday the eleventh of April I was coming down Fleet-street


, and as I was standing by a print-shop, Mr. Crost said to me, Sir, your pocket is picked of a handkerchief; upon that, the prisoner hearing him say so, she took my handkerchief out of her pocket, and gave it to me, and said she pick'd it up from off the ground.
Q. Did you perceive her take it?
Dell. No, I did not; we took her before a magistrate, she there said she found it; Mr. Croft can give a farther account.

            . On Saturday the eleventh of April, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, I was in Fleet-street, Mr. Dell was standing at a print-shop a little on this side Serjeants-inn; I saw the prisoner go over from the other side the way, and go to the prosecutor, and push against him, and take a handkerchief out of his pocket, and put it into a pocket of her own, under her apron. I went and said to him, Sir, you have lost a handkerchief; he at that time did not know of it; we went to the prisoner, and I said I saw her take a handkerchief out of the gentleman's pocket. She then delivered it to him.
Prisoner's defence.
I found the handkerchief.




               Guilty. 10 d.
            

There was another indictment against her for a crime of the same nature.

GEORGE TAYLOR. I live in Change-alley, and am clerk
 to Messrs. Bond and Co. On the 15th of December, about seven o'clock in the evening, I was going up Holborn


; an officer spoke to me, and I missed my handkerchief. The officer took me towards Furnival's Inn, where he took the prisoners, and produced my handkerchief. I had not got out of the City.
Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you see Hartell that night? A. Yes; he did not appear intoxicated.

            . I am a constable of Clerkenwell. I was on Holborn with Jordan, and saw Mr. Taylor - the prisoners were following him from Holborn-hill; I watched them; I was on the opposite side. I saw Mills take something from Mr. Taylor's pocket, by Castle-street - I crossed, and told Mr. Taylor - the prisoners were then crossing - we followed them. I took Hartell, and Jordan took Mills - I found the handkerchief in Hartell's hat.
Cross-examined. Q. Did Hartell appear intoxicated? A. When he had been some time at the watch-house I thought he had been drinking, but he knew what he was about.(Property produced and sworn to.)

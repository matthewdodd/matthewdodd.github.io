Q. Did you see Mrs. Benjamin there? - A. Yes; I saw her shove this bill of parcels under it; I asked her, in the presence of the prisoner, if it was her property, and she would not own it; then there was a Mr. Benjamin, her husband there; I asked him, and he said, he knew nothing about it, the prisoner did not deny that it was his room; I looked at the property, and searched them all, and searched the room for the wrapper, but I could not find it; then I took them to the office, and they were committed; I got the key of the room and went back again, and found a bill of parcels under the chair, which alludes to the remainder of the property.(producing them).
Q. (To Staff). Are these the things you sent? - A. Yes.

I know the prisoner; I was going along Shoreditch with my husband; the prisoner came up to my husband, and told him he had got some things to sell, my husband said to me, in Dutch, that he would not go, and desired I would go; going along, I saw Harper; I am sure these things would never have come to light, but for me; Prudence asked me, if I knew that man, I said no; because I was afraid he would not take me to his house; he said, he was a trap at Worship-street Office; I went to Prudence's house, I knew Harper would follow me; I went up three pair of stairs and saw these things upon the bed, there was a bill of parcels he shewed me, I said, I could not read not write, and thenMr. Peach came, and said, Prudence, I went to speak to you.
Q. Are these the same things? - A. They are.
Q. Did the prisoner tell you where he got these things? - A. No; he said they were new things, and wanted me to buy them.
Prisoner's defence. I was going along, and met Mr. Myer's, and he asked me where I was going; I told him, I was going home, and he begged I would let him leave them at my house till his wife came in the evening for them; this woman said, her husband could not come, because he had got six gold watches that were got from the election in the Borough.

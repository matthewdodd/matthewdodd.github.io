                  Thomas 
                  Law 
               



            . I live in Whitechapel


, am a linen-draper
. I was abroad at the time. (He produced a piece of cheque ) Here is my private mark upon it; I know it to be mine. There was an information brought to our shop of a piece of cheque being taken from thence. The day following I went before the justice and saw this piece there; the two prisoners were there. I charged them with taking it out of my shop. 
               
                  Sarah 
                  Lamprey 
               



             acknowledg'd she took it, and said the other did not know any thing of the matter. The other was examined, and said she knew nothing of it.
Q. Did you ever see either of them in your shop?
Law. I don't remember I ever did.


                  Richard 
                  Law 
               



            . I am brother to the last witness, and am his apprentice. This piece of cheque produced here is my brother's property.
Q. How do you know it?
Law. I know it by the mark. The two prisoners came into the shop together, to buy a shirt; they bought one, and paid for it.
Q. Were they both concerned in buying it?
Law. They were; they had not been gone half a quarter of an hour before 
               
                  Sarah 
                  Warner 
               



             came and asked me, if 2 such women had been there, and described them: I said they had. Said she, Have they bought a piece of cheque? I said, No. She said, she saw one end of it drop from one of them in the dirt, the end having got loose. She said she could shew me where they lived. I went with her, and asked if they had taken a piece of cheque: They said no; upon which 
               
                  Mary 
                  Childerey 
               



             said, For God's sake fetch the cheque; don't let me have a noise about it. Lamprey pretended she knew nothing of it; at last she fetch'd it, and this is it. Lamprey said she took it under her apron from our shop. Then the woman that inform'd me went and brought a constable, and they were taken up, and put in the watch-house, my brother not being at home. The next day they were taken before the justice, where 
               
                  Sarah 
                  Lamprey 
               



             owned she had taken it.


                  Sarah 
                  Warner 
               



            . As I was sitting by my barrow I saw Lamprey drop a piece of cheque, and she catch'd it up in a hurry, seeming to be affrighted, upon which I thought she did not come honestly by it. I went to the prosecutor's shop, and asked if they had bought some cheque there, and told the young man what I had seen. He went with me. We asked a child where the women lived, who told us.
Q. Did you hear either of them own they took it out of the shop?
S. Warner. 
               
                  Sarah 
                  Lamprey 
               



             owned she took it under her apron; and she also said the same before the justice. She said the other knew nothing of the taking it.
Lamprey's defence.
I took it to be sure; this other woman knew nothing of it.

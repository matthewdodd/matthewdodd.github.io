. On the 25th of September, about nine o'clock in the morning, I found that a parcel which had been packed up, had been unpacked, and tied up in a different way-the prisoner was our errand-boy
. I got a constable, and he was called into the parlour - They called me in likewise. I saw the property there, which had been taken out of different parcels.
WILLIAM CLEMENTS. I am a constable. I was sent for to Mr. Lee's, to search the prisoner. I found nothing on him. I took two keys from him, and brought his box into the parlour-his brother was present. I unlocked the trunk, and found the articles stated in the indictment in it. There was a pair of black silk stockings in his waistcoat pocket, which was in the trunk.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

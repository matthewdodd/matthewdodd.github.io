            . I am a cordwainer
. Coming down Aldgate High-street


 on the 20th of May, about a quarter after eleven at night, at the end of Black-horse-yard, the prisoner took my hat off my head, there was a crape hat-band upon it; he ran up the yard with it; I ran after him as well as I could; I called stop thief two or three times; there were two men met him; they stopped him; I came up immediately to them; they had both hold of the prisoner; the men had got my hat; the prisoner begged I would forgive him, he went on his knees; I said I could not wrong my country in such a manner, I could not forgive him.
Q. How far was he got from you when he was stopped?
Crowden. I believe he might be about thirty yards.

            . I stopped the prisoner in Black-horse-yard, hearing stop thief called, and seeing him come running, he had this hat in his hand; I delivered it to the prosecutor; he owned it; the prisoner dropped it upon my laying hold of him, and begged I would let him go. (The hat and band produced and deposed to.)
Prisoner's defence.
I was coming along, I heard Mr. Crowden call stop thief, he ran up Black-horse-yard, and I ran after him to see who it was; a lad dropped the hat and I took it up, and they took hold of me, and said I was the person that took it.

            . I live in Caroline-court, Saffron-hill


, I am a victualler
; I lett the prisoner a ready furnished lodging, on the 13th of March last; he was porter
 to Dr. Stratford; he laid in the lodging about 5 weeks; he and his wife went away without my knowledge, on or about the 22d of April; two or three days after I opened the door, and missed the things mentioned in the indictment (mentioning them by name.) These I lett him with the room; when I took the prisoner up, he begged I would not hurt him; he told me where the things were pawned, which was to Mr. Clark, at the corner of Benjamin-street.

JOHN COOK
. I am a policeman. On the 8th of Septemper I was in High-street, Stoke Newington—I saw the prisoner coming along with a bolier, about two miles from the prosecutor's—I asked him where he was going with it—he said, "To London;" and that he had bought it at a sale, for 4s. at Edmonton—I asked what part of London he was going to take it to—he hesitated, and said, "To Whiteehapel"—I said, "Well, You will have no objection to call at the station-house as you go by?"—he went with me—he said there that he lived in Brick-lane—I found he lived with his uncle, who claimed it.






ISSAC GODDARD
. I am a corn-dealer, and live at High-cross, Tottenham. The prisoner is my nephew—I took him in because he had no home—he was to stop with me until he could get employ—he took this boiler from the bay-loft—he bore a good character, but I am afraid he has got among a bad set, and he has had a bad examplein his father.




GUILTY. Aged 20.—Recommended to mercy.

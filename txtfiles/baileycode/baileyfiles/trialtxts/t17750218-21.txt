            . I am a haberdasher

, in partnership

 with Nicholas Sebier; on the 17th of January, about six in the evening some people informed us our window was broke and a piece of ribband had been taken out, I ran out into the street and saw the prisoner in custody and the ribband on the ground, I took the ribband up; the prisoner was brought into the shop, he fell on his knees and said he wished it could be passed over and he would serve his majesty.

            . Going by the prosecutors, I saw the prisoner drawing the ribband through the hole of the window, one end of it hung down on the ground. I laid hold of him, he bit my hand and got away, I called to a coachman who stopped him and brought him into Mr. Flints shop.
Flint. The window was broke, I don't know whether it was so before or no.

As I was going by, I saw the ribband come from the window and was going to tell the gentleman of it.

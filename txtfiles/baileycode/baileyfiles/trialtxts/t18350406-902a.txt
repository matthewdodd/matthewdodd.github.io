ROBERT TIBNAM
. I am a packer, and live in Union-street, Little Moorfields. On the 17th of March, I saw the prisoner in Mill's-court, about a quarter of a stoppage—he gave it to the prisoner, and ran away—the prisoner walked on with it—I hallooed, "Step thief!"—an officer came up at the time—I gave him to the officer—I secured him myself, with it on him.

Prisoner. Q. Did you see me with the basket? A. I did—two of them together were carrying it, one holding each end.





JOHN PRADE
. This linen was in my cart, in Milk-street—there was a stoppage—I ran, to catch hold of my horse's head, to prevent his going through the window, and in that time this basket was taken—I was carrying it for Eleanor Elizabeth Stevenson—it was a clothes-basket, with two handles.





ELEANOR ELIZABETH STEVENSON
. I am a laundress. This linen was instructed to my care, to wash—I sent Prade home with it.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

Prisoner's Defence. I was returning home, up the street—another man was passing by—there was a stoppage of coaches and carts—the man hallooed "Stop thief"—a man dropped the basket just behind me, and ran by me—I walked on, and this man took hand of me.




GUILTY
. Aged 19.—


Transported for Seven Years.

            . I live in Dyot-street, St. Giles's


: I had about 40 s. in halfpence and some farthings; I kept them in a woollen night cap and a stocking; the night cap was in a box. I went out on the 21st of April, between eight and nine in the morning, and left the prisoner in bed in the next room; I came home between seven and eight at night and missed my money; I went directly to the constable.

            . I met with the prisoner and stopped him; I found the money upon him; he offered me half to keep it secret; I refused to take it and secured him.
The prisoner acknowledged the charge.

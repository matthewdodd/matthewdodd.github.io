            . On the 25th of November I saw the prisoner in company with two other lads, at half-past nine o'clock in the evening - they were looking into a shop window; they passed that, and separated - I then watched the prisoner, and saw him go into the prosecutor's shop, in Bury-street, St. James'; he was not in a minute - he came out, saw me by the window, and ran off; I pursued, and just as I was going to take him in Duke-street he threw this bowl over an area; a female gave it me up - I took the prisoner to the station, and found on him four half-crowns, three shillings, two sixpences, two penny-pieces, three halfpence, and one farthing in his left-hand trousers pocket.

            . I am a baker
. I know this bowl; it was in the till in my shop on the 25th of November - it had four or crowns in it, and some small money; I was in the back parlour - I had seen it quite safe not two minutes before it was taken.

JOHN MORGAN. I keep a shop and sell pork
, at Bromley, St. Leonard's


. I lost four pieces of pork on the 24th of February; I did not see it taken, but it was brought back and I knew it was mine - it had been on my counter; the door must have been open for a person to go in - the window does not open.

            . I overtook the prisoner with the pork about two hundred yards from the shop; he was carrying it in his smock frock - he said he had bought it at Whitechapel.

            . I saw the prisoner go out of the shop backwards - I suspected he had done something wrong, and I said to my uncle he has taken something; he was brought back afterwards.

            . I took the prisoner, and found this stick with a hook at the end of it, and the pork was lacerated with the hook.
Prisoner's Defence. I met a man who asked me to have a bit of meat which he showed me - I said I had not money for it; he wanted 7s. - I was going away, but was called back and had it for 6s.

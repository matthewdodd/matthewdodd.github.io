             sworn. - I am the wife of the last witness; I lost a great many things; the first thing I missed was a card of black lace, about twelve yards.
Q.What was the value of that card of black lace? - A.Six guineas.
Q.Did you miss any other card of black lace? - A. Yes, I missed a quantity of brown striped sarcenet, I should suppose about twelve yards.
Q. What is the value of that? - A. I should suppose about two shillings and six-pence a yard; these are the only things I recollect missing myself.
Q. Where did you miss them from? - A. We only missed them by searching; there was a small piece of white lace missing, I understood Miss Jones had taken it up stairs; I enquired of her for it, and she said she could not tell where it was.
Q.When was that? - A. On Thursday, the 8th of April.
Q. Did she continue in your house till the 8th of April? - A. Yes, Mr. Sowerby made a mistake; it was April, and not March; she staid in the house till the 10th.
Q. Where did you miss the card of black lace from? - A. I missed it from the lace-box, on the 8th of April.
Q. How long before that had you looked into that box? - A. I cannot exactly say; I had not an idea that such a thing was gone; it might be more than a month or six weeks.
Q. Did you miss any thing else? - A.No; we found other things which I had not missed.
Q. What led you to imagine it was the prisoner who had taken these things? - A. Being informed that she had taken a bit of white lace up stairs, I asked her for it, and she said she could not find it.
Q. Did she admit that she had taken it up stairs? - A. Yes; she said she meant to card it, and had put it in her bosom, and took it up stairs; the sarcenet was found in a small box of her's; a lady's pelice had been cut off it; I brought it down stairs, and asked Miss Jones if she had taken that up too, and she said, no, she had bought it.
Q. Have you had the care of the sarcenet ever since? - A. Yes. (Produces it.)
Q. Look at it, and say if you are sure that is the sarcenet from which the lady's pelice was cut off? - A. Yes; this is the place where it was cut from; here is another piece of sarcenet that I found in her box; I thought I had some like it, and I sent for my own, and found this piece join it exactly.
Q. Have you that piece here? - A. I have;(Produces it.) I had desired Miss Jones to go up stairs with me, and let me see her box; I found a number of pieces of muslin and a variety of triffling articles.
Q. When did you find the goods in question? - A. On the 8th of April; the other articles are pledged.
Q. Who are the persons who had the care of those things - who missed them? - A. All the young people.
Q. Are they here? - A. Here is one, Miss Wilson; every young person in the house has access to all those articles; when a dress is wanted, they go and take what they want.
Q. Did you communicate to Miss 
               Jones
             the loss that you had sustained? - A. Yes, and she said she did not know any thing of it.
Q. When did you make that communication? - A. On the 9th; she cried very much, and gave me three duplicates that morning, and said, that was all that she knew about it.
Q. What are the duplicates? - A. Eighteen pair of stockings, two table-spoons, and twelve pair of stockings.
Q. Did you, in consequence of receiving these duplicates, go to the pawnbrokers? - A. No; the pawnbrokers are here.
Q.Who is Lockwood? - A. Mrs. Lockwood is my mother.
Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. This young lady came to you in December? - A. Yes.
Q. She came to improve herself in her own line of business? - A. Yes.
Q. Had she been in the business before? - A. She told me so.
Q. Did she offer her services for wages, or upon a premium that she was to give you to learn the business? - A. Upon a premium; she was to give me at first twenty pounds, and she was to stay three years.
Court. Q. What was she to learn? - A. Millinery and mantua-making; but, before it was finally settled, I thought it too long, and we agreed that she should pay thirty pounds, and stay one year.
Mr. Knapp. Q. Was that paid? - A. She said it was not quite convenient for her father to pay it till the last day of February.
Q. How many persons have the conduct of your business? - A.Sometimes more, and sometimes less.
Q. How many, from the month of December to April, were concerned in the management of your business, under your control? - A. Six.
Q.Therefore, if any customer were to come to your shop? - A. It is not a shop; it is a private house.
Q. If any customer came to you, they might all have the control, and serve your customers? - A. Yes, at different times.
Q. I understand you there were fourteen yards, you suppose, of black lace? - A. No, I said I thought about twelve, but I was not quite certain; it is point ground lace.
Q. Of course, in your line of business, you had a large quantity of black lace? - A.No.
Q. More than one card, I suppose? - A. Yes, a great many cards.
Q. Had you taken stock shortly before? - A.It might be six weeks.
Q.There was nothing particular in your black lace distingushable from other black lace? - A. No.
Q. Neither can you tell us, in the course of six months, how much you might have sold? - A. No.
Q. When these things were taken, the probability would be, that they might have been taken at different times? - A. Yes.
Q. As you cannot ascertain the exact quantity, you cannot, of course, six the value? - A. No.
Court. Q.Have you measured the card of lace? - A. No.
Mr. Knapp. Q. Can you state, that that card of lace positively had not been sold in your shop during six months? - A. Yes.
Q. You can venture to swear that? - A. Yes.
Q.Miss Jones was crying at the time, and shewed great contrition? - A. At first she denied it; then she gave me three duplicates, and said, that was all; and afterwards she gave Miss Wilson two duplicates.

Q.Have you never had parcels of lace taken out of that box for customers to look at? - A.Yes; the reason why I missed this particular lace, was, I intended to wear it myself; I went to look for it, and found it was gone.

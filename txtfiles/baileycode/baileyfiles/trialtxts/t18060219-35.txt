             sworn. I am clerk
 to Messrs Calvert and Co; on Wednesday the 15th of January between the hours of six and seven in the evening, the prisoner at the bar came into the accompting house in Thames-street


, saying that he came from Mrs. Clark, who keeps a public house in Oxford-street, that she wished us to send for some empty buts; while I turned my back to get the book to make a memorandum of it, I heard the prisoner move from where he stood towards the iron safe where the coat hung; I immediately came round to where I was, and before I got round the prisoner had got into the passage, I followed him and took him in the passage with the coat in his possession; this is the coat; it is my property.
Q. What did he say for himself. - A. He said he found the coat in the passage.
Q. That was not true. - A. No, it was hanging up, I saw it there not three hours before.
Prisoner's Defence. I have nothing to say; I shall throw myself entirely on the mercy of the court.
The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.

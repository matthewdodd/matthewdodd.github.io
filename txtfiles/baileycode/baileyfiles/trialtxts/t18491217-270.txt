FRANCIS MILLARD
. About a quarter to eight o'clock in the evening I was at the shop of my employer, John William Field, a silversmith in the Borough, and heard a knock against a pane of glass—I looked at the window, and saw the prisoner there—he smashed the window in with his two fists, and pulled out a number of gold and silver watches and gold chains which were hanging in the window—he attempted to run away with them—I ran out of the «hop, and secured him at the window with the articles in his hand—he threw some of them on the pavement—he kept two gold chains in his hand—I kept hold of him till the police came, and he was given into custody—I have the things here that were found, eight watches, six gold chains, and two silver crosses—there are two silver watches and one gold chain missing—the things produced are Mr. Field's—he lives in the house, and keeps it—it is in the parish of St. Mary, Newington.





JOHN LOVELOCK
 (policeman, A 477). I am attached to the M division. On 3d Dec, about a quarter to eight o'clock, I was called, went to the house, and saw the prisoner in custody—Millard gave him to me—I took these two chains out of his hand—the window was completely smashed—at the station, he said he did it with the intention of taking all he could.

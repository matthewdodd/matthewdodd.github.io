            . I am a constable, and was placed outside Mr. Morris' shop, by his order, on the 7th of July, to stop the prisoner when he came out, which I did, just about one o'clock; I said he must not go, as I suspected he had some property belonging to his master about him; I took off his hat, and in it I found this worsted; I then proceeded to put my hand in his pocket, and took out this bobbin of silk - he staggered across from one side to the other, and said it was his first offence, and he did it for want; I told him he made his case worse - I then took him to Covent-garden watch-house; he said he hoped his master would forgive him - it was the first time.

            . I gave directions to the witness to do what he has done; I heard the prisoner say it was his first offence, and he hoped I would forgive him; this property is worth about 6s.; I then caused a search to be made at his lodgings; I had property of this description on my premises.
Cross-examined by Mr. CURWOOD. Q. How long had he worked for you? A. Eight years and a half - I would wish to speak on his behalf, in consideration of his wife, who is pregnant, and has five children.

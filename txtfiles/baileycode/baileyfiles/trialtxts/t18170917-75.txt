            . On the 14th of August I apprehended the prisoner at Bristol. I told him what it was for. He said he had bought a quantity of dollars in Cornhill; I found 178 on him, and some plate. He said he had changed the notes for smaller ones. I found twenty-nine 1l. notes on him - I found him within six miles of the British Channel. He said he took some plate out of pledge with the money. He said the small notes were part of the produce of them; I also found a gold watch on him.
Prisoner. I am guilty.

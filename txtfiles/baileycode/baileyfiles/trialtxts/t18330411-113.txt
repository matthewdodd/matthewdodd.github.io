            . I am a coal-merchant
, and live at Red Lion-wharf, Wapping. On the 3rd of April, between one and two o'clock, I was in Thames-street


, just before the Custom-house; I thought I felt something at my pocket - I turned round, and the prisoner had got my handkerchief in his hands, doubling it up; he saw me, and dropped it - I followed him, calling Stop thief! and he was stopped on St. Dunstan's-hill; it was safe not ten minutes before.

            . I am an officer of Tower ward. - The prisoner was delivered to me with the handkerchief; I have had it ever since.(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. The gentleman was on the other side of the way; I saw a boy attempt his pocket - I crossed, caught hold of the boy, and he threw the handkerchief at my feet, and ran away - I ran after him, and the gentleman took me.
MR. WIPPELL. It is utterly false - there was a boy near him, who went away; he did not state this then.

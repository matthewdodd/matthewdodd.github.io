WILLIAM PEMBROKE
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
9th of May, 1 purse, value 6d.; 1 sovereign, 4 half-crowns, 9 shillings, and 1 groat; the property of 



George Hughes Wilkins, from his person; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






GEORGE HUGHES WILKINS
. I am a lieutenant in the Rifle Brigade, stationed at Windsor. On the 9th of May, about four or five o'clock in the afternoon, I was in Regent-street, and saw the prisoner following me very closely—I had suspicion—he turned down a street—I felt, and my purse was gone—he then joined another lad—there was no one near me but the prisoner till I lost my purse—I pursued him—before I said any thing to him, he set off, running—one of the two dropped my purse—it contained the property stated—this is it—(examining one)—the prisoner was taken in a public-house.

Cross-examined by
MR. PAYNE
Q. After you took up your purse you went into the public-house? A. Yes—the prisoner was as dose to me as could be when I felt something at my pocket—that was about a hundred yards from the public-house—I think there were two turnings—the street was unusually thin of people—the other person was not far from me, but not so near as the prisoner—I had observed the prisoner while I was in a pastrycook's shop, where I had changed a sovereign, and then he followed me.





TIMOTHY GIBLETT
 (police-constable C 95.) I saw the prisoner turn a

street, and run off—he turned into a public-house and sat down, and I took him—he was sitting with his hat off.





JEREMIAH MILSTEAD
 (police-constable C 132.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Gilbert's office, at Westminster—(read)—the prisoner is the person.

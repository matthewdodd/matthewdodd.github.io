JOHN KING



, stealing 1 chest, 20lbs. of coffee, and 2 tablets, value 21.5s. 6d.; the goods of 



Robert Snowden; having been before convicted.






WILLIAM WAKEFIELD
. I assist Robert Snowden, my brother-in-law. On 12th March, about a quarter-past five o'clock, I saw this chest in the street, with some coffee and two show-tablets in it, ready for Pickford's to take away, with other cases—somebody told me something, I opened the door and a boy pointed out the prisoner; I followed him, he ran, was stopped, and I took him—I passed the chest as I ran—it is worth 2l. 5s., and is Robert Snowden's property.





WILLIAM WRIGHT
. I am errand-boy to Mr. Robert Snowden. About a quarter-past four, on 12th March, I was up-stairs, cleaning windows—I heard my mistress holloa; went down, and saw the prisoner drop the chest of coffee about twelve yards from the house—I called Stop thief!" and pointed him out to Mr. Wakefield; a cabman stopped him—I ran too, and did not lose sight of him—I am sure he is the man.





THOMAS EVANS
 (policeman, G 145). The prisoner was brought to the station—I told him the charge; he said he knew nothing about it, he was merely passing along—he was very much out of breath.





EDWARD RICH
 ('policeman, G 122). On the afternoon of 12th Feb. I was at home, and saw the prisoner and two others loitering about—the prisoner took this chest—I was lame but I opened the window and sprung my rattle, and called "Stop thief!"—he dropped it and ran away.





JAMES BRANNAN
 (police-inspector). I produce a certificate (read—Joseph Holland, convicted Dec, 1847; confined one month)—I was present—the prisoner is the man.

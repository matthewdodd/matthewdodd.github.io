.

I called Coates-we pursued and secured him. I do not know the value of the watch. I never lost sight of him.
HENRY COATES. I am servant to Mr. Ward. I overtook and secured the prisoner in Brownlow-street. I first caught sight of him in Southampton-street, which is two doors from our house. He ran down Charles-street, across Drury-lane, into Brownlow-street.

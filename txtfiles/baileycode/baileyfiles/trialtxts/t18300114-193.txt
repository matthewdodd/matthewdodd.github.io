            . The prisoner was in my employ on the 9th of December; he was to receive money for me, which it was his duty to bring to me directly. I sent him at ten o'clock that morning to Messrs. Salt's, the bankers, and desired him to make haste back; he was to get 18l. 7s. 6d. for a cheque - he never returned, and I did not see him again till the 21st; when his wife had committed some assault, and he went to bail her - my servant saw him, and gave charge of him; he had been eight months in my service.
FREDERICK RIDLER. I paid this cheque on the 9th of December to a man, I think between eleven and twelve o'clock; I cannot swear to the person.
VALENTINE SIMMIONS. This is the cheque - when he was brought to me he said his wife had got 10l, which he would give me the next day - I said to him, "You are a pretty fellow, what is the reason you did not return with the money?" I am sure I said that; he said he was very sorry, he had been robbed of it.
Prisoner's Defence. I was coming home with the money, and was very thirsty - I went and got something to eat and drink - when I came out I had lost the money in the public-house.

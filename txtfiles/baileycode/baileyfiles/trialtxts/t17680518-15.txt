            . The prisoner was porter
 in the house where I live. On Wednesday the 20th of April, about ten minutes after four in the afternoon, I missed my watch-case from my side, I suppose it dropped by accident from my side as I was going up stairs. On the Thursday se'nnight after, the prisoner was stopped offering it to a Jew to sell.

            . I am a Jew. On the 26th of April, between six and seven in the evening I was standing in Duke's place, the prison walking up and down with an apron on; hed me if I knew where a goldsmith lived; I told him there was one through the arch; then he beckoned me to him, and asked me if I would buy a piece of gold, and pulled out this watch-case; I asked him what he would have for it; he said a guinea; I asked him where he got it; he said he found it between Bow and Stepney; I said, why did you not sell it before you came here, there are many silversmiths between there and Duke's-place; so I stopped him and sent for an officer, ( produced and deposed to by prosecutrix.)
Prisoner's defence.
If they can say I stole it, I'll suffer the law; please to ask Mr. Bennet, my master, my character.
Mr. Bennet. I had a very good opinion of him to the last; I had agreed to advance his wages but a week before I took him up; I never knew any thing amiss of him before this.

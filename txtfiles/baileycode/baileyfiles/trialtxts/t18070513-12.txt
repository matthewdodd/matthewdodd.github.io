. - A. I am; the prisoner was employed by me as a printer
 for about nine or ten years.
Q. Had you for a long time before suspected that you had lost a great deal of property. - A. I missed more than a thousand pound in one year; in consequence of that I employed five or six to watch, and my apprentice in particular.
Q. In consequence of what he informed you, did you get to the fact that the prisoner had robbed you. - A. I did.
Q. Was the property afterwards produced to you. - A. Most assuredly it was.

             Q. You are an apprentice to the prosecutor. - A. Yes. On the 15th of April, about ten minutes past seven in the morning, I was at the corner of Hill-street, Finsbury-square; I saw the prisoner come out of the manufactory with a piece of floor cloth upon his shoulder; I followed him, I see him go into Mr. Benson's, a chandler's shop in Gee-street, with the floor cloth. I waited till he came out again.
Q. Did he come out with any thing. - A. No. I went immediately to my master, and gave information of what I had seen.
Cross-examined by Mr. Walford. How do you know that what you saw the prisoner carry was floor cloth. - A. I had seen it before in the factory.
MRS. BENSON. - Mr. Knapp. Do you know the prisoner. - A. I do; he came to me, I believe it was the 14th or 15th of April, about eight o'clock in the morning, he came to me with a floor cloth; I purchased it of Stokes, I paid him thirty shillings for it.
Q. Was that the piece of floor cloth that was taken by the officer. - A. I believe it is; it was sold to Mrs. Fletcher.
Cross-examined by Mr. Walford. You bargained with the prisoner's wife for the floor cloth. - A. I did.
Q. How came you to purchase it of him. - A. The first time I knew the prisoner, I wanted a carpet painted; Mrs Fisher recommended him to me.

            . - Mr. Knapp. You are an officer of Worship-street. - A. I am. On the 15th of April I apprehended the prisoner; I asked him what he had done with the floor cloth, he said he knew nothing about it; I told him he should go to Mr. Benson's in Gee-street with me, and there he should find it; he then said he was very sorry, but he had sold it to her for forty shillings. We went to Benson's house with a search warrant; Benson went over with us to the little girl's mother; the little girl was in the room; I took the piece of floor cloth up. It has been in the office ever since, in the custody of Armstrong.
(The property produced and identified.)
The prisoner left his defence to his counsel, called five witnesses, who gave him a good character.

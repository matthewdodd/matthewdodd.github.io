            . I am a headborough. About half-past nine o'clock, on Saturday the 8th of January, I saw the prisoner with another person - he turned up a gateway - I collared him, and asked what he had got there; he said he did not know - I said, I must know, and took him to the watch-house; he had this tray, and said there, that a man employed him to take it to the Minories.

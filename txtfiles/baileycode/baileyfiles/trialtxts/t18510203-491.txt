conducted the Prosecution.






JOHN VARLEY
. I am a tailor and draper, at 44, Tottenham-court-road, in the parish of St. Pancras; it is my dwelling-house. On Friday, 17th Jan., I went to bed between eleven and twelve o'clock—I was the last person up, and I secured the house myself—I double-locked the street-door, and left the key in the lock, put up a chain across, and bolted the bottom bolt—in the passage there is a door leading into the shop—I locked it, and had the key upstairs with me—I went into the shop; the goods were all safe on the shelves, and this coat was on the block—I was disturbed between three and four o'clock in the morning, came down, found the street-door shut to, but unlocked; the chain was down, and the bolt drawn back; the door was latched—the door leading from the passage to the shop had been broken open—I saw a quantity of cloth in the passage, packed up, apparently ready to take away; and in my presence a jemmy was found in the kitchen under the water-butt—the cloth had been on the shelves the night before—on looking up the kitchen-chimney, Moran was found with my coat on.

Cross-examined by
MR. PARNELL. Q. Have you any name but John? A. No; I have no partner—it is my opinion that some one must have secreted themselves in ray house—they might have an opportunity to get in

while the men were closing the shop about ten o'clock—they would have no opportunity earlier than that.





HENRY BINGHAM
 (policeman, E 153). About two o'clock in this morning, 18th Jan., I was on duty in Tottenham-court-road, on the opposite side to Mr. Varley's—I saw Johnson and Gosling loitering about—I watched them for half an hour—they went down the bye-streets, Windmill-street, and Goodge-street, and John-street—I afterwards saw them go to Mr. Varley's door—they tapped at the door with their hands—I heard the key turn in the lock; the door was opened, and Williams and Cotter came out and joined the other two—they went talking together down Tottenham-court-road and Percy-street, which is the first turning—I got the assistance of Bruce, ran down Windmill-street, and met the four prisoners—that was about two minutes after I had seen them go down Percy-street—Bruce took Johnson, and made a grab at Williams, but he got away—I took Gosling and Cotter, took them some little distance, and then Gosling got away—Cotter and Johnson were taken to the station—I then went to Mr. Varley's; I rang the bell, and Mr. Varley came down—I saw this bag full of cloth, and two bundles lying in the passage, near the street-door—there were 118 yards of cloth altogether—the door leading out of the passage to the shop had been forced open by an instrument like this jemmy, which was found down-stairs—there were marks which seemed to agree with this—here is a portion of the lock which was broken off—the till bad been taken out of its place, and stood on the counter empty—I took it and the cloth to the station—I then went to a lodging-house in Neal's-yard, Seven Dials, more than a quarter of a mile from Mr. Varley's, and found Williams in bed at about half-past three o'clock—I told him the charge—he said he knew nothing about it—I took him to the station, and found on him one sovereign, two half-crowns, three new sixpences, six shillings, another sixpence, and sixpenny worth of halfpence—I saw Johnson searched; 2s. 6d. and 1 1/2 d. was found on him—I had known Williams about six years, Gosling about four years, and Johnson and Cotter about two years—I did not know Moran—I cannot be mistaken in either of them—I was not in uniform, Bruce was.

Cross-examined by
MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. What money did you find on Cotter? A. 1l. 14s., in which there were three new sixpences—the inspector said something about the date—Mr. Varley was present; the foreman was not; I had not seen him—Cotter had on a flannel jacket, with a coat over it—I have known him two years—no doubt he knows me—the four prisoners were walking as close as if they were arm-in-arm—they were talking together.

Cross-examined by
MR. PAYNE. Q. Were you in any disguise? A. I had a brown coat on—I watched Gosling and Johnson for half an hour—I did not speak to them—they passed very close to me, but did not see me—I got into a doorway in Tottenham-court-road, to avoid their seeing me—I did not always walk close to them—Bruce came out of Windmill-street, and they crossed, to avoid him, and came almost close to me—I believe they did not see me—I went into a doorway several times.

Cross-examined by
MR. PARRY. Q. When those two persons came out of the door, where did they go? A. Down Tottenham-court-road, and down Percy-street—I saw Williams for more than a minute, not more than two minutes—I bad no lantern—there is a lamp opposite the next house to Mr. Varley's, and one at the corner of Percy-street.






JOHN BRUCE
 (policeman, E 84). I have known Gosling and Williams four or five years, and Johnson about three years—I was on duty in Tottenham-court-road on 17th Jan., about two o'clock—I saw Gosling and Johnson loitering about Tottenham-court-road, about ten yards from Mr. Varley's—I saw them several times—they crossed the street when they were about to meet me—I had seen them rather better than half an hour when Bingham called me—I went with him down Windmill-street, and turned into Percy-street, and met the four prisoners walking abreast—I took Williams and Johnson, but Williams got away.

Cross-examined by
MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. Were you at the station when Cotter was searched? A. Yes; I did not search him—I was at the door, about four yards from the prisoner—the inspector was present, and Bingham, and the jailor—there was no remark made then about the three new sixpences—the foreman remarked at the police-court that there were three new sixpences.

Cross-examined by
MR. PAYNE. Q. you were not in disguise, and did not get into any doorway? A. No; I was about twelve yards from Johnson and Gosling—they could see me—they looked over their, shoulders to see me—I saw Bingham, and knew he was watching the prisoners—he had got a brown coat on, and a black hat—I did not see the prisoners come out of the house.

Cross-examined by
MR. PARRY. Q. Did you try to catch Williams? A. Yes; I knew my brother officer was watching—I did not take much notice of them—I was not more than a foot from Williams when I clutched at him.





WILLIAM LANGLEY
 (police-sergeant, F 42). I apprehended Gosling at 12, Cleveland-street, Fitzroy-square, on the morning of 18th Jan.—I told him he was charged with burglary—he said, "I know nothing of it; I am as innocent as the day."





THOMAS HILLMAN
. I am foreman to the prosecutor; I had charge of the till. I left 1l. 15s. in it on Friday night—there was a sovereign, two half-crowns, three new sixpences, and some shillings—I had noticed the new sixpences very particularly, because I had taken them a short time before; they were of the date of 1850—the next morning I found the till empty—I afterwards saw some money at the police-court—I believe these are the same sixpences that I put into the till; they are the same date—I took nine of them that evening—I put some into my own pocket—on the evening of the robbery I saw Johnson in our shop between six and seven o'clock—he staid perhaps twenty minutes—I had not known him before—he said he wished to look at some trowsers—I showed him a pair—he asked the price, and then he said he had altered his mind, and it should remain till he could afford to buy a better pair—on the Monday before Gosling came to the shop, between nine and ten at night, and inquired the price of a waistcoat in the window—I tried to sell it him—he was there a good half-hour, talking about waistcoats and trying them on—he went away without buying anything.

Cross-examined by
MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. When were these sixpences paid to you? A. The same evening—I changed nine new sixpences and one old one, for two half-crowns.





RICHARD PIKE
 (policeman, F 141). I have known Williams about four months—I heard of this robbery—about twenty minutes before I heard of it I saw Williams, about three o'clock, in Queen-street, Sevendials

—he went to his lodging in Neal's-yard—I have seen him frequently go in and out there.

Cross-examined by
MR. PARRY. Q. Why did not you go before the Magistrate? A. I did not know that I should be required—I was sent for this morning; a messenger of the Court came for me; he did not tell me that the case against Williams was so weak that they could not do without me.





GARRETT BARRY
 (policeman, A 344). I produce a certificate of Johnson's conviction—(read—Convicted Oct. 1849; confined one year.) I was present—he is the man.

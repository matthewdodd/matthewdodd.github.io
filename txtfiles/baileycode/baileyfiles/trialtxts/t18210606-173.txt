. On the 10th of March, the prisoner came to my shop and asked if I let chaise harness out; and said he wanted one for four days, to go to Oxford; and asked me to lend him another harness, for a particular friend, who was going with him - I let him have one harness, and he sent a man for the chaise and other harness - I asked where he lived, he said, in Rawstone-street, Clerkenwell, and kept a stable. On Monday, a man called, and gave me information - I went and found my chaise at a stable-yard, in Goswell-street-road; and the harness pawned in the Strand, for 50 s. - I apprehended him in Tottenham-court-road, two months after.

Prisoner's Defence. I hire ten or twelve every day, and let them out again - it did not suit me to go to Oxford, and wanting money, I pawned them.

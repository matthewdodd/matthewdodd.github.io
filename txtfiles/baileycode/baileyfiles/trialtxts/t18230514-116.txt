MARY MULLOY. I am a single woman, in service at a public-house, in Mount-street, Grosvenor-square


. On the 10th of April I slept in the attic; the prisoner came to lodge in the house for that night, he went to bed at ten o'clock, on the second floor, and after eleven, as I was going to my room, I heard a noise in the boy's room, which is also in the garret; I went in and found the prisoner; I asked what brought him there - he said he had made a mistake. I saw my gown drop, which I had seen that day in the drawers in my own room. I went and found my door open, and a shawl on the drawers, which I had left in my box - the drawers were pulled out. I came down, told my mistress - master came up and told him to dress and be off - he would not unless master returned what he had paid, and he was given in charge.
Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. You found things misplaced - A. Yes; the gown was in the boy's room. I shewed the prisoner his room in the afternoon, but did not light him to bed; the boy's room is above the floor he slept on.

            . I am a constable. I took the prisoner; he stood in the tap room with his back to the table, and kept working with his hands behind him. I looked, and found a pair of stockings on the bench, close to his coat skirt. The girl claimed them. He had a bag half full of shavings.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

                  John 
                  Campbell 
               



            . On the 14th of July
, I lost the Things out of my Children's Room; the Prisoner was my Servant
; I knew she took them, because I found the Door wide open in the Morning, and she was gone; upon this I advertised her; and my Wife having told me, that she lived formerly at Leigh in Essex; I got a Warrant, and sent 
               
                  Clement 
                  King 
               



             down; and he went and took her, and brought her to Town; and she had on the Brocade Gown, a Pair of the Shoes, the Stockings, and the laced Headcloths of my Wife's; I asked her how she could be guilty of such a Thing; she owned the Fact, and made a great deal of whindling and crying, as such People do.


                  Clement 
                  King 
               



            . I found her about five Miles off Leigh, and a young Fellow along with her, like her Gentleman; said I, she has robbed such a Person; look here Christian, said I, you lived along with Mr Campbell, did not you? No, says she, I do not know such a Man; said I, I shall make you know him before I go; I am sure, says she, you are mistaken; said I, I have got a Warrant for you; I took hold of the young Fellow, and said, if he did not clear himself I would take him into Custody; he said, he was not concerned in the Robbery; says the Prisoner, I am not willing to go to Prison here, but I will go to London; she rode upon my Horse, and I brought her to Mr Campbell's; she said, she would give me her Mistress's Things, if I would but beg her own Gown of her Mistress. 

               Guilty

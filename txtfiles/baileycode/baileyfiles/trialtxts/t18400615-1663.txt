FREDERICK PETER NICHOLAS DE KRUGER.
On the 20th of May, about a quarter before nine o'clock in the evening, I was passing from Cecilstreet to Castle-street, St. Martin's-lane—I had a bag and a pocket-book in the right side pocket of my coat—two lads overtook me in Castlestreet, and spoke to me—I put my hand to my pocket, and the bag was gone—I had not felt it taken out, nor had I missed it—I went to the station-house and saw it.





THOMAS FLETCHER.
I was in St. Martin's-lane. I saw the prisoner put his hand into the prosecutor's pocket, and take out something dark—it appeared like this bag—there was another person with the prisoner—they turned back—I went after the prisoner, and gave him into custody—he dropped this bag—(producing it.)





JOSEPH MANNERS
(police-constable F79.) Fletcher gave charge of the prisoner and his companion—I took them both—the other broke away, and went in the direction of Charing Cross.

Prisoner's Defence. I was standing by when the officer took the other, who got away—I went with him quite quietly.

            . I am watchman to Captain

                at the Savoy
, I left the Prisoner with my wife as a nurse between seven and eight at night, when I came home between seven and eight in the morning the lady was gone. The money and the velvet hood were in a box. I put the key of the box into my wife's pocket. I found the box drawn from under the bed unlocked, and the key in it. I pursued the Prisoner next day to Gravesend, for I thought she was going to Fianders, and I heard she was got to her father's and mother's at Thistleworth. She had laid out 25 s. for a pair of stays, I brought her back to my house, and found the velvet hood upon her head and the hat, she had the shift upon her back, but I would not take that; those I can swear to - the money was all gone. 


               Guilty 4 s. 10 d.
            

Prisoner. He keeps a bawdy house in Thieving Lane, and lives by the diversion of poor women.

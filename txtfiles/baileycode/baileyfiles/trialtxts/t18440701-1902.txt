JAMES LITTLE
 and 




JAMES SIMPSON
 were again indicted for

 stealing 1 ladle, value 2s. 6d.; 2 spoons, 7s. 6d.; and 1 fork, 2s. 6d.; the goods of 



Lewis Hayes.


JANE----. I am housekeeper to Lewis Hayes; I had a ladle, two spoons, and a fork safe—two boys got in at the window—I called out "Thief," and some one came—they were frightened, but ran away with the silver, and threw it away in the front gardens—these are my master's property.





WILLIAM SENIOR
. I am nine years old. On the 29th of June, between three and four o'clock in the day, I saw the two prisoners run into the prosecutor's garden—one of them lifted up the prosecutor's window, put his hand in, and drew out something bright with his hand—the servant hallooed out, and they ran, and threw the spoons on the shrubs in the garden.





BENJAMIN SENIOR
. I picked up this ladle, two spoons, and this fork in the shrubs—I did not see any boys.





THOMAS WHITE
. I was passing Belmont-place, Wands worth-road, where the prosecutor lives, between three and four o'clock—I saw the prisoners run from the house, and chuck the spoons in the shrubs—I am sure the prisoners are the boys.

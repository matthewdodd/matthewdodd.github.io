. On the 6th of December, I missed a shift, which hung in the garden by the back door; my child cried out, "Mother, a man has taken the shift off the line, and is putting it into his hat." I ran out, and saw somebody running up the road. The officer stopped the prisoner.

            . I am an officer. On the 6th of December, I was informed a shift was stolen, and on Crouch-end hill I caught hold of the prisoner, and asked where he was going, he said to Golden-lane; he had the shift tied round him like an apron, quite wet.

            . I am a carpenter
. I was doing a building in Fan's-alley


; the prisoner worked there as a bricklayer
. On the 19th of February, about seven in the morning, I was sent for; I found the prisoner in the custody of 
               
                  Sam.

            , a watchman, with a deal board which I had used in the building, and had seen it there two or three days before. There were but three of that kind.

            . I am a watchman. I met the prisoner between three and four o'clock that morning, in Pick-ax-street, with a new board on his shoulder. I suspected he had stole it from this new building in Fan's-alley. I went there to see, and found a breach made, and another board loose. I put out my candle, and watched to see if any body would come for that. The prisoner came back in order to take it, and I stopped him. I got him into an alehouse, under pretence to give him some purl, and sent for the prosecutor.
Prisoner's Defence.
The boards were my own I had a little jobb to do in the neighbourhood, and was carrying them in order to do it.

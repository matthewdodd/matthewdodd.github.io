WILLIAM HARVEY
 and 




MARY JAMES
 were indicted 

of stealing, on the 
27th of July, 2 shirts, value 3s.; the goods of 




Charles Digby: and 1 shirt, value 2s.; the goods of 



David Eady.







DAVID EADY
. I live at Hampton. I lost this property from Teddington—I am a labourer at Mr. Day's—I never saw either of the prisoners till the day I was at Brentford—Charles Digby is a carter—he is in the service of Mr. Webb—I had one shirt which I took there to be washed.





MARTHA EADY
. I am sister to David Eady. I wash for him and Digby—I had two shirts for Digby, and one for my brother—I washed them on the 27th of July, and hung them out on a hedge at three o'clock in the afterrnoon, not in the road—it was on Mr. Webb's farm—I missed them about four o'clock—these are them.





THOMAS CHESTERMAN
. I was present when the prisoner was taken by Stewart the patrol.





ROBERT STEWART
. I am a Bow-street patrol. On the 27th of July, Digby came to my house, and stated his washer-woman had lost three shirts—he told me which road to go—I went, and found the two prisoners at Hounslow, about six o'clock in the evening—I found two shirts on the man, and one on the woman—they had been at a public-house a few minutes before, but had just left it—they were going towards Teddington—Chesterman assisted me in taking them.





CHARLES DIGBY
. Two of these shirts are mine—I saw the two prisoners on the premises where they were drying, close by where these things were taken from, they hung on a hedge against the farm, not near the footpath—I am sure the two prisoners were there, and there was another man and woman—I have seen the prisoners before at Twickenham—I had known them five or six years.

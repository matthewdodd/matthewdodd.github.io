            . I am servant to John Williams, who is a linen-draper
, and lives in Bishopsgate-street


. On the 13th of September, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, the shawl hung on the rail by the side of the window; I saw the prisoner running with it in his hands - I secured him, and never lost sight of him. He threw the shawl away-it was picked up by Barrington.

            . I was passing by, and saw the prisoner with several others; the prisoner turned round to see if any person was looking, then darted in, took the shawl, and ran off - I collared him, and he threw it away.

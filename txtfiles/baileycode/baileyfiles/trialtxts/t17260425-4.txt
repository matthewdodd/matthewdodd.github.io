             thus depos'd. About 5 o'Clock in the Afternoon, I saw the Prisoner come out of the Prosecutor's House in St. Martin's-street, Leicester-fields


. I mistrusted that he had stoln something, and follow'd him, he perceiv'd it and run. I pursu'd him into Hedge-lane, and collar'd him, and within 2 or 3 Yards of him I saw the Tea-Kettle, he fell on his Knees, and beg'd of me to let him go, but I secur'd him. The Prosecutor swore to the Tea-Kettle, and the Jury found the Prisoner 


               Guilty to the Value of 10 d.

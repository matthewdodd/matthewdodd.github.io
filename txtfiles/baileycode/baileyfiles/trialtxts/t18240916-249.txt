            . I live in Parliament-street, and am night constable of Westminster-bridge. Last Sunday week, in the evening, as I was returning from a place ofworship with my mother, my handkerchief was in my right hand coat pocket, I felt the coat lifted up, and turned round and saw the prisoner with it in his hand - I stumbled in turning, and he gave it to another boy about ten yards from him, who immediately ran off with it. I searched for it, but have not seen it since. A man knocked the prisoner back into my arms, as he was running away - there was no other person that could have taken it.
Prisoner's Defence. I never had it in my hand - it was another boy took it and gave it to another boy - he was not dressed at all like me.

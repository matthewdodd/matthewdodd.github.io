            . I am in Mr. Tucker's service. I missed this sheet two or three minutes after the prisoner left the house, on the morning of the 15th of June; I went out and caught him in the street, and said, "If you please, come back - master wants to speak to you;" he said he would not till he had got his breakfast; I asked him to come now - he said he would not; master then came, and brought him back; he shook his jacket, and said he had nothing about him; I said, "Is it in his hat?" he took it off a little way, and said, "Here is nothing here;" master took his hat quite off, and it was there.(Property produced and sworn to.)

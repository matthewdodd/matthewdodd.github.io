I saw the prisoner take the mare out of Gadstone's field, and ride her away ; on the Monday after Whitsuntide, he was stoped at the Angel about two miles and a half from the place where he took the mare, I went to him, and told him he had taken away the mare, without Mr. Gadstone's leave, and said he ought to be carried back again, he seemed very willing to go back, but when we came within about a quarter of a mile of Colebrook he endeavoured to make his escape.
Q. Was he on horse-back, or a foot at that time?

JOHN TOWSER. I live in Drury-lane, and am a tinplate worker
. On the 11th of July, about a quarter-past eleven o'clock at night, the prisoner came up to me in Drury-lane


, and asked what o'clock it was - I would not tell her; she snatched at my watch, and took it from my fob; she ran off - two watchmen met her - she then turned back, and I caught her; she dropped the watch.

            . I am a watchman. I heard the alarm, and saw the prisoner running towards me; she turned back, I followed, and found Towser holding her; I took her in charge.

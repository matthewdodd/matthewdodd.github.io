Between seven and eight o'clock on the evening of the 18th of July, the prisoner came to my shop and purchased to the amount of 2s. 5 1/4 d.—after, she purchased these goods I saw her take up a small remnant of cotton and look at it and put it down—while the youth who served her went to get change—I saw her take it up and put it into her apron—he gave the change, and we suffered her to go out of the shop—I went after her and found this cotton on her, and the muslin dress in her apron, with ribbon and other things which do not belong to us.

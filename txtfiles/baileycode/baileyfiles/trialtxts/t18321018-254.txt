GEORGE FORD. I am in the employ of Mr Henry Bruce, a window-glass merchant. One of these coats belongs to my fellow-servant
, and the other to my master - they were in my master's gig, about a dozen yards from the door of the stable, in Savoy-street


 - I just turned round and the coats were gone in a minute; I saw the prisoner at a little distance, rolling them up before him - I ran after him, and told him he had got a couple of coats he had just taken off the chaise; he said he had found them down below - they were left in the gig; I gave an alarm, and he was taken.
Cross-examined by MR. DONNE. Q. Neither of them belong to you? A. No - the prisoner was walking up the street; he said he was going to take them to the station - he made some resistance when he was taken.

            . I was standing in my master's office, at the corner of Savoy-street; I saw the prisoner with the coats across his arm - Ford took them off his arm, and sent for an officer; the prisoner attempted to get off; I said he should not - he struck and kicked me very violently till the officer came up.(Property produced and sworn to).
Prisoner's Defence. I had occasion to go down the Dutch wharf - I saw the two coats lay, and took them up- I was going to the station, and the man came and said they were his master's; I gave them to him, without resistance.

             deposed, that he having Intelligence that the Prisoner carried a parcel of Goods to Mr. Rowland's, he went immediately and had Admittance and found the Prisoner a sleep on the Ground, with a Key in his Pocket which would open the Prosecutor's Door, and had the Goods produc'd before he waked him. Mr. Rowland confirm'd the same, and farther deposed, that the Prisoner brought them in and gave them to him to put to a Coat and Breeches he had brought in before. It did not appear to be a Burglary, so the Jury  acquitted him of that, and found him

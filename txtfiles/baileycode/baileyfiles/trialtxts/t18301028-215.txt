JOHN CLEMENTS. I am a broker
, and live in Little Pulteney-street


 - the prisoner was my errand-boy
. On the 6th of September, about eight o'clock in the morning, I came down with 3l. worth of silver in my hand - I put it into a small box in the parlour, which was not locked, and in the evening I missed 15s.: the prisoner should only have been in that room at his meals, but he could have access to it - I said nothing to him on that day, but on the Thursday I charged him with it; he said he had taken it, and spent it at the theatre, with some boys - I found an opera-glass on him, which he said he had bought with part of the money.

            . I took the prisoner - he told me he took 15s., to go to the theatre with another boy.
Prisoner's Defence. My friends are respectable, and my master will bear witness to my general good character - it is my first offence, and I beg for mercy.
MR. CLEMENTS. I believe his friends are respectable - for himself I can say nothing.

            . Aged 14. - 


               Transported for Fourteen Years

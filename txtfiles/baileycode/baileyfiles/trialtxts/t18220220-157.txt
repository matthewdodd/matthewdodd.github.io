            . I am a carpenter
. On the 15th of February, I was working at some houses at Clifton street, Finsbury


. I went to breakfast, at eight o'clock, after locking the door, and left my tools there. I returned in twenty minutes, found the back door broken open, and all my tools gone - it has almost ruined me - I have only found two planes.

            . I am a pawnbroker, and live in Golden-lane. On Saturday, the 16th of February, the prisoner came and offered a smoothing plane in pawn; I stopped him, and asked how he came by it; he said he bought it with some more, in Chick-lane, three months ago. He wished to be let go. I gave him in charge.

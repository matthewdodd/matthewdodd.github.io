JOHN SMITH
 were indicted for

stealing, on the 
9th of April, 1 handkerchief, value 1s., the goods of 



Thomas Harmston, from his person.






WILLIAM COLLIER
 (City police-constable No. 89.) On the afetrnoon of the 9th of April, I was in Upper Thames-street, about three o'clock, and saw the two prisoners—Taylor took hold of the prosecutor's coat, he had hit it first—he then took it up, and took the handkerchief out, and gave it to Smith—I took them both, and called the prosecutor—Smith dropped the handkerchief—this is it.





THOMAS HARMSTON
. I live in George-street, Portman-square. I was in Upper Thames-street, and lost this handkerchief—I know it to be mine; I had had it a great many years.

Taylor. If the officer had been near, as he lays, he might have taken us at the time; but we were taken into a warehouse and searched, and it was five minutes before the handkerchief was brought in by a gentleman.





WILLIAM COLLYER
. I pushed them over the way to be handcuffed—a little boy brought in the handkerchief in less than half a second.

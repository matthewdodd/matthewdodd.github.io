            . I am an apprentice to a coach spring maker
; the prisoner is a journeyman
; he lay in the same bed with me. I hung up my watch, on the 28th of August; the prisoner asked me what it was o'clock; the prisoner and the watch were gone when I awaked. I found it next day in the possession of Mr. Clay.
- Clay. The prisoner had talked to me about a fortnight before of a watch he had in pawn. I agreed to take it out of pawn; afterward the prisoner told me he had taken it out of pawn, and would sell it me; the prisoner came to me, on the 28th of August, about a quarter after eleven at night, and said he had got the watch. We walked down the Strand, he asked 40 s. for it; I said I had got but a guinea and a half; he agreed to take it, and I bought the watch. (The watch produced and deposed to by the prosecutor).
Prisoner's Defence.
The prosecutor lent me his watch, that I might know the time of night; I only gave the watch to Clay to carry home.

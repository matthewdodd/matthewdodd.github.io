JAMES FORD. I am a tin-plate worker
, I live at Battle-bridge


. I lost a cart on the 24th of January, it was taken from the side of my garden. The last prosecutor gave me information that he saw a cart in the prisoner's stable, Howland-mews; I went to the prisoner's stable. At first sight I did not know the cart. On looking over the stable, I found these four irons, and looking at the cart again, I knew the cart by the tail-board; the cart then was painted a lead colour; when I lost it it was a green. The cart had been altered so as to disguise it. I am perfectly satisfied it is my cart. I found this in the stable; this belongs to the cart to place the traces to; these two irons are fastened inside of the cart to screw two lamps into; these I found in the stable; I knew them to be my property before I knew the cart.

            . I went with the prosecutor and found the cart. I asked the prisoner how he came by the cart; at first, he said, he bought it in Smithfield; at the magistrate's, he said, he bought it of Parry; Parry said, no, you bought it in Smithfield.
Prisoner's Defence. Parry had half of my stable; he brought this cart, and left the iron in my stable.

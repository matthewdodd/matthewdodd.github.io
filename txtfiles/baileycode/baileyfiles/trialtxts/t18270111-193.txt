            . I live in Tibberton-street, Newington-causeway, and am a paper-stainer
. On the 23d of December, about three o'clock in the afternoon, Limbrick came to my house, and put me in possession of Mr. Buckley's house, next door to me - I continued there till the 29th, at half-past eleven o'clock, when I left; every thing was then perfectly safe: I then double-locked the door and went home, and next morning, about nine o'clock, I found the house had been forced open; the lock was taken off, and the door bolted inside - I looked through the keyhole, and saw that a large dining-table and the carpet were gone - I found the back door open - I went to Limbrick, and then to the landlord - when I returned, the officer had been, and Edwards also - I then went into the house, and found it nearly stripped; Hammond lived opposite to me, and keeps a go-cart at the Elephant and Castle.
Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Were you responsible for the property? A. I consider so - I had the key.


                  JOHN

            . I am a constable. On the 23d of December, I put Merritt in possession of this property - he came to me on the 30th; I sent some officers there.
Cross-examined. Q. What house was this? was it used for coining? A. There was no coin there - Buckley, the proprietor, was in custody; it was I who put Merritt there. Mrs. Buckley was present when I gave him charge- I asked if she was willing for him to take charge of her house; she said she had no objection.


                  MARY

             - it was left in Merritt's charge.

            . I am an officer. On Saturday morning, the 30th of December, I went with Vann and Brown to No. 214, Whitecross-street, which is kept by the prisoner Benjamin; it is a clothes-shop, and he deals in goods as well - the shop was shut, as it was his sabbath: I saw a go-cart thirty or forty yards from the house - it was afterwards claimed by Hammond in my presence; I went with Van up a passage into the back room, placing Brown at the door to prevent an escape - we found the prisoners all nearly together; I said to Benjamin, "Where is the property just brought in?" he pointed to three large parcels on the floor; two of them were beds and bedding, and the other contained a variety of articles; three chair-cushions and a tea-caddy were on the floor - all this property was there, except two tea-trays, which were afterwards produced from the parlour. We asked Benjamin who brought it there; he said, "These two men," pointing to Taylor and Hammond; Taylor denied it - we then questioned Hammond, who admitted bringing it there in company with Taylor, who still denied it, and said to Benjamin,"You are a pretty fellow, to say I brought it; you will say any thing, if you say that." Benjamin and his sister, who were present, both persisted that they had brought it there - Van then asked Hammond where he brought the property from; he said that Taylor and another man engaged him near the Elephant and Castle, and that his name was on his go-cart; which we found to be so - Taylor refused to tell his name - we asked Benjamin what they were to have for the property - he said they asked 10l., but they did not want such things. We took them all three into custody, and in three days after we compared these three cushions with three others found in the house.
Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Hammond was the driver of that go-cart? A. Yes, I found he was so.

            . I am the wife of William Merritt - I went with the officers, and found the lock off the door.

            . I am an officer. I went to the house on the 30th of December, found it open, and the property gone.

            . I went to the house, and found it open.

            . I am a grocer, and live with my father, in Tibberton-street. On the 30th of December, I saw Hammond in his cart, about eight o'clock in the morning; I think another person was driving; he often had another person to drive - he was in the cart, and the other driving.
Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. It was not unusual for him to have another person to drive? A. No - he generally went out about that time; I live six doors from the house.

                  SMITH
               



            . I am the last witness's father. Between twelve and one o'clock in the morning, I was disturbed by some persons about to break into my own premises - I heard my dog bark, and looked out of my window; I heard some persons in the street, three or four doors off, but could not see them, it was so dark - I heard them whispering together; I saw no cart - Hammond's cart usually stood in a recess in the road, about where the persons stood.

            . I am a pawnbroker, and live in Whitecross-street. On the 30th of December, I saw a cart come to Benjamin's premises, about five minutes to nine o'clock- Hammond drove it up to the passage leading to the back door; he and Taylor got out the goods; Taylor came down the passage - this was ten minutes or a quarter of an hour before the officers came.
Cross-examined. Q. What was done after they were unloaded? A. Hammond drove the cart to the Cherry-tree public-house, and then returned to Benjamin's house.
HAMMOND's Defence. I was hired by two men to take the goods to Benjamin's house.
TAYLOR'S Defence. I did not hire him.

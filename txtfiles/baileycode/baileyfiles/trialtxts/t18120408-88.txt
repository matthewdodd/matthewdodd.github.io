            . My husband's name is James Green.
Q. When did you lose these gowns, shawl, and breakfast cloth - A. I cannot say exactly; I employed the prisoner to work for me a fortnight before; I was ordered by the surgeon to go into the country; she absconded for four months; I had a cancer in my eye; the surgeon that took my eye out ordered me to go in the country; I found my things at the pawnbroker's.
MR. KINGTON. I am a pawnbroker. I produce two gowns, a shawl, and a breakfast cloth; I took them in pawn of the prisoner.
Prosecutrix. They are mine.
Prisoner's Defence. The prosecutrix gave me the things to pawn for her.
Prosecutrix. That is not true, I never gave her any thing to pawn in my life.

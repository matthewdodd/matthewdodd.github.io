HENRY JAMES
 and 



MARGARET BARRY
 were indicted for

26th of February, 1 coat, value 15s., the goods of 



George Walmsley and others.






THOMAS ODELL THOMPKINS
. I am in the service of Mr. George Walmsley and others—they are pawnbrokers, and live in Drury Jane. On the 26th of February, between five and six o'clock in the evening, I missed a coat, which had been hanging just inside the door, as I was taking the goods in—I had seen it safe half an hour before—this is the coat—(looking at it)—it is my employers'—I do not know the prisoner.





GEORGE TREW
 (police-constable H 125.) On the 'evening of the 26th of February I was on duty in plain clothes at Drury-lane theatre—I saw the prisoner James come running down with this coat, and doubling it up, and putting it in a handkerchief—I suspected him, and followed him round the yard, and saw him put the coat into the female prisoner's apron—I went and asked her what she had got—she would not tell me—she was not in Drury-lane.





JOHN EATON
 (police-constable S 193.) I was on duty in plain clothes—I saw James come running down Vinegar-yard with the coat—he could not get through, and he turned back, and put the coat into Barry's apron—my brother officer took her, and I took James—I asked him where he got the coat—he said he knew nothing of the coat, nor the woman either.

James' Defence. The coat was given me to pawn—I met this young woman, and asked her to pawn it—she chucked it on the ground, and the officer came and took us.

JAMES*—

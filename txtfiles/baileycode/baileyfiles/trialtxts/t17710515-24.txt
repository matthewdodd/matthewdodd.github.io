            . I let a lodging to the prisoners. I found her with a key in my room, which made me suspect her: I took her up before the justice; she said she had carried the sheets I lett them, and pawn'd them.
Patry Thompson's Defence.
I apprehended that while I continued to pay my rent I might pawn them. I intended to take them out again.

            . I was going to the Royal Exchange


 on Easter Monday, but as the Bluecoat boys were coming to Cornhill there was such a mob that I could not get through. I stopt, and felt my pocket pulled back; I put my hand in, and felt my handkerchief was gone. Mr. Wood came up, and asked me if I had lost my handkerchief; I felt, and said I had. He said he saw that man take it, pointing to the prisoner; we secured him, and my handkerchief was found upon him.

            . I was at the Royal Exchange between eleven and twelve o'clock that day. I saw the prisoner put his hand to the prosecutor's left hand pocket. I said to the young man, Have you lost your handkerchief? he said he had; and that it was a blue and white one, marked with the letter M upon the corner. We laid hold of the prisoner, and took the handkerchief out of his pocket. (Produced and deposed to.) When we got him into the Compter, we found another upon him.
Prisoner's Defence.
I picked up the handkerchief from the ground. I sell oranges and lemons.

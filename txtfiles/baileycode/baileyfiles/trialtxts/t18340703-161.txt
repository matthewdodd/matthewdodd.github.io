            . I am servant to Mr.
 Isaac Myers, who lives in Chiswell-street


. I missed a pair of trowsers from inside his door, on the 5th of June - I ran up and down several courts, and saw the prisoner at the corner of a court in Chapel-street - I watched him - he went into Fore-street - I then gave him into custody - I opened his shirt, and took these trowsers from between his shirt and his skin - this was about twenty minutes after I missed them - I had seen him lurking about our door for an hour and a half.
Prisoner. He used me very indifferently indeed. Witness. I did nothing but give him into custody.

             (City police-constable, No.49). I assisted the prosecutor in taking the trowsers from the prisoner - I asked him three or four times why he took them - he gave me no answer.
Prisoner's Defence. I was coming along, and a young man ran by and threw them down.

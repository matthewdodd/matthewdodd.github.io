            . I was a sailor
. I lost my watch on the 18th of May, between eight and nine o'clock at night. I fell in with the prisoner at the Crown and Thistle, by Tower-hill


; we had four or five pots of ale to drink. I was not half drunk; I was a little drunkish. I told him, I wanted a ship; he told me he could get me one, and asked me to take a walk to see the mate. The watch was safe in my pocket then; and we went out, and I felt him draw the watch out, and he ran off as quick as he could, and I ran after him; but he turned out of my sight, and I lost him. I am sure he is the man, I can swear positively.

MART MITCHELL
. I am servant to John-Bryan Courthope, at Black-heath. On the 11th of September this property was in the parlour-about one o'clock in the day the prisoner came to the kitchen-window, and asked if we wanted any fruit—I said, "No"—she immediately went round to the front of the house, and looked up to mistress's bed-room—I thought she was speaking to mistress at the window—she went away-about a quarter of an hour afterwards she came, again, and rang the bell at the front gate—I told her again we did not want any fruit—she had come to the gate the first time—the street-door was open the first time she came, and she could have got into the parlour—she had been to the house several times with fruit-mistress missed her bag some time after she was gone-(looking at it)—this is my mistress's reticule, and her handkerchief—I do not know what money was in it.





BENJAMIN LOVELL
. I am a policeman. I had information of the robbery, and went and found the prisoner in Greenwich-park, in company with another one—I asked her if she had been to Mr. Courthope's house with pears that day—she said she had not—it was then about a quarter to three o'clock—I took her to the house, and she denied having been there then, until the lady and servant identified her—I found 16s. 6d. on her—the lady begged hard for her to be let go. I said, "I must take her;" and said, "You know you took it"—she said, "I did"—I asked her where the bag was—she took me out, and raked in a drain, and there was the reticule—she said she must have dropped the purse—the handkerchief was in the reticule.

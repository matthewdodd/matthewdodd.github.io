Thomas Grant. I had just received 3 Shirts, 4 Stocks, and two Night-caps, ty'd up in a Linnen Handkerchief, as this Man came begging to the Door. They lay at a little Distance from the Door on the Counter; I was engaged in Business with my Back to the Linnen, and the Man was advanced almost within the Door: I was busy, and not very watchful. I told the Prisoner there was nothing for him, but I was mistaken as it happen'd. He went away; about 4 or 5 Minutes afterwards, I mist it, but thought the Servants might have taken it away. Upon enquiry, I found it was gone, and imagined that this Man must take it. On the Monday following he came again, and I seized him with one of the Shirts on his Back, which he resign'd, and then asked me to forgive him.
The Prisoner own'd his taking the Goods, and said by way of Excuse, that he wanted a Shirt, therefore he took them: That he was in Liquor and had forgot the Door, else he would not have came there again, and that he gave this Shirt back to the Prosecutor with a very good Will, and in a very good natur'd Manner.

            . On the 12th of March I slept at the Harp, public-house, Russell-street, Covent-garden


. My pocket-book was in my coat pocket, which I left on the drawers in my bed-room when I went to bed, and in the morning they were gone. I found the coat and hat on the prisoner's back at the office - he was a stranger.

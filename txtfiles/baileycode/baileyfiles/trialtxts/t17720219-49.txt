            . I was going along Cheapside


 on the 20th of January between six and seven o'clock. I felt something at my pocket; I felt and missed my handkerchief; Mr. Clark told me the prisoner had taken it.

            . I saw the prisoner put his hand between Mr. Floyd and another gentleman that was walking with him, and draw out a handkerchief from between them, which he dropt behind him; I picked it up, and gave it to Mr. Floyd. (The handkerchief produced, and deposed to by the prosecutor.)
Prisoner's Defence.
I saw the handkerchief lying upon the ground between the two gentlemen, and I picked it up.
Q. to Clark. Did the prisoner stoop as if he picked any thing up?
Clark. No; he did not stoop.
The prisoner called a witness, who said he was a hair dresser, and might get a good maintenance at his business.

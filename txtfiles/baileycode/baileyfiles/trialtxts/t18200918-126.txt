            . I am a back-maker
, and live in Compton-street, Clerkenwell. On the 2d of September, about three o'clock in the afternoon, I was told the Queen was passing, and went to the end of the street into Goswell-street


. A number of people were collected, and as I got to the end of the street, the prisoner struck me in the lower part of my belly, and pulled my watch out in an instant as he struck me. I saw him hand it over to his companions, and secured him immediately. I am sure he is the man. I have not recovered it.

(The case was stated by Mr. Knapp.)
Mrs. CONYERS sworn. - Q. You are the wife of the prosecutor? - A. Yes; my husband is an ironmonger and dealer in rags
; we live in Shoreditch, No. 229


.
Q. Where are his rags kept? - A. In the back premises, adjoining the house.
Q. How are these back premises situated; do they form a part of the house? - A. Yes; there is a little passage to it; it is all under the same roof.
Q. Do you know the prisoners at the bar? - A. They are servants

 of my husband; Oren was employed in the rag business, and Grigs in the ironmongery.
Q. Were you passing through Finsbury-square on the 24th of January in the evening; - A. Yes; I saw Grigs there; I met him at half-past eight in the evening; I called to him three times; he would not stop.
Q. Did you observe whether he had any thing with him before you called to him? - A. I observed him to have a bag of rags; there was a hole in the bag, and through that I saw the rags; he stopped at last; I asked him where he was going; he said to Aldersgate-street to sell these rags; I asked him whose they were; he said his landlady's, but he could not tell me the quantity, nor the price of them; I begged him then to return home to Mr. Conyers; he wished me to go to his landlady, but I thought I was right, that he should return home with me to my house; he did; after that he went and fetched his landlady; the rags were left in our shop; the landlady came, but he did not come with her; the landlady made a claim of these rags, and then denied it; then Mr. Conyers sent for an officer to take Grigs; I went with the officer; we took him close by his lodgings; when he was brought home to our house, he was shewn the rags and the bag; he said that he took them from the back premises.
Q. Had you threatened him, or promised any favour? - A. No; I asked him whether he had taken any before; he said he had once; we did not take Oren, the other prisoner, till the next day; I was present when he was taken; he came to work, and enquired after the other prisoner, Griggs; he asked where he was, and why he did not come; I did not give him any answer; then the officer came and took him.
Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Have you not a warehouse that is out from the house? - A. That is not where the goods were stolen from.
Q. Do not you keep old rags in other warehouses? - A. Yes, but none of this sort; these are a superior sort.
Court. Q. How much was that bag of rags worth that he had in Finsbury-square? - A. About 30 s.

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am an officer: I apprehended Grigs on the 24th of January in the evening; when I took him I met him in the street; Mrs. Conyers and his landlady were with me; the landlady said to him, you have got me in a great deal of trouble by going to claim these rags; I asked the prisoner whose rags they were that he had when his mistress stopped him; he said they were his master's, that they were delivered to him at the warehouse, and that he had put them under some dung in the yard, till he had an opportunity of taking them away; I then took him up to his master's house, with Mrs. Conyers; I told him to look round and shew me the bag of rags his mistress had stopped him with; he then went and put his hand on the bag of rags I have got here; he said, this is the bag of rags my mistress stopped me with; Mr. Conyers then charged him with a felony; I then took him to the watch-house; I went and apprehended Oren in the morning; I took them both together into the parlour at the public-house, at the side of the office; I then asked Grigs where he got the bag of rags that his mistress stopped him with; I had them from you, he said to Oren; they were both close, face to face; Oren said nothing at all; you gave them to me for the purpose of selling them, and you told me to take them into Aldersgate-street, where you told me to take the others, where you went and shewed me; and he then said to Oren, I was to return you half the money; Grigs was agitated a great deal, and Oren very much so too: Grigs said you know it is true; Oren made no reply; after that, Grigs said, there is now a parcel of rags taken from the stack, and buried under some woollen rags.
Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. I suppose you told this man that you would get him to be King's evidence? - A. No.

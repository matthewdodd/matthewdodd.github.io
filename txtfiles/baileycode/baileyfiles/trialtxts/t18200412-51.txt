            . I am coachman to His Royal Highness the Duke of York. On Saturday evening, the 4th of March, I drove the carriage to Covent Garden Theatre, every thing was safe when I set out - I missed the check braces about ten o'clock, but did not know whether I lost them in going or returning. I drove through Long-acre


 both times.

            . I am a constable of St. Pancras. On Saturday evening, the 4th of March, I was in Long-acre, and saw the prisoner at the top of James-street; I saw His Royal Highness's carriage turn up James-street; the footman was on the coach-box. The prisoner got up behind the carriage, and leaned over till he got to Little Newport-street, and in turning the corner of Leicester-square I saw his hand up, as if he was undoing the braces; he got off the carriage in Chandler-street, St. James's, with the braces in his hand. I took him into custody under the piazzas of the Opera House with the braces. I had been watching him three nights.

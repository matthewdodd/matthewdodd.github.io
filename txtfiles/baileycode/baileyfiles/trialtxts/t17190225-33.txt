             deposed that she observing Williams lurk about her Window, ask'd what he did there, who reply'd what was that to her ; and a little while after she heard the Glass break, and the Handkerchief which hung in the Window was gone; that the Prisoners being pursued were taken, Williams at a Corner of a street, and Woodward in an Ale-house with his Hand bloody, being cut by the Glass he broke to come at the Handkerchief. The Prisoners denyed the Fact, or that they knew one another; but were both mark'd alike in the Arm with a Jerusalem Mark, which one of them said was his Business to make; and produced his Mark with which he did it. The Jury upon the whole matter found them 

               guilty
             of Felony.

            . I am wife to the prosecutor; I took the prisoner in out of charity, she being in distress; I lost the things mentioned in the indictment (mentioning them) about the 10th of June, she absented herself; she was seen at Chelsea, where we went and took her; she had my bonnet and cloak on at the time; I found my things pawned in West-street, to Mr. Humphreys; the prisoner acknowledged them to be my property.

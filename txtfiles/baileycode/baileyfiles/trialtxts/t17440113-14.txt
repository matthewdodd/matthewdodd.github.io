            . The Prisoner was my servant
, the goods mentioned in the indictment were missed the 11th of December, and were found at Mr. Brooks's, a pawnbroker.
Mrs. Corbet. My gowns were locked up in my drawers, and the children's clothes lay in a closet in the room where the Prisoner lay I missed them on Sunday the 11th of Dec. I went up for something for Mr. Corbet, and found that all these things were gone - I cannot say when I saw the gowns last, for I do not dress myself much in winter time. - I saw one of them about three weeks before.
Q. What did she say when the robbery was found out?
Corbet. She did not say any thing till I went to her when she was in custody to ask her where the things were, and then she told me they were all at Mr. Brooks's , the pawnbroker's.
Q. What did the Prisoner say to you about these things, have you had any conversation with her about them?


                  Charles 
                  Corbet 
               



             . I have had talk with her about them more than once, and she confessed that she had taken all these things herself, and pawned them from time to time at Mr. Brooks's; she said she took the child's things out of the closet above stairs - she said she took the other things out of the house.
Q How came you to find out that the things were at Mr. Brooks's ?


                  Charles 
                  Corbet 
               



            . I found it out by my advertisement , for I offered five guineas reward for them. 


               Guilty, 39 s.
            

Mr. Brooks. The things were pledged to me in the name of 
               
                  Mary 
                  Lee 
               



            ; Mr. Corbet had given out advertisements by a porter, and I stopped the Prisoner; the gowns lay upon the counter six hours before I lent any money upon them; I have suffered very severely, I lent 3 l. 11 s. 5 d. upon them, it is very hard to lose that; Mr. Corbet offered a reward of five guineas, and he has not paid that.
Corbet. I am ready to pay it now.
Mr. Corbet very readily paid the five guineas to Mr. Brooks in court.

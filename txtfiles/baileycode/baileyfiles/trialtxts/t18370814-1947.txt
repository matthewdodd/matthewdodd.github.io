RICHARD WILLIAM MUSGROVE
. I am in the service of William James Stevenson, a hosier and linen-draper in Ratcliff Highway. On the 14th of August I missed some stockings—I then watched, and saw the two prisoners come and cut five pairs down—they were joined by four bakers, and walked towards the Crooked billett—they then returned, after parting with the bakers, and took three of the five which they had cut before—I had lost four pairs before, that day—a young man ran out and brought the prisoners into the shop—I ran out, and took up the stockings which I saw drop from them—these are the stockings.





WILLIAM BROOK
 (police-constable H 99.) I took the prisoners.

Brickell's Defence. Having no work, I went to take a walk, and met Green—we saw two young men who asked us to have some ale, which we did, and when we left them, we passed the prosecutor's shop, when two or three young men came out, and accused us of cutting some stockings from the door, just before we went to drink with the young men—they took us to the station-house, and found nothing on us—next morning they produced a pair of stockings, which they said we had cut, but we had no scissors about us—I stopped to look at some carpetting in the prosecutor's window, but did not see any stockings.

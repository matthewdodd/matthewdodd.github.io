PATRICK CROW. I live at Camden-town. On the 9th of March, about half-past twelve o'clock, I was in Cheapside


, nearly opposite to Bread-street, and felt a jerk at my coat - I turned round, and saw the prisoner close behind me, with my handkerchief in his hand - it was safe five minutes before - he turned round immediately, crossed over Cheapside, and ran down Bread-street, concealing it in his trousers; I ran after him - he saw me pursuing, and ran faster. I called out Stop thief! he was stopped before I lost sight of him: he immediately pulled out thehandkerchief, and threw it behind him - I picked it up. - He knelt down, and begged me not to prosecute him.

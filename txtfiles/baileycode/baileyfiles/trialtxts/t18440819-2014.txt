2014. 




GEORGE GOULDING
 was indicted

 for stealing 1 jacket, value 12s., the goods of 



Joseph Horton; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






JOSEPH HORTON
. I am a labourer. On the 22nd of July I had a jacket safe in a yard at Lower Clapton—I was at work at a quarter to twelve o'clock—I heard the gate-bell, and saw the prisoner running a distance off, with my jacket under his arm—I pursued him a long distance, and took him, but he had thrown my jacket away—he said he did not take it, and bit my hand to get away—this is my jacket.

Prisoner. I beg to express my sincere contrition for the offence.





WILLIAM HOLLAND
 (police-constable N 146.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 26.—


Transported for Seven Years.

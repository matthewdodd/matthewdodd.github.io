JOHN SAWGOOD. The prisoner is my son. I live at Union-place, Land of Promise, Hoxton Old-town


. On the 20th of December, about half-past five o'clock, I went down to the wash-house, and missed a stove - I had seen it safe on the Sunday - I went out, and found it at a locksmith's, at the corner of Ivy-lane, Hoxton - I saw my son afterwards, and told him what he had done; he said I should have it in a few days, but next morning I went to Worship-street; my son has lived away from me for three months. I never gave him leave to sell or pawn my things.

Prisoner's Defence. I had no work to do. I asked my father to give me 1s.; he told me to go thieving for it; he would not give me a bit of victuals.

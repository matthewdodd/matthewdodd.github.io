 for stealing, on the

THOMAS SHEPCOTT
. I am son of Alexander Shepcott, of Oxford-street. These are a pair of my father's boots—(looking at them)—they

were exposed for sale at the side of the shop-door, on the 13th of December, and we lost them.





GEORGE HOBBS
 (police-constable E 67.) At a quarter before five o'clock, in the afternoon of the 13th of December, I was on duty in Oxford-street, and saw the prisoner, with another lad, two doors from the prosecutor's—the other went opposite the shop, and then returned to the prisoner—they then both went to the shop—the prisoner was in the act of eating a bit of bread, opposite the window, while the other took the boots from the door, and handed them to him—I crossed, and took the prisoner with them.

Prisoner's Defence. I had been to the servants' office for a place—I was coming along, and met this boy, and was going with him—he took the boots and put them into my lap, and I let them fall directly.




GUILTY
.* Aged 17.—


Transported for Seven Years.

EPHRAIM GOATLY
. I am a boot and shoe-maker. The prisoner was in my employ—he came on the 9th of March, and left on the 21st of April, without notice—on his leaving, I missed eight or ten pairs of shoes, and a pair of boots—we went to his lodgings, and found he had absented himself from there—he was apprehended last week, having returned to his lodging.





HENRY PECK
. I am foreman to Mr. Goatly. I was present at the prisoner's apprehension—he said he bad pawned a pair of boots in Jermyn-street, and a pair of shoes in St. Martin's-lane.





WILLIAM WILLIAMS
. I am a pawnbroker, and live in St. Martin's-lane. On the 7th of April I received a pair of new shoes in pawn for 2s. 6d.—I cannot identify the prisoner—it was a boy.





WILLIAM HENRY MEAGLE
. I am a shopman to Mr. Masters, in Jermyn-street. On the 21st of April I received a pair of boots in pawn from the prisoner for 12s.

Property produced and sworn to.

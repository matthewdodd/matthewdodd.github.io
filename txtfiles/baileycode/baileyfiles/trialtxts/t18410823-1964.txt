JAMES STOCKFORD
 (City police-constable, No. 442.) At half-past ten o'clock on the 7th of August, I went into a coffee-shop in Great Distaff-lane—the prisoner was detained there on suspicion of having stolen this loaf of sugar—the prisoner said two gentlemen gave him 1s., to carryy it to a cab in Cheapside—I was not satisfied—I took the prisoner, and found the owner in the afternoon.





MARTHA CHOWN
. I am the wife of Thomas Chown, a ships' carpenter, now at Jamaica. I am book-keeper at the New Inn, Old-change. There were ten loaves of sugar their from Mr. Dickson—they were to go to Dorking—they came at nine o'clock in the morning—we missed one of them at ten, when the carrier came to load them—I should have had to pay for it if it had not been found—I know it by the mark on it, "C. C. D," and it answers to the weight and mark of the one missing.

Prisoner's Defence. On Saturday I was in Fresh Wharf—two gentlemen asked me to take it to the coach-stand in Cheapside, and they would give me 1s.—I took it, and they went off—I do not know who they were, but I have since heard they were regular cart robbers.




GUILTY
.* Aged 21.—


Transported for Seven Years.

            , the youger. I was coming home about six in the morning, I saw the prisoner shutting the door; I called out and asked her who she wanted, she made no answer but went away; I went in doors and asked my sister if she heard any body in the house, she said she heard somebody making a rattling and thought it had been my father; I ran after the prisoner, I called out to her and asked her who she wanted in the house; she made no answer, I ran after her into Burr-street; I called out to her, she would not stop; I came up to her and asked what she had got in her apron; she said nothing but some things to iron, and gave me the iron into my hand, and said, If I stopt her, she would send for her husband; as soon as I saw the punch bowl in her apron, I knew it; I desired her to come back along with me; she came back very quietly and put the things down in the house; these are the things I found upon her; (producing them.)
Prosecutor. They are my property; these things were in the house when I went out in the morning.

I was going out one morning, young Pond wanted to use me ill; he used me very impudently because he could not get his will of me; he charged me with this, it is all nothing but spite.

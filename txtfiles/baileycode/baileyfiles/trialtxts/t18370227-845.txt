for a misdemeanor.






THOMAS NIXEY
. I live in St. John-street. On the 2nd of February the prisoner came to me—he put his hands on a piece of flannel, and said, "I want four yards and a half of this flannel"—I said, "Very well"—I having been out before, supposed he had seen it—I cut it off, and he said he wanted it for Mr. Wheeler—I hesitated, and said, "Who is Mr. Wheeler? I do not recollect him"—he said, "Not recollect him?—he lives a few doors off, at the timber yard"—in consequence of that representation, I trusted him with the flannel, and he went away with it—about twenty minutes after nine o'clock in the evening he came again, and said he wanted ten yards more, and that Mr. Wheeler would be such a customer as I had not tad for some time; that he usually bought flannel for Mr. Wheeler at a house in King-street, and the last quantity was seventy yards; and he said to me, "You did not follow me"—I said, "No; if I suspected you, should have let you known"—he talked so much about Mr. Wheeler, and saying he was a relation, that I let him have ten yards, but I suspected it was not right—I asked him when I was to have the money; whether I was to fetch it—he said I could do as I liked; I could make oat the bill—I intended to go with him—he said Mr. Wheeler would not he at home till to-morrow morning—I put the flannel up, and let him go with it—I followed him, and finding he went by Mr. Wheeler's premises, I gave him in charge.

JAMES WILSON
. I live in St. John-street. On the 2nd of February the prisoner pawned this four yards and a half of flannel with me.

MARY BARNETT

SARAH WENHAM
. I live in Lower Chapman-street, and I am single; I have known the prisoner many years. On the 18th of May, she came and asked for a night's lodging, and she slept up stairs on the floor—I got up at seven o'clock, and told her to come to my bed—I went out, and returned It eleven or twelve o'clock—she was then gone, and I missed the gown.





JAMES RICHMAN FOLKARD
. I am a pawnbroker, and live in the Commercial-road—I have a gown, which was pledged by the prisoner, to the best of my belief.





CHARLOTTE RAYMENT
. The prisoner was brought to the station-house by White—I searched her, and saw the duplicate drop from her on the floor—I gave it to the officer.





JAMES WHITE
 (police Constable K 285.) I took the prisoner, and Went to the pawnbroker's.





JAMES HENRY ANDREWS
 (police-constable K 104.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got at Mr. Clark's office—I was a witness—I know she is the person who was tried (read,):

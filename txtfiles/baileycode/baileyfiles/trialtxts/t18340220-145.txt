 - I am the wife of James Pike, but he has not lived with me for eight years - the prisoner is my daughter, but was not living with me - she had no authority to pawn anything of mine - on the 10th of February I was out at work till twelve o'clock - I have since seen the sheet, which I had lost - it was pawned - the prisoner had been in the street with some abandoned characters - she had left her place and parted with all her new things.

MRS. PIKE. This is my sheet - it has my mark, and I hemmed it at the sides - the prisoner had left me on the Wednesday before to go to a situation - I fetched her out of the Compter, where she had been for an assault, and she went to Mr. Marchant's, an officer, as she had no character - they came to me on the Saturday night afterwards, and said she had left - I found her at the corner of Castle-street, Holborn, on the Monday night, with a girl of the town.

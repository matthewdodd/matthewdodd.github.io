1927. 




SAMUEL MAGINN
 was again indicted with 




WILLIAM PETTITT



 for stealing 1 fire lump, value 2s. 3d.; and 1 brick, 2s. 3d.; the goods of 



John Cherry, the master of Pettitt.






JAMES LARGE.
 At a quarter past two o'clock, in the afternoon, on the 2nd of Aug., I saw Maginn take a lump out of the tail of the cart, into his own house—Pettit was the carman—he turned his back towards the cart while Maginn took it out—I followed the cart to Mr. Moreland's house—I gave information, and had the prisoner taken—I went with the officer to Maginn's house, and found six lumps there—he took the lump at the corner of Wenlock-street, about forty yards from his house.





JOHN CHERRY.
 I employed Pettit to drive a cart on the 2nd of Aug.





JOSEPH MORELAND.
 I have examined these lumps—I am positive they are mine—the prisoners had to carry a great quantity of them for me.


Maginn. I was asked by Mrs. Johnson to carry them out of the yard.





ANN JOHNSON.
 They were put into my yard—I had to clean the yard, and I said, "Move them down in the kitchen"—they were not brought in for me.

Pettitt's Defence. Maginn said a man wished to look at this lump, and if it did not suit, I was to have it when I came back; I let him have it.

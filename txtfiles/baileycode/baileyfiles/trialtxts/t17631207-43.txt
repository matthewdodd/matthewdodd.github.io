            . I am servant to Mr.

            , cheesemonger
, in Whitechapel; on the 3d of this instant, I was driving a cart from Dice-key


, with some cheeses in it, I saw the prisoner taking a cheese out of the cart; I went and took him by the arm, and said, what did you rob my cart for? he said, he did not: I saw him deliver a cheese to another man, before I took hold of him; he got from me, I pursued, calling, stop thief, the people on the Key stopped him; I got a constable, and, carrying him to the Counter, he said, if we would go along with him, we should have the cheese again, we went with him to a Jew's house in Northumberland Alley; when we went in, he asked for the cheese, the woman said there was none; then he said, he wanted the cheese that the old man brought in. When she saw the constable, she said there were some cheeses brought in, and put on the stairs, there we found it standing between two other cheeses; (the cheese produced, and deposed to, marked J. F.)

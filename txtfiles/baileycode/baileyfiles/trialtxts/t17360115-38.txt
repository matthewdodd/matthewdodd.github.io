            . The 8th of January, the Prisoner brought these Cloaths to my Master (a Pawn-broker) and had half a Guinea upon them, and half a Guinea more, a Day or two afterward. Towle made enquiry after them, but I then did not remember them. But on Tuesday last the Prisoner came for half a Crown more, and having examined the Cloaths, I secured her, and sent for Towle: She said Mrs. Philips gave her them to pawn, but could not produce this Philips: She was asked where she was to carry the Money she had on the Cloaths; and she told us she came on her own Account. 


               Guilty to the value of 10d
            .

WILLIAM STONE
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
29th of February, 1 hat, value 2s. 6d., the goods of 



Robert Brodis; and 1 coat, value 12s., the goods of 



Edwin Lock.






ROBERT BRODIS
. I am a recruit, belonging to the 24th Regiment. I was staying at the William the Fourth beer-shop in Gardener's-lane, West-minster, for about a fortnight—I was there on the 29th of February—Edwin Lock and the prisoner were there—they were in one bed—I had this hat there, and Lock's coat was there safe on the Friday night, the 28th of February—next morning I awoke about a quarter-past seven o'clock—my hat and Lock's coat were missing, and the prisoner was gone—Lock and I got up, we ran down and found the prisoner with the hat and coat on him—we asked him what he did with the coat—he said merely to keep himself warm—we asked what he did with the hat—he made no answer.





EDWIN LOCK
. I slept in this room—I had this coat there, and missed it—I found the prisoner on the lower flight of stairs with the coat on—I

asked what he did with it—he said, merely to keep himself warm—this hat was on his head, his own hat was up-stairs, and it was worse than this.

            . On the 4th of August, between 12 and 1 in the night, Mr. Short, Mr. Shipman, and I, were coming up Lombard-street



: I stop'd in George Yard to make water; three men came up to Mr. Shipman, and insulted him: 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Beadle 
               



             the evidence was one of them, and Cook and Miller the other two. I went up to see what was the matter; Beadle struck me in the face: I struck him again, and he fell; my hat was knocked off in the Scuffle; we took Beadle, and Cook and the other got off: the next day, before my Lord Mayor, my hat was produced.


                  Hugh 
                  Short 
               



            . As I was coming along with Mr. Wood and Mr. Shipman, 
               
                  Edward 
                  Cook 
               



             insulted me, and knocked me down without speaking a word, and then swore he would have my hat: 
               
                  William 
                  Miller 
               



             and 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Beadle 
               



             were with him; he took my hat from my head, and ran away with it. I ran after him, and cry'd, Stop thief; and one of the watchmen took him, and brought him to the same place where Mr. Wood and Mr. Shipman were; they had Beadle then in custody.
Q. Were they drunk or sober?
Short. There was no appearance of their being drunk.
Q. Did they ask for any money?
Short. No, they did not; Beadle said afterwards, their intentions were to rob some body that night; I being knock'd down, know nothing that was done to Mr. Wood. The first thing was, the prisoners came up and insulted us, and bid us stand out of the path; then Cook knocked me down.


                  Charles

                  Thomas 
                  Beadle 
               



             first came up to me, at the beginning of this, and shov'd against me, to shove me against the wall; I asked him what he meant by that? he began damning me, and shoving me again; Mr. Wood came up; Beadle quitted me, and struck Mr. Wood on the Face; then a scuffle began, and continued till the constable and watch came up, and he was secured. They lost both their hats; I lost nothing.


                  Mary 
                  Spencer 
               



            . I went to lie at 
               
                  Elizabeth 
                  Wilson 
               



            's lodgings that night, and 
               
                  William 
                  Miller 
               



             came and knocked at the door about one in the morning; he desired her to open the door; she made him no reply; I got up and opened it, and he came in with this hat under his arm; I asked him how he came by it? he said he found it in Lombard-street. (Producing a gold lac'd hat.)
Prosecutor. This is my property, and what I lost that night.
Spencer. In the morning he desired 
               
                  Elizabeth 
                  Wilson 
               



             would go with him to 
               
                  Edward 
                  Carey 
               



            , to dispose of it; we went with him; he left us at a public house while he went for some body to buy it.
Q. What place did you go to?
Spencer. It was somewhere in the city, but I don't know where: Miller staid in the room while we went; we met with a Jew, who said he had not money enough; and said, he would go and fetch more: he brought in a constable, and took us up.



                  Solomon 
                  Isaacs 
               



            . On Friday the 3d of August, Carey came and asked if I know a person that would buy a hat, and said it was in a public house, the Three Herrings. I went with him there; there was Spencer and another woman; they had the hat; he asked a guinea for it; I saw it dirty; I thought it not honestly come by, and I got them secured.

                  Beadle

                  Edward 
                  Cook 
               



            , 
               
                  William 
                  Miller 
               



            , and I, came from St. Giles's to Lombard-street, where we saw those three gentlemen: I ran against one of them; he returned round and asked me what that was for? I struck him; he struck me again; two or three blows pass'd, and the hat tumbled off; Miller took it up and ran away with it.
Q. What was you going upon?
Beadle. We went out with intent to rob some body before we came home.
Q. How came you not to demand their money?
Beadle. We intended to get what we could.
Q. How long have you been acquainted with them, and what are they?
Beadle. I have known Miller upwards of three years, he is a brazier; and I have known Cook about a quarter of a year, he is a blacksmith.
Q. What are you?
Beadle. I am a watch-case maker.
Cook's Defence.
We met these gentlemen as we came up Lombard-street; we brushed one of their elbows; Beadle ran against it; the gentleman was making water; he said, What do you mean by that? Mr. Wood came and struck him; what Beadle said, I know not; he beat Beadle on the ground; I went to lift Beadle upon his legs; one of them went to strike at me; they knock'd my hat off, which I lost.
He called 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Gould

            , and 
               
                  John 
                  Pratt 
               



            , who had known him from a child, who said he was an honest man.
Miller's Defence.
I was drinking with Cook and Beadle on Saffron-hill; we went to Cook's lodgings in St. Giles's, and from thence we went to see Beadle home to Newington: going up Lombard-street, I stop'd to make water; I heard a noise; I picked up a gold lac'd hat, and went to this woman's lodgings, and knocked at the door; the girl said she could go and sell it the next day to one 
               
                  James 
                  Castle 
               



            ; she went, and was taken up.
Carey's Defence.
The two women came down to me with the hat in the morning, and said they had something to dispose of: I asked what it was? they said, if I would go with them to Duke's Place, they would tell me. I went with them there; then they told me it was a gold lac'd hat: they took me in to have some beer, and wanted me to go and call a Jew; I said I would with all my heart, if it would do them any good. I went and call'd in that man, and told him the woman had something to dispose of: then Poll Spencer pull'd it out of her apron, and delivered it into his hand; he asked what she would have for it? I said, I suppose the hat may be worth a guinea or more; he went out, and said, he would bring in a man that should buy it directly. He went out and brought in all the runners, and took me and the two women; upon which I was hiked to Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            .
He called 
               
                  Margaret 
                  Read 
               



            , who said he had spent most of his time at sea; but he had been in her apartment, and she never missed any thing.
Wilson's Defence.


                  Mary 
                  Spencer 
               



             let in Miller with the hat when I was asleep; she asked me to go to a person with it to sell it: we went to Saffron-hill, and met with 
               
                  Edward 
                  Carey 
               



             accidentally: we asked him to take a walk with us; she never told me what it was about, till we got to Duke's Place: we went into a public house; she asked Carey if he could find any body that would buy a hat? he said he believed he could. He went out and brought in a Jew.
Cook and Miller 

               guilty
             of stealing the hat.

There was an indictment against Cook and Miller for robbing

WILLIAM JONES
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
21st of January, 3 pairs of trowsers, value 3l., the goods of 



Alexander Goodbody, and that he had before been convicted of felony.






ALEXANDER GOODBODY
. I am a tailor, and live on Ludgate-hill. On the 21st of January, the prisoner came into my shop—he stole from the rod in my shop three pairs of trowsers—it was about half-past eight o'clock—he ran out, and I pursued—he then dropped two pairs of trowsers—the officer stopped him in my presence—he had dropped one pair on the step of the door.





JOHN MURPHY
 (police-constable G 215.) I was on private duty—I heard the alarm, and turned, and took the prisoner—I did not see him drop any thing—the prosecutor came up, and said he had stolen the trowsers from his shop.





WILLIAM HOWARD
. I am an officer of St. Bride's. I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction—(read)—I know he is the man.




GUILTY
. Aged 20.—


Transported for Seven Years.

Did you lose any razor-strops? - The prisoner came into my warehouse between six and seven in the evening, with some goods that had been ordered; after being paid for them, my servant missed a parcel, containing twenty-four razor-strops, which was made up, and marked ready for a customer; my servant went after him, and brought him back with the two dozen of strops.

             sworn.
On Tuesday, the 28th, the prisoner brought some buckle chapes; as soon as I had paid him, I missed the strops off the counter; I pursued him, and as soon as I overtook him, he dropped them; I immediately took him, and brought him back to the warehouse; he said he was very sorry for what he had done.
(The razor-strops produced, and deposed to.)



               GUILTY
            .
Tried by the London Jury before Mr. RECORDER.

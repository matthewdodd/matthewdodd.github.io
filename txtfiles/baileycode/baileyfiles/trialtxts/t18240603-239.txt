            '; on the 13th of May, while I was in the right-hand room, on the first floor, I heard a noise, and I went out, but saw no one; but I saw wet foot-steps upon the staircase. I opened the window, and saw the prisoner going out of the house. I went down and informed Mrs. Cruikshanks; she pursued her, and took her - I saw her taken; she had some sheets in her apron. I heard her say,
"Take the sheets, and let me go."
ESTHER CRUIKSHANKS. I am the wife of

            ; I know nothing of the prisoner; Oliver gave me information, and I went out and saw the prisoner about one hundred yards from my house. I found three sheets in her apron - she said,
"Take the sheets, and let me go;" they were my property, she had no business in my house; they had been in the left-hand room on the first floor.

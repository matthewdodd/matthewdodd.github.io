for stealing, on the

WILLIAM MACKLIN
 (police-constable S 180.) On the 4th of April, I was in Greenwich fair—I saw the prisoner about three o'clock in the afternoon—he put his hand into a man's pocket, and took this handkerchief out—I took him with it in his hand—I spoke to the man he took it from, but he declined appearing, on account of the little value of the handkerchief—I do not know his name.

Prisoner. I was in the fair and picked it up—I was putting it into my pocket, when the officer came and took me. Witness. I am quite certain I saw him put his hand in the pocket and take it out—I cannot be mistaken—it was in a crowded part of the fair—I took him with it in his hand—I asked the gentlemen his name, but he did not tell me—the prisoner walked with me to the station—I never saw him before.




GUILTY
. Aged 15.—


Transported for Seven Years.

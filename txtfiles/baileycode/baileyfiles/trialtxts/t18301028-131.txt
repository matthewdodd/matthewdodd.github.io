 - the prisoner is my own brother; he was in a destitute state, and we took him in from charity. I went out on the 14th of September, and left him in the house; I had not locked the room in which this property was, as I expected to find the prisoner there when I returned - our street door was fastened with a string; I was absent about an hour - when I returned the string was untied, the door open, and the prisoner was gone; I missed a watch, a coat, six napkins, a gown, and a cap - I had seen them safe the day before; I gave information - he did not return; he was taken about the 18th of September.

            . I am an officer. The prosecutor came to me, and I found the prisoner at the Three Crowns, East Smithfield; I made him no promise or threat - he at first denied having taken them, and then he said at the station-house that he took them, and sold them to a Jew in the Minories, the first, second, or third door, but he did not know his name.

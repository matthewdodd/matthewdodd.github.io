The prisoner had been servant

 to the prosecutor about ten months; he had missed goods for about eight months out of his store-room; he suspected nobody but the prisoner, and went round to the shops; at last he saw a card of buttons he knew to be his own at the shop of 
               
                  John 
                  Craymer 
               



             in Shoemaker-row, so he went in and asked for such other things that he had lost; whereupon Craymer produced a large quantity of goods of divers forts as mentioned in the indictment, which the prosecutor deposed to be his property. (Produced in court.) Craymer deposed, he bought them at several times of the prisoner at the bar.

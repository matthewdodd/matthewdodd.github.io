JOSEPH KELLY
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
5th of December, 1 bag, value 6d., and 6lbs. weight of coffee, value 11s., the goods of 



Samuel Grimmett; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






SAMUEL GRIMMETT
. I live in Lower-street, Islington. Between six and seven o'clock, on the evening of the 5th of December, the prisoner came into my shop for some lozenges, with two other lads—they did not buy any—I had a bag of coffee there, and I missed it directly they were gone—I followed them—I was going to lay hold of Kelly, who had a basket with the coffee in it, when he dropped it just before me, and ran about six houses—the policeman caught him—it is my coffee and bag.

Prisoner's Defence. It was not me that stole it—I had it given me by the other boy to carry.





JAMES BRANNAN
. I am a policeman. I produce a certificate of the prisoner's conviction from Mr. Clark's office (read)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 14.—


Transported for Seven Years.

            . The prisoner at the bar used to wash at my house. I lost one of these spoons on the 18th of April, the other on the 8th of May; she was at my house these two days. My maid went to the person who recommended the prisoner to my house, and found her out. She confess'd to me that she had pawn'd the spoons to one 
               
                  Stephen 
                  Keen 
               



            , a pawnbroker and distiller, at the corner of Fore-street, to whom I went and had them again.
[They were produc'd in Court.]

            , Mr. Sturges came to me, and told me, he had lost two silver spoons, and that he suspected the prisoner had got them. I went with the prosecutor to the person's house who recommended the prisoner. She sent for the prisoner, who came to us, and own'd it, and told us where she had pawn'd them, which was at Stephen Keen's.

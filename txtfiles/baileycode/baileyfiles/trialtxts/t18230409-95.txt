AVIS DOWNES. I live in Red Lion-street, Kingsland-road. On Sunday morning, the 9th of March, I was returning home through the Kingsland-road, about half-past eleven o'clock, and as I came by Shoreditch church


, a young man said to me
"The dog is fond of his mistress
"I had a dog with me - he then snatched my whittle off my neck; I saw no more of him, and ran towards the church. I called Stop thief! and he was secured in five minutes - I am sure he is the man.

            . I am a watchman; my box is on the spot. The young woman called out that she had lost her whittle; I ran across the road where the prisoner was running very hard - he turned back and dodged me, and was taken with it under his coat - he said he picked it up.

Prisoner's Defence. I heard an alarm; ran up and saw the whittle in the road, and seeing a woman and two watchmen at the end of the street, I took it to them, thinking it belonged to them, and was taken by the watchman.

 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
26th of May, 2 sovereigns and 1 half-crown, the monies of 



James Homer.






JAMES HORNER
. I am a sailor belonging to the George the Fourth, which laid in the Thames. The prisoner was an apprentice on board-on the 26th of May I went on shore to get provisions for the ship—I went to my chest and took my purse out, meaning to change a sovereign at shore—I did not look inside my purse—I did not spend any money, and came back without taking my purse out of my pocket till I went to pot it into my box—I then looked into it and missed two sovereigns and a half-crown—when the prisoner was accused of it he called me, and said if I would go on shore with him, he would make up the rest of the money which he had hove overboard—I had put my purse in my waistcoat pocket the money must have been taken before I took the purse out of the chest to take it on shore.





JOSHUA HALL
. I am mate of the vessel. Horner complained that he had been robbed of two sovereigns and a half-crown—I went and inquired and said all the men should be searched—the prisoner then went forward to the forecastle, down into a dark corner—I followed him, and asked

what he was doing there—he said he was going to get his hammock to be I searched—I said "Come out," and in a crevice of the beam in the dark place he went into 1 found a sovereign.





JOHN GASKIN
. I am an officer. The prisoner was given into my charge, I and I found 4s. 6d. on him—I asked what he had done with the rest, and told him what he said would be taken against him, and he need not say any thing unless he chose—he said, "As the worst has come to the worst, by G—d I have taken it, and chucked a sovereign and a half-crown overboard."




GUILTY
. Aged 19.—


Transported for Seven Years.

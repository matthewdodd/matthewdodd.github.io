            ; I am a washerwoman; the things mentioned in the indictment are the property of Dr. Hine, of Hatton Garden. I had occasion to call on Mrs. Reynolds, in Bleeding Hart Yard


; the linen was in a bundle; I put the bundle down upon the stairs; the street door was open;

             came to me whilst I was talking to Mrs. Reynolds, and told me the bundle was stole; I went down, and 
               
                  John

             brought the prisoner and the clothes back. (The linen produced and deposed to.)

            . I am an apprentice to Mr. Herbert, next door to Mrs. Reynolds; I was at work in the shop; I saw a young fellow fetching some water; I observed him go into Mrs. Reynolds's house; I saw the prisoner come out with this bundle under his arm; I sent Dunfield after him, who brought him back.

            . I manufacture chair bottoms
; on the 23d of September I happened to be out; the prisoner was a journeyman
 in the house, I was sent for home, and told he had got some horsehair; he was sent to the watch-house by my father; I went to him, and desired to know if he had any confederates in the house; he said there were none; I asked him what was his intention to do with it; he said, when he had got twenty or thirty pounds together, he used to go and sell it at a rag-shop in St. Giles's, and that he had gone on so for two months past.

            . I am apprentice to the prosecutor; the prisoner asked me for the key of the warehouse on the 23d of September; I went to look for it, and told him I could not find it; upon that he went to the counting house, and took it, and went to the warehouse, and I lay down and watched him, and saw him putting hair into his pocket; I called the maid, and she saw him; then I called my mistress, and she saw him; then I went and locked the door, he came up, and went to go out, but could not; I asked him what he had in his pockets; he said he had nothing; we took the hair out of his pockets, there were three pounds weight of it.
Prisoner's defence.

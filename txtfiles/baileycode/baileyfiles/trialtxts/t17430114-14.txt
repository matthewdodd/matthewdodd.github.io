                  Hurst 
               



            . On the 29th of December 
               
                  Tobias 
                  Isaacs 
               



             and 
               
                  William 
                  Waters 
               



             broke open the Door of a little Room my Husband has in Newgate, and brought 
               
                  Jack 
                  Friday 
               



             along with them; they said they would null him if he did not come; says my Husband, For God Almighty's Sake, Gentlemen, what do you want? Says Isaac, I will tell you what I want; so he gave him a Push against the Wall, and took his Breeches from under his Head, and gave them to Waters; there were two Six pences, and Twelve-pence Three-farthings in Brass , which was all the Substance we had then in the World. I went to get the Breeches away from him, and Waters stabb'd me in the thick Part of my Thumb, with a Knife, or something he had in his Hand, and took a Cobweb down to stop the Blood; and Waters threw the Breeches down on the Floor, and said, There, you Dog, there's your Breeches; but there was not a Farthing in them. Says my Husband, Lord bless me! these Men will always rob me, so that I cannot keep a Farthing of Money to myself.
Waters. Was nobody else in the Room?


                  Mary 
                  Hurst 
               



            . Yes, 
               
                  Peggy 
                  Girdler 
               



             was there, and 
               
                  John 
                  Friday 
               



            , whom you forc'd in: You have broke open the Door, and robbed me before this.
Isaacs. I hope, as it is a Prison-Affair, the Court will give Leave to bring down some of the Prisoners of our Ward; for we cannot defend ourselves, but by Prisoners. This is only a prompt-up Prosecution upon the Account of a Quarrel. We are inform'd, Hurst is to have a Guinea for this Prosecution.
Hurst. I am not promis'd any Money, or so much as a Glass of Wine, or a Drink of Beer.


                  Edward 
                  Hurst 
               



            . On the 29th of December, when I went to Bed, I had two Six-pences in Silver, and Twelve-pence Three-farthings in Brass, but Copper is the proper Name, I believe. I clapp'd a Pad. lock upon the Door when I went to Bed, because the Prisoners have told me, if I had but a Shilling in the World, they would have it from me; but I happened to be worth two Shillings then: They said they would have 
               
                  Ned 
                  Hurst 
               



            's Prime, that is the Expression they made use of: When I was asleep, I believe I had slept about half an Hour, some People came to the Door; my Wife waked me, and before they got in I was quite awake: The two Prisoners at the Bar came in; said I, What do you want? Says Isaacs, You Dog, I will tell you what I want; so he push'd me against the Wall, and took my Breeches from under my Head, and gave them to Waters, and he took the Money out, for I saw Water's Hand in my Pocket, and he took out a Handful of Copper; and my Wife laid hold of the Breeches, and he said, D - n you, you Bitch, let go, or I will make you; and he stuck her in the Hand, either with a Penknife or the Point of a Sword, I cannot tell which: Gentlemen, said I, you will repent this I doubt. G - d d - n you, you black-guard Dog, says he, if you speak another Word, I will stick you to the Heart; or if you ever speak of it, and I hear of it again. He then threw the Breeches into the Room, but there was not any Thing in them.
Isaacs . Did you make mention of any thing of this till there was a Quarrel between me and one of the Partners?


                  Edward 
                  Hurst 
               



            . Yes I did, I spoke of it to the Keeper; and a Day or two afterwards I wrote to Mr Akerman about it. - 
               
                  Jack 
                  Friday 
               



             came in, but he did not meddle or make with any Thing: He came in because they threatned to null him, that is, beat him, if he did not come in. - There was 
               
                  Margaret 
                  Girdler 
               



             in the Room, she lay upon another Bed in the same Room, because they did not agree in the Women's Ward.
Isaacs. Is there a Hasp to the Door?


                  Edward 
                  Hurst 
               



            . Yes, you know there is, and you broke one all to Pieces. There is a Place to fix a Padlock on. There is a Hasp and Staples.


                  Richard 
                  Akerman 
               



             sworn.
Q. Had you any Complaint made to you relating to the Prisoners?
Akerman. I do remember something of Mrs Hurst's complaining to me of her Husband's being ill us'd; I think I had a Letter about it. - I believe it is about three Weeks ago; Mr Bold and I had them down about it, and put them into the Cells upon this Complaint, and that of other Prisoners whom they had used ill, as a Punishment for their Offences.
Isaacs. Was I not confined in the Cells where the Criminals are consined? And was I not there ten Days?
Akerman. Yes, I believe it was about ten Days.
Isaacs. I was there eight Days before I had a Hearing.
Q. Has the Room, that Hurst lies in, a Lock?
Akerman. I do not know whether it has now or not; I know it used to have a Hasp, Staples, and Padlock. It is what we call a Duce-Room, for Persons who are brought from one Goal to another.
Isaacs. There has not been a Staple to the Door this Year and half.


                  Edward 
                  Hurst 
               



            . I have a Hasp now on the Inside to put a Padlock to.


                  John 
                  Friday 
               



            . On the 29th of December, Isaacs , Waters, and I, went into 
               
                  Ned 
                  Hurst 
               



            's Room together; as soon as they got in, Isaacs took the Breeches from under Hurst's Head, and Waters took the Money out of them. When I came into my own Ward, Waters told the Money, and there was 11 d. in Half-pence, and for that we had two Pots of Gin and Small-Beer. - I thought the Door stood upon the jar - I did not see any Hurt done to Mrs Hurst, but she complained that her Hand was cut. - I am sure it was Hurst's Money, because I saw Waters take it out of his Pocket, and did not put his Hand into his own Pocket 'till he told the Money.


                  Margaret 
                  Girdler 
               



            . On the 29th of December I lay in Hurst's Room. I was undressed, and she was almost undressed. The Prisoners came to the Door, and were half an Hour, or three quarters, striving to open it with a Poker. The Door had a Hasp, and was fastened with a Pad-lock. The first Man that came in was Isaacs, and the next Waters. Friday came no farther than the Door. Says Isaacs, Let us see what Prime Hurst has got: And he took from under his Head a Pair of Leather Breeches, and gave them to Waters, and he blew out the Candle, and took the Money out. - I did not see the Money in his Hand, but I saw his Hand in his Pocket; he stabbed Mrs Hurst in the Hand with a Knife. -
Isaacs. How could you see what was doing there, when you must go the length of the Hall to get a Candle?
Girdler . I did not go any farther than to 
               
                  Jack 
                  Ketch 
               



            's Kitchin, as they call it. - It was Charity-Money that was given us: We are robbed daily and hourly.


                  Mary 
                  Delabrown 
               



            . I heard Isaacs desire Friday to go with him into 
               
                  Ned 
                  Hurst 
               



            's Room, and see what Prime he had got. Friday was very drunk, and did not care to go. And the Prisoners said, he should go with them. They would null him if he did not. I know no more of it.
Isaacs . Was there any thing to fix a Pad lock to?


                  Mary 
                  Delabrown 
               



            . I believe not: For I lay there one Night ; and Hurst told me, there was no such Thing: It was sastened with a Bit of Wire.


                  Robert 
                  Watson 
               



             . Isaacs always behaved well to me. I know nothing of the Fact.


                  Jonathan 
                  Hatton 
               



            . I know nothing of this Affair. - I never knew that Isaacs ever robbed any body. - I have heard say that he did. -
Isaacs. I would sooner give than take from any body.
Butterworth . Isaacs has behaved very well, for what I know. - He always used me with good Manners. I know nothing of this Affair.


                  John 
                  Delabrown 
               



             . I know nothing of this. - Isaacs has used my Wife very ill, in striking of her several times. Waters never used me ill in any Shape. - Both

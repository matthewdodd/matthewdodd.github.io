JAMES ENNIS ROSE
. I live in Lower Sloane-street, Chelsea. On the 8th of February, I lost six pairs of slippers, which were in a bundle, at the corner of my door—I saw them safe at twelve o'clock, and missed then before one o'clock—I have not seen them since.





GEORGE MATTHEWS
. I live with a green-grocer in Little George-Street, Chelsea. On the 8th of February, I saw the prisoners about Mr. Roses shop—I had seen Long before—I saw him cut a string, take the slipper's and put them into Smith's black apron—they both went away—Long went round Little George-street, and Smith up Sloane-street—I an certain of them both.





GEORGE WAREHAM
. I live in Cramp's yard, Little George-street—I saw Smith go up Lower Sloane-street with some carpet shoes.

Smith's Defence. I was going along, and was taken—I never spoke to Long until I was taken.

Long's Defence. I never spoke to Smith until we were taken—the prosecutor said the shoes were taken a fortnight before we were taken.





JAMES BRADLEY
. I am a policeman. I took the prisoners in company together on the 19th of February.





SAMUEL DILLON
. (police-constable D 92.) I produce a certificate of Long's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office.—(read)—he is the person who was tried and convicted on that occasion.

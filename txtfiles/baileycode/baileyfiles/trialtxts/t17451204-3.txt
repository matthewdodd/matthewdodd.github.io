            , was indicted for 


               stealing a Bank Note of 20 l.
             the Property of 
               
                  
                     Elizabeth 
                     Matthews

                  Matthews 
               



            . The Prisoner at the Bar was my Footman
. I had a Draught of 50 l. upon Mr. Neal, my Son-in-Law, and I sent the Prisoner with the Draught to Mr. Martin's, the Banker, ordering him to bring me two 20 l. Bank Notes and 10 l. in Money; and accordingly he brought me back the two Bank Notes and ten Pounds in Cash for the Draught. I was not very well. I was at Mr. Neal's House in Million-Bank, and he brought me the Notes up into my Daughter's Chamber: I put them into my Purse, and the Purse into my Pocket. When I came Home I lock'd them up in my Buroe, in my own Bed-Chamber. This was over-Night; and the next Morning the Prisoner came up to know my Orders, and I had Occasion to send him to the Toy-Shop: He came close to my Dressing-Table to have his Order; I got up and went to my Buroe to take my Purse and give him the Studs that were in it; I turn'd my Purse inside-out upon the Table, Money and Notes -
Q. Did you see the Note at that Time?


                  Elizabeth 
                  Matthews 
               



            . Yes, my Lord. I did this to find the two Studs that were at the Bottom of the Purse. After this, I put the Money again into the Purse, and going to put the Notes in, said I, Here is but one Bank Note; the other Note was gone. Look, Madam, said he, is it not upon the Ground? Well, we search'd diligently, but it could not be found. I look'd, and said it was not on the Ground. I did not charge him with taking it, nor mistrust him, as he had liv'd with me between two and three Years. I sent him into the City to Mr. Neale's, to know whether it did not slip out of my Hand in putting them into my Purse; but there was none found there. After this he (Mr. Neal) went with me to the Bank, to stop the Payment of the Note: The Prisoner also went there with me. Then I thought no more of it.

            . This was a Draught for 50 l. upon Mr. Neal. The Bearer of it was one 
               
                  John 
                  Mason 
               



            , who brought it from Mrs. Matthews, and he had in exchange two Bank Notes of 20 l. each, and 10 l. in Money. And this Bank Note does exactly correspond with the Bank Note then given; for we enter the Number, Date and Sum of every Note coming in or going out. This Note being stolen, was brought to me: I examin'd it by our Books, and found it correspond with the Number, Date and Sum of the Entry thereof paid unto Mr. Neal's Draught; and because I would be sure it was right, I put the second Letter of my Name.
Q. From whom receiv'd you this Note?


                  Ebenezer 
                  Blackwell 
               



            . From a Clerk of the Bank: Mr. Neal's Clerk was with me first of all.
Q. Madam, are you sure that this is the Prisoner's Hand-writing?
Mrs. Matthews. Yes, I have seen him write several Times, and I am sure it is his own Hand-writing.

Hinckley Phipps. The Prisoner, my Lord, came to my Shop in Cheapside: I am a Linnen-Draper, and he came and bought Cloth of my Man to the Amount of 2 l. 13 s. after which he presented the Bill to my Man and desired Change, and truly I did not care to change it for so little Money being laid out: But, however, I bid my Man run down with it to the Bank, and see whether it was a good Note. But my Servant returning, tells me that the Payment of it was stopt at the Bank, which I immediately acquainted the Prisoner with, and told him that I would go with him to the Bank, to know the Reason of it. As we were going along I asked him about his receiving it, and he said that he receiv'd it of one Sands, a Barber in Holborn; and he speaking broad, I asked him whether he was a Scoth Hair Merchant? and he said that he was, and that he had given for the Bank-Note 12 l. in Hair and 8 l. in Money. He was then well dress'd, like a Merchant; he had on a Snuff-colour'd Coat, a Silk Waistcoat of the same Colour, and a white Wig. He gave in his Name at the Bank, 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Turner 
               



            ; the Clerk asked him some Questions, how he came by it, and he told him the same Story that I have just related to your Lordship. He said his Name was Turner, and that he lived at the Blue Boar at Turn-Stile in Holborn. My Lord, I did believe him to be entirely innocent to the last Degree, for he had a very steady Countenance and an Air of Honesty; and therefore I offer'd my Service to go along with him to Mr. Neal's, to know the Reason why the Note was stopt, for it appear'd at the Bank that it was stopt by Mr. Neal. He made no Scruple to go to Mr. Neal; but as we were walking along in Lombard-Street, I turn'd about to speak to him, and he was gone. Mr. Neal lives in a Court in Lombard-Street. When I missed him then, I was resolved to go to Mr. Neal's, where describing the Man, they thought the Description answer'd to Mrs. Matthews's Footman, and they told me that he was to go to live with Dr. Jurin. I afterwards saw him, and knew him to be the Man that brought me the Bank Note, and he confess'd it before Sir 
               
                  Thomas 
                  De Veil 
               



            .
Q. Well, Sir, can you swear that this is the same Note?
Hinckley Phipps. It is the same Number, but my Knowledge may not amount to a sufficient Testimony to swear; yet I verily believe it is. The Prisoner said at Sir 
               
                  Thomas 
                  De Veil 
               



            's, that he brought this Bank-Note to me: He said there that he took it off of the Ground; and before he said, that he had it of a Barber in Holborn. He denied for two Hours together at Dr. Jurin's, that ever he saw my Face, and with such a steady Countenance that I never saw the like before in all my Life.
Thomas Green. The Prisoner, on Saturday was a Fortnight, bought Irish Cloth to the Value of 2 d. 13 s. and after he bought it, he gave me a Bank Bill for Change: I carried it to my Master in the Counting-House, and he sent me down to the Bank, to see whether it was a good Note.
Q. Was that the Note?
Green. I can't be positive that was the Note.
Q. Are you sure that the Prisoner at the Bar did buy the Cloth?
Green. Yes, very sure. I am a Servant to Mr. Phipps. I know that I carried the Note to the Bank Saturday was a Fortnight, and found the Payment of it stopt.

                  Cutler 
               



            . I am a Clerk at the Bank. This Note was brought to me, and he that brought it said he came from Mr. Phipps. I told him it was a stopt Note, and asked who he took it of; and he said there was a Person in his Master's Shop that brought it, and I told him he must bring the Person to the Bank, that he might make out his Claim to it. Mr. Phipps and the Prisoner, I believe it was, came to the Bank, and I went up with them to the Secretary; and Mr. Phipps said that he would go along with him (the Prisoner) to Mr. Neal's. He said at the Bank that he sold some Hair to a Barber, and gave him 8 l. in Change out of the Note; upon which they went away to Mr. Neal's. This Note has been in my Custody ever since the 16th of November: This is the very Note, and it has been in my Possession ever since: Shew it to

                  Blackwell 
               



            . This is the Note that is in our Book.
Q. How does it appear that this is stopt in Payment? Do you remember the Time of the Entry, and by whom enter'd?
Blackwell. By the Secretary's Clerk: It is a Bank Note enter'd in the Books of the Bank.
Mr. Morris. I am Cashier of the Bank: I know nothing more of it, than that this is a Bank Note signed by me.
Prisoner. I don't very well know how I came by it, but I took up this Note with another Piece of Paper, and put it into my Frock-pocket, but did not know at all that I had it.
Q. But when you found it, why did you not carry it to your Mistress, instead of going to the Shop to buy Goods?
John Brown. I have known the Prisoner at the Bar these nine Years; he has a very honest Character. I keep a publick House in Newport Market.

            . I have known the Prisoner about seven Years, and he has a very honest Character.

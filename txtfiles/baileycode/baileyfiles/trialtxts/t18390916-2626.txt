DANIEL MOBBS
. (police-constable E 11) I fell in with the prisoner in Bainbridge-street, St. Giles's, on the 11th of September, at nine o'clock at night, with this hat—I asked what he had got there—he said, a hat which he was going to take to his father—I found the shop ticket on it, which led me to Mr. Marks.





MARK MARKS
. I am a hatter, and live in High-street, St. Giles. This is my hat, it has my ticket on it—I saw it a short time before I was fetched to the station-house—it was in my window.

Prisoner's Defence. A boy took it, and gave it to me to carry it for him.





JAMES M'CORMACK
. (police-constable E 59.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—he is the same person.

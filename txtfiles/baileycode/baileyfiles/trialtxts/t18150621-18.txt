            . I live in Clarendon-square. On Thursday, the 8th of June, between one and two in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner and a lad walking together up the square. When they came to Mr. Michelson's gate, the lad went down the area, and returned in a minute, giving the prisoner a bundle; I ran on, and took the prisoner, property, and all; the lad made his escape.
JAMES WHITEHAIR. I am a beadle. I received the prisoner and these things into my custody.

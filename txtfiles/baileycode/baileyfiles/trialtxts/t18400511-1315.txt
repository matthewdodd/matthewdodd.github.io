JOHN WATKINS
. I am a surgeon, and live in Newgate-street. About a quarter-past nine o'clock at night, on the 5th of May, I was near Bow-church, Cheapside, walking fast—I felt a tug at my coat-tail, turned round, and took hold of the prisoner, who had my coat-tail in one hand and my handkerchief in the other—I took hold of his arm, and he had the handkerchief in his hand—he dropped it, and said I was mistaken—the policeman, who was behind, secured him.





JOHN BYRNE
. I am a policeman. I was on duty in Cheapside on Monday night, and saw the prosecutor seize the prisoner by the collar—he immediately dropped the handkerchief, and I secured him.




GUILTY

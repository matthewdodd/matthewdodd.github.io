             is my husband, I live at Somerset-house



; I lost the things mentioned in the indictment the 16th of June, about three in the afternoon, neither I nor my husband were at home; I came home in the evening about eight, a neighbour's boy told me he saw the two boys at the bar, playing before my door; we went to Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            , and told him our suspicion, and he sent for them.
Q. How old are they?
A. Gad. The oldest is about thirteen years of age; they owned to the taking of the things out of my room, and that one of the spoons was broke and sold for 3 d. the little boy Dawson told me, that 
               
                  Anne 
                  Smith 
               



             had bought one of the spoons and the tongs; we went to her house with the boy, and she owned she had bought a spoon and the tongs of them; and he told me of having offered one silver spoon to a silversmith, and that he stopped it.
Q. Where did 
               
                  Anne 
                  Smith 
               



             live?
A. Gad. She lived in Black-boy-alley, in a private house; she gave up the spoon, and said, the tongs were pawned in Cow-cross, with one Clark; we went there, and it was delivered; she said, the boys told her they found them; then the boy carried us to Leicester-fields, to a silversmith's; the gentleman told us, that Cox brought the gold ring to him, and he stopt it; we found it there; I never found the rest of my things.

            . I live at the corner of Benjamin-street, Cow-cross, with Mr. Clark, a pawnbroker; I took in this pair of tea-tongs of 
               
                  Anne 
                  Smith

            . I am a constable; I took up these boys at the bar, I took Dawson first; he told me where he sold one of the spoons and tongs, and took me to the woman at the bar; she gave me the spoon out of a little drawer under her table, and owned where she had pawned the tongs; we went to the pawnbroker, and ordered him to bring them to Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            ; Dawson and Smith were committed for further examination, and as we were coming back we met Cox, we took him in custody; when we charged him with the fact, he did not deny it, he said little or nothing about it; I cannot say that he did own it; we searched him, but found nothing upon him.

                  Fisher 
               



            . I am a goldsmith in Leicester-fields; the prisoner Cox, with another boy a little bigger than Dawson, came to my shop, and brought this ring; I happened not to be at home; this was about three weeks ago; they said they found it; my man said they ought to be charged with a constable; this he told me; he said they must leave the ring till his master comes home, and they to come again in the morning. In the morning Cox and another boy came; I asked them how they came by it; they said they found it in Lombard-street, or some such name; I said, I am fearful you are bad boys, I have a good mind to send for a constable; one said, he picked it up, and the other that he saw him; I said, I should keep the ring till they bring somebody to testify for them. I think Cox said, he worked for somebody in Bedford-row; the boy came again on the Thursday in the afternoon, and wanted the ring; I said, I will not part from it, without you bring your master; on the next morning there came a man from Sir John Fielding with the prosecutrix, and asked me about it ( the ring produced in court, and deposed to).
Cox's defence.
This little boy and I were at play by that old wall, and a boy that belongs to St. Clement's school, came and brought them things; I took that ring to the goldsmith's shop, to know if it was gold or not, I did not go to sell it; then we carried a spoon to this young woman ( meaning Smith) we lost that other boy in Covent-garden; then we went down into Field-lane, and so to Smith's house; he was going to break the spoon, and she gave him a shilling for it; then he came with the tongs; she took them of him, and asked him how he came by them. I am a plaisterer by trade; my master lives in Bedford row.

            , who all gave him a good character.
Dawson's defence.
Another boy gave us the things; we were playing at trap-ball, he asked us to go and sell them for him; he said he found them, so we went along with him to Covent-garden market; then that boy ran away ; I was not within the door where the place was broke; it was Cox carried the spoons to Smith, and I went with him; we went to sell them; I am but nine years old.

Q. How old is he?
J. Dawson. He is as he says.
Q. Is he not older?
J. Dawson. The truth is, he is not twelve years of age; but I can hardly tell, for I can neither write nor read.
Smith's defence.

I sell oranges
 at the Royal Exchange; I had been out, and Dawson was sitting on the dunghill by our door; he was going to break a spoon; I asked him what he was going to do with it; he said he would sell it for a shilling, if I would buy it; I gave him a shilling for it; he went and sat upon the dunghill again, and came to me presently after, and asked me if I would buy a pair of tea-tongs; I asked him how he came by them; he said he found the things in a stocking; I had the tongs in my hand, and some money; he wanted to snatch the tongs out of my hand; I dropt six-pence; he took it up, and ran away.

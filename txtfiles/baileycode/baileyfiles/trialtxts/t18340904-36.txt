            . I was coming along King-street, Westminster, on the 8th of August - I saw the two prisoners, and heard an alarm of "Stop thief" - I pursued them - Jones had this hat in his hand - he threw it over to Geary, and cried "Ding" - which means "Take it" - I ran, and caught Jones - he gave me a blow over the eye, but I kept him till the officer took him - Geary caught the hat and ran away.
JOSEPH BENTLEY. In consequence of something I heard, I ran out of my shop - I saw Geary running - he went into a public-house at one door, and came out at the other - I took him - this hat had been two feet inside my window.

            . I live with the prosecutor - I saw Geary with this hat - I followed him - I went up to him, and said,"Now" - he gave me the hat, and ran off - I did not see Jones.

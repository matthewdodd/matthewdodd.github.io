JOHN SMITH. I live at Brighton. On the 18th of May I was in Little Newport-street


, and felt a slight motion, and saw Gibbs pass on my right side, and Groves on the other - I seized Groves, and an officer close by seized Gibbs, and took my handkerchief from him.

            . I am an officer. I saw the prisoner following Mr. Smith along Newport-street - Gibbs took the handkerchief from his pocket - I took him, and took it from him - Groves was close to him at the time - I had seen them in company before; they followed him twenty or thirty yards; they were close together, and walking together - Groves took off his hat, and two handkerchiefs were in it.

GROVES' Defence. I was not in his company, and know nothing of him - I was rather in liquor, and reading a bill, when I was taken; the two handkerchiefs I had got from Ashford's, in the Strand, where they had been pawned, as I was in distress.
GIBBS' Defence. The officer took the handkerchief off the rails; it was not on me.

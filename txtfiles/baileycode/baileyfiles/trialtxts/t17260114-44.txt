                     Viscount
 Nutterville



               
            , of the Kingdom of Ireland, on the 5th of November
 last.


                  John 
                  Follard 
               



            , commonly call'd Sir John Follard, at the Black-Lion Alehouse in the Strand, thus depos'd. The Prisoner came to me, and desir'd me to lend her 14 Shillings to fetch a Ring out of Pawn, where it had lain for three Months; and which, she said, was given her by her Master, my Lord Nutterville. I lent her the Money, and she left me the same Ring in pledge to me. But, not long after, my Lord's Gentleman came with her, and demanded the Ring again.
Her Confession before Justice Gore, was read, in which she acknowledg'd, that about 2 Months ago, being Servant
 to the Lord Nutterville, in Great Queen-Street, Lincoln's-Inn-Fields


, she then took a Ring away (with a Head in the Seal) out of a Trunk, and pawn'd it to Follard.
The Prisoner thus made her Defence. I don't deny that I had the Ring and Snuff Box, but my Lord gave 'em me for a Present. - He brought me out of my own Country, and overcame me, and when I proved with Child, he would have sent me back again, and gave me 2 Guineas more. - My Lord's Gentleman perswaded me to say, before the Justice, that I took the Things, that no Reflection might be cast upon my Lord's Character. - 'Tis well known, that I was not a common Servant in the House; for my Lord paid me weekly, and I had the Use of his Chariot 2 or 3 Days in a Week. The Jury found her 


               guilty to the Value of 10 d
            .

JAMES PETERS
. On the 12th of July, between four and five o'clock, I was walking along the Strand, towards Charing-cross-when I got to Somerset-house I felt a twitch—I turned, and saw the prisoner with my blue silk handkerchief in his hand—he was in the act of putting it into his trowsere pocket, and he ran off—I took him—this is it.

Prisoner. I did it for want.

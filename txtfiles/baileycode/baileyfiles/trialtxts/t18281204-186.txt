            . I am beadle of St. Bride's. On the 2d of November, at about five o'clock in the afternoon, I was on the west side of Fleet-market, and saw the prisoner take a great coat out of a gig: he ran away with it; I stopped him, about ten yards off, with it - I took him to Mr. Saunders's shop, where the gig stood.

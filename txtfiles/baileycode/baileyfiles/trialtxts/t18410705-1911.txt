GERTRUDE PARKER
. I live in Northampton shire. I came to town in May—I staid about three weeks, and on the 15th of May was going to return to my friends—I was going by the mail—I met the prisoner in the Bull and Month inn—he said he was the porter, and took care of the luggage—I gave him the care of my trunk in consequence of that—I did not go that night, as there was not room—he said he would continue to take care of the trunk till I called for it the next evening—I returned next evening, and he was not to be found—I have seen some of the property—a great deal is lost altogether—my box was corded.

Cross-examined by
MR. DOANE. Q. Do you know that the things found are yours? A. Yes, I made them myself, and have examined them—I am single, and am living with my father—I am a dress-maker—these are my own wearing apparel—I went to Northampton shire after this—I have always gone by the name of Gertrude.





JOSEPH HEDINOTON
 (City police-constable No. 218.) I took the prisoner into custody at the Angel public-house—I searched his lodgings, and found two nightcaps, two handkerchiefs, one collar, one nightgown, and one bag there—part of it was in a band-box on the bed there—he is not a porter at the inn, but plies about there for jobs.
(Charles Seasel, weaver, New Market-street, Bethnal-green; Maria Jacqueman, Barnsbufy-road, Islington; William Matthews, glass-finisher,

Bartholomew-close; and John Dudd, cloth-worker, Trinity-court, Alders—gate-street, gave the prisoner a good character.)




GUILTY
. Aged 39.—


Transported for Seven Years.

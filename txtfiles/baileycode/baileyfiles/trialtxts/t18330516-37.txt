            . I am in the service of Mr. Thomas Hall, he is a baker
, and lives in Kentish-town. On the 20th of April, I was out with my bread - I left my basket at the end of Union Terrace


 - I was away three or four minutes delivering some bread; when I came back I missed my basket and 6 loaves - I had not seen the prisoner, but a person told me he had seen a man take the basket and bread, and go down Camden-town.

            . I am a baker. I saw the prisoner take the basket, but I took no thought of it; I did not know but that it belonged to him - the officer got the basket afterwards.

             (police-serjeant, S 3). On the 29th of April, I met the prisoner in the Hampstead-road; I took him, and said he was wanted for taking a basket and some bread from Mr. Hall - he said I was mistaken, he was not the person; but in going along, he said, "I know what it is about, it is about Saturday week's job; it is for that bread and basket" - he said, he had sold some of thebread, and had eaten some; and he told me where to find the basket, which I did.

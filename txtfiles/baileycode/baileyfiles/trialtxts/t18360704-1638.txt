GEORGE WILLOUGHBY
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
9th of June, 1 handkerchief, value 4s., the goods of 




William Turner, from his person.






WILLIAM TURNER
. I am an ironmonger, and live in Bishopsgate-street. On the 9th of June, between nine and ten o'clock at night, I was in Fleet-street, near the end of Fetter-lane—Thorp told me something—I examined my pocket, and my handkerchief was gone—it was afterwards produced—this is it.

Cross-examined by
MR. BALLANTINE. Q. Have you not prosecuted two persons already? A. Yes; for the same handkerchief—they have been convicted.





CHARLES THORP
. I was an officer on duty. I saw the prisoner take

the handkerchiefs from the prosecutor's pocket, and hand it to another out named Miles, who handed it to one Willis—I immediately tried to seize Willis and the prisoner—I am certain the prisoner is the one who took it—I took the handkerchief out of Willis's hat.

Cross-examined. Q. Are you quite certain of the prisoner? A. Yes, because I knew him before.




GUILTY
. Aged 20.—


Transported for Seven Years.

CHARLES HASSAN
. I am in the employ of William Cope, a bookbinder and stationer, in St. Martin's-lane. We have lost 1760 sheets of printed paper—the Report of the Poor Law Commissioners was amongst it—I have not the least doubt that this is my master's—(looking at it)—I saw it safe about a quarter to six o'clock, on the 13th of December, in the passage of our house.





JOHN PIKE
 (police-constable F 105.) I was on duty a quarter-past six on the 13th of December, in Monmouth-street—I saw the prisoner

going up the street very fast with this paper on his head—I asked where he was going—he would not give me a satisfactory answer—I said he must go with me—he threw it off his head into my face, knocked my hat off, and ran off—I took him, and produce the property.

Prisoner. I met some young man who asked me to carry it to the Green Man and Still—a person told the officer so, and I offered to take the policeman to the house in St. Martin's-lane, where I received it—the man was before me. Witness. There was a man passed and said something about St. Martin's-lane, but I don't know what.




GUILTY
.* Aged 20.—


Transported for Seven Years.

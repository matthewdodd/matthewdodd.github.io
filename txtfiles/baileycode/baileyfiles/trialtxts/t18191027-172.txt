             were indicted for 


               stealing, on the 7th of October
, one handkerchief, value 3 s., the goods of a 
                     man


                   unknown, from his person
            .

            . I am an officer. On the 7th of October, in the evening, I was in the Strand, and saw the three prisoners in company together; suspecting them, I watched, and saw them follow several gentlemen - they attempted to pick their pockets. I followed them untilthey had got through Clare-market, following a lady and gentleman. When they got into the market, I saw George Green go up to the gentleman, and draw the handkerchief a little way out of his pocket - the others were covering him. They followed him into Russell-court, Drury-lane


, where I saw William Green take the handkerchief quite out of the gentleman's pocket; I immediately took him into custody, and took the handkerchief out of his hand - the others were secured. I stopped the gentleman, and he gave me his direction, but did not attend before the Magistrate. I summoned him, and he afterwards attended, but refused to swear to the handkerchief. I saw it taken out of his pocket.

            . I was with Thompson, and saw the prisoners following the gentleman in Clare-market - George Green 
               drew
             the handkerchief out a little way, in Clare-street; I followed them to Russell-court, and then William Green took it quite out. I seized George Green and Lawrence - I am certain they were all three together. I knew them well, and saw them together all the way.

            . I was with the witnesses, and followed the prisoners. I saw Green and Lawrence attempt several people's pockets. I afterwards secured George Green.

                  MORRIS
               



            . I was constable of the night, and took the prisoners in charge.

            'S Defence. I was walking through the passage, and picked the handkerchief up; the officer collared me. The other two did not know that I had it. The gentleman said he did not know whether he had lost it or not.

            'S Defence. It is false. I never touched it.

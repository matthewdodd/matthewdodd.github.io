            . I am one of the constables belonging to the kays



. I heard Fowler was committed, being taken with a frail of raisins upon him. I went to the Compter, and asked him if he had any persons concerned with him; he confessed the two other prisoners and he had stole a frail the night before. I heard him confess the same at the Mansion-house. I went with him, and, by his direction, took them both; after which they both confessed they stole one on the Wednesday night, about 7 in the evening, and that they sold it to a chemist in Whitechapel.

            . I had charge of these fruit upon the wharf. I missed a frail on the Thursday morning.

             told me he had a frail at his house, and the man they were taken upon was in the Compter; that was Fowler. I went to him, and desired him to make a discovery, if any body was concerned with him, which might be a means to get him off; then he told me of the other two men; that he got it from the parcel, and they carried it into the fields, and emptied it into their pockets, and went and sold it to a chemist in Whitechapel. I heard the other two confess the same. I know all their faces. I have seen them pilfering upon the kays daily. M'Cullock and James,

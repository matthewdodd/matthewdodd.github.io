                  Mitchell
               



            , late of the City of London, Labourer
, was tried upon two several Indictments: one for 


               feloniously stealing from 
                     
                        William 
                        Wey
                     



                   on the 21th. of October

, 8 Pistols, Value 18 s. each, 44 Guineas Value 22 s. each, and 56 s. in Money numbred
            : the other for 


               feloniously stealing from 
                     
                        Joseph 
                        Ansell
                     



                   on the said 21st of October

 3 Pound 18 Shillings in Moneys Numbered
            . It appeared that the Prisoner was Chamberlain
 at the Inn where the Prosecutors Lodged, put them to bed as usually, and carry'd aways the Keys of the Rooms where they lay, who next Morning miss'd their Breeches and Money, and their Breeches hid in the staircase. The Matter was very plain against the Prisoner, who had little to say in his defence, he was found 

               Guilty
             of both Felonies.

JOHN CRAWLEY
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
26th of December, 591bs. weight of butter, value 2l. 4s.; and 1 cask, value 6d.; the goods of 




Joseph Blyth Stevens.






WILLIAM GATLIFFE
. I am in the employ of Joseph Blyth Stevens and another, cheesemongers in Arthur-street, West. I was in the warehouse on the evening of the 26th of December, and saw the prisoner come and take up the firkin of butter, and walk out with it—I ran after him, and caught him with it in his arms, three or four yards from the door—I called, and my master came to my assistance, sent for the officer, and he was taken.





JOSEPH BLYTH STEVENS
. I was called to assist my man and secured the prisoner—it is my butter.






JOSIAH EVANS
. I took the prisoner—he went for a few paces quietly, and then he made a start, and struck me in the left eye—with great assistance we got him to the watch-house—we were obliged to hold him down, and handcuff him.

Prisoner. He struck me first. Witness, No, I did not.

Prisoner. I was passing, and a man came out with the butter—a man came out and took me.




GUILTY
. Aged 21.—


Transported for Seven Years.

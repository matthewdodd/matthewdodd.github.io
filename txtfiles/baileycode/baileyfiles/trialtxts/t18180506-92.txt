JOHN JAMES WRIGHT. I am nine years of age. On the 31st of March I was in St. John-street, and met the prisoner at the top of Cow-cross, he gave me a knife, and gave my brother thirty-two songs; he said, "Come along with me and I will give you a ship." He got me into St. John-square


, pulled my coat off, and my brother's also, and ran away - I lost sight of him. I am sure he is the boy.
JAMES WRIGHT. I am father of the last witness. On the 31st of March, about seven o'clock in the evening, my wife told me my sons had been robbed of their coats-the little one had his returned. On the 12th of April I sent the last witness to the top of St. John-street, on an errand. he met the prisoner at the top of West-street, and got him secured, and brought to me. As we were going along he said he was the boy
 who took the coat, and that he had pledged it at Peachey's, in Goswell-street, for 4s. 6d.

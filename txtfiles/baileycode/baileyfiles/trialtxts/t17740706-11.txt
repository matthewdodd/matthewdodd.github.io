            . I hired the prisoner as a servant
 on the 21st of June, at three shillings a week; she was to find herself; I weave; my husband is a taylor
; I went out on the 23d of June, about three or four in the afternoon going to wash some things; it was not much past four when I returned; then I missed the things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them); she was gone; I pursued her, but did not find her till next day; then I found her at the place she lodged at before she came to me; she had my cardinal on; in her pocket I found a pair of stockings, a cap, and two handkerchiefs.

            . The prosecutrix is my daughter: she came and told me she was robbed. When the prisoner was taken I entreated her to return the things; she said she would suffer the law. (The cardinal produced and deposed to.)
Prisoner's Defence.
I was distressed or I should not have done it: it is the first offence I ever committed.

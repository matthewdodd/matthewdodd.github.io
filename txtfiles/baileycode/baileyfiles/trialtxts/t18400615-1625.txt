1625. 




WILLIAM THOMAS
and 




RICHARD LEWIS
were indicted for

stealing, on the 
25th of May, 1 purse, value 1s., the goods of a man unknown, from his person.






GEORGE TREW
(police-constable H125.) On the 25th of May I was in St. James's Park, in plain clothes—I saw the prisoners there—I knew them, and watched them—I saw Thomas attempt two or three gentlemen's pockets—he put his hand into one and drew a handkerchief partly out—he then went and took this purse, which I now produce, from a gentleman's pocket, and gave it to Lewis—they ran across the park to Whitehall-place,—I and Pidgeon followed and took them—I saw Lewis in Whitehall-place give the purse back again to Thomas—I took it out of Thomas's hand—I

do not know who the gentleman was who lost the purse—it was just at the time the cannons were firing—I lost him in a minute.





HENRY PIDGEON
(police-constable H28.) I was in the Park. I saw Thomas attempt several gentlemen's pockets—I then saw him take this purse out of a gentleman's pocket and pass it to the other prisoner—I pursued them across the park—we took them in Whitehall—Thomas had the purse then—I saw Lewis return it to him.

Thomas's Defence. I bought the purse two months ago, and had it to put my money in.

Lewis's Defence. I saw this man about three weeks ago selling oranges—I bought three of him—he took out this purse and put the money in.

THOMAS—


GUILTY.† Aged 17.

GUILTY.† Aged 15.

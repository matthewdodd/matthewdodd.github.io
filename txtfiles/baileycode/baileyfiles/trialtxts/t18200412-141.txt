            . I live with my brother William, who is a baker
, and lives in St. John-street, Smithfield


. On the 10th of February
, between eight and nine o'clock at night, the prisoner, Earl, came and bought a quartern and a half-quartern loaf, which came to 1 s. 1 1/2 d. He paid me a 1 l. Bank note. I gave him change, and asked his address. He said
"Johnson, No. 10, Wilderness-row," which I wrote on it - (looks at one) - this is it. He went out, and was brought back in about ten minutes with Batten, in custody of Morgan. I gave Morgan the note.

            . I am a patrol of St. Sepulchre's. On the 10th of February, between eight and nine o'clock at night, I saw the prisoners and three others lurking about Stockham's shop, talking together. I saw Earl go into the shop, the rest were about five yards off. Then one of them went up to the door of the shop, and the others went down the street - the shop door was open. I stood on the other side of the way, and saw Earl offer a piece of paper to the last witness, and saw him receive the change. He took up the bread and came out. He went towards Wilderness-row, in a direction that Batten went. I ran into the shop, came out, and saw the prisoners going up the street together. I overtook them in Wilderness-row, and met Read. He secured Batten, and I took Earl. Batten then had the bread. I found 18 s. 10 1/2 d. on Earl.


                  CHARLES 
                  READ
               



            . I met Morgan, and assisted in taking Batten, who had the bread in his apron.

            . I live at No. 10, Wilderness-row, and have lived there fourteen years. No person named Johnson lived there. I know nothing of the prisoner.

            . The note is forged in every respect.

            . I am a signing-clerk. The signature to the note is not mine.
EARL's Defence. I was coming down St. John-street, a young man in a flannel jacket put the note into my hand, and asked me to go and get the bread. I asked why he could not get it himself. He said he lived at Mr. Johnson's, a bookseller, No. 10, Wilderness-row - I have been to that shop twenty times. He said he had had some bread in trust for his master, and did not like to go himself. I went in, came out, and put the bread into his lap. We went and got some porter, and before I gave the man the change, I heard the cry of Stop the boy! I stopped and was secured. I believe the man sold the bread to this prisoner. The girl did not put her address on the note till I was brought back.

                  STOCKHAM
               



             re-examined. I wrote the address before he left, but put my own name on it when he was brought back.


                  HENRY 
                  MORGAN
               



            . I am sure they were in conversation together, and Earl went into the shop. I saw no person with a white jacket. I called at Mr. Johnson's, No. 37, Wilderness-row, they had sent no person there. I saw him give Batten the bread.


                  JAMES 
                  ARIELL
               



            . There is a Mr. Johnson, a stationer, at No. 27, he lives there now.
BATTEN's Defence. I never had the bread from this lad in my life. I bought the bread of a man in the street, and in about three-quarters of an hour the gentleman said I must come back to the shop the bread came from. I know the man by sight.


                  HENRY 
                  MORGAN
               



            . When I came out of the shop, they were in my sight directly.

                  STOCKHAM
               



            . When the bread was brought back I knew them to be the same loaves.

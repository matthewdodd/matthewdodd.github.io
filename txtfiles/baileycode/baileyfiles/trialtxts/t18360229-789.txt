789. 




WILLIAM HORSEMAN
 and 




WALTER WELLS
 were indicted for

stealing, on the 
19th of February, 7 tabacco-pouches, value 2s., the goods of 



Abraham Barnett; to which


William Horseman pleaded 


GUILTY
. Aged 12.





HENRY WEBB
. I know Mr. Abraham Barnett's shop, in High-street, Shadwell. I saw the prisoner Wells, with Horseman, loitering about on the 19th of February, and looking in at the window—Horseman put his hand into the window, and took out one or two tobacco-pouches; and then Wells put his arm in, and took some more—I then made over to them, and caught Horseman putting his hand in again—Wells ran away—I could not lay hold of him—I saw him again the same evening, when they were taken to the Thames Police—I am sure the prisoner is the boy.





JAMES MANN
 (police-constable K 239.) I have four tobacco-pouches, which I got from Horseman.





SARAH PRESSLEY
. I am daughter-in-law of Mr. Abraham Barnett. I believe these to be his property, but we could not swear to them—we could not miss them.





SAMUEL PERKINS
. I am a policeman. I have a certificate of Wells's former conviction for felony—he is the boy(read).

WELLS—


GUILTY
. Aged 9.—Both 



Transported for Seven Years.

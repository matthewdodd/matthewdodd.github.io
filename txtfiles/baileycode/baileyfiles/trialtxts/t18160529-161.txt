            . I am a pawnbroker, at 105, Bishopsgate-street. Between seven and eight o'clock in the evening of the day in the indictment, a woman brought a livery coat to my house to pledge; she said, she was sent by a young man. I told her I should detain the coat. Soon after, the prisoner at the bar appeared as the owner of the coat, he said, he bought it of a jew in Rag-fair. I thought I knew something of the livery, as Mr. Windus lived near me. I detained the prisoner, and that coat was afterwards claimed by the prosecutor.

            . I am coachman
 to Mr. Windus. That coat is his property; it was taken out of our stable.

            . I am an officer of the Merchant Tailors' Company
. On the 4th of November, about a quarter to three o'clock in the afternoon, I was at the corner of Bouverie-street


 and Fleet-street


, and felt a tug at my coat pocket - I felt, and missed my handkerchief; I turned round, and the prisoner was close at my elbow - on looking him in the face I suspected him; he turned down Bouverie-street - I followed him about ten yards down,collared him, and accused him of it: he denied it - I insisted that he had it in his possession; I got him into a door-way, and saw him drop it at his heels; I held him till Half took him; a gentleman had his pocket picked within twenty yards of the spot just before.

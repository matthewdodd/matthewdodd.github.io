            . I was in St. Andrew-street with two other officers, watching No. 33, which was suspected to be a receiving house. About half-past six o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner going by with something like a coal-sack, he went into the house. I ran across, and he put it down at the foot of the stairs, came back, and when he saw me, he made an excuse, saying to the woman,
"I am come for that pair of stockings;" when she saw me she said he had looked at none. I took him, and asked what he had brought? he said nothing; I went into the passage, opened the sack, and found the carpet - it was in a soot-sack. I found that it belonged to the prosecutor.

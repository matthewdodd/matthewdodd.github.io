THOMAS WILSON. I live in Hoxton Old-town. On the 12th of January, I had just driven my gig up to a stable, facing Shoreditch church


, about half-past eleven o'clock at night; I got out of the gig, had just rung the bell, and on turning round I saw the prisoner take the coat from the side of my gig - he pulled it off, hung it on his arm, and was walking off with it, away from me; I went up to him, and said, "What do you do with that coat, you scoundrel?" the Policeman came, and took him.
Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What are you? A. A publican; I keep the Plough - I did not perceive that the prisoner was tipsy; he said it was a lark, or something of that kind - he had got about two yards from the gig.

            . I was with the prosecutor - I got out of the gig first; I saw the prisoner take the coat - he was walking away with it; he did not appear to be tipsy.

            . I am the officer. I took the prisoner and the coat.
The prisoner put in a written defence, stating that he was intoxicated; and, in the act of falling down, had caught hold of the coat to save himself, when he was taken.

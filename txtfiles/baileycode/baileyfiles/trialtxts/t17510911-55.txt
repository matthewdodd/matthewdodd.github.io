Malby Braberson. On the 28th of July, walking from Charing-cross to Temple-bar, near Durham-yard


, a lad came to me, and asked me if I had not lost something; I felt in my pockets, and said I had lost a handkerchief; he told me he had seen a fellow take it out of my pocket. and that he was just gone towards Charing-cross, I went back, and near the One Tun alehouse the lad shewed me the prisoner. I laid hold on him, and carried him into the Three Tun alehouse, where I searched him, and found this handkerchief in his pocket. [Produced in court, and deposed to. ] I know I had it five minutes before.

            . On the 28th of July, about nine at night, I saw the prosecutor at the end of St. Martin's Lane, and the prisoner follow him on to the New Buildings in the Strand: they were on that side Northumberland-house is on: I was on the other side. It was a moon light night. I saw the prisoner put his left hand into the gentleman's right hand pocket, his coat-being loose, and took something, and as he drew it out, I took it to be a handkerchief. Upon this I went to the gentleman, and asked him if he had lost any thing. The rest as the prosecutor.
Prisoner's Defence.
I was going along the Strand, and kicked something before me; I took it up, and found it to be a handkerchief.




               Guilty, 10 d.

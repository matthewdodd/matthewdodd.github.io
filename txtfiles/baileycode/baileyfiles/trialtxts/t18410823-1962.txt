1962. 




THOMAS HALLING
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
17th of August, 6 handkerchiefs, value 16s., the goods of 



John Harvey and mother.


MR. PHILLIPS
conducted the Prosecution.






PATRICK FOY
. I am a private watchman. I was called into Mr. Harvey's shop between eight and nine o'clock in the evening of the 17th of August, and Davis gave the prisoner into my custody—I searched him, and found this handkerchief on him, which Davis identified—I saw some other handkerchiefs at the station in another policeman's hand.





JAMES DAVIS
. I am in the employ of John Harvey and Son, on Lugate-hill. The prisoner came into the shop between eight and nine o'clock—he told me he was waiting for his mother—at the end of the counter near where he stood were some boxes containing dresses and a quantity of loose handkerchiefs—I saw him leave his seat and approach these boxes, and raise the lids—I had Foy called in, and in the prisoner's pocket was found one silk handkerchief—at the station I saw five more found in his hat—he was asked if he stole them—he said he would confess to having stolen one—he gave no account of the others—these handkerchiefs are my master's, and have his private mark on them.

Cross-examined by
MR. CLARKSON. Q. Are there any other partners but Mr. Harvey and his son? A. No; and Mr. Harvey has no other name but John—there are five handkerchiefs in one piece, and one separate.




GUILTY. Aged 13.—(Recommended to mercy by the Jury.)




Transported for Seven Years—Convict Ship.

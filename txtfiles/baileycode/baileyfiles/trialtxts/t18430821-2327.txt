JOHN SELLICK
. I am a carpenter, in the service of Henry Tyler, and live in Praed-street. I left some boards safe at a house in Westborae-terrace, at half-past five o'clock on the 17th of July—I missed them the next morning—these are them—I believe them to be my master's.

WILLIAM HIGGIN BOTTOM. At half-past eight o'clock in the evening of the 17th of July, I met the prisoners at Westburn-terrace, with some hags on their back—I asked what they had got—they said some wood they got at West-burn-terrace; it was thrown out with some shavings—Barnes had eighteen of these boards, and Liley had the rest.

Barnes's Defence. I was coming along, and Liley asked me to mind them for him.

BARNES—


NOT GUILTY
.

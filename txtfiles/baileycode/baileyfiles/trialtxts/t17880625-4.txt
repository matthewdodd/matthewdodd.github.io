             sworn.
I am a haberdasher



, and one of the partners mentioned in the indictment; on Monday the 26th of May, I was informed by one of our servants that some goods were lying on the ground; the prisoner was in the shop, and the shopmen had some suspicion of her, which they communicated to me; I desired that they would not touch her, unless they were positive, as it was a delicate matter, and in fact would be cruel to take her into custody on flight suspicions; after which the shopmen were quite positive; and on her going out, one of the young men stopped her and brought her back, and she was searched, and a piece of silk for handkerchiefs fell from under her petticoats; which is the goods mentioned in the indictment; I am positive it fell from her, as I saw it before it touched the ground.


                  WILLIAM
                   STORER
               



             sworn.
I am a shopman to the persons mentioned in the indictment; on the 26th of May, the prisoner came in to purchase some silk handkerchiefs; I shewed her some which she did not approve of; upon which I went with her into a back warehouse and shewed her some others; she chose one, and deposited a shilling by way of earnest for it; I shewed her some others of which she chose two and deposited two shillings; after which we had some conversation about the price; she had not paid the full; nor had she them delivered to her; she was to send her sister the next day for them with the remainder of the money, who she described to be a short black girl; I then sold her several yards of binding; then she went out of the warehouse into the shop; Mr. Walford was at the door; when she had got about ten yards into the shop from the warehouse, she let fall a piece of silk handkerchiefs; I was about two yards from her; Mr. Walford said, this is what we want; we will make an example of her; I then returned her the three shillings she had deposited; the constable was sent for, and she was taken into custody.


                  JOHN
                   BUTLER
               



             sworn.
I am a shopman to the prosecutors; while Storer was conversing with the prisoner, I saw a piece of silk handkerchiefs lying on the ground; I thought it looked suspicious, and I mentioned it to Mr. Walford, who told me, not to accuse her unless I was positive, and to be very cautiousabout matters of that kind; after which both me and Mr. Walford saw another piece drop; she had her hands in her pockets, and seemed uneasy; on her going out I brought her back, and then she dropt the piece mentioned in the indictment.


                  WILLIAM
                   HAWKINS
               



             sworn.
I am a constable; I took charge of the prisoner; and the goods were delivered to me by Storer.
(The goods produced and shop mark sworn to.)
PRISONER's DEFENCE.
I never touched any thing but the binding; and I looked at the handkerchiefs and bought three, and left a deposit for them; I was very willing to be searched, as I knew I was innocent.



               GUILTY
            .
Tried by the first Middlesex Jury before Mr. Justice WILSON.

            . I am shopmans to the prosecutor. - On the 30th of May, between seven and nine o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came to the shop, and asked for three yards of drab mixed kerseymere, for Mr. Lightfoot, who lives at Camberwell, and dealt with us; he had brought a genuine order from Mr. Lightfoot once before. I gave him the kerseymere, which came to 24 s. On the 2d of June he came again, for three yards and a quarter more, for the same person - I delivered it to him.

On the 3d of June, about eight o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came for six yards of velveteen, for Mr. Lightfoot - it came to 2 l. 6 s. 6 d. - I delivered it tohim, believing his story, and on the following Saturday I went with an officer, and found him at the Red Lion public-house, at Camberwell. I have found two of the articles in pawn.

            . I am a tailor, and deal with the prosecutors. The prisoner was not in my service. I once gave his father an order for goods to the prosecutors, but never sent him for any of these goods. I never received them.

FRANCISCO FIGULS
. I am an oilman, and live in Woburn-buildings. On the 22nd of September, between ten and eleven o'clock, I was in my back parlour, I heard a noise, went into the shop, and saw the two prisoners—Pearson was against the counter—Lynch was leaning over the counter, and had his hand in the till—I caught them both, and found three half-crowns in Lynch's hand—Pearson was close to him—they had not called any body to serve them—I looked into my till, and missed three half-crowns—I sent for an officer, who took them.





JAMAES STUTCHFIELD

Pearson's Defence. I was going into the shop, and the prosecutor came out—I did not go in till I saw the prosecutor come.

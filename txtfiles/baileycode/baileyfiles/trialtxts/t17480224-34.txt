             . On Saturday was sevennight I happened to be out of town, and when I came home my wife was in a great disorder about these two pair of shoes; she said, this Joe the black had been at my shop, and asked her to shew him some shoes and pumps, and desired she would go along with him to his captain or lieutenant; so he led her up to the Gun at the Hermitage, and he said he would fetch his master; instead of that he came to my shop, and said to a little girl, who is here, that her mistress sent him for a pair of shoes and a pair of pumps, and she would not let him have them; but he put his hand over and took them out of the shew-glass, and about half an hour afterwards I found the goods upon him, and he was offering to sell them. These are my Goods. Not only that, but he came back again, and took a hat, pretending that he had left his hat. He owned before the Justice, that there were two more concerned and a woman. He was asked what he had to say, and he pretended he could not speak English, but he spoke very good English before the Justice. The gunner of the Wager man of war said he could speak English very well, and that he was a very great rogue.

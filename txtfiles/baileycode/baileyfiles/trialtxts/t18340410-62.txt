. The prisoner lived with me about six months - on the 19th of September, I made up a parcel to go to my father - it contained a shirt, a pair of trowsers, four sovereigns, two half-sovereigns, and a letter - it was directed to Mr. Waite, Duke-street, Reading, Berkshire - I brought it into the shop, sewed it in a basket, and gave it to the prisoner to take to the waggon-office, and if he was too late for the waggon, to take it to the coach-office - he took it out and I saw him no more, till he was in custody.

            . I received the parcel on the 21st of September - it contained a shirt, a pair of trowsers, and a note, but no money.

             (police-constable, G. 175.) I received information, and took the prisoner in the House of Correction - I said, "I suppose you know what I take you for"- he said, "Yes; I know all about it - I had a good master, and I should have been more grateful" - he said, "I suppose I shall be transported; but I am a good scholar, I shall do better there than here."

            . I am mother-in-law to the prisoner, I have no children of my own - my husband is a smith
, and lives in Phillip's-buildings, St. Pancras


. On the 9th of November, my husband's watch was on the table in the bed-room, and on the Tuesday following I missed it - this is the watch.

            . I am shopman to a pawnbroker. I have the watch, which I took in of an older lad than the prisoner for 10s.; in the name of

             (police-constable S 169). I took the prisoner in the street - I asked what he had done with his father's coat and watch - he said, he and another lad had pawned the watch in Holborn; and the coat he had sold to a Jew in the street for 3d. - I found the watch - I did not tell him it would be better for him to confess.

            . What my wife has stated is true; this is my watch, but my coat is lost - the prisoner was absent a week, and then came and took the coat while I was out.

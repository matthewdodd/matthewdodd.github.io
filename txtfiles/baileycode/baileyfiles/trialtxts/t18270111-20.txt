            . I am shopman to Mr. Burket, a pawnbroker, of Paddington-street. On the 16th of December the two prisoners came to the shop together with eight curtains; Lutman pawned five of them for 10s., and three for 10s., and had separate duplicates - she carried them; Partington was merely with her.

            . I am upholsterer to Lord Dufferin. I paid Lutman her board wages every fortnight; the duplicates of these curtains were found in the porter's table drawer - I know them to be his lordship's.

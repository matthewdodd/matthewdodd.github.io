            . The prisoner was his servant
. The things mentioned in the indictment were missing the 20th of February. The prisoner was charged with taking them the 26th, and, in my hearing, she confessed she took them, and told us where they were pawned. (Produced in court.) I can swear to all but the ring, which had no mark upon it. I had such a one, and the prisoner said it was mine.

 was again indicted

 for embezzlement.






CHARLES SINCLAIR
. I am in the employ of Mrs. Glover. I received from her, on the 10th of September, two sovereigns, to pay a cognovit at Mr. Ratton's. I went to his office in Liverpool-street—I went there, and saw the prisoner—I gave him the two sovereigns, for which he gave me a written acknowledgment—I went there again on the 15th of September, and paid one sovereign to Canton, for which I also received an acknowledgment—I gave them to Mrs. Glover.

Prisoner. Q. When you came on the 11th of September, did I seem anxious to get the money? Witness. No, I took a note, and you said it did not signify whether it was a week or ten days, as Mr. Ratton was out of town.





ROBERT CANTON
. I was in the prosecutor's employ—this witness came on the 16th of September, and paid me a sovereign—I paid 10s. to the prisoner, and the 10s. I kept for my wages.





WILLIAM HOLMES
. I am clerk to Mr. Headland, a solicitor. On the 19th of September, I went to Mr. Ratton's office—I paid the prisoner 3l. 10s. 6d.—I gave him a 5l. note—he went out to get change, and gave it me.

Prisoner. Q. Do not you know that it had been due some time, and that Mr. Headland had made excuses for the non-payment of it? Witness. Not that I know of.





LEWIS RATTON
. The prisoner was my clerk—he was to receive money for me, to enter it and pay it—I have never received these sums.

Prisoner's Defence. I had no intention of appropriating these sums to my own use, and I gave them their own time to pay the money.

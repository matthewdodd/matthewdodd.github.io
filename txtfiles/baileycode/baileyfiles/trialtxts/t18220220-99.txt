            . I am a salesman
, and live in the Commercial-road. On the 25th of January, about seven o'clock in the evening, I was standing at my counter at work, and saw the prisoner walk in and lift up the cuff of a jacket, which hung by the wall; he dragged it down in a moment or two, and ran out. I pursued, he threw it back into the shop, and I collared him outside the door.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

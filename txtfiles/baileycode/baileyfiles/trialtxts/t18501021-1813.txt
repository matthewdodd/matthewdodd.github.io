, stealing 1 gown, 3 spoons, 2 tumblers, and other, articles, value 2l. 10s.; the goods of 



William Brownrigg, her master.






WILLIAM BROWNRIGG
. I live in Stanhope-street, Hampstead-road. On 19th Sept., at half-past eleven o'clock, I engaged the prisoner as a servant, and she came at half-past three—she brought an old bundle with her, which I thought was her nightclothes, and she said her box would come at six—about half-past five 1 missed her—her box did not come, and I missed a dress, some tumblers, three tea-spoons, a case of mathematical instruments, and other things—she left her bundle when she went, and I found it contained a ragged old counterpane, part of a very dirty dress, and a nightcap—I heard of her in the newspaper, went to Bagnigge-wells station, and saw her there—this dress (produced) is my wife's, and the one I lost.





MARY COOK
. I lodge in the house—this gown is Mrs. Brownrigg's—I made it for her—I saw the prisoner when she came.





JOSIAH STONE
. I am in the service of Mr. Goulburn, pawnbroker, of Ernest-street, Regent's-park—I produce this gown, which I believe the prisoner pawned, but I will not swear to her—the person who pawned it also offered me a case of mathematical instruments.





MARY ANN ELIZABETH BROWNRIGG
. I am daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Brownrigg, and am ten years old—I recollect the prisoner coming—she was

cleaning the passage, and told me to go up-stairs and sec if there was anything wanted, and to come down and tell her—I went, came back again, and she was gone—I afterwards missed this gown.




GUILTY
. Aged 17.—


Transported for Seven Years.

(There was another indictment against the prisoner.)

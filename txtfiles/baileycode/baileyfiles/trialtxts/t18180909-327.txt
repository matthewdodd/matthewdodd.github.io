            . I am a servant at Fairman's library, in Bond-street


. I was standing at the door on the 23d of July, and saw Joseph Wells, the prosecutor, go by, I knew him very well before; the prisoners were following him. I went out and saw Edwards take the handkerchief out of his pocket, and give it to Parr - I seized them both; another man who was with them ran away. Edwards got from me, and ran off - He was stopped; Parr pulled the handkerchief from his bosom, and threw it down. I know the prosecutor's name is

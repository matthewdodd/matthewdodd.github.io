             sworn.
I saw the prisoner standing in the street, with a drab coloured coat under his arm; I went up to him and said, I believe you are the gentleman I want to speak with; he ran away; my suspicion was grounded on his having a great coat under his arm, and one on his back, and he ran away; I have kept this coat ever since.
(Produces the coat.)

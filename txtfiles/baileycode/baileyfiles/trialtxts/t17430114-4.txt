            . I am a Tayler, I had a pair of Black Cloth Breeches sent me to mend by Mr Keckwick, I hung them carelesly over the Shop-Door, and on Tuesday the 14th of December, the Prisoner snatched them off the Door, and run away with them: But having no Shoes on, I did not pursue him: The next Night, I hung a Waistcoat over the Door, to see if I could catch him, fastened a String to it, and nailed it to the Door, and on Saturday Night he came again, took the Waistcoat off the Door, and pulled it as far as he could for the String, so I run after him, and took him. I am sure, he is the Person that took the Breeches; because I saw him very plain, he had a Cap on, as he has now, when he took the Breeches, but when he came for the Waistcoat, he had a Hat on.

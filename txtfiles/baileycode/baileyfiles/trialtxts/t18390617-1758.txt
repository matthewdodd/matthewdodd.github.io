JAMES ROBERTS
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
23rd of May, 2 spades, value 3s., the goods of 



Leonard Jones, and 1 rake, value 1s., the goods of 



Joseph Saunders.






JAMES HILSDON
. I am a policeman. On the 23rd of May I was in Harlington-street, St. Pancras—it is a retired part, a great part of it is gardens—I saw the prisoner in Mr. Leonard Jones's garden—part of it is a gate and part is pales—I asked what he was doing there—he said he had come to pick up a few bones, and that a young man gave him leave—I asked where he lived—he said he did not know—I said, "Where are you going with this spade?"—he said he meant to take it, to make a way through a hedge—I said, "What have you got in your bag?" he said, "A few bones"—I found in it this spade and this rake, broken.





JOSEPH SAUNDERS
. This rake belongs to me, it was in my father's garden—I do not know the prisoner.





LEONARD JONES
. These spades are mine—I left them safe on the 22nd of May, and hid them behind the canvas, at the back of the summer-house—the prisoner had no right there—I do not know him.

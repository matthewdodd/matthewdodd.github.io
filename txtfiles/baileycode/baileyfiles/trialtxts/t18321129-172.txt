            . I was passing the shop of Mr. Reynolds, a pawnbroker
, in Mile-end-road


, on the 23rd of October, and saw two men at the door; I crossed, and waited about ten minutes - I then saw a third man, who was the prisoner, come out of the shop; he crossed the road, and turned down a place: I followed - he saw me; he opened his coat, threw down these handkerchiefs, and ran off - I pursued him a mile and a half, and took him.

             Reynolds. These are his ten handkerchiefs; they were about one yard inside his shop, and were safe before; the officer brought them back.

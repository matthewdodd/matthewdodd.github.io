            . I am a widow
, and keep the White Hart, public-house
, in Windmill-street, Tottenham-court-road


. I let the prisoner a room - he slept in a room where there were two other beds; he had a bed to himself, and was to pay 1 s. per night. He took it on the 25th of October for one night. Next morning he sent the two men who slept in the room after situations, as they were out of employ - they found no situations were wanted. As he was going out I sent the servant up to see if all was safe, and as he went out, she said the sheets were gone. I ran after him, but lost him - he was taken that day.

            . I am constable of St. Pancras. The prosecutrix gave me information, and I traced the prisoner to the Hole in the Wall, public-house, in Chancery-lane. I went there about eleven o'clock in the morning, he came in in about an hour after - I took him in charge. He then said he had pledged the sheets in Greek-street, Soho, and had made away with the duplicate. I went to the pawnbroker's, who produced them at the office.

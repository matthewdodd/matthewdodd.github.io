            . I am a Policeman. On the night of the 26th of January I stopped the prisoner in High-street, St. Giles's, with this Bible under his left arm, about half-past eight o'clock - it is Dr. Geddes' Bible; he said he was going to take it to St. Giles' church - I took him into custody.

            . I am in the service of Mr. Charles Stenson, of Charlotte-street, Fitzroy-square. This Bible is his property - I saw it safe on the night in question, just within the door; I did not miss it till the officer brought it.
The prisoner pleaded poverty.

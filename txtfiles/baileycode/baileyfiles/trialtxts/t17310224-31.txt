             , were indicted for 


               feloniously stealing a Water-Man's Silver Badge, Value 7 l. and twelve Silver Buttons, Value 20 s.

Lady
 Falconbridge


             , in the Custody of George Abraham's , the 9th of November
 last.
The Prosecutor depos'd, That he being a Waterman to the Lady Falconbridge, wore her Badge, and he being dressing his Boat, having pulled off his Coat, had laid it by upon another Boat; and that the Prisoners who were Watermen's Boys (as he afterwards was inform'd) took the Coat, and carrying it away in a Boat, cut off the Badge and Buttons, and threw the Coat into the Thames.
- Henry depos'd, That the Prisoners and himself seeing the Coat hang on a Boat, did take it, and carry'd it to Cholniley's Brewhouse in a Boat, cut off the Badge and Buttons, threw the Coat into the River, and sold the Badge and Buttons to 
               
                  Katherine 
                  Collins 
               



             (who is since run away) for 32 s. the Badge was produc'd in Court, and sworn to by the Prosecutor.
The Prisoners having nothing material to say in their Defence, but that they found the Coat; and the Fact being plainly prov'd, the Jury found them both 

               Guilty
             of the Indictment.

EDWARD COLEMAN,


 JOHN RYAN
, and 



JOHN KEMP
 were indicted for

 stealing, on the 
26th of November, 4 caps, value 3s. 9d., the goods of 



William Lance.






JOHN EATON
 (police-constable S 199.) Between eight and nine o'clock at night, on the 26th of November, I met the three prisoners—they had all new caps on—I had known them before, and knew they had old caps—I saw Coleman separate from the other two, and he had something under his jacket—I took him, and told a butcher to take the other two—I found one of these caps under Coleman's jacket, and this other on his head—the other prisoners had each one of these caps on his head—Coleman said they had found them.






WILLIAM LANCE
. I live in High-street, Camden-town—I lost these four caps between half-past six and eight o'clock that evening—I can swear to their being mine.
(Owen Hart and James Harley gave Coleman a good character; Margaret Massey and Bridget Preston gave Ryan a good character.)

DANIEL ROBINS
. I am a carrier, living in Church-street, Lower Edmonton. On the 19th of September I had this linen in a basket hooked up behind my cart—I saw it safe at Kingsland—I soon after was informed it was gone—I looked, and set off after the prisoners—I saw the basket lying in the road—I met Izzard with Boynett—this is the basket and the articles.

Cross-examined by
MR. BALLANTINE. Q. What time was this? A. About nine o'clock—there was a dog following the cart.





JOSEPH SUDD
. I saw the basket behind the cart, and the chain about it—I heard the dog barking, and saw the prisoners keeping a short distance behind, which caused me to notice them—they took the basket from the cart—I gave information.

Cross-examined by
MR. PAYNE. Q. What are you? A. A tailor—I was about forty yards from them—they went down St. John-street.





JOSEPH IZZARD
. I was on the road, and saw the prisoners take the basket from behind the cart.

Cross-examined by
MR. PAYNE. Q. What are you? A. A carpenter—I never saw Izzard before—I was ten or fifteen yards from the prisoners—they went into John-street.





JAMES BRENAN
. I am a policeman. I took the prisoners, and found the basket about a quarter of a mile from where it was lost.

Cross-examined by
MR. BALLANTINE. Q. How far was Boynett from it? A. About 150 yards—I took Castle about half-past nine o'clock.

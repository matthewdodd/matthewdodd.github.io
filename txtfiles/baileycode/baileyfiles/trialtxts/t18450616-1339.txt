JOHN WILLIAMS
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
2nd of June, 1 coat, value 1l. 10s.; 1 pair of trowsers, 1l.; 1 waistcoat, 2s. 6d.; 1 shirt, 1s. 6d.; 1 handkerchief, 6d.; and 1 pair of braces, 6d.: the goods of 



John Turpin, in a vessel on the navigable river Thames; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






JOHN TURPIN
. I am master of the brig Bowen, of Whitby, which was lying in the Thames. On Monday morning, the 2nd of June, I missed the articles stated, which I had left safe about half-past nine o'clock on Sunday night, on the cabin locker—these now produced are them, and are my property—I do not know the prisoner.





DANIEL SUGG
 (police-sergeant.) About four o'clock on Monday morning, the 2nd of June, I saw the prisoner in Cannon-street, St. George's, carrying a bundle—I followed him, and made signs to another constable to stop him till I came up, which he did—I asked him what he had in the bundle—he said, "I don't know"—I asked where he got it—he said he met a man at Execution-dock stairs, who asked him to carry it to Commercial-road, and remain at Mr. Gurney's public-house until he came—I took him to the station, and found the bundle contained these things.

Prisoner's Defence. I was standing at Execution Dock-stairs about half-past two o'clock; a man, dressed like a sailor, came over the water, and asked me whether—I would carry a bundle up to Cannon-street; I said yes; I walked there, and stood by Mr. Gurney's public-house about ten minutes, and the policeman took me into custody.





THOMAS TURVEY
 (policeman.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction—(read—Convicted 3rd April, 1843, by the name of 


John Lewis, of stealing 20l. worth of rags, and confined two years)—I was present at the trial, and am certain the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
.—


Transported for Ten Years.

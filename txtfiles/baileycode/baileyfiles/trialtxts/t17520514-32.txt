William M'Cleere. I live with one Mr. Gripe in Bishopsgate-street


, a Hair Cutter; the prisoner and I were both 
servants


 together with Mr. Hyate; we went to bed together on the 3d of March, being the first day he came there, I got up in the morning and asked him if he'd get up to work, he said, he was not acquainted with rising so soon in a morning; in the night he said, the cloaths were too thin and took my coat to lay on the bed, I said, I did not chuse that, so I took it and hung it on a chair, my comb and buttons were in my pocket then. We missed the prisoner about seven o'clock, and my shirt, and coat, and things in the pockets ; I met with the prisoner again accidently in the street on Saturday in the afternoon, I took him into Custody and found the comb and buttons upon him. (produced in court and deposed to) I asked him where my coat was, he said, it was not to be had again, but he would send down to his friends in the country and make me satisfaction ; I took him before the Alderman and he was committed.

            . I took the prisoner into my service the 3d of March, he absconded my service; I saw not the going of him, when he was taken he had the comb and buttons upon him.
Prisoner's defence.

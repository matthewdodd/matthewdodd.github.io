THOMAS HENRY HARTLEY
. I live in Earl-street, Westminster. On the 14th of April I left my cloak in my gig, about half-past eleven o'clock, at the door of Mr. Good's shop, in White-street, Cripplegate—I was absent five or ten minutes—when I came back the cloak was gone—I had looked at it once or twice during that, time, and seen it safe, having nobody to mind the horse. I received information, and ran in one direction and the witness in another, and secured the prisoner—this is my cloak.





ROBERT ROLFE
. I was in White-street—I saw the prisoner step on the chaise, take the cloak and run off—I followed him into Tenter-street, and there he dropped it—I secured him.

Prisoner's Defence. A man gave me the cloak, he asked me to go and clean it for him, and said he would give me 1d.




GUILTY
. Aged 14.—


Transported for Seven Years.

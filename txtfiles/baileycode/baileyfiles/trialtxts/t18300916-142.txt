WILLIAM WATLING, I am a newsman, and sell oysters
 in the Strand. On the 4th of August I went on board one of the boats at Billingsgate


 to get some oysters - it was a quarter before one o'clock in the day; I had a sovereign, and a half-sovereign in my pocket - I took the half-sovereign out, put the sovereign into my pocket again, buttoned it up, and pulled my waistcoat over it - I was reaching with one hand over the hatchway to pay the money, and had my other hand behind me - I felt a hand in my pocket- I seized it, turned round, and saw the prisoner; I said,"You scoundrel, you have robbed me of my sovereign;" he said "Me!" and got from me, but was taken getting out of the boat.

            . I am a porter at Billingsgate. I saw the prosecutor on board the boat, and while he was paying for his oysters he turned round, and said to the prisoner, "You scoundrel, you have robbed me of my sovereign;" he got from him, and I took him going to the next boat - I am sure he is the person; I never lost sight of him.

            . I took the prisoner, and found this sovereign on him, which he said he picked up on board the boat.
The prisoner put in a written Defence, stating that he had found the sovereign in a boat.

SARAH HARRIS
. I am a laundress—I live at No. 8, Caplin-street, Lisson-grove, in the parish of St. Marylebone—I rent the house and have lodgers. I occupy the front room second floor myself, or 1 may say the whole floor—Roberts keeps a shop on my ground floor, and Fry the sheep✗ on the other side—it is a double house—Mrs. Hooper occupies two rooms on the first floor, Salmon the front room, and Roberts the otherroom—the female prisoner lodged in my house for nearly two years, and was in the habit of coining into the room I occupied—I kept my money in the right hand drawer in the room which I keep as a sitting room and bedroom—she has✗ the opportunity of seeing me put money into the drawer, and I have taken✗

money out of it to lend her before now—she left me just before May, and took all her things away—she left a tea-pot behind her, and came for it on the 1st of May—she had not paid me her last week's rent—she paid me then, and said, "I have left a tea-pot here, and a knife and fork"—I said, "Yes, I know you have, and when you have made good what things you have destroyed here, you should have them"—she said, "Oh you b—old b—we will have a b-lark over this tea-pot, and you shall lose a rare lot of time," and as she went down stairs she said it should cause me to lose a deal of time—on the 15th of May, I left my house a little before two o'clock, with my daughter, to get in my linen—I returned a little after three o'clock, and found two or three policemen in my room, and my son and daughter—I found the drawer which my money was in open—I had locked it and had the key in my pocket—I missed a £5 note, and as near as I can guess seven sovereigns—six sovereigns were with the note, and one with some fourpenny-pieces, a few shillings, and sixpences—I had looked into the drawer just before I started, and saw the money safe—I missed a watch which hung on the mantel-piece, and four silver teaspoons from the drawer, and a silk handkerchief I missed next day—I had put it on as I was going out, but I thought it would be too hot, and threw it carelessly on the table—I always went out from half-past one to two o'clock on Monday, and the female prisoner knew that—I did so at the time she lodged with me—I sometimes leave somebody behind in my room, and sometimes not—sometimes I was about an hour and a half out, and sometimes about two hours—I had an old lady in my room for six weeks before the prisoner left, but after that I had nobody to leave in the room.

Cross-examined by
MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did not some of your lodgers leave you about a week before the prisoner left?A. No, no person left the house that I had had a quarrel with—I swear that is the truth—some persons named Jones occupied the shop on the left hand side—they left about a fortnight or three weeks before the prisoner—I had no quarrel with them before they left—we parted on good terms so far at making up matters—we had no quarrel, but they asked me to take the fixtures towards my quarter's rent, as they were not able to stop—I was not at all angry with them because they could not pay their rent—a person named Walker was not in the habit of coming to my house—I never called Chambers an ill name while she was with me, but gave her good advice—all my lodgers are good old standers—I never had one for only a day—I swear that I did not call the prisoner a w—, nor any ill name—all I said to her was, "I think you are forgetting yourself'—my daughter is about twenty-six yean old—I left her behind—she might have staid in the room if she chose, but the had her own business to attend to—she used to visit me while the prisoner lodged in my house—she hardly ever staid in my room while I went out—she was there about five minutes that day—that was the only time I ever left her to lock the door—I should not have done it then, only the cart came up in a hurry the was never left in the room except that day—she was there sometimes with me, but I never left her behind me except that day—the lodgers all knew that Monday was my usual day for going out—I betters I had about five lodgers at that time in the house—a young man named Herbert lodged in the house, but he went out in the morning, and is not at home in the lay time—he went into the City that day—I went into his attic not five minutes before I went out—I saw him about nine o'clock in the even-ing when he returned from hit sister's—neither Mrs. Hooper nor Mrs. Salmon

have any family—I had no mark on the note, it was a new one—the prisoner had left some things for me to wash, and came on Monday to fetch them, and pay the rent—I never left my door unlocked except when she was there, and I have said to her, "Rose, I wish you would look to my door," as I thought I could depend on her—I used to put the key on a stool outside the door, and sometimes under a water pitcher, when I was out, as I did not like to trouble her to give it me when I came up stairs again.





MARY ANN FOX
. I am the prosecutrix's daughter. I was at her house at the time she went out—she left me behind, as the cart came to the door for her to go out—she said "Will you lock the door Mary?"—I did so, and came out of the room—I locked the door, and went to see that Herbert's room was locked,—I locked his door and put the key of his door on my mother's drawers, and brought my mother's key over to my own place—my mother's drawers were safe then and the door locked—I did not lock the street door—it is always open—in about half an hour afterwards I received information from Mrs. Roberts, and went over to my mother's—I went up stairs and found the door open—I saw no marks of violence on it—the lock appeared to have been unlocked with a key—I went and tried the drawer which I knew my mother kept her money in, and it was forced open—there was a piece of the drawer lying on the floor, and the mark of a chisel on the drawers, as if it had been used to prize it open—the box my mother's money was in was gone, and her watch and tea spoons.





ELIZA LOUISA ROBERTS
. I am the wife of Joseph Roberts, who keeps a hair-dresser's shop in the prosecutrix's house. On Whit Monday, rather before two o'clock, I was standing at the shop door—I did not know whether Mrs. Harris was gone out then, but I noticed the prisoner Blackson and another walking about—I do not know the other sufficiently to swear to him, but he was exactly the same sort of person as the prisoner Walker—(looking at the prisoners)—yes, they were the two men—they were walking very slowly backwards and forwards—they afterwards separated, and Blackson went to the corner of Nightingale-street—the other was standing just beyond Nightingale-street, waiting as if for Blackson to come up him—Blackson was looking at me as I stood at the door with my baby in my arms my arms—I afterwards went from the street-door into my shop, pushed my shop door to, and went into my parlour—I heard the footsteps of one person, not more, going up stairs—the street door was open at that time, and the middle door of the passage was a-jar—I went and found it ajar after I heard the footsteps, and closed it—I cannot say whether it had been ajar before—it was easy to open it—it opens with a string, and was not fastened at all—I went up stairs to my bed-room on the first floor for a jug at that time—I came down again, put the jug on the table, went to the door instantly, and met Blackson coming through the passage, as if from up stairs—I asked him his business, whether it was with Mrs. Harris—he said it was—I asked him if I should tell her when she came home—he said no, the business was with her herself—I said, "If you have any message I will tell her when she comes home"—he said, "Then you can tell her I came from Mr. Dalston, (or Dalton,) a tailor"—I saw no more of him, but I suspected something was wrong, from his agitated appearance, and I went over to Mrs. Harris's daughter to tell her—she came over immediately after me—we went up and found her mother's door open, and the drawer broken open—I am sure it was Blackson I saw—he had on a dark frock coat, but I did not notice any other part of his dress—I did not see any body else go into the house.


Cross-examined. Q. You crossed the street very soon after to Mrs. Fox? A. Yes, Blackson was then gone—I saw nobody on crossing the street—I could see up and down a considerable distance—Walker was the person saw walking with him in the street, but I did not see him after Blackson came out of the house—I have never sworn that the middle door was shut—Mrs. Harris has left her key in my shop once or twice when she went out—(looking at her deposition)—here is my mark to this—(the deposition being read contained the following sentence—"There is a middle door in the passage, but it was shut.")





JOHN MATTHEWS
. I live at No. 6, Caplin-street, two doors from Mrs. Harris. On Whit Monday, a little after two o'clock in the afternoon, I saw the prisoners, Walker and Blackson, walking backwards and forwards for a full half hour, which made me take particular notice of them—they were exactly opposite my house at the corner of Nightingale-street—I saw Blackson leave Walker, cross over the road, and enter into Mrs. Harris's passage door, but I could not see him go up stairs—I had seen Mrs. Harris go away with her cart before that—she was not gone when they were first walking about, but after she was gone he crossed to the door—Walker walked a little farther off towards Church-street—I did not notice whether he turned the corner or not—Blackson was dressed in a dark frock coat—it appeared to me like a dark bottle-green.

Cross-examined. Q. As long as you saw Walker after Blackson parted from him, was he not walking? A. He was walking gently on.

COURT. Q. How far did he go? A. I did not notice particularly, as I went into my shop—he was about twenty yards from the house when I saw him last.





WILLIAM SEYMOUR
. I am a shoemaker, and live in Caplin-street, directly opposite Mrs. Harris. On Whit Monday I was at work in my shop, and saw Blackson go into Mrs. Harris's house—it was near upon three o'clock when he came out—I cannot say the time exactly—I had seen Mrs. Harris go away before he went in—I did not see anybody with Blackson—I saw him go in, push the door open in the passage, and turn round towards the stairs, and the door shut afterwards—I saw him come down and open the door, and he came and spoke to Mrs. Roberts—he pulled out a piece of something white while he was speaking to her—he had a dark frock coat on—I saw Mrs. Harris come home afterwards—I had seen nobody go into the house from the time Mrs. Harris went away to the time Mrs. Roberts went to tell Mrs. Fox, besides Blackson.

Cross-examined. Q. Did you see Blackson go up to Mrs. Roberts at the street door about three o'clock? A. He came up to the door, and she was then at the door, but he did not speak to her—he was walking about—he turned back, and went towards Church-street after that, but he came by my shop and went over into Mrs. Harris's house—I saw him go in slyly—I was a short space of time observing him—I was not noticing the time—I had no suspicion of him—I do not know how long I had been observing him—it might be ten minutes.





LYDIA REEVES
. I am the wife of Thomas Reeves of Devonshire-street, Lisson-grove. I know the female prisoner—I have seen her frequently at the time she lived at Mrs. Harris's, and she afterwards lived for a fortnight at No. 5, Charles-street—I understand she lived there with Blackson—she sent for me about half-past one o'clock on Whit Monday, to know if I would wash for her on the Tuesday—Walker lived in the front room, first floor of of the same house—he is married—Chambers lived in the back room—I

swept her room out that day, and the front room, and while I was sweeping she said she had some thoughts of going to Greenwich if she had any luck—while I was in the back room with Chambers, Blackson and Walker came in—it was a little after three o'clock—they ran up stairs together, and went into the front room, which is Walker's, and Chambers went into the room to them—I heard them talking and laughing together, but did not hear what they said—they did not stay there many minutes—I saw them go down again—I am sure it was them—a few minutes afterwards I was in Walker's room, and Blackson came up again and changed a coat—he took off a large dark frock coat—Chambers went to her own room—Blackson followed her, and staid there about five minutes, and then went away—I did not look at the clock when he went—I looked at it when I left there and got home—it was then near four o'clock—I went to Chambers next day to wash—I went into Walker's room for some soap, and heard Walker's wife tell him he had no business to tell Rose how much money they had, for she was a b——deceitful b—and there was no bottom to her—he said, he could buy them at any time for a quartern of gin, fourpence would buy them—I heard this at the door—I knocked at the door then, and Walker's wife gave me the money to get the soap—after this Mrs. Walker came down and asked me to go up to tea with her and her husband, which I did—Rose and Blackson came in and sat down to tea with us—I saw some new trowsers and a new gown piece in Chambers's room—it was a pink plaid.

Cross-examined. Q. Have you always said you saw the trowsers? A. That was what I saw—they were not quite finished, and they were unmade dresses—I told Rose that I should not have had tea there, but she took my bonnet and shawl, and locked them in—Walker's wife was trimming a bonnet—I did not mention that before the Magistrate, as I was not asked about it—I looked at Rose's clock when the prisoners went away—I cannot exactly say the time—it was near four o'clock—about half-past three o'clock—I cannot say whether I ever said it was a little after three o'clock.
(The witness's deposition being read, stated it to be a little after three o'clock when Blackson left, and contained nothing of having observed the trowsers.)





THOMAS LEE
. I am an apprentice to Mr. Walker, a linen-draper, in Oxford-street. On Whit Monday, between five and six o'clock in the evening, Blackson and Walker came to our shop, and bought two cotton dresses—one was a pink plaid—they each changed a sovereign, and received change.





WILLIAM CUMMING
. I am a policeman. On the afternoon of Whit Monday I was called into Mrs. Harris's house, when the alarm was given—I saw the drawer, and examined the door—there were no marks of violence on the door—I went on the Wednesday with Mrs. Harris and Mrs. Roberts to No. 5, Charles-street, Lisson-grove, which is about a quarter of a mile from Mrs. Harris's—in the first-floor front room I found the prisoners, Blackson and Walker, and two young women—I asked Mrs. Roberts, which was the young man she had seen in the house that day—she pointed Blakson out, and I took him into custody, and told him he was my prisoner—he asked what for—I said, about stealing a £5 note, seven sovereigns, and other articles—he said he never heard tell of such a thing in his life—I saw a pair of quite new boots there, and asked whose they were—Blackson said they were his—I found none of the stolen property—Walker was also taken—I afterwards took Chambers, and found 1l. 10s. in gold, and 16s. 6d. in silver, in a small box in her room, and 3d.

in a table drawer in the room where she was, (the first-floor back room)—I also found a key which had been newly filed—I applied it to Mrs. Harris's door, and found it opened and locked it—on the Friday night following I went into the same room, and found this gown piece in a box belonging to Chambers—I had searched the same box before, and she then said it was her box—Davey was with me.

Cross-examined. Q. Had you not Chambers in custody at the time you found it? A. I had—I searched the box the day I took her, but I was not looking for a gown then, but a silver tea-spoon and watch—the gown-piece might have been there and I not notice it, as there were sheets and different things in a lump together.

COURT. Q. Did you try the key of the door to Chamber's room? A. Yes—it unlocked her door—I found a black frock coat on the Saturday night in Chambers's bed.





WILLIAM DAVEY
. I am a policeman. I went on the 17th to No. 5, Charles-street, with Cumming, and took Walker into custody—I searched the room, and found two chisels, two files, part of a centre-bit, a hand-vice, a screw-driver, ten duplicates, and a pick-lock key, in a small box, in Walker's room—I applied the chisels to the marks in the drawers which I found at Mrs. Harris's, and they corresponded exactly—one chisel was smaller than the other, and there were marks of both.





THOMAS LEE

MRS. REEVES. This is the gown-piece I saw.

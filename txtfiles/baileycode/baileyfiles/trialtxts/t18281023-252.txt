JAMES KEMP. I am coachman
 to Mr. Stevens, of Brighton. I lost the articles stated in the indictment from Regency-square, Brighton


, at the back of the mews, on the morning of the 28th of September, or the night before - some were in the stable, and part in my bed-room; I saw the prisoner in the room that morning - he had been working in the stables, and was going to assist me - he left that morning, about five o'clock, and about ten I missed my property; I could not find him.
- HART. I am an officer of Upper Tooting. I apprehended the prisoner in Wardour-street; I had come to town with Pleasant. I found part of the property at his lodging, No. 32, Wardour-street; his wife was in the room - we were watching for him there from half-past eleven to half-past one o'clock, and then saw him coming up the street; Pleasant said, "This is him;" he turned down a passage - I ran, and collared him; he said, "Is that you, Pleasant?' I found at his lodging three white handkerchiefs and other things.

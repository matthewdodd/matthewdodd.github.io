            . On the 15th of last month, about two in the morning, I met the prisoner with the tilt upon his shoulder; I asked him what he had got there. He said it was a tilt belonging to Mr. Norman at Execution-Dock, where he work'd. I took him and that to the watch-house, and looking upon it I found it belong'd to the prosecutor. (Produced in court, and deposed to by the prosecutor and Simkins.)
Prisoner's Defence.
I am a fellowship porter
. I went to do a chare for myself, and in the necessary house, belonging to the Customhouse, I found this tilt; there being nobody by I took it to carry home.

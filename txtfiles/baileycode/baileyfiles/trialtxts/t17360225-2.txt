            , was indicted for 


               privately stealing 20 lb. of Sugar, value 4s.
             the Goods of Persons unknown, the 24th of January
 last, in the Parish of St. Botolph Billingsgate

            . I saw a Man, January the 24th come down the Stairs of a Ware-house in an Alley on Cox's Key


, and the Prisoner followed him, with something ty'd up in his Apron: I took him by the Collar, and he endeavouring to get from me, dragg'd me to the top of the Alley. I called for Assistance, and we took 20 lb. of Sugar upon him. Upon searching the Ware-house, we found a Door open in the Garret, and the Head of a Hogshead of Sugar taken out; we weigh'd the Goods, and found half a Hundred, and 22lb. missing; we compared what we took upon the Prisoner, with that in the Hogshead, and it answered directly.


                  John 
                  Davis 
               



            . Upon Mr. Broad's calling out, I went to assist him; and took the Prisoner with this Sugar upon him; we secured him, and found the Hogshead broke, from whence the Sugar was taken.
The Prisoner in his Defence, said, the Man that got off, employ'd him to carry the Sugar out of the Alley, and was to give him a Pot of Beer; but could not give any account of him. 


               Guilty 10d.

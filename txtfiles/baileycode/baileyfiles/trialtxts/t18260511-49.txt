            . I am the wife of James Evans - he has gone abroad in the East India Company's service
; I live in Charlotte-court, Strand


. The prisoner came to lodge with me - she was with me nine days; she owed me nothing for rent. I left home on the 9th of April, from twelve till four o'clock; when I came back I saw a bundle under the table, but I took no notice of it. After she had her tea she took the bundle, and put it under the bed; she went out about eight o'clock, and returned about half-past ten; she then had this pin in her bosom, and said she found it in the Strand. I searched my box, and missed several things; I found this petticoat in her possession. I asked her to go with me, but she refused, because it was late. Mr. Hughes, of Bow-street, went with me, with a warrant, to search her box; I never lent her any thing. I swear the pin is mine - these things were found in the prisoner's box, which was locked up, and she took the key to the watch-house.(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. All these things are my own.
PROSECUTRIX. Every thing is mine - both the petticoats are my own making.

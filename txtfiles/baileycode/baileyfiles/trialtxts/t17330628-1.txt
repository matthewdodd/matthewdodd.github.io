.
Cornelins Herbert. The Prisoner came to my Shop on London-Bridge


, and desired to see some weighty Gold-Rings. I shew'd him two that were very heavy. He seem'd to be well pleas'd with them, and call'd for Pen and Ink to set down the Weight and Value. I began to suspect that he wanted to make off, and I happen'd to think right, for he took up the two Rings and ran out; I follow'd, as well as the Gout would let me, and cry'd, Stop Thief! He was soon seiz'd, and when I came up to him he had the two Rings in his Hand, and I took them out my self.
Prisoner. I had bought a Rings of the Prosecutor some time before, and I afterwards found that he had charged me 5 s. more than they were worth, and so because I would not be cheated again, I took these two Rings to shew to a Friend before I paid for them.
Mr. Herbert. I don't know that I ever saw him before. 


               Guilty 4 s. 10 d.

JOSEPH HOLDING
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
12th of February, 1 coat, value 10s., the goods of 



Daniel Robert Law.






ROBERT PURSER
. I am a pawnbroker, and live at Limehouse-causeway. On. the 12th of February the prisoner offered this great-coat in pledge—I asked him whose it was—he said it was his brother's, who was about his own size—I saw it was too large for a person near his size, and said I

should keep it till he fetched his mother—he brought a person who I knew did not know any thing about him—I stopped the prisoner, and the coat too.





JOHN SIMPSON
 (police-sergeant K 25.) I retook the prisoner—he said he had suffered for it once before, and he ought to be let go—he had been remanded before.





DANIEL ROBERT LAW
. I live in Church-lane, Limehouse. This coat is mine—I lost it in the forenoon, on the 12th of February, from a lathshed in a timber-yard—it was hanging up on the left-hand side—the yard is enclosed, and no persons but those who work there have a right to be there.

Prisoner's Defence. I had it given me by a lad to pawn.




GUILTY
.* Aged 17.—


Transported for Seven Years.

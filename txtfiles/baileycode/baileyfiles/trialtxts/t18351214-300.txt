WILLIAM REAL
. I am a sawyer, and live at Mr. Langton's timber-yard, Narrow-wall. I lost a saw, on the 4th of November, from that yard—I was at work with it all that evening—I left it under the roof of the sawpit—I returned the next morning, as soon as it was light, and missed it—I found it at the pawnbroker's—I do not know the prisoner—this is the saw—It cost me 29s. when new.





HENRY GARROD
. I live at No. 51, Charlotte-terrace, Lambeth. On the

4th of November, I took this saw in pledge from the prisoner, in the name of James Turner—I am sure it was James.





WILLIAM TURNER
. I was standing before Mr. Hickinbotham's shop, on the 4th of November, and saw the prisoner take the saw to pawn—I am no relation of his.





STEPHEN WARLEY
. (police-constable L 121.) I took the prisoner into custody, and produce the saw.





WILLIAM DRIVER

Prisoner's Defence. I pledged the saw and a copper glue-pot—on the 6th I went to get it out, and I had not got sufficient money—this is the ticket he gave me—he put a wrong name on my ticket—I had not sufficient money to get the things out, and left some articles for them—this is the hand-writing on the ticket.

MONTAGUE GROVER
. I live in Wells-street, Gray's-inn-road. On the afternoon of the 28th of May, I was in High-street, St. Giles's, about half-past five o'clock—I felt a pull at my pocket, turned round, and observed my handkerchief in the prisoner's hand—he was about three yards from me, handing it to another person—I immediately seized him—he said, "Here is your handkerchief," and gave it to me—he got from me, and ran into Denmark-street—I did not lose sight of him for above two minutes; he ran behind an omnibus, and I seized him—he begged me to let him go saying, I had got my handkerchief again—I gave him in charge—it could not have fallen out of my pocket.





ROBERT CULVER
 (police Constable F 95.) I was on duty in High-street, St. Giles's—in consequence of information, I went to Denmark-street, and saw the prosecutor holding the prisoner—I took him in charge.




GUILTY

            . I lost some halfpence, and there was nobody near but the prisoner, who was in the next room; he is an apprentice to a rugmaker
, his master was then at our house; the halfpence were in my bar in a wooden dish (I keep a publick house
) I do not know who took them, but we have found such a quantity, which the prisoner confessed he took, (produced in court.) He said he took them by the persuasion of a woman.
Q How many did he confess he took?
Gaul. I charged him with taking some, and he said he had, but did not name what number.

            . I am the boy's master; the boy confessed he took about three shillings worth of half-pence, and that they were lodged at the next door.
Q. How old is he?
Cook. He is about sixteen years of age; he has been with me about three years, and always behaved well before.

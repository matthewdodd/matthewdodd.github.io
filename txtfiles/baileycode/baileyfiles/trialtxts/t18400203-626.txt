 for stealing, on the

JOHN HALL
. My partner's name is Samuel Hall—we live at No. 3, Leadenhall-street. We had a piece of kerseymere, which was safe on the evening of the 31st of January—I saw it lying exposed on the side Counter, within two yards of the door—I and my brother went to tea, leaving the shop with the porter or errand-boy—I can identify the cloth, which was found on the prisoner's person.





THOMAS PEARSON
. I am errand-boy to the prosecutors. I saw the prisoner come into the shop on Friday evening, the 31st of January—he took the cloth off the side counter, and ran off with it—I ran after him, caught him, and brought him and the cloth, which was on him, back to the shop—a policeman was sent for.

Prisoner. I was compelled by necessity to do it.





JAMES TRIMMER
 (City police-constable, No. 458.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction—(read)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 24.—


Transported for Seven Years.

JOSEPH CHAFFE. On the 23rd of August I lodged in Upper Charlotte-street, Fitzroy-square


, in the house of Joseph Ingram. My watch hung by the side of the mantel-piece, in my own room, on the second floor - I went out about eight o'clock in the morning, leaving my wife at home; I returned in the evening, and it was gone - I went next morning with my wife in search of the prisoner, and found her, after much inquiry, crossing Foley-street; I did not know her, but my wife said, "That's her;" I crossed over, and charged her with stealing my watch - she denied it several times, and I said if she would tell all about it, I would forgive her.

            . I live at No. 12, Charlotte-street, Fitzroy-square - I have known the prisoner by sight for about six months. On the 23rd of August I saw her at the corner of Little Ogle-street, talking to a woman - she asked if I was out of work; I said Yes, and asked who that young woman was - she said it was a young woman who was going to pawn a watch for her; she then asked if I wanted to buy one - I said No, but I dare say I could sell it, and asked where she got it; she said a gentleman gave it to her for sleeping with her all night, as he had no money - this was about half-past eight o'clock in the morning; I asked to look at it - she said she would go home and fetch it, and meet me in half an hour; I met her in about three quarters of an hour, at the corner of Riding-house-lane - she gave it to me; I told her I had but 11s. about me, which I gave her, and asked what she wanted for it - she said she did not know how much; I said I would give her 3l. 10s. for it, and pay the rest by instalments - I gave her half a sovereign and a shilling; she asked if I would have any drink - I had half a glass of grog; she gave me 2s. to keep for her, and I left her with the young woman - she said she was going to the play, and I went with her that night; I was never in her company before, but knew her by passing her of a morning as I went to work - I gave the watch to the prosecutor's wife.

            . I am an officer. I received the watch from the inspector of my division.

            . This is my watch, and cost me 7l. 7s. three or four years ago.

            . I believe this to be the watch I had from her; it was in my possession two days.
The prisoner handed in a Written paper, stating that lane had taken the watch for her, she having informed him it had been given her by a gentleman, and that he had pretended to her that he had sold it to a Jew for 11s.




               GUILTY of stealing to the value of 99s. only
            . Aged 18.




               Transported for Seven Years
            .
Before Mr. Justice Alderson.

ELIZA IRONS
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
5th of October, one £5 Bank-note, the property of 



Henry Hammond, her master.






HARRIET HAMMOND
. I am the wife of Henry Hammond, a glasscutter, in Smith-street, Chelsea. The prisoner was our servant of all-work for five weeks—I gave her this note on the afternoon of the 5th of October, to get change—she returned with it and said she could have change in two or three hours—she came for it again afterwards and I gave it her—she went away, and I did not see her again till she was in custody—I had hired her by the month—she took her clothes away with her.





JAMES MOORE
. I am servant at the Phœnix, at Chelsea. The prisoner came for change, and we refused it—she went away with the note—we did not promise to give it her afterwards.

Prisoner's Defence. She sent me for some gin, and they could not give me change—she then sent me again—I was looking at the note and a man came and snatched it out of my hand, and before I could get assistance he was gone.




GUILTY
—Aged 28.—


Transported for Fourteen Years.

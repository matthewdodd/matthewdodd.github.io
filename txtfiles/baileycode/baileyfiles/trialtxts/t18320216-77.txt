            . I am a cheesemonger
, and live in High-street, Shoreditch


. On the 18th of January I went from my parlour, and saw the prisoner come up to my shop-board, and take something from my window; I ordered my servant to run out - he went out, and the officer was pursuing the prisoner with the cheese; the prisoner was taken to the station, and the cheese was brought back to me - I have no doubt it was mine.

            . I was in the Police at that time. I saw the prisoner in company with Wilkins and another, loitering about the shop - the prisoner and Wilkins then went to the window; Dean reached in, and took this cheese out of the window, which was thrown open - he ran off; I pursued him, and just as I got up to him he threw the cheese at my feet - I called Stop thief! and another officer took him.

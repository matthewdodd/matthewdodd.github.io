On the 3rd of April, about half-past four o'clock, the prisoner came into my shop, took this pair of shoes off the shelf, and walked off—I walked after him, and overtook him about two doors off with them—he said he was going to wear them—these are them—(looking at them.)

Prisoner. Another boy came by me, and dropped them close by me.

Witness. There was no other boy—he came in, looked about him, and took them from the shelf—he did not see me.

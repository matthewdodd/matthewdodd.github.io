            . I was coming up Fish-street-hill


 on the 24th of April, about nine in the evening; about seven or eight yards above the Monument, I felt something at my pocket; I turned my head, and saw the lad at the bar have hold of my handkerchief; I catched hold of the other part of it, he ran holding one end of it in his hand, and I the other; at last I with my stick knocked him down, then he hallooed out murder.

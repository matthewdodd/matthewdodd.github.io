JAMES ADAMS
. I am a picture-dealer. I was in the picture-shop of Mr. Deane—the prisoner came in, and offered the picture to me for 3s.—he said he bought it of a boy for 1s. 6d.—I knew it belonged to some dealer, and I went round to find the owner.





CHARLOTTE CORSBY
. I am a daughter of George Corsby, a musical instrument maker, in Princes-street, Leicester-square. This is his picture—I saw it last on the 18th of July, in the morning, inside the shop—I do not know the prisoner.





COLIN FORBES
. I am a policeman. I took the prisoner into custody.

Prisoner's Defence. I purchased the painting of a lad in the street for 1s. 6d., without the least idea it was stolen—there is no proof of my having stolen it, or that I was in the prosecutor's shop—on my being questioned, I said I bought it, but I was not aware where the boy was to be found—this is the first time I have been in confinement—my character has been good.




GUILTY
.* Aged 17.—


Transported for Seven Years.

            . I am independent. On the 9th of September, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, I was in Cavendish-square


 - I felt my handkerchief go from my pocket; I turned, and saw the prisoner with it, in the act of throwing it behind him - I took him to the office; two other boys ran across the square - he said they took it, but I think they were not near enough.

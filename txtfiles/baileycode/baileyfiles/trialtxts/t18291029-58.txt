PRISCILLA WOODWARD. I am the wife of Samuel Woodward, of Galway-street


, tinman
; the prisoner lodged at our house. On the 13th of October I saw him come out of the parlour - there was nobody in the room; I had been up stairs; he gave me some linen to wash for him, and immediately went out - I went into the parlour within a minute, and missed the watch within ten minutes, before I left the room again; I had seen it safe a quarter of an hour before - I did not know whether my husband had taken it; the prisoner did not come in till one o'clock that morning; I let him go into his bed-room, then got an officer, who took him; he then said he would make the watch good if we would not prosecute.

            . I am a constable. I was fetched to Woodward's at three o'clock in the morning, and took the prisoner; the prosecutrix said she only wished to have her property, and in consequence of what he said I went and found it at Baylis'.

            , Mar. 1
.
W. Roberts On Monday, the 1st of March, I was at the Globe in Whitechapel, I staid there till about 9 o'Clock at Night, and then designed to go home directly; I went through Aldgate, came up Leadenhall-street, that Side the India-house is of, and saw very few Persons; but by St Peter's Church, the Corner of Gracechurch-street


, I found my self immediately in a Crowd of People, I believe four or five before me, and one or two just at my Heels. I had not gone far before two or three cross'd me, and the first run, I believe he had an Eye upon the Chain of my Watch, and got the Watch, then he cry'd, Hallow, and they all run away, down Gracechurch-street ; I immediately put my Hand to my Pocket, and said, 'tis gone, 'tis in vain to go after them; I then told the People. I had a Mischance, and lost my Watch: I look'd into the Papers to see if it were advertised, and not finding that, in a few Days I advertised it my self, and then a Person came to me, (I think it was Tuesday was Seven-Night ) and said, he believed there was a Man in the Poultry-Compter could tell me something of it; I went there, and 
               
                  William 
                  Cavenagh 
               



             asked me, if I had not a Leek in my Hat, in such a Place, the 1st of March, and whether I was not robb'd of my Watch? I said, Yes: Upon which I asked him, if he could not procure me my Watch again? He said, he would endeavour to procure me my Watch; he said, he was the Man that took it from me. The Watch is in Court. This is the Watch.
Prisoner. I never saw the Man in my Life. - This vile Villain will swear away my Life.

            . On Monday, the 1st of March, the Prisoner at the Bar, and one 
               
                  William 
                  Bryers 
               



            , and my self, went out with an Intent to rob any Person, that we could conveniently: We went from Rag-Fair, and between 9 and 10 at Night, in Cornhill, we met this Gentleman, Mr Roberts. The Prisoner at the Bar, and W. Bryers passed him, and when I saw him, I turned back from him, and walked before him; then they turned round and seized his Arms, and kept him that he could not go any farther, then I turn'd round and came up to his Face, and took his Watch out of his Pocket, the Watch which is now produced, is the same Watch I took from him, we run down Gracechurch-street immediately; we sold the Watch jointly, to one Jack the Sailor, who is now in Newgate, and he sold it to the Person I got it of; we sold it for two Guineas, and divided the Money.
Prisoner. My Lord, this vile Rogue is only going to swear my Life away to save his own, and there is Evidence against him now, at this Time; and when I was carried to Woodstreet-Compter, to him, he said, he would not hurt a Hair of my Head; but he only did it to make his Information stronger than the others. 


               Guilty 10 d.

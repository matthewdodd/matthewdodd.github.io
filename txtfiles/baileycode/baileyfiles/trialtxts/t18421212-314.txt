.* Aged 14.—


Transported for Seven Years.






WILLIAM TINDALL
. I live in High-street, Wapping. On the 2nd of Dec, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, I was in the parlour—my son called me—I went into the shop—M'Allister was there—he had four papers of halfpence—he laid them on the counter—I gave him a shaking, and sent him away—I then missed a fifth paper of halfpence—I sent my son after him—he went to the bridge, and brought both the prisoners back to my parlour—my son said, "Williams has got some halfpence in his pocket"—I desired Williams to put them on the table, which he did, and there were 5s. worth, but they were not in a paper then—I asked how he came by them—he said he had been playing at marbles in the court, and M'Allister came and threw the package of halfpence down; he picked them up, and put them into his pocket.





HENRY TINDALL
. I saw M'Allister in our bar, coming round from behind our counter, with four bundles of halfpence in his arms—he had no business there—I saw Williams, who was outside, looking round the door-post, when M'Allister came from behind the counter—I then went after them, took them, and brought them back.





KENNEDY O'BRIEN
 (police-constable H 151.) I took the prisoners.

Williams's Defence. I was playing at marbles; M'Allister ran down the court, and threw the halfpence down; I picked them up; he wanted me to

give him some; I would not; then this man came; I was not at the door, it was another boy with a straw hat, who ran down the court with M'Allister.

WILLIAMS—


GUILTY
. Aged 16.—



Confined Two Months.

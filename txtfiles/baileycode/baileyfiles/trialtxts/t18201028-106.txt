            . On the 25th of October, I was coming up Knightsbridge


, and exactly at the barrack-gate, I was hustled by eight or ten men; I disengaged myself from them with difficulty, and missed my watch. In about three minutes a soldier brought the prisoner up, and said he saw him take the watch from my fob. I am certain he was one of them.

            . I am a soldier. I was at the barrack-gate looking at a procession, saw Mr. Vardon surrounded, and saw the prisoner take the watch from his pocket. I secured him a very few yards off, and saw him take the watch from the flap of his breeches. As I was scuffling with him another came up, forced his hand through and received it of him. I secured him also, but let him go again.

            . I am a patrol of Bow-street. I took the prisoner in charge.

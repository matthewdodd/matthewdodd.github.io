            , he lives at Newington


; I have known the prisoner ever since he was three years of age - he has visited at our house - he is not related to us; I don't think he had done any thing; but his father is a wine merchant; on the 19th of September, he came to our house about three o'clock, and said Mr. Gale had sent him to wait there till five o'clock; he was hown into the parlour - I went down and staid there ten minutes or a quarter of an hour - I then went out of the room - I heard him walk across the room, and go out at the door; I then went into the parlour, and missed the property sated from the sideboard in the parlour - I gave information directly.

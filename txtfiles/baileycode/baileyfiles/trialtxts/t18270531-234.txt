            . On the 1st of May, Mr. Wilkinson informed me of this lead being taken - I went to Queen-square, and saw Phillips, who produced some lead, which I compared with the gutter - it matched exactly with the small pieces which are left - it appeared fresh cut.

            . I am an officer. On the 26th of April I found the prisoner going along Duck-lane with this lead - I asked what he had got; he said, "Some tools;" I felt it - he then said, "You know what I have got, take me;" I took him - he told me he found it in Horseferry-road, at the watch-house - he was remanded, and I found the prosecutor - I saw it compared with his house - it fitted exactly.

            . I live in Dyer's-buildings, Holborn. On the 2d of October, about half-past eleven o'clock at night, I met the prisoner at the bottom of Chancery-lane; she asked if I was going home; I said, Yes, and suffered her to have my arm as far as Castle-street. I refused to go home with her. She left me suddenly. I put my hand to my watch pocket, and found I was robbed of this money. I found her at the end of Barlett's-buildings - she wished to get away. I gave her in charge, and in her stocking the two sovereigns and a half were found - the half-sovereign was quite new, which I had observed before.

            . I searched the prisoner, and found three half-crowns, two shillings, and two sixpences - the two sovereigns and a half fell out of her stockings; she then fell on her knees and begged pardon. She had denied having any gold.

            , were indicted for 


               feloniously stealing, on the 16th of January
, 8 pieces of wood, value 14s.
            , the goods of 
               
                  
                     John 
                     Butler
                  




               
            .
MR. DOANE conducted the Prosecution.


                  JOHN 
                  BUTLER
               



            . I am a gentleman
 - I have a number of houses in St. John-street, Bethnal-green


 - I was pulling down some - on the morning of the 16th of January I went there, and missed about 5l.'s worth of old wood - I went to Cooper's house the same afternoon, and saw eight pieces of wood which I could swear to.


                  JOHN 
                  COOPER
               



            . I live in James-street, Bethnal-green, and deal in old building materials - on the 16th of January the three prisoners came to me about nine o'clock in the morning - they asked me to buy some wood - James Clark said it was on a piece of ground opposite my house - I had seen him and Dorrington carrying some wood, and they turned toward that place - I looked at the wood; there were eight pieces - I agreed to give 7s. for it, but did not pay them then - they went away, and came again in the afternoon; but I had then been taken, and the prisoners were brought to the station-house.

Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. You did not give Mr. Butler information? A. No; he came and had me apprehended close to my own premises - 7s. was what they asked for the wood - I considered it was the outside value of it - I was taken before the magistrate, but not sent to gaol - I was deceived, by knowing Clarke's father to be an honest man - 
               
                  James 
                  Clarke
               



             made the bargain - it was bad old wood - it would hardly burn - there might be 7 cwt. of it.


                  WILLIAM 
                  SABOURIN
               



            . I am a rent collector, and live in Thomas-street, Brick-lane - on the 16th of January, I saw 
               
                  George 
                  Clarke
               



            , about half-past seven o'clock in the morning, turning into Edward-street, going in a direction towards Cooper's, with a piece of wood on his shoulder - I have seen that piece of wood twice since.


                  JOHN 
                  WORSFOLD
               



            . I live in Edward-court, Bethnalgreen - on the morning of the 16th of January, I was in Edward-street - I saw Dorrington about seven o'clock with a piece of timber on his shoulder, which was broken at one end - this is it - he was going towards Cooper's - I afterwards saw 
               
                  George 
                  Clarke
               



             with a piece of wood, but I could not swear to that.
Cross-examined. Q. Did you speak to Dorrington? A. No - I had seen him before.


                  JARVIS 
                  GIBSON
               



            . On the 15th of January, I was working at the house, No. 36, St. John-street - the two Clarkes lived there, and were removing from the premises; and Dorrington was assisting them - I went to work there the next morning, and found three pieces of timber in the backroom, which had not been there the night before - the three prisoners came in about an hour, and carried them away - these are the pieces - they came back again, and abused me - Dorrington said, "You have seen Mr. Butler, and nosed all you know" - James Clarke used the same sort of language, and pulled off his coat to fight me.
Cross-examined. Q. How long is it since you was in gaol yourself? It is five years ago - it was for spending half-a-crown of my master's.


                  TIMOTHY 
                  DONOVAN
               



            . I was working at the house - I saw the prisoners moving on the 15th of January, and the next morning I found three pieces of wood in the backroom - I saw the prisoners carry them away.
Cross-examined. Do not you know that Dorrington was helping Clarke to move? Yes.

                  GREEN
               



             (Police-constable H 61). I took 
               
                  James 
                  Clark
               



            , on the evening of the 16th of January - he said he knew nothing about any wood - I took the prisoner 
               
                  George 
                  Clarke
               



             afterwards - he said he knew nothing of it.


                  JOHN 
                  BUTLER
               



            . This is my wood.
Cross-examined. Q. Had you noticed it? A. Yes; the night before - some of it is window sills, and some garden - I could swear to them if they were a hundred miles off - seven hundred-weight of this would be worth 12s. or 14s.

DANIEL LYNCH
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
18th of August, 1 hamper, value 10d.; and 1 bottle, value 4s.; the goods of 



Mary Ilsley and another.






GEORGE JOHN RESTIEAUX
 (police-constable E 49.) On the morning of the 18th of August I saw the prisoner in Bainbridge-street, behind the Maidenhead wagon—he cut this hamper from under the tail-board—it fell to the ground—he ran up Jones's-court with it—he saw me in the court, then turned and ran down Bainbridge-street, down some turnings, where I lost him—the direction on the hamper is, "J. Baker, Maidenhead"—it contained this bottle, with a direction to Foulcher's distillery—I knew the prisoner before.

Prisoner. Q. What time was it? A. A quarter before three o'clock in the morning—there was no thoroughfare in the court where I was—you ran in front of me, and then you went up Bainbridge-street, and on to Church-street into a house, and escaped.





JOSEPH TOWLEY
. I live at Maidenhead, and am wagoner to Mary and John Ilsley. I was driving the wagon to London on the morning of the 18th of August—I saw the hamper safe in Oxford-street—I went on to Holborn, and then missed it—it was directed "John Baker, Maiden-head"—this is it—it is a bottle in which they put distilled spirits.





JAMES TILBE
. I am cooper to George and Henry Foulcher of Osborn-street. This bottle is theirs, and is worth 5*.—it belongs to the customer till it is returned—it had had spirits in it.

Prisoner. I know nothing of it.

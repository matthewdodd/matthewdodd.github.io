            . I am an umbrella-maker
, and an agent for the sale of Birmingham goods. I have a customer named Angel; the prisoner was employed as a daily porter
 by me - he used to carry out goods, and receive money, for which he was to account on his return; he kept no books, but was to hand me the money when he came back.

            . The prisoner took out these goods, but never brought the money to me; I think it was on a Wednesday - I expected him to return the same evening, but I never saw him till I took him into custody on the Saturday.

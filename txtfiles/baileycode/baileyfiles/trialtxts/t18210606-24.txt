            . I live at Deptford


. The prisoner came to me on the 28th of April, he engaged for a week's lodging, and slept there. On the 29th, the next morning, in consequence of information, I went in pursuit of him, and overtook him at Shadwell - I found my handkerchief round his neck. I also lost a shirt, which I have not recovered.

            . I missed the shirt and handkerchief; the prisoner was gone in the morning; he had asked me to go to Greenwich with him to receive two years pension, and while I was getting ready I missed them, and he was gone. I know the handkerchief, I had hemmed it myself, with ravelings, and the colour is faded in the middle.
- WALKER. I have been a weaveress; this handkerchief is hemmed with sewing silk, and not ravelings - ravelings are much finer.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

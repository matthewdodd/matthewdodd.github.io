            . I am a glass-cutter
, and live in Golden-lane. On the morning of the 25th of May I was watching some buildings; I fell asleep, and at ten minutes after three o'clock the watchman came and awoke me - I saw a hat by my side; I got up, found my own new hat was gone, and an old one left in its place - I had only had mine one week, and gave 5s. for it; this is it.
WILLIAM FINCH. I am a watchman. I saw the witness asleep on the morning of the 25th of May, at a quarter before three o'clock; he had a good hat on his head - I went down the lane, came up again, and saw him asleep, with an old hat lying by his side; I told him of it - I took the prisoner the next day; he offered me 5s. not to take him, and said he had a wife and two children.
WILLIAM SMITH. On the 25th of May my brother-in-law came to me, and said he had lost his bat; I said,"This old hat belongs to Bill Bucker," which is a name the prisoner goes by - I have seen him with it frequently.
ROBERT LOCK. The prisoner was given to me the next day, at the office door; he said the hat he had on was his own, but we sent for the prosecutor, who claimed it.(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. That hat does not belong to him.

            . I live at Enfield. On Friday, the 13th of May, about two o'clock in the afternoon, I was passing over Blackfriars-bridge


, and felt a snatch at my pocket - I put my hand to my coat, turned round, and saw the prisoner walking leisurely behind me, alone, dressed in a butcher's apron; I collared him, removed the apron, and found my handkerchief concealed under it - I am certain it is mine - I gave him in charge.

MICHAEL HARNETT. I am an officer. I received him in charge.(Property produced and sworn to.)

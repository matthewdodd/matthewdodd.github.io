GEORGE LINGWOOD
 was indicted

 for stealing 81lbs. of lead, value 12s., the goods of 



Mary Conaway, being fixed to a certain building; and that he had been before convicted of felony. 2nd COUNT, not stating it to be fixed.






PETER MASSEY
. I live in Drum-lane, Old Brentford. I know the prisoner—on the 7th of April, about nine o'clock, I saw him taking up some lead out of a gutter, on an out-house near Mr. Coster's, who keeps the Drum public-house—the prisoner was rolling the lead up—I went and told Mr. Coster—this is the lead.





RICHARD DOUGLAS COSTER
. I keep the Drum public-house—this out-house belongs to Mr. Conaway—I was sitting in my bar, and Massey came in and said there was a thief outside the house—I went out and saw the prisoner coming down—I struck at him—he got over the shed, and a man stopped him—he had been very tipsy all day.

Prisoner. I was not in your yard all the day. Witness. I told you to go home, and get sober.





HENRY CONAWAY
. This lead is the property of my mother, Mary Conaway—she is the tenant of the property—it belongs to the crown.





JOHN HADDON
. (police-serjeant T 18.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction at this Court—(read—Convicted 3rd Feb. 1845, and confined four months)—the prisoner is the man—he has been associated with bad characters ever since.




GUILTY
. Aged 34.—


Transported for Seven Years.

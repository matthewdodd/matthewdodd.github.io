            . I live in Lincolnshire. On the 11th of October, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, I was opposite St. Giles's church


, going towards Oxford-street, and felt my silk handkerchief taken out of my outside coat pocket, turned round, and saw the prisoner, who set off running, and I after him. I lost sight of him for two or three minutes, and before he was stopped saw him drop the handkerchief - he was alone. It was given to the constable, who returned it to me.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

            . I was servant to a grocer, but am out of place. I was walking with Mr. Watson, and saw the prisoner take the handkerchief from his pocket - I followed him, and saw him drop it; he ran through a public-house - I pursued, and never lost sight of him. An officer came up, and took him.
Prisoner. I beg for mercy.

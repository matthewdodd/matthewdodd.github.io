JOSEPH HESTER. I am a boot and shoemaker
, and live in Crown-street, Finsbury


. On the 24th of August, about two o'clock, the prisoner and another came into my shop to buy a pair of shoes; several pairs fitted them, but they objected to them - the other went out, and just as the prisoner was going out, I stopped her, and asked what she was going to do with the boots she had got, as I missed two pairs off a rail; I found one pair under her arm, under her shawl - she said she was going to pay for them- she had before denied having them; I have not found the other pair.

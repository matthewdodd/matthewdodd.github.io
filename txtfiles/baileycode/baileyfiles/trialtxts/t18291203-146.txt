            . I am servant to Mr. Hambrook. On the 21st of November I saw the two prisoners at the corner of Gainsford-place; I took twelve pint pots and one quart from them - I had tied the pots up against a rail, and when I came back I saw Turner untie the string, Batchelor took up his apron, and tooks the pots in - they bolted away together; they are all my master's pots except one - I know nothing of the prisoners.

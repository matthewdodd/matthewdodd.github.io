WILLIAM JAMES DAVIS
. I am shopman to Mr. Thomas Jerome, of Bishopsgate-street. At half-past eight o'clock in the morning of the 20th of June saw the prisoner near the shop—the jacket and trowsers hung outside the door—I asked her to walk in—she stooped down, and they dropped from under her clothes—I am certain of that.

Prisoner. He speaks quiet false—there was an omnibus going by—I was standing by the window—I had some halfpence in my hand, and dropped some—he came to me an said, "What have you got there?"—I said, "Nothing"—I went two or three steps away, and then he came and brought me back—if I knocked them down I did not know it—but I had not got them. Witness. I am sure they fell from her person under her feet—she was just outside, not inside, when they dropped from her—they had been hanging across a bar at the door—she was not a step from where they hung—I was close by her—I had missed them before I accused her, and they were not on the ground then.

Transported for Seven Years.

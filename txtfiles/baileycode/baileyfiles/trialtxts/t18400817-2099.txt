WILLIAM TRENTER
. I live in Oxford-street. On the morning of the 6th of August, about half-past nine o'clock, I was in Mr. Stockley's shop, and observed the prisoner at the window endeavouring to secrete some books—I watched him for half an hour, and saw him collect four particular books that would fit his hat—he put them into his hat, put his handkerchief over them, and put it on—I ran out—he threw the books out of his hat—two fell on the stall and two on the ground—I followed and collared his—he said, "What did you strike me for? I have none of your books"—in the struggle my fist went in his face—I took them up—these are them—(produced.)





GILKES STOCKLEY
 These are my books.

Prisoner's Defence. I stopped to look at the stall—I had my handkerchief in one hand and the books in another—he came out and hit me is the mouth—the books were never in my hat.




GUILTY
.* Aged 25.—


Transported for Seven Years.

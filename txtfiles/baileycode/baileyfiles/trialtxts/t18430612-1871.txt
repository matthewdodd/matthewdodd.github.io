1871. 




WILLIAM ATKINS
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
30th of May, 1 gelding, price 12l.; the property of 



Robert Hewitt.







ROBERT HEWITT
. I live at Tamworth, in Yorkshire, in the hamlet of Wickham. At nine o'clock at night, on the 11th of May, I saw my gelding in a field along with two mares, nearly a mile from where I live—about seven next morning I received information, I went to the field, and missed the horse—on the 13th I went to Leicester—I could hear nothing there—I saw it again, with the policeman, at Brentford, on the 16th of June—I am sure it was the one I lost from Yorkshire.





WILLIAM CRESWELL
. On the 12th of May I saw the horse, and on the 13th I met the prisoner—he said he had a horse to sell—I went to look at it—I said it was too small—he asked 6l. for it—I hired the horse of him, as my mare was lame—I gave him 10s. for the hire of it to take me to Staffordshire—I started on the 14th, and got to Leighton Buzzard—the persons thought they knew the horse, and I hod to bring it back.





JOHN HADDON
 (police-constable T 46.) I took the prisoner at Ealing. I heard he had been offering the horse for ten guineas, then for six, and then for four—on the road he said, "If I must tell the truth, I will; I stole it from Mr. Hewitt, of Tamworth"—I went down to Mr. Hewitt, and he owned it—I had traced it down to Leighton Buzzard, and there I got it from Creswell.





WILLIAM SMITH
 (police-constable T 78.) I went with Haddon, and found the horse in the hands of Creswell—it was shown to the prosecutor.

Prisoner's Defence. It was in a lane, with a halter, and another man was by it; he said, "Will you take this for me to Brentford, I will give you so much money?"—I said, "Yes"l—he said, "You must go up the tow-path all the way," and I did—he said he would meet me at Brentford on the Saturday morning—he said he had bought it.




GUILTY
. Aged 28.—


Transported for Ten Years.

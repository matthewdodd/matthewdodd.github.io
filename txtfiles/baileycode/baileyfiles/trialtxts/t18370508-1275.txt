 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
29th of April, 23/8 yards of cantoon, value 7s., the goods of 



Philip Speyer and another.






THOMAS CARTER
 (police-constable F 37.) I was on duty in Holborn, on Saturday the 29th of April, about half-past eight o'clock in the evening—I saw the prisoner pass and repass the prosecutor's door, two or three times—he then put his hand inside the doorway, and took away this cantoon—he walked about thirty yards—I then stopped him and took him back to the shop.

Prisoner, I saw it lying down on the step of the door, and took it up.

Witness. It hung inside the door—he went in and felt it, and after-wards took it down.





PHILIP SPEYER
. I am a tailor in High Holborn. I was in my shop on the 29th of April, when the prisoner was brought in with the cantoon—I missed two pieces—the one produced is my property, and was taken from within two feet of the door—I have one partner.




GUILTY
. Aged 17.—


Transported for Seven Years.

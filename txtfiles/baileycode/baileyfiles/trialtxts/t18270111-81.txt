            . I am a stable-keeper
, and live in Oxford-street; the prisoner was employed to mend my harness on the first or second week in September - I had then some long traces in my harness-room - I missed them in a fortnight or three weeks after; I at last found them at Clark's; I am sure they were in the room while the prisoner was there - the last money I paid him was on the 14th of September.

            . I am a saddler, and live in St. James'-place, Hampstead-road. On the 14th of September the prisoner brought these traces, on his arm, to my house; I had seen him several times before - he asked if I would buy a bargain, and wanted 16s. for them; I bought them for 14s., and asked how he got them; he said his name was 
               Wm. Ryder
            , of No. 13, Henry-street, Hampstead-road, and he had them from a friend; I entered his name in my book, and when Roberts came I told him about it.
Prisoner. Q. Did not you know I lived in Henry-street? A. I think I had heard so.(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I met a man who appeared to be a gentleman - he sold them to me for 12s.; he said he was going abroad the next day - I had seen him before.

. On the 6th of July, about nine o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came down the area into the front room on the ground floor. I found him in the room, and asked what he did there; he said he came to beg some dust. I missed the spoons off the table, and charged him with stealing them, he denied it. I found them in his pocket.

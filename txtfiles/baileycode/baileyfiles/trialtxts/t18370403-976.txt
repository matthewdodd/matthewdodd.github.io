ELIZABETH CHABOT
. I am a widow, living in Bath-street, Tabernacle-square. This bag is mine—I saw it safe on Sunday evening, the 5th of March, in the yard adjoining my house—on the Monday morning my neighbour came and awoke me, I looked through the window, and missed the bag, and then I missed this lead, which had been fixed along the gutter of the roof of my premises—this is about half the lead, I suppose—(looking at some.)





JAMES SIMMONS
 (police-constable G 159.) I was in Curtain-road—I stopped the prisoner about ten minutes past nine o'clock on Wednesday night, the 8th, with this bag and lead—I asked what he had got—he made no reply, but tried to throw it on my legs," and away he ran—I called, "Stop thief—Weed stopped him, and brought him back to me, while I took care of the property—I went to the prosecutrix's house, and fitted the lead, and it matched exactly—I have no doubt it came from there.





JOSEPH WEED
 (police-constable G 114.) I heard the cry, "Stop thief, "I pursued, and in New-inn-yard I met the prisoner—I asked what that hue and cry was—he said he had run foul of a boy—I said, "You have no objection to go back with me"—he said, no—I took him back, and saw Simmonds.





GEORGE AVERY
 (police-constable G 5.) I heard the cry of "Stop thief;" and saw the prisoner running—he was taken back, I took him, and the other officers took the lead—he said he knew nothing of the lead—I fitted it to the house, and it matched exactly.

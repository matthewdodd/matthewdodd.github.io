                  Mascall 
               



            . About the 27th or 28th of February, I saw the Prisoner in Botolph's-Wharf Gate-Way


, and thought he had got something more than he should have. I found Sugar in his Apron, and in the Inside of his Cloaths, in his Bosom, besides what he had got in his Apron and Handkerchief.
Jury. Had he no Pocket?
Mascall. No, he had no Pocket at all; the Sugar would have fell through between his Coat and Waistcoat if he had gone far. When I laid hold of him he seemed to be in a Fit, or drunk, or not well, and was very rustical, and I was obliged to get a Cart to carry him. He would not acknowledge any thing till he found he was mastered, and I had got him into the Cart; and then he said he had got the Sugar under Botolph's-Wharf Gateway. - He is a Person that goes about the Keys to pilfer what he can.
Q. How do you know that?
Mascall. I know it very well, he was in the House of Correction two or three Days before that for the same Practices. - He owned he took it out of the Warehouses.
Q. How has he an Opportunity of doing that?
Mascall. The Cooper's Servants go into the Warehouses to draw the Casks for Samples for Sale; and I do apprehend they might leave the Doors open, and that he might get in that Way, - they are very apt to leave the Doors open.

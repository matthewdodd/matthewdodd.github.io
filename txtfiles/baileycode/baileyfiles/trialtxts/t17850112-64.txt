             sworn.
I am servant to the prosecutor, I saw the prisoner come out of my master's cart in Milk-street


, and he went towards the market, instead of going into the market he turned to the left, and went into Milk-street, and then turned up Robinhood-court, and I came back to Milk-street, and there I found him, he had a carcass of mutton on his shoulders, between five and six in the evening, I suspected him, and asked him where he was going with it, he said it was his master's, I asked him where his master lived, he said, it was no business of mine, I took the mutton off his shoulders, and gave it to an acquaintance of mine, and we brought it into the market, that is all the account I can give of it.
Prosecutor. Every man has his own mark, this is my mutton.
PRISONER's DEFENCE.
When Mr. Harwood was before the Alderman, he said he saw the sheep before five, and missed it a little after five, I was hired to carry it.
The prisoner called one witness to his character.

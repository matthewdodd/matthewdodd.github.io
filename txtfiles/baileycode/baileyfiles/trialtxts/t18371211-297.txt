CHARLES POULDEN
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
11th of December, 100lbs. weight of lead, value 14s., the goods of 



George Scott, and fixed to a certain building; against the Statute, &c.






GEORGE SCOTT
. I live in Moor-lane, and am a stable-keeper. I have a kitchen and stable covered with lead—I saw it safe on the 11th of December—I was at supper between ten and eleven o'clock that night, and began to hear a rumbling over head—I went and looked and found the prisoner on the roof—I asked what he did there—he said I am looking after some pigeons"—I took him into my workshop, and then examined all round the skylight and gutter, and found, about two yards from where I took him, these rolls of lead, weighing about twenty-six pounds—I am sure it is mine.





JOHN HILL
. I am an officer. I took the prisoner—I had seen him on an adjoining roof a short time before.




GUILTY
. Aged 15.—


Transported for Seven Years.

            . I was going down cheapside


 between six and seven in the evening, on the nineteenth of March; I stopped to buy some nuts; there were three girls stood round me: soon after they were gone, a woman told me one of them had took my handkerchief. I followed the prisoner, and charged her with it; she denied it; I took hold of her: when the people came round about us, she took it out of her pocket and gave it me.
The prisoner said nothing in her defence.

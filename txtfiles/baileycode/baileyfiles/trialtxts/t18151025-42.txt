            . I am clerk to Messrs. Sargent and Rutty, who are timber merchants

, and reside at Paddington


. I was returning to the wharf, at about nine o'clock at night, and saw a plank moving along, above the top of the fence. After I had rung the bell, I looked through the gate, and saw the prisoner making his way off from where he had thrown the plank down. Smith opened the gate, and told him. The prisoner got over the fence, and was making his escape, when Smith made a nearer cut, and took him in my presence.

            . I am also in the employ of the prosecutors. I stopped the prisoner. The deal was moved a considerable way from its place where the others were.

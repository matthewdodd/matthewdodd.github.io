            . I live at King James's stairs, Shadwell


. I lost a coat, on the 19th of Sept. out of my room; I forgot to lock my door when I went out. When I came home, about noon, I found the prisoner in my bed; I left him there; I came home again about nine o'clock, then I missed my coat, and the prisoner was gone; I found my coat the next day, at Mr. Blake's, a pawnbroker's. The prisoner dropt a pawnbroker's ticket in the house, which was picked up by the landlady; he owned the next day, that he carried the coat to pawn.

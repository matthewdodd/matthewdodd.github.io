            . On the 24th of January I was going to Drury-lane theatre


, and as the door was opening I felt a pressure on my back - I had before observed something, which made me rather suspicious; as soon as the pressure ceased, I felt, and my purse was gone - I turned to seize the prisoner, as I knew he had made the attempt before, because no other person was near; he had nearly opened my pocket before - to the best of my belief he had opened my right-hand pocket about two minutes before; I did not then speak to him, but I looked full at him, and buttoned my great coat round me - I had my wife and daughters with me; as soon as the pressure ceased, which was a peculiar sort of pressure, which made me sure I was robbed, I turned and was going to seize the prisoner, but a man threw his force against my chest, and tried to trip my heels up - I saw the prisoner's eyes were fixed on something in his hand; he moved off very slowly, but a man got between me and him - I cried out Stop thief! two or three of his friends tried to impede my progress, and when he got near the entrance of the lobby he ran - I got clear of those who impeded me and ran after him; an officer saw him run, and took him - I lost sight of him for a short time while he turned the corner of a court; when I came up I said, "That is the man, I will swear to him;" he made no reply - I had lost my purse with four sovereigns and a half, out of my pocket; there was no one else near enough to have taken it - he is the man, to a certainty.
Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. If there were persons trying to trip you up, how can you say no one was near you? A. That was afterwards; it was about half-past six o'clock - at the pit door there might be fifty persons, but I was quite outside of them; the crowd was before me when I was robbed, and there was no one behind me but the prisoner - there was no person so close as to rob me; I turned, and would have taken him by the collar, if his companion, who was before me, had not pressed me back, and when I turned the prisoner was facing me in a side direction: just at the moment I first saw the prisoner, another man came between us - I put my arm out to grasp the prisoner, and the other pressed against me; I told the prisoner I thought he had been a clerk of ours, and when he was at the watch-house I called him Davis, but I had not seen that man for ten years - when asked at the watch-house how much I had lost, I said I was not certain, it was four sovereigns or four sovereigns and a half - they then said,"Here are four sovereigns and a half found on the prisoner," and I said, on reflection, "It was four sovereigns and a half;" I knew I had taken four sovereigns and two half-sovereigns from the cash, and did not at first recollect whether I had changed one half-sovereign or two - my purse has not been found; I only lost sight of the prisoner as he turned the corner, and the officer was then pursuing him, so that he was not out of the sight of the officer or me - the pressure was a pressure forwards, to get into the pit, but the prisoner was the only man behind me at the time; my wife had hold of my arm, and my daughters were before me - I did not notice to my wife that my pocket had been opened, but I felt it, buttoned it up, and then buttoned my coat: I was at the door about three minutes.
COURT. Q. If I understand you rightly, there was no one behind you but the prisoner? A. Not immediately behind me, and there was a sharp pressure upon me, which there was no occasion for, and in a quarter of a minute I found I had been robbed - the prisoner was not going forward when I turned, but he had something looking at in his hand, and was endeavouring to get out of the house - it was impossible for any one but the prisoner to take my purse; I have not the least doubt of that, nor had I from the first.

            . I am a Police-constable. I was on duty at the theatre - I heard a cry of Stop thief! and saw the prisoner leave the pit entrance; I reached my hand out to take him, but he ran out of my reach, and I followed him to Eagle-court, where he was met by two persons, who stopped his progress - I then took hold of both his hands; I did not see any one following him till I had him in my custody, as the company going to the theatre was so thick - I might have seen the prosecutor before, but there were so many people I did not notice him; I found 15s. 6d. and a bunch of keys in one of the prisoner's pockets, and in his other pocket four sovereigns and a half.
Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Which of the pit doors was this? A. On the south side; I saw a concourse of people, enough to fill the avenue out of the street; the place was very full as it generally is - when I first saw him, he was coming down the steps from the crowd - I did not lose sight of him; he certainly turned some corners, but I turned and kept him in view - he might have got rid of a purse without my seeing him, or he might have thrown it down before he got out of the crowd - I did not see where his hand went while I was pursuing him - I took him in about two minutes - I looked along the line he run in, and in the lobby, but found nothing -I had taken him to the station-house before that; the prosecutor said he believed he had lost about 4l. 10s.; that was before I told him what I had taken from the prisoner - I do not recollect whether he said pounds or sovereigns; he recognized the prisoner as having stood on his right hand at the theatre, and just as the doors were being opened he felt himself hustled; he said several pressed up against him, and somebody called out "Don't press gentleman, there is time enough and room enough," and when he tried to get after the prisoner, he was attempted to he tripped up; I heard him call the prisoner Davis, and he said he thought he was a young man who had been a clerk of theirs, but afterwards he told me it was not him.

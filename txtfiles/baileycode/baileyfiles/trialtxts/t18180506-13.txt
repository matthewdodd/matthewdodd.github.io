WILLIAM WELLS. I am a hosier
, and live in Cheapside


. On the 2d of May, about half-past nine o'clock at night, while I was serving a customer, the prisoner walked into the shop, put his hand on a silk handkerchief that laid on the counter, and ran off with it. I sent my boy after him, who brought him back. He attempted to drop the handkerchief at the threshold of the door; my boy took it out of his hand.

            . I am a servant to Mr. Wells. I was behind the counter, and saw the prisoner come in and snatch the handkerchief. A gentleman and me pursued him, and brought him back. I held his hand all the time, and took the handkerchief out of it. He tried to drop it - I caught it as it fell.

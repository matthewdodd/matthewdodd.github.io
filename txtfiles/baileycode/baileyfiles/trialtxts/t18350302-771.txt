JOHN DUNKIN
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
16th of February, 5 pieces of leather, called calf-butts, value 30s., the goods of 



James Lowe; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






CHARLES VINCENT
. I am a shoemaker, and live in Portpool-lane. On the 16th of February, in the evening, I was coming out of my shop door—I saw the prisoner and two others in company pass my shop door—I followed them and heard the taller one say, "Go right past and go straight in"—I went on till they came to Mr. Lowe's door, where they made a full stop—I saw a policeman, and told him I thought their intention was to plunder the premises—I then saw one of the others go into the shop and the prisoner behind him—the prisoner came but with these calf skins, which he was rolling round—he crossed over to where I was—I went towards him and he dropped the skins—I took them up—he said they had been thrown at him by a boy, and he was running as hard as he could to give them to the first policeman—I took him to Mr. Lowe's parlour—he was not at home, but Mrs. Lowe was—he fell on his knees and asked her to forgive him, and said it was the first time.





DANIEL HUMPHRIES
 (police-constable G 74.) I saw the prisoner and the other men near the prosecutor's door—I waited with Vincent, and saw the prisoner and another go into the shop—the prisoner came out with this leather—he was stopped by Vincent—I chased the other two, but they got away.





JAMES LOWE
. I am a leather-cutter, and live in Portpool-lane. I know this leather to be mine—I came home a little after seven o'clock, and missed it from its place.





EVAN DAVIES
 (police-constable G 192.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got at Mr. Clark's office—(read)—I was present at the trial—I know the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 16.—


Transported for Seven Years.

Before Mr. Common Sergeant.

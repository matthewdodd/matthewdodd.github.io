WILLIAM MATTHEWS. I am a stationer
 in Holborn. On the 10th of January, soon after eleven o'clock in the morning, I was in White Hart-court


, and felt a motion at my coat, and a boy passed before me - I was looking very earnestly at that boy, when a gentleman gave me information, and laid hold of the prisoner; I found my handkerchief under his arm - he said he had just picked it up.
Prisoner. Q. Did you feel me at your pocket? A. I felt something press my pocket, and when I had gone four or five steps, the gentleman charged him with it.

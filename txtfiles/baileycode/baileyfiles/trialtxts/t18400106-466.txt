JOSEPH DAVID LEATHART.
I am a house-decorator. About five o'clock in the evening of the 31st of December I was talking to a policeman in St. James's-street—I saw the two prisoners and another boy in company—I said something to the policeman, and they tried to shun upto a door-way—I went up, and took hold of Corbett—I saw something sticking out from his coat—I said, "What have you got there? "—he said, "Nothing"—I said, "Yes, you have, " and I pulled out this sleeved waistcoat—the other boy ran way—I looked round, and saw Alexander in custody of the policeman, and he found this other waistcoat on him.





GEORGE THORNTON.
I am a police-constable. I was talking to the witness—I took Alexander, and found this other waistcoat under his waistcoat—it has been pinned up somewhere, and torn down—he said he had got nothing—I said, "What do you call this? "





JAMES REARDEN.
I am in the employ of James Ross, in East-street, Manchester-square. These two waistcoats are his—they were safe at the door between two and three o'clock that afternoon—there were several persons at the door, and among them the prisoners.

Corbett's Defence. I was going down Marylebone-lane—two men asked us to go and pawn these waistcoats for them—when we got to St. James's-street we were stopped by the witness, and the policeman—the two men had been following us, but they ran away when they saw us in custody.





GEORGE MAWCROFT.
I produce a certificate of Corbett's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the boy.

I am certain he said the corner house.
Q. What business did he say he had there? - He did not tell what business he had there, he said he left his basket where he brought the things from; the constable of the night examined him again, and desired him to tell where he fetched them from, and he would not detain him any longer; then when he was backward I asked him to tell me the number of the house, and I would go there and get him acquitted, with that he told the number of the house, a shoemaker's house, No. 40, St. Giles's; then I went up and rapped at the door, and asked the man if he had lost any bed-clothes.
Mr. Knowlys. He told you the right number of the house? - He did.
Q. Did you see the basket there? - I did not.
Q. What time was it? - As soon I cried ten o'clock, it was a few minutes after ten when I alarmed the house.

Q. Then the mistress was up? - She got up on my alarm.

Q. When was it you first saw the basket? - I did not see the basket at all till the day after, which was on Monday. The basket is there now.
Q. Did the servant maid at any time say any thing to you about the basket, afterwards? - When she came up to wait at surper, I asked her if the jew and she had been fellow servants? she said no, she never knew him in her life. A little after ten the watchman came and made an alarm, and the lodger let him in, and they came up to my door, and we got up.
Q. Did the servant maid first tell you about this basket, or did you speak to her first about it? - To the best of my recollection she told me, that the jew had been there, and he had left his basket, and that she refused to take it.
Jury. Did your servant lay on this same bed where the clothes were taken off? - Not on the same bed, but in the same room.
Court. How long had this servant been with you? - About two months, but I don't recollect that ever she saw him before.

            . I have the care of the Refuge for the Destitute
. The prisoner was received into the institution on the 28th of September, and left on the 4th of May, without our knowledge. We missed a gown, a bonnet, and a shawl. She was apprehended on the 7th, and brought back to the house, and I found those articles on her back - they are the property of the institution. They were not for her wear, but for two other inmates; she had other clothes, which she also took with her; she said she would not be confined to see the committee, but would take the event of justice. She had her own clothes on, as well as these when she was brought back.

            . I am housekeeper at the institution. The prisoner left about eight o'clock in the evening, and when brought back had these clothes on; she left the clothes behind which she came in with - they were locked up.

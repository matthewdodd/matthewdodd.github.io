            . I live in Sun-yard, East Smithfield


. I am an unfortunate girl, and the prisoner is also the same. On the 24th of June these things were in my room. I had pulled them off over night, and went to bed. I had taken her to sleep with me till she could get into the hospital, as she was ill. She had been about a week with me. I went to bed, rather tipsy; she did not come to bed that night, but was in the room when I did. I awoke about six o'clock and found her and the things gone. I found her at the watch-house with them.

            . I am a patrol. I stopped the prisoner by the watch-house door with these things in a pinafore, about half-past one o'clock in the morning. I asked what she had got, she said nothing but what was her own.

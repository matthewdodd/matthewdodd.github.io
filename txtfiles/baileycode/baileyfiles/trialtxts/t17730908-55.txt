            . I am a widow: I went out the 19th of July about one at night; I locked my door and went to Water-lane; while I was there, Mrs. Newey told me somebody had been in, my house; when she came up she brought the prisoner at the bar with her; I went home and found my door broke open; I missed some of the things mentioned in the indictment. The prisoner had two pillows, a pair of salts and the glass in her apron; the other things were scattered about in my house but were not taken away. The prisoner at that time was very much in liquor.

            . I saw the prisoner come out of the prosecutrix's house; I followed her as fast as I could; I laid hold of her and took her to the house where the prosecutrix was; I saw the apron examined which contained the things mentioned by the prosecutrix.
Prisoner's Defence.
It is my first fact, I hope the Court will shew me mercy.

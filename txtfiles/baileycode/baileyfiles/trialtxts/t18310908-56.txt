            . I am servant to Mr. Turner, a pawnbroker, Brydges-street. On the 26th of July the prisoner pawned this gold watch with five seals, for 3l.; they would fetch 4l. or 5l. - I am confident of her person; Mrs. Carey saw and identified them a few days after.
MRS. CAREY. These are my watch and seals.
Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Are you the lady who prosecuted a French woman here yesterday? A. Yes; she could not have taken the watch, because I had it after she left, I am certain. (See page 751.)
Prisoner's Defence. I left on the Sunday night; a young lady left on the Saturday afternoon, while I was cleaning the steps, and took two boxes away.
MRS. CAREY. I wound it up on the Saturday night.
Cross-examined. Q. Will you swear you was not tipsy on the Saturday? A. Yes.
The prisoner received a good character.




               GUILTY of stealing to the value of 99s. only
            . Aged 19.
Recommended to Mercy by the Prosecutrix.

THOMAS COOK
. I live in Skinner-street, Clerkcnwell, and am a wadding-maker. The prisoner worked with me the week after Christmas, but not in February—I was ill—I lost the pair of scales, the planes, and other things stated in this indictment, and a great many more—here are what we have found of them—I have examined them carefully, and can swear to them—several of them have my marks on them.





JAMES LUSBY
. I live in Hare-street, Bethnal-green. I bought these tools and scales of the prisoner, on the 12th of February, I gave him 3s. 6d. for them—I am not aware what they are worth—he said they belonged to him, that he was in distress, and wanted to sell them—I gave him what he asked for them.





THOMAS COOK
. I gave 14s. for the scales only.





JAMES CHAPMAN
 (police-constable K 370.) I went to Lusby's, and found all these things there—the prosecutor identified them directly.

Prisoner's Defence. I bought them in Petticoat-lane.

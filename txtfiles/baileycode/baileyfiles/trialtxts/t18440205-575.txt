JOHN CONNER
 was indicted

 for breaking and entering the ing-house of 



Francis Wilks, at 
St. George, Bloomsbury, and stealing therein 2 paintings framed, value 11l.;, his goods.






FRANCIS WILKS
. I am a picture-dealer, and live in Southampton-row, Russell-square, in the parish of St. George the Martyr, Bloomsbury—it is my dwelling-house—on the evening of the 19th Jan. I was at the back of my shop, and hearing a noise I went into the shop and found the outer door open, which had been before closed—I am quite sure the latch had caught—I missed two oil paintings, worth 11l.;, from the window close to the door—they had been safe just before—nobody had gone out of the shop after I left the door secure till the dog barked—I have not recovered the paintings.

Cross-examined by
MR. WILKINS. Q. Is there an internal communication between the shop and dwelling-house? A. Yes, by folding-doors.





FREDERICK WILLIAM WEST
 (police-constable F 106.) About six o'clock on the evening of the 19th Jan., I saw the prisoner, and watched him—I saw him lay hold of the handle of the prosecutor's door, open it, and go in he came oat with a picture in each hand, and went towards Bloomsbury-square—there is a cab rank there, and I lost sight of him—I went to the prosecutor's—I saw the prisoner again on the Monday following and took him—I had such a knowledge of him before as to be quite positive he is the man.

Cross-examined. Q. How near were you to him? A. He passed by me nearer than you are, before he went to the door—I noticed him as he passed me—he out-ran me—he was dressed as he is now—there was gaslight from the shop window—one picture appeared about a foot square, and the other much larger.


MR. WILKS
re-examined. One picture was about 2 feet by 15 inches broad, including the frame, and the other about a foot square.

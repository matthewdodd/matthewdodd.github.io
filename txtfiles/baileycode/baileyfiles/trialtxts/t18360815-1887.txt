JOHN THOMAS
 and 




IRELAND PITTS BELL
 were indicted for

 stealing, on the 
11th of August, 3 stone bottles, value 1s.; 1 gallon of turpentine, value 6s.; and 1 1/2 gallons of oil, value 5s.; the goods of 




George Urling Clark and another.







HENRY JOSEPH DURIEN
. I am in the service of George Urling Clark and Frederick Clark, oilmen, in Holywell-street, Shoreditch. On the 11th of August, I had been serving a customer with the articles stated in the indictment—the porter placed them at the door—I was making out the invoice, and then I missed them—Thomas had come to the house with a waggon loaded with brimstone, under the pretence of assisting the waggoner to unload—he loitered about, and then I missed the goods—I told the policeman to look for him—I went myself to Norton Falgate, and there I found Bell, with the bottles standing at his feet—Thomas went and lifted them on his shoulder, and they went on towards Bishopsgate-street—I told the policeman, whom I met coming back, saying he could not find them; and we took them, with the property, about twenty-five minutes after I missed it.

Bell. Q. Did you see me near the house at all? A. No; you were 150 or 200 yards from the shop, with the bottles at your feet, when I first saw you.





JAMES HAYWARD
. I am a policeman. I have heard what the witness has stated—it is true.

Bell's Defence. I was going towards White Lion-street—I met this young man, with the three bottles on his shoulder—he asked me to take care of them while he went a little way—I did so—in about twenty minutes he returned, and found me there with them—I had not staid two minutes longer before the policeman came up with this gentleman, and took us both into custody.

Thomas's Defence. I was desired to assist the waggoner, and after leaving the shop, a man asked me to help him up with the bottles, and I was directly taken.

THOMAS—

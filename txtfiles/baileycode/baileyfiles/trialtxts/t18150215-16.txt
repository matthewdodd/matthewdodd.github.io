. On Friday, the 10th of February, about half past eight in the evening, I heard my errand boy cry stop thief; I went to the door; I saw the boy pursuing the man, and when I attempted to stop the prisoner, he presented a knife at me, one of the articles he had taken.

            . I was in the shop on the 10th of February. The prisoner made a violent rush into the shop; he snatched the articles off a chest of drawers in the shop; I cried out stop thief immediately.
Prosecutor. I am sure they are mine, they have my mark upon them; altogether they are of the value of seventeen shillings and sixpence.

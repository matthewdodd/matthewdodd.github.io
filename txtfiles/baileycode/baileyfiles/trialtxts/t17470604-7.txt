             . The Prisoner came to me to look for a Smock she had in Pawn. I laid my Watch upon the Counter. I stoop'd down to look after what she ask'd for, and when I arose again she took my Watch and went out; and the next Day I took her, and she confess'd she had pawn'd it for 20 s.
Q. Who produces the Watch now.
Picknell. 
               
                  William 
                  Smith 
               



             the Constable.
(The Watch was produc'd in Court.)

Court. Is that your Watch?
Picknell. Yes; I know it as it has been lately mended.
Q. Who took her?
Picknell. Smith, my Lord.
Court. Prisoner, will you ask 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Picknell 
               



             any Questions?
Prisoner. Did you not chuck me under the Chin?
Q. to the Prisoner. How came you by the Watch?
Prisoner. I had it out of his Fob, he gave it me out of his Pocket to pledge; he was to give me Half a Crown to be concerned with me.
Picknell. As I hope for Mercy I never did. I have as likely a Woman to my Wife as a Man need to have.

            . I am Headborough in Whitechapel . I took the Prisoner, and she confess'd she had pawn'd the Watch in Winfield-Street .
Q. Is that the Watch?
Smith. Yes, my Lord; the Pawn-broker brought it before the Justice, and the Justice delivered it into my care.
Court to the Prisoner. Have you any Thing to say, or any Witnesses?
Prisoner. There was none but he and I in the Room; he thought his Wife was coming, and he told me I should come again for the Shift.
Q. Where was this chucking under the Chin?
Prisoner. In his own Room, it is like a Shop.

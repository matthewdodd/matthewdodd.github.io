WILLIAM WILMOTT
. I live in Wilmott's-buildings. I was at the Royal Standard, in White-street, on the 17th of September—the prisoner was there, and some other people—I had a watch—the prisoner had a child, and she put the child on my lap—there was a little uproar at the door—the prisoner came and took the child—she must have taken the chain of the watch, and pulled that out with her, and went away—I went out to quiet the mob, and then I went back, and went out at the side door—this is my watch, chain, and seals, that I lost on that occasion—(looking at them)—I did not miss them at the time.





WILLIAM REEVE
. I am shopman to Thomas Blackman, a pawnbroker. I produce the watch, chain, and seals, which were pledged by the Prisoner on the 17th of September.

Prisoner's Defence. A good many were drinking in this wine-vaults, he asked me for the child—I gave it him—there was a row outside the door—I came out, and a woman handed me the watch, and told me to Pawn it, which I did, for 10s. where I have been known for these ten years.





JOHN RANDALL
 (police-sergeant M 9.) I produce a certificate of the

prisoner's former conviction from the clerk of Surrey—(read)—the prisoner is the person.

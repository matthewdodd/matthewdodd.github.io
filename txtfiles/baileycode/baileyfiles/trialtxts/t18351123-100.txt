DAVID CARTY
. The prisoner lived at my house for a week—he slept in my cellar—there is a step ladder from the cellar to my room—there is no lock to my door—he has no parents, and was sleeping outside on the stairs—I pitied him, and let him sleep in my cellar—the things stated were on the line in my room on the 1st of November—I went to bed about nine o'clock, and got up at half-past four to go to work—there was a hod and shovel of mine in the cellar— I went and found the child's frock there and the chap gone—I asked my wife where she put the child's frock—she said, "On the line"—I went up with a light, and there was nothing on it—I then went and gave notice to the officer—I saw the prisoner at Blue Anchor-yard, under a stair-case, and the clothes by the side of him—I said, "Is that Jack?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, had he the clothes—he said, "Yes"—I took the clothes, and some persons said, "Let him go," and I said, "Let him go"—another said, "If I let him go, I should be taken myself"—I then got frighted—some of them took him again—the policeman has had the clothes ever since—these are my clothes, my wife's and children's and sister-in-law's.

             . My child told me there was a woman come down with her mother's cloak upon her arm. I pursued her, and took my own things upon her: I asked her how she came by them, she said, do not be angry with me , and I will go back with you; I said, so you shall. She said , let me go, and I will give you the things again: I said she should go before a Magistrate, and accordingly she did. I went to see her in New-Prison, and she said two soldiers persuaded her to do it: I said, why did not you say this before Justice Tall? There was no soldier near the house .

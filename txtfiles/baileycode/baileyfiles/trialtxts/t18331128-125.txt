             has a house at No. 12, Homer-street


, and I had the key of it to show the apartments to any person who called - on the 10th of October the prisoner called on me at ten o'clock in the morning, and asked me if there was a room to let there; I said there was. and I showed it her: she said she had been a servant, but had been married three weeks to a forman-sawyer; she referred me to her mistress, and wanted to come in that night - she came again about six o'clock in the evening; I went up to the room and missed a milk-pot and a basin from the mantle-piece; I thought she might have taken them off to put some images on - this coal-scuttle was let to her as a part of the furniture of the room; I gave it her to fetch some coals, and she went away with it; it was found at a broker's in the neighbourhood.

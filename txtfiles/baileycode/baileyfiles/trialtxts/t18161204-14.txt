            . I am an officer; on the 9th of November, about twelve o'clock, I heard a cry of stop thief; the man turned into Leadenhall-market; I followed, and met a young man with the prisoner and trunk in his custody,

            . A person came into the shop and and gave the alarm, that a trunk was stolen; I traced the prisoner by a man on the top of a coach pointing towards Leadenhall-market; as soon as I got into the market the prisoner and trunk was brought up to me by a strange man; I gave both to the officer.

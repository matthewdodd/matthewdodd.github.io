ELIZABETH FOSTER
. I live in Wellington-street, Pentonville, and am single. On the evening of the 11th of March, I was at the station-house door at St. Giles—the prisoner was by my side—I did not know him before—I had a pair of boots under my arm, he snatched them from me, and ran down a court—I went after him, but he got out of my sight—I am sure he is the person—these are my boots—(looking at them.)





GEORGE JOHN RESTIEAUX
. I am a policeman. I saw the prosecutrix near the station-house, and saw the prisoner there—the prosecutrix afterwards gave me information, and described the prisoner—I went and found him in bed, in a lodging-house, and these boots were in the bed, wrapped up in the prisoner's apron—I had seen him wear the apron before—he claimed it, and I gave it him.





THOMAS JENNINGS
. I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—he is the man who was tried and convicted—(read.)




GUILTY
. Aged 24—


Transported for Ten Years.

ELIZABETH AKED
. I am the wife of Joseph Aked. On the 18th of March I was at a sale in Red Lion-court, Fleet-street, between twelve and one o'clock—I felt a pressure against me several times—I had a purse in my right-side pocket, which contained a half-crown, a shilling, and three six-pences—a gentleman asked me something—I felt my pocket, and my purse was gone, and my dress cut—I went to the top of the stairs, and Adams was bringing the prisoner up—this is my purse, and contains the money stated—(examining it.)


Prisoner. Q. How can you identify the purse? A. I know it very well, it belongs to my apprentice.





GEORGE ADAMS
. I am a furniture dealer. I was at the sale—I saw the prosecutrix and another lady at the front of the table—the prisoner was behind fumbling about her dress—he drew his hand from her person, turned round, and went down stairs—I went and took him on the stair-case, and when he got on the landing I said, "You have robbed this lady"—I took hold of his arm—he gave me the purse, begged me, in God's name, to let him go, and said he had not done it—I heard this knife drop from him, and took it up.





HENRY GORDON
 (City police-constable No. 87.) The prisoner was given into my custody.

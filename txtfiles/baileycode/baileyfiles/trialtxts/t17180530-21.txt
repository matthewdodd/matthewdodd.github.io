             the 22d of May
 last. The Prosecutor deposed, That the Prisoner came to his House and called for a Pint of Drink, and afterwards wanted to go to the Necessary House in the Cellar, which he did, and came up again, that then he call'd for another Pint of Drink, and took an Excuse to go into the Cellar a second time, and came up and pass'd by him and went away, saying, your Humble Servant; he saying, Sir, you are kindly Welcome, not knowing what he had done. The Servant deposed the same, adding that he going down into the Cellar to draw some Sider, met the Prisoner on the Stairs different from what he went down, and asking him what he did there, he pretended he had mistaken his way; but when he came into the Cellar saw the Cock taken out of the But of Stout, and another out of the Cask of Sider, and the Liquors running about the Cellar; however the Prisoner got off for that time, but was afterwards taken by accident. The Prisoner denied the Fact, or that he ever was in the Prosecutor's House in his Life. But the contrary being sufficiently proved, the Jury found him 


               guilty to the value of 10 d.

                  Colebrank 
               



             depos'd, That on the 29th of January he went to pay 130 l. to Mr. Martin, but remembring he should have occasion for some Money at home, he took the Money mentioned in the Indictment from the rest, in Mr. Martin's Shop, and laid it on the Compter by him; that presently he saw it move, and looking behind him saw the Prisoner snatch it up and run away with it, that he pursued him and never lost Sight of him till he was taken with the Money and Bag in his Hand.
Mr. Allen depos'd, That he took the Prisoner with the Bag and Money in his Hand, which Bag and Money appear'd to be Mr. Colebrank's, and being carried before a Magistrate, he said, he believ'd he was bewitch'd.
He said in his Defence, That they run after him and put the Money into his Hand, which being a worse Excuse than t'other, and neither of them appearing reasonable, the Jury found him 


               guilty to the Value of 39 s.

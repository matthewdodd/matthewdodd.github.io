            . I am an apothecary
, and live in St. Thomas's-street, Borough. On the 24th of July, at eleven o'clock in the morning, I was in Holborn


, and felt my handkerchief drawn from my pocket; I turned round, and found it in possession of Gambler; he immediately threw it to Hemptead, whom I also seized, and took it from him; two officers came up.

                  HANCE
               



            . I am a constable. I was on Holborn-hill, and saw Gambler take hold of the prosecutor's coat-skirt with one hand; he 
               drew
             the handkerchief out, and threw it behind him to Hempstead; it was done so quick I cannot say whether they were in company. When I caught Hempstead, he had it in his hand.


                  WILLIAM 
                  WILSHIRE
               



            . I am a constable. I saw a crowd on Holborn-hill, and found the prisoners detained.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
HEMPSTEAD'S Defence. I am a drover, and work for Mr. Miles, of Saffron-hill; I was taken coming from work; I am no companion of Gambler; I handed the handkerchief to the witness.


                  WILLIAM 
                  HANCE
               



            . I took hold of him and the handkerchief at the same time; he said he knew nothing of the other prisoner.



               NOT GUILTY
            .

WILLIAM GREEN
. I live in Plough-court, Fetter-lane. On the 4th of November I was standing at the corner of Felix-court, and saw the prisoner unbuckle the horse-cloths, and take them off the horses which stood in a wagon at the corner of Durham-street—he put them under his arm, and came away—I followed him, but did not see a policeman—he was taken on Friday—I am sure he is the person—I had seen him before, and knew him well.





RICHARD NASH
. I am in the employ of Mary Andrews. On the 4th of November I was in her wagon loading it near Felix-court, Fetter-lane—when I got down I missed the cloths which had been buckled on the horses—I gave notice to the police, and saw them next day—these are them—(looking at them.)





WILLIAM COOPE
. (Citypolice-constable, No. 264.) I received information from Green on Friday, and went to the prisoner's lodging—he was not at home, his sister was—I found these horse-cloths on the bed—I inquired where the prisoner was—she said, in Smithfield—I immediately went there, and took him—in answer to questions, he stated that a strange man had given him the horse-cloths to mind, and had never returned to fetch them away.

Prisoner's Defence. I was standing in Smithfield, and had the cloths given to me.

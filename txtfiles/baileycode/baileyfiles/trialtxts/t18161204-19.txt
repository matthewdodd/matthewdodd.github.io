WILLIAM DEYKES. I am an attorney
; on the 20th of November, about seven o'clock in the evening, I was in St. Martin's-le-grand


, I felt a jerk at my pocket, and I found I had lost my handkerchief, I turned round and caught hold of the prisoner, and took him over the way; he refused to go into a shop, but I held him tight; a young man called out here is the handkerchief, he has dropped it; I observed him shuffle very much, as if he wanted to get rid of it.
JOHN GRAY. I am a jeweller; I was passing through St. Martin's-le-grand, I was about three yards from Mr. Deykes; I saw the prisoner drop the handkerchief and helped to secure him till the patrole arrived.
WILLIAM TAYLOR. I am an officer; this is the handkerchief. (Produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I was walking along and the gentleman collared me, and said I had picked his pocket; he took me to a shop and searched me, I had nothing about me, somebody brought the handkerchief to him.

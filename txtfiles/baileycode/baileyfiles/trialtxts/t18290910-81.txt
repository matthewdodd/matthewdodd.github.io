. I was near Cock-hill, Shadwell


, on the 3rd of August; the prisoner came by the side of me - I walked a little way with her; she asked me for some gin; as we were walking up the street she drew my watch from my pocket - I took it from her, put it in again, went on to acorner, stood there a minute or two, and she took the watch from my pocket; she stooped down, and put it behind a post - I took hold of her, and gave charge of her to the watchman: this is the watch.

            . I am a watchman. I came up; the prosecutor had hold of the prisoner, and said she had got his watch; she denied it - I asked where they came from; he said, "Up this lane;" I then went and found the watch behind the post.
Prisoner's Defence. He came and asked me to drink; he took me to the White Lion, and had some gin, but I did not; he went down this lane, then came again, and wanted to take liberties with me; he then called the watchman, said he had lost his watch, and would sell my life as a butcher would an ox.

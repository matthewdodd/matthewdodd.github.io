            . I live near College-hill


; the prisoner lodged with me about a fortnight; he went away on the 26th of September, without any notice; I came home about eight o'clock that night, and missed the things mentioned in the indictment: the sheets were taken from a bed in the garret; that was not the bed where the prisoner lay; the hat was taken from a nail in the kitchen; the prisoner did not return again. On the Thursday after, I took him on the other side of the water.

            . I am a pawnbroker; I took in a pair of sheets, and a hat, (producing them) of a person, who I believe is the prisoner, I will not swear to him; on the 26th of September he pawned them in the name of

It appear'd that Hannah Bignell (a Child
) was on a Moon-light Night going over Tower Hill


 with a Pair of Breeches under her Arm: The Prisoner snatch'd them from her; and being closely pursu'd, upon her crying out, he threw the Breeches into Tower Ditch; but he was presently stopt, and the Breeches taken up again. 

               Guilty
             of Felony.

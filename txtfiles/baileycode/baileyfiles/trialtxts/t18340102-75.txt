, and a woman came and spoke to me - I quitted her; and the prisoner rushed past me - he snatched at my watch, broke the small ring, and took away the seal and chain - I pursued him, and struck him two or three times, and should have taken him; but some persons came up and rescued him - on the Saturday night afterwards I went with the officer to St. Giles's - we found the prisoner in bed - I am sure he is the person.
Prisoner. I know nothing of it - I was in bed at the time. Witness. I am positive he is the person.
EDWARD MUNDY (police-sergeant E 2). I received information, and took the prosecutor to the prisoner - he identified him.
Prisoner. He said he was not certain I was the person. Witness. No; he was quite sure.
Prisoner's Defence. I went home at half-past eleven o'clock on the Saturday night, and went to bed - I was poorly, and did not get up till half-past ten on the Monday morning.

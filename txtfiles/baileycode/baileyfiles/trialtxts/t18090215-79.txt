                  LONG
               



            . I live in Holborn, in the parish of St. George, Bloomsbury


; I occupy the house.


                  GEORGE 
                  ROWLAND
               



            . I am an apprentice to Mr. 
               
                  Richard 
                  Long
               



            . On the evening of the 25th of January I was sent out a few doors; I stopped about ten minutes; when I came back I saw the three prisoners at the window; I went past and took no notice of them till I had got a few doors beyond; then I came back to the window to see what they had been doing, as they had gone away; I found there was a hole in the window. It was then about half past seven.
Q. What business does your master carry on - A. A cutler.
Q. One of the panes was broken - A. Yes; there was a piece out; it was cracked before; I had observed it about an hour and a half before. It might have been cracked about three weeks, or more.
Q. Was the shop door fastened - A. Only with the latch. I observed one of the panes of glass were broken; I observed that the knives that were in the tray had been pulled about; I did not know then any were taken away; I saw they were standing a few doors lower, and seeing they were lurking about I went after them.
Q. Did you go into the shop before you went after them or not - A. No; I pursued them, they ran away. I catched 
               
                  Michael 
                  Connolly
               



             in Bloomsbury market; he ran there, stopped all of a sudden, and put his hands in his breeches pocket. He was never out of my sight.
Q. Can you say positively that he was one of the three that you saw at the window - A. Yes. I asked him where the other chaps were that were with him;he said nobody had been with him; I asked him if he had not been in Holborn; he said no. I brought him home, he was searched; nothing was found on him.
Q. When you first saw him how near was he to the window - A. Standing as close as he could with his face towards the window; the big one was standing in the middle of the two little ones; they were looking up Holborn, one of them, and the other down. I took 
               
                  Charles 
                  Evans
               



             in Holborn. I asked Connelly where the other boys were; he said in Holborn; I saw the little one looking out for him, as I supposed; I went and took him. Charles escaped; I left him at the door; I thought the watchman would take care of him. The officers took Charles afterwards.


                  EDWARD 
                  CROCKER
               



            . I am one of the patrols of Bow street. I was going down Holborn with one of my brother officers, we heard there was a boy in custody at Mr. Long's; he was delivered to us. We asked him where the other two were; he said he did not know, at first; after we had searched him he told us where they lived, in a street, the first turning round Brooks' market, it went into Leather lane, Holborn; and as we were coming out of the door 
               
                  Richard 
                  Evans
               



             was at the door; I asked him what his name was; he said Evans; he was a lamp lighter
, he lived at No. 15, Beauchamp street, Brook's market. After searching him in the public house we went down to the lodgings, up stairs, a little boy opened the door; I asked him if Evans lived there; he said no; 
               
                  Charles 
                  Evans
               



             was there drinking tea; his mother was ill in bed. On Blackman searching about he found there were five knives in a tumbler on the mantle piece; Blackman called me to look at them; I took two, Blackman took out the other three. We asked 
               
                  Charles 
                  Evans
               



             where they came from; he said his brother Dick gave them to him to bring home in Holborn; and going up Holborn, he told us Connelly, another boy, was with them; he shewed us the window, and the hole in the pane of glass; they got the knives through by a wire; he said the big boy broke it with a knife. We went to Mr. Long with the knives; he identified them as his property.


                  WILLIAM 
                  BLACKMAN
               



            . I was with Crocker; I found this knife and box of gunpowder on Richard. This knife is ground up for the purpose to star the glaze, as they call it.
Q. Did you find any knives in Beauchamp street - A. Yes; five, in a small tumbler over Charles's head, where he was drinking his tea; he said his brother Dick gave them to him when he was in Holborn, to carry home; we brought him up Holborn; he took us to the window, told us it was Connelly that broke the window with a knife, and drawed the knives out with a wire; he shewed us the very place. When I laid hold of Richard he said he was a lamp lighter; his father lived in Beachamp street, in a front room, two pair of stairs; he was a lamp lighter.
The property produced and identified.
Connelly's Defence. I know no more about the knives than a child unborn.
Richard Evans's Defence. I am quite innocent of it.


                  Charles 
                  Evans
               



            's Defence. The knives were given to me by a boy for fifteen marlows; I came home and put them in a tumbler on the mantle shelf. These gentlemen came and gave me some beer, and told me to say that I took them out of the window, and that if I did I should be forgiven.
Q. Is the boy here that gave you the knives - A. No.
Q. to Crocker. Did either you or Blackman, or any body tell Charles Evans, if he said he took them out of the window he should be forgiven - A. No, nothing at all of the kind.
Q. to Blackman. Was any thing of the kind said to 
               
                  Charles 
                  Evans
               



             - A. No, no promise of any kind whatever; it was his own voluntary act of telling.
Connelly called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.
Richard and 
               
                  Charles 
                  Evans
               



             called one witness, who gave them a good character.

            . I am a jeweller
; the prisoner came into my shop on August 6, under a pretence of buying a pair of Bristol stone buttons; they were handed to him by my wife, then he asked for a pair of mecho stone buttons, in the mean time he put his hand on a box of rings, and took a ring out; I saw him; and he said, he would give two shillings for the Bristol stone buttons; rns himself round and away he ran out of the house, I followed him.
Q. How long after the taking up of the ring, did he run out of the shop?
Reneals. About half a minute; he turned round to go out, he had no money in his pocket; in about half an hour, I found him in a person's closet, he was shut up; a little boy saw him go in, I went to see where he went to; so I enquired for him but he was denied, the boy said, he saw which apartment he went into; while I was examining the woman, the little boy opened the closet door, and there he was stuck up in the closet. I did not find the ring on him, but I saw him take it.
Q. from the Prisoner. Where is the constable that gave me in charge, he has not brought him here, because he can contradict him?
Reneals. I look upon it he is at home; Sir.
Prisoner. He asked me if I had his property? I said no; he has brought no witness that will speak in my behalf; the boy and constable could contradict him; therefore he has not brought them here.

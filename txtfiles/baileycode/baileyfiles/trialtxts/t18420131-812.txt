HENRY ABRAMS
. I am a potato-dealer—I live in King David-lane, Shadwell—the prisoner was my errand-boy. I sent out for 1l. worth of silver on the 15th of January—I placed it on the mantel-piece in the back-parlour, two rooms from the shop—I went down stairs with the prisoner, and left my wife in the room—I sent the prisoner up to fetch some empty baskets—he did not return—I went up, and missed the silver off the mantelpiece—no one was in the place but the prisoner.





MARTHA ABRAM
. I am the prosecutor's wife. I did not take the money—there was no one in the house but the prisoner and me and my husband—I got up to go into the shop—the prisoner passed me, and went out.




GUILTY
. Aged 14.—


Transported for Seven Years. —Convict Ship.

(There was another indictment against the prisoner.)

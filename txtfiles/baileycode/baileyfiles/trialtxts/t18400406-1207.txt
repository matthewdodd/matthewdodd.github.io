THOMAS BASFIELD
. I am a tailor, and live in Aldgate. On Saturday last I was in my shop, and saw the prisoner snatch a coat from off the block inside the door—he ran off—I went after him and he threw the coat down, and while I was picking it up he got a few yards a-head—he was then brought back by the policeman.

Prisoner. Q. By what do you identify me? A. By seeing your face very plainly—I did not refuse to sign my deposition.

Jury. Q. Did you ever lose sight of the prisoner? A. Yes, while I was picking the coat up—a wagon was going past at the time—I saw him very plainly take the coat, and I was within arm's length of him for one hundred yards.





WILLIAM WREFORD
 (City police-constable No. 158.) The prisoner was given to me by Mr. Pound, the ward beadle.

Prisoner. Q. Did not the prosecutor refuse to sign the deposition on Monday? A. No, he never refused at all—there was a very heavy case on—he wanted to go borne to his business, and signed it the next day.

Prisoner's Defence. I was in Fenchurch-street, and heard the cry of "Stop thief"—I saw the prosecutor take the coat up—I ran after the person, but lost sight of him at the corner of Duke-street—I was then taken—I told where the cry came from, and walked back to the shop—the prosecutor said he thought it was me by my having a hat band on—I only came from Birmingham on the Monday before.




GUILTY
.** Aged 22. 


Transported for Seven Years.

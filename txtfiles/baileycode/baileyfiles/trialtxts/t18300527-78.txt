. On the 29th of April, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, this watch hung in the parlour by the side of the mantelpiece; I was shaking out the tea-pot; I turned, and saw the prisoner just at my back; he unhung the watch, and ran off with it; I screamed out, "Here is a thief;" I had eight men about me who were at work in a back house, they were afraid they should be accused of it, but I said,"Here is a thief! here is a thief!;" and I followed the prisoner and took him.

            . I am a labourer. I heard the alarm, and saw the prisoner running towards me as I was on the bridge; I heard Stop thief! called, and took hold of him till the prosecutrix came up - another lad came behind the prisoner, and he was trying to give this watch to the other lad; I tried to secure that one, but he got away.(Property produced and sworn to.)
The prisoner handed in a petition, representing that he had been led into bad company - that his companions had made him intoxicated and persuaded him to commit the offence.

RICHARD SNELL sworn. - I am a corn-chandler
, in Portman-Mews, Orchard-street, Portman-square: On the 18th of January, between the hours of eleven and twelve in the morning, I lost a box from behind a one-horse chaise, going down Oxford-street; I missed it in Broad St. Giles's; I told a little boy to look and see if the box was safe; he said, it was gone; the box contained the articles mentioned in the indictment.
Q. Did you, at any time, see the box safe upon the chaise? - A. Not after I left my home; I put it on the chaise about two minutes before I got into the chaise; I did not think of looking for it afterwards, till I bid the boy look round to see if it was safe.

Q. 
            Have you ever found any of your things? - A. Yes, by advertisement in the paper, from Bow-street; I attended, seeing that a box was taken from a one-horse chaise, with the name of Snell on it; it is my property; I think it was the following Thursday that I saw my box.
Q. Was any of your property in it? - A. Yes, all that was in the box.
Q. Have you the box here? - A. Yes.
 - HURLE sworn. - (Produces the box:)
Q. When was that box delivered to you? - A. I observed the two men go from the chaise with this box in their possession, in Oxford-street, the lower end, near St. Giles's; I saw the prisoners running in Oxford-street, and the chaise was in the middle; they were on the pavement; they were going the same way as the chaise; it was about half past eleven in the morning, and a good many people about; I had some property with me, I suspected them, and left my property in a shop, and went and followed them; when I came out of the shop, they were going from the chaise with the box in their possession.
Q. Was the chaise going fast or slow? - A. Middling, not particularly fast.
Q. Did you observe how the box was fastened to the chaise? - A. No.

Q. 
            Which of them did you see carrying it? - A. The prisoner Dungworth.
Q. How far from the chaise were they then? - A. About the space of two or three yards.
Q. Was there any fastening about the trunk, or cord? - A. A cord; one end was broke or cut, I do not know which; I cannot say whether it was broke or cut; I followed Dungworth up a court; I took him up the court, and took him by the collar, and said, he had stole the box from the back of the chaise; they made some resistance, and were assisted; they got away from me, and took the box with them; I followed them again into the Mews, near Bedford-square, (Carlisle-Mews.)
Q. Did you ever lose sight of them? - A. Yes, while they went round the corner of Russell-street into the Mews, a minute or two; there I got Dungworth again, and he let the box fall, and went on.
Q. Dungworth still had it? - A. I cannot say which had it then.
Q. They let it drop, in order to get away? - A. I was going to let them go away, but I wasadvised not, and I followed them again, and endeavoured to take them a third time, near Bedford-square; and this man, Bowles, assisted me, and took them.
Q. All the time you followed them, did not you give alarm? - A. Yes, but no person gave any assistance; I called out stop thief; I saw the box drop from one of them; I do not know which.
Q. How long might this be after you saw them come from the chaise? - A. All in the course of six or seven minutes.
Q. Is that the box? - A. Yes, it is the same;I took the prisoner Dungworth and the box in a coach, and went to Bow-street immediately.

Q. 
            Have you had it in your custody ever since? - A. No, it was at Bow-street, and Mr. Snell had it again.

Q. 
            (To Mr. Snell.) How was your box fastened? - 
               A. 
            Only by a cord, no straps.

Q.

Q. Do you mean to state, that, though you kept raising an alarm, nobody assisted you in midday? - A. Yes; I can declare the several neighbours never gave any assistance at the top of the court; I asked people to assist me, and nobody would.
Q. You brought a great crowd, possibly, with all this, and yet nobody assisted you? - A. No, nobody, until at last these men assisted me.

Q. 
            Where did these men assist you, near Bedford-square? - A. Yes.

This man had hold of him, and his bosom open; he got away from him; he went up, and I followed him up the Mews; we came up with him, after going out of the Mews, at the end of the Square; a good many people followed him; when he was crossing the Square, this man made an attempt to catch him; he made a blow at him, and took hold of him, and stopped him.
Q. Did you see the other prisoner? - A. No, not till we brought this man to Bow-street.

Q. 
            Whose books are they? - A. They are mine.
Prisoner Dungworth. I leave my defence to my Counsel.
Prisoner Thompson. I know nothing of it more has being a spectator of the business; there was a mob of people; I never touched the box, nor never saw it.

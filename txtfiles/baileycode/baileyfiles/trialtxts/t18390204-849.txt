WILLIAM HOLLIS
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
19th of January, 6 pairs of combs, value 2s., the goods of 



Mary Ann Davies.






MARY ANN DAVIES
. I keep a stationer's shop at Deptford—I sell combs. On the 19th of January the prisoner came into my shop to offer matches for sale—I did not want any—I had an opportunity of seeing him, and I believe he is the boy—soon after he was gone I missed six pairs of combs from the window—it was then a little after twelve o'clock—soon afterwards the prisoner was taken by the officer—I saw these six pairs of combs, which I believe are mine—they were all fastened together when I lost them, but they have been cut.

Cross-examined by
MR. HORRY. Q. You have a good business? A. Not very good—I never saw the prisoner before—I was in the parlour when he came into the shop—there is a glass-door to the parlour—I was in the shop about three minutes before—there is a sliding-board at the back of the window, and that was open—I had looked into the window a very short time before, and had set the board to rights—I believe these combs are mine—they are very common—I merely speak to them from having seen them frequently, and from their size.





URIAH EDEN
. (police-constable R 81.) I took these combs from the prisoner at five o'clock that day—he was offering them for sale in Church-street, which is a mile from the prosecutrix's—he had another in a handkerchief—as they were common combs, I let him go—he was afterwards taken by another officer—I met him again about twenty minutes after.

             is my husband; we keep a public-house in Mark-lane

             told me on the 22d of August, I had too good an opinion of her, and if I would go to 
               
                  Ann 
                  Terril 
               



            , I should find things that I was unacquainted with. I went and advised with Mr. Winslow; he and I went to Terril's; she produced us two trunks, which she said belonged to Stanmore; I opened them; there were a great number of good things; lace, handkerchiefs, buckles, buttons, lawn, cloth cut for shifts, a silver snuff-box, and other things: I brought the boxes and things home: when Stanmore saw the boxes, she confessed the things were bought with money she had stolen from her master; she owned she had taken money out of his breeches pocket when he was gone to bed, and money out of the till; and that she had given tea, rum, and soap, to Calvert, who was my nurse, whom I thought I could have trusted with five hundred pounds. Calvert confessed before the Alderman, that it might be about three quarters of a pound of tea.

            . I was servant to the prosecutor; I have seen Stanmore take money and things, my master's property; but know nothing of the things in the indictment.
Stanmore said nothing in her Defence.
Calvert's Defence.
I am innocent of the charge.
Mr. Winslow. I have known Calvert six or seven years; I have heard Mrs. Wilkinson give her the best of characters.
Mrs. Wilkinson. I have recommended her to nurse to every place I could, and thought her as honest a woman as lived before this.

(L.) Stanmore was a second time indicted, for 


               stealing a pair of silk stockings, value 2 s. 6 d. 240 copper half-pence, two quarter-guineas, and seven shillings and six-pence in money, numbered
            , the property of 
               
                  
                     Joseph 
                     Wilkinson

                  Wilkinson 
               



            . When the trunks were brought home, as before mentioned, the prisoner immediately confessed taking about half a guinea out of the till, which I mentioned to her I had one day miss'd, when I left it open. She confessed at our house, and before the Alderman, she had taken about eleven guineas, and a pair of silk stockings, which she took out of a box. (Produced and deposed to.) She owned to taking two five shilling papers of half-pence.

            . On the 18th of August I miss'd a gold ring; the prisoner said she would lend me one till I got another; she brought it in the afternoon: she said a gentleman gave it her and several other things. On the Friday after 
               
                  Ann 
                  Terril 
               



             came to wash; then in conversation I found the prisoner had many things at her house; so it came out; I saw my mistress's silk stockings found.

            . The first money I saw the prisoner have, was three guineas: she gave me 1 l. 7 s. to buy her a pair of buckles and buttons. When my master was gone to Epsom races, I saw her take two five-and-three-penny pieces out of the till, and one shilling out of the sarthing-dish, and put it in her shoe: at night she told me how she had gone on, and desired me to do the same: I went and took eight shillings and six-pence out of the till: on the Friday following she took a paper of half-pence out of the bar, and half a crown in silver: on the Saturday following she took another paper; On the Monday following she took four shillings out of a bag of silver: after that there was a silver tankard under the brandy cask, with money in it; I saw her take out two thirty-six-shilling pieces, and some half-pence. She gave me money to keep for her, and had it again by three or four shillings at a time.
The prisoner said nothing in her defence.

JAMES DUNCAN
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
4th of Aug., 1 handkerchief, value 6d.; the goods of 



Joseph Wills, from his person.






ADOLPHUS TAYLOR
. I have been lodging with Mr. Green, in Stepney-fields—I was present in the Commercial-road, on the 4th of Aug., when Father Mathew was holding his meeting—I saw the prisoner go behind several gentlemen who were going to be pledged—I saw him go behind a gentleman, lift his coat, and put his hand in the pocket—there were three more with the prisoner who got round him—the prisoner then drew the handkerchief out of the prosecutor's pocket, and gave it to one of the three—the other

three ran away—I laid hold of the prisoner, called the police, and gave him into custody.

Prisoner. I was right away down at the other end of the mob—you said to the gentleman "Did you lose a handkerchief?"—he said no at first, and then you said, "This is the boy that took it."





JOSEPH WILLS
. I was on the ground—there was a great crowd—Taylor came and told me something, and I missed a silk pocket handkerchief, which had been in my pocket ten minutes before.

Prisoner. I was not near you when I was accused of this—I never saw it.





ROBERT AYLIFFE
 (policeman.) The prisoner was given into my custody—he said he knew nothing about it, and began to cry.
(CHARLOTTE DUNCAN, the prisoner's sister, gave him a good character.)




GUILTY. Aged 12.—Recommended to mercy by the Jury and Prosecutor
—



Transported for Ten Yean.—Parkhursi.

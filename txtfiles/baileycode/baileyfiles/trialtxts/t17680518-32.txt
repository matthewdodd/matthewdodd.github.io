            . I keep a clothes-shop in Chick-lane, I was standing at my door, and saw the two prisoners, Wilmer went in at Mr. Williamson's door, Beacham stood at the door; she took a pair of stockings from the window, and put them into her apron, and then went into the shop; I went and told Mrs. Williamson of it; after they were gone out she went and brought them back.
Williamson. My wife is not here, but I heard Beacham confess she took a pair of stockings my property.

            . I was the constable that had the prisoners in charge for stealing a pair of stockings; Beacham confessed she took a pair from the outside the window, and went into the shop, and dropped them at the end of the counter; there they were found (produced and deposed to by prosecutor.)
Wilmer's defence.
I am a poor hard working woman, I never saw the stockings.
Beacham's defence.
They asked sixteen-pence for a pair of shoes, that was too much money; we went down Field-lane, they came after us; we were taken to the watch-house, after that they brought a pair of stockings there to us.

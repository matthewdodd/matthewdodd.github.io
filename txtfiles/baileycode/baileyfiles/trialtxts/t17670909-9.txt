            . On the 29th of July I was gone out, and when I came back, my house was in an uproar; I was told they had got a thief; there was the prisoner; we searched his pocket, and found the knife, scissars, and tin pot upon him.

            . I am servant to Mr. Bays; I saw the prisoner take the pottage-pot and cover out of our wash-house; as he was going off, I asked him what he was going to do with it; he dropped it down, and went away; then the people went and took him; the other things were found upon him.
Prisoner's defence.
I never touched the pot.

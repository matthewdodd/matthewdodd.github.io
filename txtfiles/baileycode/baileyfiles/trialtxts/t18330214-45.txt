            . I am servant to James Morris; he keeps a pork shop, and sells pig's heads
 - he had lost one before this, and on the 18th of January he set me to watch; I hid myself behind some rabbits, and watched from six o'clock till half-past eight - I then saw the prisoner take the pig's head; I had not known him before - he took it from the window, but did not come into the shop; I jumped out, called Stop thief! and he was taken.

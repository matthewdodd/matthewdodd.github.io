MART ANN HACKER
. I am the wife of William Hacker, a stationer, in Margaret-street, Clerkenwell. On the 14th of Sept, the prisoner came to the shop for a sheet of writing paper—I served him, and he went out—I left the shop, and in a quarter of an hour I came in again, and saw the prisoner putting something into his pocket—I said if he did not pull it out I would give him in charge—he then pulled out one shawl, I said he had got something else, and he pulled out the other shawl, threw it at me, and ran out—I pursued, and a gentleman stopped him—he struck me two or three times in the mouth—these are my shawls—they had been behind the counter—he must have gone round, or have reached over to get them.

Prisoner. My pocket would not hold them. Witness. I saw him pull them both out—I had folded them up half an hour, before, and put them behind the counter.




GUILTY
. * Aged 25.—


Transported for Seven Years.

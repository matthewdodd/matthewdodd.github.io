JOHN TWIZELL WAWN. I live at No. 1, Marine-place, Commercial Road. On the afternoon of the 7th of April, I was coming from the Coal Exchange, and was going through St. Mary-at-Hill


 - I had got across the next street when a witness came up, and pointed out the prisoner - I ran after him, and took him - before I said any thing to him, he said, "I have not got your handkerchief" - I had not told him what I took him for - nothing was found on him.
Prisoner. You said, "You have picked my pocket" - I said, "I have not." Witness. I did not.

            . I was near St. Mary-at-Hill, on the 7th of April - at the corner of Cross-lane, there were six or seven boys - the prisoner and another, (a kind of a sailor boy) left them, and went through Church-passage - they winked at one another, and when they came to the prosecutor and a gentleman walking with him, the prisoner pulled out a handkerchief from his pocket, and gave it to the sailor boy, who went on by the gentlemen - I went and told the gentleman that the prisoner had picked his pocket - he pursued them - I am quite certain I saw him do it - he said, "I have not got your handkerchief," before any charge was made against him.

DAVID DAVIS
 and 




WILLIAM GOODWIN
 were indicted for

 stealing, on the 
11th of June, 1 handkerchief, value 1s.; the goods of 




Abraham Romanel, from his person.






ABRAHAM ROMANEL
. I am a tailor. On Saturday night last I was at the foot of Holborn, nearly opposite Farringdon-street—I heard a cry of "You have lost your handkerchief"—and the prisoners were going on, I took no notice of it—but soon after, a person caught hold of my collar, and said, "You have lost your handkerchief"—a female gave it to me—the officer took it from me, and said he must take charge of it—and he had the prisoners—I believe this is my handkerchief, but I have no mark on it—I had one a few minutes before, and this resembles mine, but I could not swear to it—I have no particular doubt of it—I have no doubt about it.





WILLIAM RAIT
. I am a patrol. I saw Davis take the handkerchief out of the gentleman's pocket—I had been watching both the prisoners lot some time, and there was another with them—I watched them about half a dozen yards, and then Davis took the handkerchief and handed it to Goodwin—the third one escaped—I stopped them, and Goodwin dropped it at his feet—a female passing by took it up, and gave it to the prosecutor—I took it out of his hand—he said it was his, but he would not swear to it.


Davis's Defence. There was a man going by, and he went and told that gentleman that it was I picked his pocket.

 , on the 25th of August
 last. It appeared that the Prisoner and two other went into the Prosecutor's House and had two Pints of Drink in about three Hours time; that they enquiring among themselves how the Reckoning should be paid, the Prisoner bid them run away with the Candlelocks, and had pay the Reckoning in the mean time; accordingly he call'd the Prosecutor to take his Reckoning, and stretcht himself out to receive his Change, there by giving his Companions the better Opportunity to run away with the Goods, which they did; the Prosecutor's Sister perceiving the matter ran after them, and tho' she could not overtake them, brought back two of the Candlesticks, which they dropt in their Flight, and the Prisoner was secured. The Prisoner in his Defence deny'd that he knew any thing of their going away with the Candle-sticks; but it appearing plainly by the Evidence that it was a Contrivance between all three of them, the Jury found him 


               Guilty to the value of 10 d.

             sworn. - I work in the warehouses in the Steel yard


; the prisoner was at work with me: On the 25th of May as we were going home to dinner, I saw the prisoner go behind the pile of chests and take a smock frock off the chest; I saw something stand out at the side, it looked very big; he put it across his shoulder; he had got, I suppose thirty yards from the warehouse-door when I called him back again; he came back very readily; I asked him what he had got there; he said he had only got a bit of indigo or two, and he thought it no harm; he was going to put them into a chest that was near him; I said, give them to me, that they may be put into the right chest; he pulled off his hat, and there were two or three bits in his hat; and then I sent for my master; the constable was sent for, and I delivered him the indigo.

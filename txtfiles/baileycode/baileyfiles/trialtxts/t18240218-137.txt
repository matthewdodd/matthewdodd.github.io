            , who lives in Broad-street, Ratcliff. On the 27th of January, Marshall told me something - I went out, and saw the prisoners about 100 yards off - together with three more. I took hold of Wall; he asked what I wanted - I said nothing but the meat he had taken; he then dropped something, and ran away, and I after him. I overtook him - he knocked me down and ran off again; I still followed, and caught him in Stepney-causeway. Marshall came up, and he was secured - and said he had not seen any bacon; I did not name what meat it was.
GEORGE MARSHALL. I am a shoemaker, and live at Ratcliff. I saw five boys lurking about Atkins's window - the sash was partly up; they walked by three times, and the third time I saw Wall take the bacon, and put it under his left arm; French was behind him; I went into the shop, and North went with me. They went down Vine-tavern. French was taken.

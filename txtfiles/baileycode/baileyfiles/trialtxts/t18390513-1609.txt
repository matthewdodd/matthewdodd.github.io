1609. 




JOHN BARKER
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
6th of May, 2 pieces of timber, value 16s., the goods of 



James John Carter.






WILLIAM COX
. I am a policeman. Mr. Carter has an unfinished house at the corner of Paul's-terrace, Islington—I saw the prisoner there between one and two o'clock in the day on the 6th of May—he brought one piece of timber from there, which he laid in the road—he then went and took another piece—I went and questioned him about it—he said he was sent by Mr. Thompson, of Pitfield-street—I made inquiries of some workmen there, and then took him to the station-house—he then said that Messrs. Gabriel and Son had a law-suit about the houses against Mr. Thompson, and that he was in Whitecross-street prison—I inquired, and found it was not true.





JAMES JOHN CARTER
. I was building these carcases—this timber is mine—it was for ceiling joists—it is worth about 16s.—I know nothing of the prisoner.

Prisoner's Defence. Mr. Thompson sent me for it.




GUILTY
.* Aged 40.—


Transported for Ten Years.
(There was another indictment against the prisoner.)

             sworn. - I am a baker
: On Tuesday night, in consequence of a suspicion, I marked some money in the till, the prisoner was my journeyman
; the next morning I got up at five o'clock, and missed two seven-shilling-pieces, five shillings in silver, eleven penny-pieces, and eleven old halfpence; I sent for a constable, but did not see him searched; I saw at Guildhall, two seven-shilling-pieces, and five shillings, which I knew to be mine.
Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. What did you mark them with? - A. A smith's file.
Q. Did you never see a file mark upon silver before? - A. Yes, but not like this.
Q.Suppose I were to shew you, out of mypocket, two seven-shilling-pieces, and some silver that had a file mark, should you know one from the other? - A. I don't know.
Q. How long has he lived with you? - A. Near two years.
Q. During that time, has he not maintained a good character? - A. I never knew any thing to the contrary.(Barrett, a constable, produced the money, which was identified by the prosecutor.)
The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.

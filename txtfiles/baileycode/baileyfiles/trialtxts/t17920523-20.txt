             sworn.
I lost a bar of iron; I suspected the prisoner, because he remained in the shop after the men went to dinner; then he went round to the back door of the front shop, and I saw him come away with the bar of iron; I stopped him, and asked him where he was going to sell it; he said, in Petticoat-lane: the prisoner was employed as porter
 or odd man
.
Prisoner. I leave it to the mercy of the Court.



               GUILTY
            .
Tried by the second Middlesex Jury before Mr. RECORDER.

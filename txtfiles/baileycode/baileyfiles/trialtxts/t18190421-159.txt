            . I am a green-grocer, and live in Oxford-street. On the 19th of March, about half-past two o'clock in the morning, I had been attending a party at the Red Lion, Cavendish-square


, and met the prisoner. She began pulling me about; as soon as I got from her, I felt my pocket, and found only 2 s. 6 d., there - I had 9 s. 6 d. I immediately charged her with robbing me; she declared she had not got a halfpenny about her. I was taking her to the watch-house, but she declared she would go no further; the watchman came, and took her to the watch-house. I had been no where with her.

            . I am a constable. I took the prisoner in charge; I searched her, but found nothing. I asked her if she had any thing in her mouth? she said she had not. I heard something rattle against her teeth, opened her mouth, and a half crown, and 4 s. 6 d. dropped out; she said it was the money that she had robbed him of.

            . As I was going down Fleet-street


, on the 15th of November, just after twelve o'clock at night, I felt something at my pocket; I turned about and saw my pocket book in the prisoner's hand; as there was not any person near me I was rather afraid, but I walked with him and kept my eye upon him, till we came to a watchman's stand; then I called the watchman over; and seized the prisoner, with my book in his hand.
The prisoner, in his defence, said, he was not near the prosecutor.
He called two witnesses, one of them seemed to have a very slight knowledge of him, the other gave him a good character.

On the 19th of July she ran away; I saw her in the street and had her brought back; I talked to her about robbing me of other things, and said I would forgive her. In the evening I missed these things Pilgrim brought them to my house.

            . My husband is a rag merchant. The prisoner came to my house between seven and eight o'clock in the morning, and left a bundle containing these articles; she said she had left Mrs. Gardener, and I endeavoured to persuade her to return - she said she would not. Soon after Mrs. Gardener came; she saw her and ran away.

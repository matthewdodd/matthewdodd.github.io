Thomas Popjoy. I live in Hanover-square


; the prisoner lodg'd with me three years and a half. I let her the room at 22 pence per week, with goods ready furnished. The things mention'd in the indictment were missing about the 20th of September. I took her up, and charg'd her with taking them; she owned that she had taken them, and told where they were, and they were found accordingly. (produced in court, and depos'd to.)
Mr. Brooks. I am a pawnbroker; I lent the prisoner 2 s. 7 d. on these goods.
Prisoner. I did intend to pay for the goods, and bring them again, but he took me up before I could get the money.

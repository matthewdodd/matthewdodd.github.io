THOMAS REAY
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
16th of November, 1 coat, value 20s., the goods of 



James Godwin.






JAMES GODWIN
. I am the driver of an omnibus. On the evening of the 16th of November, I came to the Bank, and left the omnibus in the care of Richard Dawson—I left my coat on the box, and missed it when I came back.





RICHARD DAWSON
. I was left in care of the omnibus—I was sent to fetch Godwin, and as I came back, I observed the prisoner getting up on the other side of the omnibus, with the coat on his shoulder—he went away with it—I did not know but Godwin had sent him for it, as he used to mind the omnibuses there sometimes—the coat has not been found—he was taken up in about ten minutes—I am sure he took it.





GEORGE PORTER
 (City-officer.) The prisoner was given into my custody in Mansion House-street—he had nothing with him.


Prisoner. I had not been there four minutes, when I was accused of stealing the coat—I was there when the coachman went to get something to drink, and remained there when he came out.





RICHARD DAWSON

re-examined. I was present when the officer took him—I said he was the young man—I had described him to the officer—he said he was innocent—I am quite sure he is the person I saw take it—I knew him before—I have seen him selling things in the streets—I have known him twelve months—I left the omnibus in charge of the time-keeper.




GUILTY.*—Aged 24. 


Transported for Seven Years.

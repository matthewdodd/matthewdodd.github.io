            . I am minister of Cannon-street-road Chapel


, it is Independent, or Congregational Dissenters, not of the Church of England. On Wednesday night, the 6th of September, there was service in the chapel, I used one of the robes, there were three in the vestry. I had a writing-desk, with papers in it. I left the chapel about nine o'clock, Hawkins was there then - he keeps the key. The names of the trustees are rightly stated in the indictment.


                  SAMUEL 
                  HAWKINS
               



            . I keep the keys of the chapel. The robes are kept in a closet in Mr. Reed's study, over the Committee-room, I keep the key of it. On this night I shut up the chapel, and locked every thing up. Next day, about five o'clock, I went and missed the carpet from the pulpit stairs, the Bible, writing-desk, and all the gowns were gone. No outer doors were broken open. I suppose somebody had concealed themselves there the night before. Mr. Reed's study door was broken open.


                  SAMUEL 
                  MILLER
               



            . I am an officer of Lambeth-street. I searched the prisoner's house in Rosemary-lane on the 12th of September, by a warrant. In a closet on the second floor I found the scarf or sash, and on the third floor, on a bed, a quantity of papers laid, which Mr. Reed claimed.

            . I was with Miller, and found a carpet in the garret.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
The Court ruled that the offence was not sacrilege, as the statute only affixed that protection to places of worship belonging to the Establishment.

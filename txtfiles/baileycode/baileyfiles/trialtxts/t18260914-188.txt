THOMAS JONES. I am an upholsterer
, and live in Hoxton-square


. This caddy was in my shop on the 29th of June - I turned round to speak to my son, and on turning back, I saw the caddy under the officer's arm.

            . I am a patrol. On the 29th of June I saw the prisoner and Lock together, for about an hour, in company with another person - they were near Mr. Jones' shop; I did not see any of them do any thing, but I saw Lock with this caddy under his apron - I stopped him, and took it back to the shop; I saw the prisoner turning round the corner, and I said, "This is one, take him;" and he was stopped by a carpenter; when I first saw them they were all close to the shop-window - when I saw Lock with the caddy, he was round the corner, not with Gayton; Gayton said he did not know Lock, and had not been with him - but I had seen them together an hour before.

            . I stopped the prisoner in Crown-street, within twenty yards of Mr. Jones' shop; I and Tyrrell had been watching the prisoner and Lock some time - the prisoner was running from the house when I took him.

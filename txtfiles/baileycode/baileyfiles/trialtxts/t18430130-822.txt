THOMAS POWERS
 were indicted for

stealing, on the 
12st of Jan., 30lbs. weight of rope, value 2s. 6d., the goods of 



John Churchin, in a vessel on the navigable 
river Thames.






ROBERT BARKER
. I am mate of the Richmond Packet, lying in the Thames—John Churchin is the master. This rope belongs to that packet.

Cross-examined by
MR. BALLANTINE. Q. Who had the care of this vessel? A. The captain, Mr. Churchin—I was absent from the ship about an hour.





JOSHUA JUDGE
. I am an inspector of the Thames Police. On Saturday night, the 21st of Jan., I saw the prisoners in a boat—I saw Smith get on to the Richmond, and soon after jump back—I boarded their boat, and found this rope in it—I said, "Where did you get this?"—Smith said a lighterman had sent them for it—I said, "Do you know his name?"—he said, "No"—I said I should take them to his vessel—Smith said, "It is no use to go, it did not come from there."

Cross-examined. Q. Smith seemed the active person? A. Yes—Powers took no part in the conversation—I cannot tell whether Powers was employed to row Smith.


Smith's Defence. I was sent after it by a lighterman, who said he would pay us for it—I did not go on board the vessel.

SMITH*—


GUILTY

Transported for Ten Years.

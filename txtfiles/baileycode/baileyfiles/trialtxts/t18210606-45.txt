; the prisoner had been discharged from a regiment of Veterans a few days before. I was billetted at the King's Arms, Westminster


. On the 21st of April, he slept in the same room with me. I went out about ten o'clock to parade, and when I returned I missed my shirts - I had seen them an hour before. I found him in ten minutes, with both my shirts on his back, over his own.

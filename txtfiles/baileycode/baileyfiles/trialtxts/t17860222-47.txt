; I saw the prisoner in my house on Tuesday last, the 21st instant, about three; I was shewn some pots by Mr. White, which were mine, I have seen the prisoner at my house before; he says, he is a bricklayer, I am sure when I went out, the day I lost the pots, I left him in the house.

             sworn.
I am a publican, I keep the Sun on Addle-hill, the prisoner came into my house last Tuesday the 21st, he sat drinking in my house, I suspected he had something in his pocket that he should not have; I saw the mark of a pot in his pocket, and I accused him, he took a quart and two pints out of his pocket, and he said, he had bought them, there was the mark within on the pots, with the Green Dragon; I sent to Mr. Witham that evening, and he came and sent for a constable, the constable took the pots.
(The pott deposed to.)
I was insensible, and I suppose these things were put into my pocket out of spite.
The prisoner called one witness to his character.

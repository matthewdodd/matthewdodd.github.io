            . I live in Silver-court; I was going to Bartholomew-fair along with 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Nevil 
               



             and 
               
                  Michael 
                  Brown 
               



            , on Saturday night, Sept. 6th, I desired them to take care of my cloak; when we were at the top of Hosier-lane


, I heard 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Nevil 
               



             cry out that there was a thief, this was between seven and eight in the afternoon; I looked round and saw a great mob of people, but I did not see the prisoner that night, till the Monday following; 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Nevil 
               



             had put my cloak into his pocket; the prisoner was secured, but the cloak was never found; it was in a handkerchief.
Q. What are you?
M. Iverson. I am a servant
.


                  Thomas 
                  Nevil 
               



            . I am a servant; I went to Bartholomew-fair along with 
               
                  Mary 
                  Iverson 
               



             and 
               
                  Michael 
                  Brown 
               



            ; her cloak was done up in a silk handkerchief; she desired I would take care of it; I put it in my right-hand coat pocket, in Hosier-lane; I was going to see the little man at the top of Hosier-lane; as I was standing among the mob, the prisoner took the cloak and handkerchief out of my pocket, I catched him at it; he ran out of the mob, and I after him; I catched hold of his coat; he threw them out of his hand, and two chaps took it up and ran away with it.
Q. Did you see him take it out of your pocket?
Nevil. I felt and saw him drawing it out.


                  Michael 
                  Brown 
               



            . I was with the young woman and Nevil; I carried the cardinal till we came into Hosier-lane; I said to Nevil, You have a pocket, put the cloak into it: I had not given it him five minutes before he called out, Mich, I am robbed. I saw the prisoner and Nevil, and the constable, all on the ground together; the constable charged me to aid and assist; we carried the prisoner before the city marshal; I offered him half a guinea to let us have the cloak; he said he knew nothing of it. The next morning came his wife, as she called herself, and two men, and offered to pay 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Nevil 
               



             for the cardinal if he would let him go; the city marshal said that could not be done.
Prisoner's defence.
I offered to pay for it in order to avoid the scandal of a prosecution; there was a mob, part were for going one way, and part the other, and in the scuffle the young man turned round and charged me with having the cardinal; then they said two boys had ran away with it; the mob was so great I could hardly stand on my legs; it is impossible, as his back was towards me, to see me if I had taken it out.

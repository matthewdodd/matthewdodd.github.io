(The case was opened by Mr. Knapp.)
THOMAS GLOVER sworn. - I am an underwriter
: On the 12th of August, the Prince of Wales's birth-day, I went to Vauxhall; when I returned I slept at the New Hummums, in Covent-garden


; I got there between two and three o'clock in the morning, and slept in the top story; I awoke about half past eight in the morning, and missed my watch; my eye-glass, and two Banknotes of one pound each; I afterwards saw the watch and the eye-glass at the Mansion-house; I have no doubt of their being mine, particularly the watch; I know nothing of the prisoner.
WILLIAM DALBY sworn. - I was chamberlain at the Hummums: On the 12th of August I shewed a person to bed, in No. 17, whom from his manner and the height of his person I believe to be the prisoner, but I cannot swear to his face; Mr. Glover came about two hours afterwards; I shewed him to bed in No. 23, opposite the prisoner's room; I have no doubt of his being the person; he was the first that went out in the morning.
Cross-examined by the prisoner. Q. You say you cannot swear to my face? - A. No.
Q. Did you see me after I went to bed? - A. No, when you came in I shewed you up stairs, and you gave me three shillings, saying there was sixpence for myself.
Q. How do you know that the person who slept in No. 17 was the first that went out in the morning? - A. I carried in your shoes, and left you to call a gentleman who was going away by the stage, and while I was calling him you ran down stairs; I described the prisoner before the Lord Mayor, and I have no doubt of his being the person.

                  FEATHER
               



             sworn. - I keep the Guildhall coffee-house; I am well acquainted with the person of the prisoner; he came to my house on the 18th of August; I was in bed; I was awoke by the waiter of the City coffee-house, informing me that the prisoner was in bed in my house; I immediately got up, and sent for a constable; I went to him, and desired him to put on his cloaths; I told him I was astonished at his coming to me again so soon; he asked me what I meant; I told him he had slept there on the 6th of May, and had robbed a gentleman; he said he had slept there on the 6th of May, but had not robbed any body; I was well convinced he was a desperate character, and desired the officer to handcuff him; he was then searched, and in one of his pockets, which he objected to have searched, the officer found an instrument similar to a chissel at one end; it was sunk below the level of his pocket, in a place appropriated for it; a person might have put his hand to the bottom of the pocket, and not have felt it; he also found upon him a bunch of keys and a watch; at the Compter he was searched further, and on his person were found two one-pound notes, a seven-shilling piece, and five shillings and sixpence in silver, and I think two half guineas; he then had on white shag breeches and boots; the next morning he had nankeen pantaloons.(

            , a constable, repeated the circumstances of the prisoner's apprehension, as they had been stated by the last witness.)

                  TIPPER
               



             sworn. - I am a constable; I was ordered by the Lord Mayor to go to the Compter, and examine the place where the prisoner had been; I was informed he had been left at the necessary; I went there, and on the righthand fronting the necessary was a bulk seven or eight feet high; I got up there, and in the further corner I found these white shag breeches, with an eye-glass in the pocket - (Produces them.)
Mr. Glover. I have no private mark upon the eye-glass, but I have no doubt of its being mine from its appearance, and from the focus of the fight; I have had it about six or eight months; the watch I am sure is mine,

            , No. 1825.
ROBERT JOY sworn. - I am in partnership with Thomas Harrison; I sleep in the house; the rent and taxes are paid by us jointly; Mr. Harrison never sleeps there.
Prisoner's defence. If my trial had been put off till next Sessions, I could have brought evidence to shew how I came in possession of the watch.

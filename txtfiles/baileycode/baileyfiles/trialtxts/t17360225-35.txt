            . I keep a Publick House
. On the 20th of January the Prisoner and 2 more came into my House and call'd for Drink; they went away without paying the Reckoning and took the Mug with them. The next Day it was offer'd to Mr. Bond a Silversmith, and we having had Advertisements sent from Goldsmith's-Hall to all the Shops, he sent me Word, and I came to take up Evans.
Bond. Mrs. Evans, and Mrs. Parker came to my Shop early in the Morning, January 21st. Evans had got the Pot under her Apron, she pull'd it out, and Parker said, what don't you know her? 'Tis Mrs. Evans at the end of the Alley. I had a suspicion of them, but I weigh'd it, and told them it came to 4 l. 18 s. 9 d. Evans said if it came to no more she should lose Money by it, for she had lent 7 l. on it. I advised her to acquaint the Person she had it of, that it was worth no more; and so they went away. About an Hour afterward, Parker came and asked me if that was the most I would give for it. I told her, it was as much as it came to, at 5 s. an Ounce. Well, says she, Mrs. Evans has try'd, and she can't get more, so she desires you to send the Money for it. No. I told her I did not care to meddle with it at all: Why, says she, you don't think it stolen, do you? you don't hear me charge you, says I. As soon as she was gone. I search'd my Warnings, and did not find the Pot advertis'd But about out an Hour and a Half after, the Man brought a Notice of it: says I, the Pot was here about an Hour and half ago, a Neighbour of mine has got it to sell. I was telling another Neighbour this Master, and he say'd he knew Silvester, and would tell him, and bring him to me. He did so, and I told him, if I had had his Warning a little sooner, I could have stop'd the Pot. He was for having a Warrant to take them up, but I desired him to go and speak to them first. I went with him, and took Evans aside, and told her I had got a Customer, who wanted such a Thing; she said it was too late, she had sold it to another for more, and to one too who had asked no Questions. He got a Warrant for them; and Evans told us then that she had sold it to Mr. Green in the Minories I went thither, but he had it not: but at the next Shop, (Mr. Boddy's we found it.

            . The Prisoner at the Bar and another Woman, came to my Shop the 22d of January. The other Woman whose Name was Parker, had been in my Shop often. I gave 4 l. 18 s. 6 d to Evans for the Pot.

            . The Man at the Bar and two more came to drink at our House: They sat very near the Bar, and I saw them serv'd with every Thing they call'd for: The Reckoning came to 19 d. halfpenny; and while I stept up Stairs, tho' I staid not above a Minute, before I could get down again, they were gone, without paying a Farthing, and had taken the Mug with them.
Prisoner George. I was sick at the Queen's Head at Shoreditch when one of the Men came in and ask'd me if I knew 
               
                  Daniel 
                  Malden 
               



             and Country-Jack, they asked me, if they were in the House; I knew nothing at all of the Mug, nor of the three Men, who were drinking there.
Prisoner Evans. Mrs. Parker brought the Mug to me, she desired me to sell it for her: she owed me 20 s. and I was to be paid when the Mug was sold. I went with her to sell it, and know nothing how she came by it.
- Matthews. The Day Evans was taken up she told me, she had had the Mug 4 Years, and had lent 7l. upon it. I press'd her to tell the Truth, and then she said she found it in the Entry, as she was shutting up her Windows.
- Bond. When we had her before the Justice, he told her in our hearing, she was in an Information, for receiving Lead and other stolen Goods.

Several Persons appeared to the Character of Evans, but George had nothing material to say in his Defence.

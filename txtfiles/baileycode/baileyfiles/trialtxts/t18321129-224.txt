CHARLES JAMES. I am a camp-equipage maker
, and live in Coventry-street. On the 30th of November, about twelve o'clock at night, I was going home, and in King-street, Covent-garden


, I missed from my pocket a pocketbook, containing a bill for 15l.; I was close to the houses - a person tried to pass between me and the houses; there was not room, and during that time I felt a motion at my pocket - I looked round, and saw a person walking away from me; I put my hand to my pocket, and my book was gone - I went after the person, and the Policeman laid hold of him; it was the prisoner - I saw him drop the book while the Policeman held his collar.

            . I am a Policeman. I took the prisoner, as Mr. James said he had taken his pocket-book; both my hands were engaged - I looked down, and saw the pocket-book slip down at his feet; he seemed surprised that he should be apprehended; there were two youngsters there, who ran off, but I could not follow them.(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I had been to Chelsea, looking for employ, and then went to see my mother - I met two young men, and had a glass or two with them, and in King-street I was charged with this.

SARAH HALL
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
7th of September, 1 shawl, value 5s., the goods of 



Robert Prior; and that she had been before convicted of felony.






DEBORAH PRIOR
. I am the wife of Robert Prior, and five in East-street, Greenwich. About half-past seven o'clock in the evening of the 7th of September, I saw this shawl safe—I saw the prisoner there hat evening—I went out, and when I was going away I went to put my shawl on, and it was gone.





JOHN LOVICK
. I am shopman to Mr. Nash, a pawnbroker at Green-wich. The prisoner pawned this shawl in the evening of the 7th of September.

Prisoner. Q, Have you seen me in the shop before? A. Yes, I think I have, but not frequently—I can swear you pawned this, you said you had taken it out the day before for 4*.





WILLIAM KIRBY
. (police-constable R 155.) I went after the prisoner—she said, "I know what you want me for." I asked where the duplicate was—she said she had burnt it—that she had pawned the shawl at Mr. Nash's, but she should not have taken it had she not been drinking.





WALTER SCOTT BARRY
. (police-constable R 196.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—she is the person.




GUILTY
 Aged 40.—


Transported for Seven Years.

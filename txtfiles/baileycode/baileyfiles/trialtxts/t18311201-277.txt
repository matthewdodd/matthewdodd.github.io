             RUTHVEN. My father set me up in business as a tobacconist
 - my shop is at No. 16, Wych-street


. On the 8th of November the prisoner came and asked for half an ounce of returns - I served him; he gave me a shilling, and I gave him change - he then asked to look at a snuff-box in the window - I showed him one, and said the price was a guinea; he then asked to look at another, which was 16s. - he put on the lid, and ran away with it; there was another person with him, and we think he run away with another box - my uncle followed the prisoner, and just as he got to the New-church, in the Strand; the Policeman took him.

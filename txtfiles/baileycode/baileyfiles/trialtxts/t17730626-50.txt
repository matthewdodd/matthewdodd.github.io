            : we have a house at Hampstead


. Last Friday was se'ennight there was lost out of the hen roost, a cock, three hens, and five chickens; the hen house was broke open. I advertised a reward for detecting the offender, and in consequence of that advertisement I found at Mrs. Norman's one cock and one hen. (They are produced and deposed to by the prosecutrix.) Five of the chickens were in the custody of a constable.

            . It is my business to buy and sell fowls and birds: I live in the City Road. On Saturday se'ennight the prisoner brought two cocks, six hens, and fifteen chickens; I bought two cocks, six hens, and five of the chickens; the prisoner told me where he lived, but gave a wrong description as I found upon enquiry.
The constable. I went into the public house, and found among many other fowls in the prisoner's custody, the two fowls produced.

I could have good evidence to morrow to prove I came honestly by them.

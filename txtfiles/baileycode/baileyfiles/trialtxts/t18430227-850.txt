ELIZABETH SARAH MAGNESS
. I am forty years of age, and am the wife of Thomas Magness. I fill the situation of upper bar-maid at the Auction Mart hotel—I was there for eleven months before this happened—it is an hotel behind the Auction-mart in Bartholomew-lane, and communicates with it—the lower part of the hotel is called the tap, and that part is under my management—Mr. Baker is the keeper of the hotel—the prisoner was potman at the tap—he had been there five months—I noticed that his behaviour was very cross on the Sunday previous to the 12th of Dec.—he has attempted to kiss me, and I rebuked him for it—I have heard that he is twenty-one years old—he went by the name of John in the establishment—the housemaid is called Ann—on the evening of the 12th of Dec she complained, in his presence, that she and John had been locked in the cellar—I took no notice of it—it was afterwards mentioned to me that John and her had been in the bed-room together—in consequence of that, about a quarter to nine o'clock, when the prisoner came into the tap, I told him he had better be minding his work than playing—he said he had not been playing—I said it was false, he had—I said he had better be clearing his tables, that I had been clearing them all day, and he had better be clearing them himself—that was part of his duty—I told him he was in the cellar just now, referring to what I have mentioned—he said it was not his fault—he did not say he locked the door—somebody locked him in I believe—when I scolded him, he seemed very surly and sullen—he cleared the tables, and after that he sat down on one of the tables—there were customers there, and he waited on them—the sulky or sullen appearance continued—I had occasion to go past where he was sitting, and he said something to me—I did not hear what it was—I felt offended—I thought he was jeering me, and I called him a forward vagabond—later in the evening, he came to the bar for some porter, which he took out to a customer—when I spoke to him I scolded him about his work, and he said, "Go to heaven with

you"—he was not long gone with the beer—I saw him come back—nothing more passed after that till Ann called him—she said, "Mrs. Baker wants you"—it was about a quarter or half-past nine o'clock—he left the tap in consequence of that and remained away till about eleven o'clock, which is the time we usually begin to prepare to shut up—it was his duty to shut up the shutters—I desired him to be called for that purpose—Sarah, another servant, called him—I did not hear him answer—he did not come—I rang for him—I did not hear him make any answer to the bell, and at half-past eleven, as he did not come, I proceeded to shut up the shutters myself—I did not fasten the door, as there was still some customers in the house—I came in again and attended to them—I returned to the bar—the customers did not stop long—they only came to the bar and had what they wanted—there are two gates outside the house—I proceeded to lock them at about a quarter to twelve—there are steps and a sort of iron railing—the whole is below the level of the street, down in a sort of area—I was fastening the right hand gate first, inside, intending to come back—I had gone up the steps to get to it—a young man, a customer, who had been in the house, seeing me come up the steps, came and asked what I was doing—I could not find the right key, and he helped me—I had never fastened the gate before—he was not on the outside—he had been having something to drink—he did not go outside—another door is left open till twelve, and when he did go he went out that way—while I was fastening the right hand gate, at the top of the steps, the prisoner came half-way up the steps, as if to help me fasten the gate—I told him I did not want him—I said I had done the rest part of the work and I could do that—he said, "Go to hell with you," went down the steps, and stopped at the bottom—after I had closed the gate I came down, and the customer who had helped me came down with me—we passed the prisoner, standing at the bottom of the steps, and went into the tap, leaving him there—I served the customer with liquor—while he was drinking it I observed the prisoner come in—he said nothing—he passed through the tap and went in a direction that would take him to his bed-room, which is on the same floor as the tap, right facing it, at the left hand side of the building, about the middle of it—there is a door going out of the tap—the bed-room is not behind the bar—as you stand at the bar you can see his bed-room—it is on the other side of the building, a very little distance from the bar, just across the passage—there is the mart door about the middle of the passage, at the back of his bed-room—it was not my duty to fasten that door, it was his duty, but I went to do it—I took the key with me and a light in my hand—when I got into the passage, to fasten that door, I observed the prisoner towards the right, sitting on a pair of steps which were there—I went down the passage, in a direction from where he was sitting, leaving him behind me—as I went along I heard something behind me, and felt both his hands behind me, one on each shoulder—he did not say anything—I pushed him from me, and said, "Be quiet, sir, or I will call Mrs. Baker"—I proceeded to put the key in the door to fasten it—I was quite separated from him at that time—I heard something click, and just as I was in the act of turning the key I felt myself shot—I heard a report, as of the discharge of fire-arms—I heard the click as I was putting the key in the door—it was followed by the report instantly—I fell—I did not lose my senses at first, I fell on the ground immediately, it knocked me down—my falling with the candle in my hand put it out, and the place was in darkness—before I lost my senses I heard him say, "Woman, what have I done?"—after I laid there two or three minutes I got up—it was after I became insensible, immediately after he said, "Woman, what have I done?" and he fell down near me—I had said nothing thing myself before he used that phrase, nor at any time before I lost my senses—before I became insensible, I felt something trickling in my hand—it

was afterwards found that it was blood—upon that I became insensible for a minute or two, and then I got up—I do not recollect rising, but I found myself on my feet again—I left the prisoner on the ground, I think—I went to the tap—I believe I tried to open the door to get into the street, but could not—I forgot I had locked it—when I turned round from the door I met the prisoner—there was a gas-light there, which reflects inside, and gave me an opportunity of seeing his person—I put my hand to my side, and said, "What have you done?"—he stood firmly fixed before me, with his right arm up, with a knife in it—he said, "Now I'll finish you"—there was blood on the knife—I put my hands together, and said, "For God's sake spare me," and rushed past him, screaming "Murder"—when I left that spot I was again in darkness—I did not fall during my progress—I scrambled along the wall, and eventually succeeded in getting up to my bed-room, which is along the passage and across the yard, in the upper part of the same building—the prisoner followed me—as I was going along he said, "For God's sake stop, and I will not hurt you"—I think those were the exact words, or "Come to me, and I will not hurt you"—he said it more than once—that was while I was going along the passage—it was all dark there—I got into my bed-room—he came up after me—I hid myself by the side of the bed, and heard him say, "Where is she?"—the room was in darkness—he was in the bed-room at that time—soon after that the house was alarmed, a medical man was sent for, the police came in, and the prisoner was taken.

Cross-examined by
MR. PAYNE. Q. Did you not represent yourself at the time you took the situation at the Auction-mart as a widow? A. Yes—from anything that I can tell the prisoner did not know that I was otherwise—he did not appear to be very partial to me in particular, not more than he was to the rest—he did kiss me once, and then I pushed him from me, and said, "Be quiet"—he has attempted it several times, and he has others the same—he never succeeded but once, and then I scolded him for it—I do not know how long before this 12th of Dec. it was that he first attempted to kiss me—not long before this occurrence—I think one night when Mr. Baker went out to dinner—it was my brother, Mr. Moton's birthday, I and one of the other females sat up for him—that was the time he succeeded in kissing me—he had not his arm round my waist on that occasion—I swear that—he put his arm or elbow on my shoulder—my back was to him, and I instantly pushed it off—Sarah was with me—she was at the side of the fire-place—she was sitting on a chair—I believe her eyes were shut—I do not think she was asleep—I am sure she was not—I never had a picture a likeness of myself—a young person I know, named Jones, had—she was not in the house—she called there—I believe she asked the prisoner if he would fetch the likeness for her—it was being repaired—I did not hear her ask him—I do not know that any body asked me for that picture unless it was her—she asked me for it—I said I had not got it, John had got it.

COURT. Q. How long was this before the 12th of Dec? A. I cannot tell—about three weeks before.

MR. PAYNE. Q. Did you give him some money to buy a scarf which he wore round his neck? A. Never in my life—I never heard of such a thing—he wore a scarf round his neck—I swear I did not give him the money to buy it—he did not make me a present of a pair of boots—he bought a pair for me, but he had the money for them—I gave it him—Henry was to have fetched them—there was a conversation in the house about something having happened with the prisoner in my bed-room—I never spoke to the prisoner privately about the reports—I was in a passion when I spoke to him—the 12th of Dec. was on a Monday, and about a month or five weeks before that, when I heard of this, I made a complaint to the prisoner—I did not cry—I went up

stairs to put my dress on on Thursday morning, and Sarah told me what Mary should say—I said I would not put up with that—I came down stairs, stopped in the bar a few minutes, spoke to Sarah on the subject, and told her it was a scandalous shame—I went out of the bar, and was running across the lobby, and saw the prisoner there—I was going to open the parlour door to speak to somebody in the parlour about it, and he would not allow me—I said, "How dare you, sir, say I opened the door and let you out of the bed-room?"—he said he did not say any such thing—I said, "I will not have my character taken away by such apoor beggarly wretch as you"—he was going to say something to me, and I said, "Don't talk to me, you beggarly wretch, don't," and I left the place—I made no complaint to Mr. or Mrs. Baker about this during all the time between this and the 12th of Dec.—I spoke to him again about it at night in the presence of Sarah—I do not recollect that he said the best thing I could do was to tell Mrs. Baker, and she would discharge him—he might have said so—I never told him I would not tell Mrs. Baker—I did not have another conversation with him on the same subject a few days before the 12th of Dec.—I never spoke to him after that Thursday night—I do not think he has made attempts to kiss me after that—I swear I have not allowed him to kiss me frequently since that time—he never told me that what with my fretting, and the others talking about this it would drive him out of his mind—he did not stab himself in the breast in my presence with a knife—I swear I never had any conversation of this kind with him after the one on Thursday, the month before—I never had any private conversation with him at all—I had no conversation with him on the night this happened—I did not tell him then that I had disgraced myself through him, and that my brother would hear of it—I never told him any such thing—when I was in the passage, previous to being shot, he did not put his left arm across my neck—he only put his two hands on my shoulder—I believe he kissed me then, and that made me push him away—I felt his face or his head at the side of my face, and I pushed him from me, and said, "Be quiet, sir"—he did not kiss me, and say he had come to take leave of me for ever—he never opened his lips—he did not kiss me—he put his face by the side of mine, and I pushed him from me on the instant—it was not at that moment that the pistol went off—he put one hand on each of my shoulders in this manner—I do not know where the pistol was at that time—I did not feel it against me at all—he did not turn my head round at all, and put his lips to my face—I never saw his face—he did not put his head over my shoulder, and put his lips to my face—he put the side of his face or head against the side of mine, and I pushed him from me—when he said, "Now I'll finish you," he was standing directly opposite to me—when I turned round from the street door that I was trying to get out at, he came after me—he was before me at the entrance to the tap—he was in the tap, and I was in the tap.

Q. What was there to prevent his carrying his threat into execution if he ever meant it? A. I put my hands together, and rushed past him, as he was just coming to plunge the knife into me—I will swear he said, "Now I will finish you," not "Now I will finish it"—that was after I was shot, but I had my senses—there was nobody else there at that time—he never said to me that he wished he was in heaven, and I was there with him—when I got up stairs I found my clothes on fire from the pistol—I am confident the prisoner did not help me up off the ground when he said, "O woman! what have I done?"—I laid there a few minutes—as soon as I was up I left him laying there—I hardly remember rising, but I know I got up by myself—I said, "I am on fire, put it out," when I was up stairs—he was not near me then—he was down stairs—he was not in the room then—he might be coming up the stairs—I knew afterwards that the blood trickling on my hand came

from his throat—it was not blood from myself—I suppose it most have been from his throat—I know Mary Jones—she has been living in the service of Mrs. Baker twice—she came the second time five or six weeks after I did—she slept with me—she was living there at the time this happened—it was on the Thursday after the Monday that he got in at the window that I first heard of his being in the bed-room with me—that was about a month or five weeks before the 12th of Dec.—I did not say anything about what had been said to Mr. or Mrs. Baker, because Mary, the kitchen-maid, begged and prayed of me not—she is the person who slept with me—I do not think they call it a recess that is in the room—it is an awkward made room—the other bedstead stands exactly opposite ours—you might reach one from the other—I was awoke in the night, by Mary Jones saying the window was open—she did not say there was somebody in the bed—I did not say it was all nonsense—she never said there was anybody in the bed till the Thursday after the transaction—I got out of bed—after that Mary Jones got out, and got a light, as I could not find the lucifers, never having occasion for them myself—I was sitting in the bed when she said there was somebody under the bed—she begged of me not to say anything about bis being found there—she said Mrs. Baker would think he came in to rob the house if I said anything about it—she said, "For God's sake don't say anything about it, Mrs. Baker is such a very suspicious woman"—I did not say to her,"Don't say anything about it"—I never in my life gave her anything to drink not to say anything about it—I never thought of such a thing—when I complained to the prisoner of his having been locked in the coal-cellar with Ann, he said it was no fault of his, he did not lock the door—that was when I was in the tap, scolding him—after that I was friendly with him with respect to the business—I spoke to him concerning the business, but nothing further, no further than I could help—I did not speak to him for two days after the Monday, not the next day, and very little the day after he was found in the bed-room—on the third day, after I heard what I did, I called him a beggarly wretch—he begged my pardon, and said he would never do it again—Sarah was in the tap-room when I scolded him on Thursday night, and I said it was a planned thing between Mary and him—I should think Mary is as old as myself—I scolded him several times for being so much in the kitchen, and neglecting his tap-room—I have not seen him take any liberty with Mary—I was never in the kitchen—my husband was in the habit of coming there while I was there—nobody knew he was my husband—I think the prisoner spoke to me one day about the man that used to come to see me two or three times a week—he said one day, "Do you know the person that is there?"—I said, "Yes, I know him"—he said, "I dreamed last night that he stabbed me"—I did not tell him that he was my husband—he knew I knew him by speaking to him—this was more than a week before the 12th of Dec.—it must be more than two or three months, I should think—I cannot recollect, I am sure.

MR. BODKIN. Q. What was your motive in representing yourself as a widow when you applied about the situation? A. Mr. Baker wanted a bar-maid—I went after the situation for my daughter, who is turned eighteen—I saw Mrs. Baker—she asked who it was wanted the situation—I said my daughter—she said she was too young, she would rather have such a person as myself—I said I should be very happy to serve her, as I intended going out when my daughter went out—as I came out she said, "I suppose you are a widow? "—I said, "Yes," as I thought my having a husband would be objected to—my husband is very much afflicted, and I thought it would do him good my going out—there was a picture in the possession of somebody I

knew—it was not Jones who was in the establishment, a different person altogether—on one occasion she had asked the prisoner to fetch the picture—I had nothing to do with his having it—I did not ask him for it—I knew he had got it, because I saw it—I knew he went for it from the shop—it had a new glass put into it—she thought I had got it, and came to me for it—the prisoner and Henry were allowed to go out on errands for me—I never went out but once in three months—I asked Henry several times to get me a pair of boots, and he did not—the prisoner was going out for oil one Saturday night, and he said he would bring them in, and he did—the room I slept in is up one flight of stairs—Sarah and Ann sleep in the other bed—Ann has left—Sarah is here—on my oath I did not know of the prisoner's being in the room—I was no party to his being there, and had no reason to expect him there—Mary Jones was in the bed, and the other two in their bed—when I was locking the door on the night of the 12th, the prisoner put his hands flat on my shoulder—I am sure at that time he had no such weapon as a pistol in either hand—at the moment I pushed him from me I went to put the key into the door, and when I had put it in, I heard the click, while I, was putting it in, and as I was turning the key he shot me—the moment he said, "Now I'll finish you," I rushed past him, and screamed "Murder!"





SELINA CUSHWAY
. I was called Sarah at the Auction-mart tap—I had been there about nine months, as under barmaid under Mrs. Magness—I remember the night of the 12th of Dec.—Mr. and Mrs. Baker and the family were gone to the theatre—about twelve o'clock I was with Mrs. Magness in the bar—about eleven o'clock she told me to call the potman Cannell, to shut up the shutters—we used to shut up the shutters about that time—I went and called Cannell—I found him in his bed-room—he said he was coming—he did not come—Mrs. Magness went out after that to put the shutters up herself—she went to fasten the outer iron gate—the prisoner went out after her—I remember after that her going to secure the mart door in the passage—she took a candle with her—I saw the prisoner follow her, and soon afterwards I heard Mrs. Magness say, "Be quiet, leave me alone"—it was in a middling tone, between a good-natured and an angry tone—it appeared in an angry tone then—in about a minute or two I heard the report of a pistol, and heard Cannell say, "O woman! what have I done?"—I got out of the window, and ran for the police, and a doctor—I was very much alarmed—a policeman got in.

Cross-examined. Q. Had you heard, about ten o'clock that evening, anything said by Mrs. Magness to the prisoner about Ann, the housemaid? A. Yes, she scolded him—he said Ann had no business in his room, and it was not his fault—I afterwards saw him in the scullery—I said, "Why did you try Mrs. Magness when she was in anger?"—I meant tried her temper—I was afraid Mrs. Magness would be angry, and tell Mrs. Baker, and then she would be angry with him—he said, "I wish I was in heaven, and Mrs. Magness was with me"—I do not know that Mrs. Magness is of rather captivating manners—I had seen the prisoner kiss her about three or four times—the last time might have been about three or four weeks before the 12th of Dec.—I remember the rumour about the matter in the bed-room—it was about a fortnight before the 12th of Dec.

MR. CLARKSON. Q. Have you any means of fixing accurately the time, whether it was a fortnight or more? A. No, I have not—I have seen the prisoner actually kiss Mrs. Magness three or four times—she always told him to be quiet—he once attempted to kiss me—I never saw him try to kiss Jones—my bed was close to Mrs. Magness's—Mrs. Baker is not now ill in bed—she is not confined to her bed.


COURT. Q. Are you living there now? A. Yes, I saw Mrs. Baker up this morning—she is a very old woman.





WILLIAM BAKER
. I keep the Auction-mart hotel—my wife might be able to come here as a witness if it was particularly desired, but I can bring a certificate from my doctor—she is very unwell, very nervous and in very infirm health.

Cross-examined. Q. How long was the prisoner in your service? A. Five or six months—he was with me for a fortnight before, and came back to me—he was the best servant I ever had in the house.





JAMES SMITH
. I am waiter at the tap of the Auction-mart coffee-house—I go by the name of Henry there—I remember the talk in the house some time ago about the prisoner being in the women's bed-room—the prisoner gave me an account of it a few days afterwards—he told me he went up to the window out of a joke to see them get into bed, and that after they were in bed, he lifted the window and got into the room, that he fell asleep by the side of the bed, and might have slept two or three hours—when be awoke he endeavoured to leave the room, but the door was fastened—in endeavouring to open it the noise awoke Mrs. Magness and the kitchen-maid—they got out of bed to see if there was any person in the room—I am not positive whether he said they both got out or only one; at all events, the kitchen-maid got out, lit a candle, and closed the window, when he saw that that was the case, he got under the bed, that the kitchen-maid fancying she heard a noise the second time, got out and found him in that position—he said neither Mrs. Magness or any one else was aware he was in the room till the noise awoke them.

Cross-examined. Q. You had spoken to him about it, I suppose? A. I had—we were on very friendly terms—we never quarrelled the whole time he was in the housr—he did not appear more partial to Mrs. Magness than servants should be—I was more in the bar than any other room, by Mrs. Baker's desire.

MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did you observe any improper familiarity on Mrs. Magness's part? A. Not the slightest, to any of the servants.

MR. PAYNE. Q. You did not sleep there, did you? A. No, I sometimes sat up for Mr. Baker when he was out, and sometimes slept there—my time of leaving depended on the time the customers went.





HENRY CHAPMAN
 (City police-constable, No. 648.) On the 12th of December about midnight, I was on duty near the Auction-mart tavern—I heard the report of a pistol or fire-arms, and in about two minutes I heard a female crying, "Help, help"—I went near and found Cushway standing opposite the door of the Auction-mart tavern—in consequence of what she said, I got into the house at last by the door being opened by Mrs. Baker—I went through the further end of the coffee-room—I called out for the prisoner—I ultimately found him on the top of the stairs, and took him into custody—he said, "Here I am, here I am; what have I done, what have I done? "—I then apprehended him—he said at the bottom of the stairs, "What a coward I must be, to shoot the woman I love, and that has been so kind to me"—I had charged him with shooting at Mrs. Magness, but said nothing to induce a conversation from him—he attempted to tear his heart out—he appeared to be very much excited.

Q. In what way did he attempt to tear his heart out? A. By putting his hand into his waistcoat, and saying, "Could I but tear my heart out," and he pulled his hair violently—when I got him to the foot of the stairs he fell—I then saw he had cut his throat—I said, "You have cut your throat"—he said, "Yes, I have"—I immediately sent for a surgeon—after giving him

into the charge of Edwards, I went to see for Mrs. Magness—the prisoner said she was up stairs—I saw her in the bed-room in the arms of a person who was supporting her—I returned, and found the prisoner in Edwards's custody—after his throat was dressed, I asked him where the pistol was—he was on a form in the coffee-room—he said he had thrown it down in the passage—I went to the passage, where I saw the blood, and found the pistol—a little further on in the passage I found a razor-case, four or five yards from the pistol—I then went to search the bar, which is about four yards from where I found the pistol and razor-case—I found a knife on the bar counter, open, and wet with blood—I returned to the prisoner—he said while in the coffee-room, "Take the razor from my pocket—I have a razor in my pocket"—I saw Edwards take a razor from his right hand pocket, wet with blood—this now produced is it—I produce the pistol, razor-case, and clasp-knife—as we went through Bishopsgate-street to the station, he said, "O that woman! that woman!"—I took him from the station to St. Thomas's Hospital, and remained with him all night—he told me he had bought the pistol in Little Bell-alley for the purpose of shooting cats, and he had shot one about six weeks previous, and during that time the pistol had been loaded in his bed-room—he said be could not account where his senses could have been to have hurt the woman he loved, that she was in the act of locking the door, when he drew out the pistol and shot her, that he immediately cut his own throat, and they both fell to the ground together.

Cross-examined. Q. You sat up with him at the hospital at night? A. Yes, two nights—I had no more conversation with him—he was very restless indeed all the first night—there was no one present except the nurse when he made this statement—she was not near the bed—he said he had dreamed on the Friday night before that he had shot the same woman, and he little thought he should have done so in reality—he said she was very obstinate, and would not let him fasten a gate—I did not write down the conversation—the conversation about buying the pistol in Bell-alley was the first night, and about shooting her and their falling together on the Tuesday—he was not restless all the night, but till about midnight—he made the statements to me during the time he was very restless—he said Betsy seeing herself on fire got up and ran into the bar, and said, "For God's sake put the fire out"—that he got up and ran after her, and she cried out, "Loosen my stays"—that he drew the razor for the purpose, and on that she became frightened and got away from him—he afterwards cried bitterly, and went off to sleep—I was with him from five o'clock in the afternoon till eight in the morning, but not in the day time—I asked him once whether he wished to make any confession, if he did, I would send for the surgeon that it might be taken down—he said he should not say anything about that till he knew the fate of the woman.

MR. CLARKSON. Q. What he said was on Tuesday night, was it not? A. Tuesday night or Wednesday morning—I never used any threat or inducement to him to converse with me—he said it of his own free will—the way he talked induced me to say if he wanted to make a confession I would send for a surgeon—he said he would not say anything about the provocation he had for doing it till he heard the fate of the woman—I am quite certain of that.





JAMES JOHN ADAMS
. I am the medical person who attended Mrs. Magness on the night in question—I found her standing, partly leaning against the bed—I caused her to be undressed, and examined the wound—there were two wounds, one at the upper edge of the eighth rib, on the right hand, and the other on the left side, opposite the cartilege of the sixth rib, about two inches below the heart, but that would vary in different individuals—I do not remember to have seen a pistol or gun-shot wound before, but I believe

it to be so—I did not see the ball found in ber stays—I picked it up myself—I have applied it to the pistol—it appears to be a rifle-ball—this ball would have inflicted the wound—it must have passed through her body, from the back to the left side, about two inches below the heart—I believe the lungs to have been perforated—such an injury is very dangerous to life—she continued in imminent danger till the middle of Thursday, the 18th—when she recovered a little I had some account of the transaction from her—I had a conversation with the prisoner about it—I said nothing to induce him to make a confession to me, nor threatened him if he did not—I requested to know if two balls were in the pistol or not—I asked him if he had ever any connexion with Mrs. Magness—he hesitated, and replied, "No"—I requested him to be careful what he said, not to injure her character, as he had endangered her life, and before he answered me any question not to be in a hurry—I cautioned him before he answered any question—he said that he withdrew a step when close to her, and then fired—he gave me no account of what led to this transaction.

Cross-examined. Q. Was that all he said? A. All that I can remember at present—I had heard something said that might affect Mrs. Magness's character, before I went to him at the hospital—not from him, but generally—I did not go for the purpose of asking him whether he intended to confirm these rumours—I was not desirous of doing so—when I went there I asked him if he would answer my question—he said, "Yes"—I said, "You have nearly taken the life of Mrs. Magness, don't ruin her character"—he said he went to kiss her, and she pushed him away, and then he stepped back, and fired—that did not occur to me before—I did not write down my conversation with him at the time—I went to inquire whether there was wadding in with the ball—I had heard something said that might affect the character of Mrs. Magness, and was desirous of knowing-whether he intended to confirm the rumours—I asked him if he would answer my questions—I said, "Relate to me all that happened at the time," meaning at the time he shot her.
(James Goff, landlord of the Cherry Tree, in Kingsland-road; John Bly, Kingsland-road; and Richard Hooper, King-squire, Goswell-road, gave the prisoner a good character.)

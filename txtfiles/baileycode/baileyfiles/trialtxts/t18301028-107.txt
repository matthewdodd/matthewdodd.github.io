            . I know Mr. 
               
                  Benjamin 
                  Hickinbotham
               



             - he is a butcher
, and lives at the corner of the Minories


. Between nine and ten o'clock on the night of the 9th of October, I saw the two prisoners in company, near his shop; they were standing at the next window, near his board - I saw Mortimer take the beef off; the other was close to him at the time - they both went away together; Mortimer carried it - they went down the Minories, and crossed the road; Mortimer then gave it to Jones - I went back, and gave an alarm; they were taken in the Minories - I am quite sure of their persons.

            . I am apprentice to Mr. 
               
                  Benjamin 
                  Hickinbotham
               



            . I heard the alarm, and ran down the Minories - I saw Jones with the meat, and he was taken; the other was close by his side; there were four or five others in company, who all ran away - there were 45 Ibs. of meat.
Jones' Defence. A person asked me to carry it - I went on, and the man came and stopped me - I do not know any thing of this prisoner.
Mortimer's Defence. I was coming down the Minories, and saw a mob; I went over, saw this prisoner on the ground, and the butcher near him; I asked what he was going to do with him - he turned, and said I was one of the gang; I have lately come from North America.

            . I saw the prisoner take a barrel of anchovies from a pile of an hundred at Wool Key


, on the 16th of this instant, about 12 o'clock in the day. He first put it between his legs, and had it there I believe a full quarter of an hour: he stooped several times, in order to take it up, but there were so many people about that he was afraid; but at last he took it up in his hands, and walked along the key with it, till he came to the custom-house: there Mr. White took hold of him; he had observed him as well as I. It is the property of Messrs, More and Barlow: I landed them. (Produced in court.)

                  AYRES
               



            . On the 23rd of January, about a quarter to eight o'clock, I was going to the shop of 
               
                  Elizabeth 
                  Owen
               



            , to purchase some glass articles; I saw two girls standing near her door, as I was going into the shop a boy came from behind the door, which was ajar, and passed me with some dishes; I considered Owen had been robbed, but I did not interfere, as I thought he might be her servant - but I turned my head and saw the boy give the dishes to a girl; I think the boy was Mead, and to the best of my belief the female prisoners were the two that were standing there - Devalien was the girl who received the dishes.

            . I lodge at the prosecutrix's. About seven o'clock in the evening I saw Devalien near the house - a tall boy and a short one who I believe was Mead were watching the house; I then saw Devalien cross from the boys, but she had first looked in at one shop window, and then in at the other.

                  OWEN
               



            . I keep the shop
, when Ayres gave me information I missed four dishes, which the officers afterwards found. I had seen Devalien and Mead watching the shop.

             (Police-constable K 217.) I found these dishes at No. 5. Hart's-court.

             (Police-serjeant K 3). Devalies told me where the dishes were; I sent for them - Bull and Stanfield were in custody at the time, and they told me they were all in it.(Property produced and sworn to.)
Devalien's Defence. Bull took the dishes and I received them - Mead was not there, but the rest of us were.
Mead's Defence. I was at home at supper at the time.
Bull put in a written defence denying that he was in the other prisoner's company and declaring his innocence - He received a good character.

1916. 




JOHN POLISHER
 and 




JOHN PHILLIPS
 were indicted for

 stealing 1 handkerchief, value 2s.; the goods of 



John Bond Haydon, form his person; Phillips having been before convicted of felony.


MR. WILDE
conducted the Prosecution.






JOSEPH DALTON
 (City policeman 366.) On the 6th of Aug. I was in Cheapside in plain clothes—I saw the prisoners, and, knowing them, I followed them to Holborn-hill—they stopped near Chancery-lane, where there was a crowd—I saw the prosecutor—the prisoners went near him, and I saw Polisher put his hand into his pocket, and take out this handkerchief—the prisoners then walked away—I told the prosecutor his pocket was picked—I took the prisoners to the station, and took this handkerchief out of Polisher's pocket.


COURT.
Q. How long had you seen the prisoners together? A. I followed them from Cheapside to Holborn-hill—they had not tried any other pockets—Phillips stood as close to Polisher as he could, while Polisher took the handkerchief, to hide anyone from seeing him.





JOHN BOND HAYDON.
 I am a solicitor, and live in Field-court, Gray's-inn. On the 6th of Aug. I was at a shop-window near Chancery-lane—I had a handkerchief in my pocket shortly before, and I lost it—this is it.

Philips's Defence. I was coming through Cheapside when Polisher spoke to me; we were going on together, and were overtaken by the officer, who charged us with this; I know nothing about it; I never saw the handkerchief till I was taken.





JOSEPH DALTON

re-examined. I produce a certificate of Phillips's former conviction at this Court—(read—Convicted on the 14th of Dec., 1846, by the name of William Gray, and confined six months)—he is the person.

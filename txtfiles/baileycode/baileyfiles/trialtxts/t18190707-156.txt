            . I am a tallow-chandler
, and live in Oxford-street
. On the 6th of July, about nine o'clock, I had just left my shop to go to the bottom of the street, which is only seven doors off. I was returning, and when I was within two doors of my own house, my neighbour said I had been robbed, and cried Stop thief! The watchman pursued the prisoner, and caught him - he begged for mercy. I found he lived about a hundred yards off.

            . I was standing at my door, and saw the prisoner lay hold of the prosecutor's pocket, and with the other hand draw the handkerchief out. I called to the prosecutor, and followed the prisoner. The watchman brought him back - I am certain he is the boy. Another was with him.

            . I am a watchman. I went to a house in St. Giles's with the prisoner, and brought him back. I found the handkerchief on the stairs. I had followed him up there.

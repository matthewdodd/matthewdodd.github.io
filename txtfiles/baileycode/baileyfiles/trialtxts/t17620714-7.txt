            . I once lodged in the prisoner's house. She has been reduced. She came into my house promiscuously. Being destitute of a servant, I took her for her victuals and drink, She had been at my house the Saturday, Sunday, and Monday. She never lay in my house. Last Monday there was a few words among the people in the tap room. She went out of the house at that time. After that I saw a woman with one of my handkerchiefs on; I knew it by the mark. I took her to justice Welch. She said, she bought it of the prisoner at the bar. I took up the prisoner: she owned the fact upon being charged with the things mentioned in the indictment. She had the other handkerchief in her pocket, and the apron on.
The prisoner said nothing in her defence.

             sworn.
My husband is a stone mason, but we look after the market boats that come to Paul's Wharf


; I was at the water side when the young man, the prisoner, came down to move his boat, he went down about nine or ten o'clock at night to move his boat out of the causeway, he said he was going to stow it into Mr. Crawshaw's Dock, because the market boats were coming in, and that he would make it fast there for safety, this was on Thursday evening the first of August.
Q. Have you any thing more to say about it? - No.
Prisoner. When I went down to my boat I found the iron in her at this time.
Court to Phelps. Did you observe any thing in it? - I did not, I cannot say either one way or the other.

             sworn.
I am a barge master; on the 1st of August my barge lay at the Hamborough Wharf, her head tied to Mr. Crawshaw's craft;between the hours of ten and eleven I saw a person come along side of one of the crafts, I thought there must be somebody coming to steal things out of my barge, so with that I laid down in a small boat to watch, hearing and seeing a man move about, I heard the iron at work, first the upper side, and then the lower side of the craft, after that 
               
                  Robert
                   Williams
               



            , he saw a young man coming over the water to the craft, and he hallooed, and he loosened his boat to get nearer along side of the craft where the iron was, and then the man shoved his boat off, and rowed over the water? I said to him if you had stopped a little longer I should have catched him. The prisoner went off with the bars, and 
               
                  Robert

                   Ball
               



             to help him come and row the boat after this man, and they went after him, and in about a quarter of an hour they came back, they took him, I saw him brought back to Paul's Wharf, the prisoner is the man that was brought back, but I cannot swear to the man that went off with the barge.
Q. When the man was brought back was he in a boat then? - Yes.
Q. Was any iron brought back? - Yes, seven pigs and two bits.
Q. Was the prisoner in the same craft as the iron was? - I cannot say.
Q. Did you see the iron that night? - I did.
Q. Do you know whether he was brought on shore on the same skiff as the iron was? - I will not say.
Q. Do you happen to know the prisoner? - Yes, very well.
Prisoner. Yes, I have done work for him, ask him whether he can give me a good character? - Yes, he was a sculler
 when he worked for me.

             sworn.
I am a lighterman. Thursday the 1st day of August my business called me to take two craft over the water at eleven o'clock at night, I had got them over the water, and was driving down with them, and I heard a noise of iron grappling. I had two crafts and a boat with me at the same time, I was the width of the pile from the stairs of Mr. Crawshaw's Dock, about ten yards, which I supposed somebody was moving it in the craft of Mr. Crawshaw's Wharf; I called out to one Bensley who happened to be the constable of the night; Bensley is here, I thought he might very possibly have stepped in the craft half a minute or two, I heard a boat row away from the craft, and heard Mr. Mason say something to the man but could not tell what distinctly.
Q. How many people were in that boat that rowed away from the craft? - I did not perceive only one; I dropped my barge down, I asked another, and we followed the man that went off with the boat, and overtook him some little distance from London Bridge.
Q. Did you lose sight of the boat or man in the course of this business? - Yes, I lost sight of the boat, we rowed along side of him, and in bringing him back he wished that we would let him go on shore, and let him throw the iron overboard.
Q. Who was that man you rowed along side of? - The prisoner at the bar. He said we might dispose of his boat as we thought proper; we brought him up to Paul's Wharf stairs, we left the iron in charge of Mr. Crawshaw's watchman.
Q. What quantity of iron did you find in the boat? - Seven iron pigs and two pieces.
Q. Did you make observation enough of that iron to swear it is the same if you was to see it in court? - No, I did not, the prisoner was given in charge of the constable of the night with the iron.

Prisoner. He never knew any harm of me? - I have heard several times of his doing very bad things.


                  THOMAS
                   BALL
               



             sworn.
I am a bargeman; between the hours of ten and eleven 
               
                  Thomas
                   Williams
               



             called out to me, desired me to step into the skiff, and row after somebody, I did not know who, we got with the prisoner just after we past London Bridge, and took him, and brought him back to Paul's Wharf, and found seven pigs of iron in his boat, and two pieces, he begged and prayed of us to set him on shore, and throw the iron overboard, and to do what we would with the boat.
Q. What was done with the iron? - It was left on the top of the Causeway with the watchman, 
               
                  Cornelius
                   Crawley
               



            .
Q. Should you know the iron again was you to see it? - Upon my word I should not. As we were rowing he put his hands to his face, and cried and said, now I am done if you will not let me go.
Prisoner. I have worked for him, he never knew any harm of me? - I have employed him several times but as to his character he bears but a very middling one.
Court to Ball. Was this craft a float or were they in dock? - They were a float in the dock.

             sworn.
I am clerk to Messrs. Crawshaw, son, and Thompson, the firm is

                   Thompson
               



            .
Q. Do you know any thing that happened at that time yourself, or do you only speak to the property? - I was called up about a quarter past eleven, and heard that they had taken this Mears, with some iron, and I told them to take him to the watch-house; I was not out of my room. I lifted up the sash, I was three parts undressed, going to bed, I did not see him at all, it was very dark, I saw the iron in the morning, soon after six o'clock.
Q. Did you observe whether any iron was missing? - It was impossible to know out of about forty ton, I ordered our porter to take them into the warehouse and have them weighed, the pig iron found corresponded with the iron that was in the Joseph barge that very night.
Q. Where was this iron? - It was left with the watchman, on the public stairs, down on the Causeway. I examined the iron and found the mark, Donnington, on five whole pigs, and one piece and found the mark Ketley on two whole pigs, and one piece. The Joseph barge is the property of 
               
                  Robert
                   Fletcher

                   Williams
               



             works for him on it; before I went to bed that night I had been out on the stair head to call the watchman, to see if any fresh craft had come in, and called out watchman three times, he did not hear, and then I went into the counting house, and knocked with my stick very hard, and he came out rubbing his eyes, and I went in, as soon as I got in almost, I heard this man was brought back; this Joseph barge lay in the second tier.
Court to Williams. Did either of you examine what was written on the barge over night? - I did not. I observed the mark of Donnington and Ketley on it.
Q. Did you see that Donnington and Ketley on it the over night? - The same night or the next morning, I saw it when I brought it back.
Court to Hall. Did you make the same observation? - I did not.
Prisoner. When I went to the water side to take my boat away I found the iron in my boat, and if they had let me alone I should have come down and told them so. I know no more about the iron coming intothe boat than the greatest stranger in the world; when they came to me I only asked them to put me on shore; says I, you know where to find me.

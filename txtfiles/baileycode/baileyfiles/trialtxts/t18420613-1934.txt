GEORGE LANGLY
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
4th of June, at 
St. Pancras, 9 forks, value 7l. 5s.; and 1 pair of sugar-tongs, value 15s; the goods of 



Edward Lindsey, in his dwelling-house; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






ELIZABETH HEWITT
. I am servant to Edward Lindsey, who lives at No. 14, Mornington-crescent, Hampstead-road—it is his dwelling-house, and is in the parish of St. Pancras. On Saturday evening, the 4th of June, at a quarter before six o'clock, there was a ring at the door—I opened it, and the prisoner appeared—he said he came for a bonnet to be cleaned—I asked him inside, went up, and asked my mistress—she said he had made a mistake—I went down again, and the prisoner was on the mat, where I had left him—I said he had made a mistake—he said he was sorry he had given me the trouble—I opened the door, and he went off—the plate-basket was about four yards from where he stood—there were a dozen forks in it, and the sugar-tongs, when I left it—when he was gone I looked at it again—nine forks and the tongs were gone—they were worth about 8l—no one could have taken them but him—I have not seen them since.

Prisoner. Q. There were other servants in the house? A. There are two; but the coachman was in the stable, and the cook in the kitchen—I am positive you are the person.





JOHN JAMBS ALLEN
 (police-constable E 150.) I took the prisoner—I told him what it was for—he said he had never been there at all—on the road to the police-court he said, "If I am sworn to, do you think I shall be transported?"—I said I did not know—he said, if I would not say any thing about what I knew of him, he would go to the Marine Society. Prisoner's Defence. I was not there at all.





THOMAS LANE
 (police-constable E 52.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person.

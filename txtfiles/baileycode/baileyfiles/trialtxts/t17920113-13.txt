                  WILLIAM
                   THACKWAY
               



             sworn.
I am a coachman to Mr. Edwards; my master lost the articles in the indictment from the coach-house, on the Friday before the Christmas-day; I had seen them at nine o'clock in the evening, and missed them at six o'clock in the morning; I did not see either of the prisoners take them; I saw them on the Tuesday week following; the glass was in the hand of the man that made the carriage, his name is Dick; I saw the bridle and the bit of carpet in the hands of 
               
                  Peter
                   Mayne
               



            ; I saw the glasses fitted, and they had the frames on when I first saw them, and it was of the colour that corresponded with the carriage; the prisoners are quite strangers to me; Dick did not bring four glasses, only the two front glasses.

             sworn.
The prisoner with the woman first asked me to buy the glasses; I told her, yes; I told him to let me look at them; this was the Friday before Christmas, between eleven and twelve in the forenoon; I asked her the price of these glasses; the man immediately said, have you not another room? I told him I had; we went into the back room, and the man pulled out three glasses out of a bag, and the woman pulled out of her lap a bridle, a cloth coat, and a carpet; I asked them the price of these goods; they said, three guineas; I said that was too much, I would give them two guineas and a half; I gave it them, and they went about their business; there was a man in the shop that saw me buy them, and pay for them; I gave them to a brother of mine to sell for me, because he understood them better than me.
Jury. Did you ask the prisoner how he came by this glass? - I did, and he told me that he dealt in the country, and that he often gets these things, if I would buy them of him; his shoes were all mouldy with country dirt at the time he came to me; I live at No. 109, Petticoat-lane; I am a broker, and in the rag line.
Court to Thackway. Where is this house of Mr. Edwards? - No. 292, Wapping

             sworn.
I buy and sell rags, on my own account, and was on the 23d of December, Friday, sorting rags in Mordecai's house, in themorning, about eleven o'clock, and the woman first came, and had in her apron a bit of carpet, a bridle, and a great coat; and the man followed her with three coach glasses; I saw them pulled out of the bag; and they asked him three guineas, and he offered two guineas and a half, and gave it, and kept all the things for that money.
Did he ask the man any questions? - I did not hear him; I was in before them, and staid after they were gone for an hour.


                  JOHN
                   DICK
               



             sworn.
I am a coach-joiner; I was going, the 23d of December, between eleven and twelve, cross Petticoat-lane, and Mordecai the Jew stopt me, and told me he had some glasses to dispose of; I went up stairs, into a back room where was a bed, and I saw two glasses, and a small glass for the side, and he asked me 27 s. for them; I bid him 25 s. and he said I should have them; I never went any more to the house afterwards, but his brother came to me, and told me I had lost a good bargain, this was on the Friday after, and brought the front glasses, and wanted 25 s. for them, and 2 s. 6 d. for the broken one, as in the course of this time the little glass was broke; but in consequence of an information of some glasses being lost, I stopt them when he brought them, and I went to Mr. Edward's and tried the frames, and they fitted very well; I have no doubt but they belonged to that carriage; I have kept them from that time to this; it is the same glass; when I saw them at first, they were without the frames; we got the frames from Mr. Kinsey, New-Road, Whitechapel; I had the glasses of Mordecai's brother; I have never seen him since the Monday after he brought the glasses, and told him I should stop them.
To Thackway. Were the glasses taken, and the frames left? - Yes, the front glasses.
To Dick. Did you happen to see whether the third glass was in a frame? - It was in a frame.
Did you make any observations of the glass the brother brought you, so as to know it is the same glass? - I measured them, and I observed it was diamond-cut glass.
Court to Mordecai. What have you done with the bridle, carpet, and other things? - I delivered them to the officer.
Jury. What did you sell the coat for? - One guinea.

             sworn.
I produce one bridle, and a piece of carpetting, which I had from Mordecai, who came with it and a brother of his to East-Smithfield office; in consequence of his information, I apprehended the prisoners; he gave the information last Monday week; I searched the prisoners' room, and found nothing.
(The bridle and the carpet deposed to by Thackway and Mr. Edwards.)

            ' DEFENCE.
I went out after a pound of butter last Tuesday was week, and when I came home I saw this here man, and another man named 
               
                  Joseph
                   Brown
               



            , in the room; and Mr. Mayne said, you must go along with me; I said, if that is the case, I will; and I went; and when I came down to the lock-up place, I said, Lord, I never was guilty of any thing in my life; with that, that man, whose name is 
               
                  Moses
                   Levy
               



            , came up to me, and asked me what I was here for; and said, I shall bring you two men to swear to, that they gave you the things; I said I could not swear to what was so false; says he again to me, if you will not do that, swear that your husband gave it to you, and you will get off; and I said I could not do that; and when I came before the justice, these two men came and sware against me; and if ever I saw them before in my life, I wish God may judge me at the day of judgement.
Court to Mayne. Did you tell her to swear against any body? - I did not; she says it was a Jew.
When you took these prisoners, were they in the same room; do they live together? - She came up after we had been in the room with Read about a minute; there is no doubt but they live together as man and wife; they always passed so, from my knowledge; I have known the prisoner Readthese eight years, but have not known her so long.
Prisoner Jacobs to Mayne. Do you not know a man that they call Moushe Pop; was not he there in the room? - There was a man that they call by that name there.
Prisoner. He was the man that I mean that persuaded me to swear against my husband.

Court to Thackway. Was the stable-house broke open at all? - I double-locked it, and in the morning when I came it was on the single lock.
(The prisoners called three witnesses further to their character, and who proved they lived as man and wife.)

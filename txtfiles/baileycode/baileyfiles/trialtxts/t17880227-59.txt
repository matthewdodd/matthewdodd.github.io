             sworn.
On the 18th of January about one o'clock, I was at an opposite neighbour's; I saw the prisoner come out of my door; I called to him, he made no answer; I crossed the way, and called, stop him; a person stopped him, and I found the things mentioned in the indictment, in his apron; they were in my parlor; I saw them about five minutes before; he said, a man in a green coat met him, and bid him go into that house, and bring something out, or he would cut his throat; but if he did, he would give him a shilling, and that when I came after him, the man ran away.
PRISONER's DEFENCE.
I was going down Wapping; a man put these things in my apron, and desired me to carry them to Cross-street; my father and mother died since I have been in prison.

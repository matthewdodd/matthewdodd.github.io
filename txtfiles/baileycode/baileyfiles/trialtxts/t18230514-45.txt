            . I am a labourer, in the East India Company's Service. I was on London-bridge, and saw three young men following Mr. Roberts; the prisoner was one of them - I watched and saw him take the handkerchief from Mr. Robert's pocket, I was close behind him and collared him; he dropped it - I saw nothing of the others after; a little girl picked it up, and gave it to Mr. Roberts.

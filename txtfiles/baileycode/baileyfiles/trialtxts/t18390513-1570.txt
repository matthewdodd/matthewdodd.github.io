STEPHEN THORNTON
 (police-constable E 83.) On the evening of the 20th of April I saw the prisoner in Union-street, Middlesex Hospital—he

had something bulky upon his hip—I followed him to a marine-store shop—I saw through the glass door that he laid a parcel on the counter—the woman who was there opened it, and there was a piece of meat in it, and these stays—the woman asked the prisoner how much he wanted—he said 2s.—she said, "That is too much—I can buy them cheaper than that"—he said, "Look at the work"—she then said 1s. 6d.—I then went in, and said to the prisoner, "Where did you get these stays.?"—he said he had seen no stays—I took them off the counter, and showed them to him—he then said he did not know where they came from—I said I would endeavour to find out—I then asked the woman for the meat—she said she had seen no meat—I said, "You don't mean to deny having some meat, when I saw the boy put it on the counter, and you said 2s. was too much"—she then put her hand under the counter, and gave me out 71bs. of beef—the prisoner denied that he had seen any beef, but in going to the station-house he said he had found them wrapped up behind a pump.





ROBERT NICHOLSON
. I live in Ernest-street, and am a haberdasher. These stays are mine, and had been taken out of my shop—they had not been sold—they were safe on my door-post about seven o'clock in the evening of the 20th of April.

Prisoner's Defence. I was passing, and saw this bundle lying down—there was a piece of meat inside the stays—I offered the stays for sale, and was going to take the meat home—I told the officer so.




GUILTY

Transported for Seven Years.

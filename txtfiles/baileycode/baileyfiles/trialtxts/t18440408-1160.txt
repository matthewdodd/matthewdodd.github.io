 was again indicted

 for stealing 10lbs. weight of mutton, value 5s. 6d., the goods of 



Ann Pridden.






HENRY WATLING
. butcher, Marchant-street. On the 27th of Jan. I sent Mrs. Pridden a leg of mutton, of 10lbs. weight—the next morning the servant came to know why I had not sent the other leg of mutton—I did not send the prisoner to get that leg back.





MARI ANN BARNARD
. I am in the service of Ann Pridden. On the 27th of Jan. the prisoner came, and said Mr. Watling would be much obliged to me to let him have the leg of mutton back, as he bad sent it by mistake, and sent ours to Woburn-place, and he would bring me another in five minutes—he had a tray—it had only been left five minutes.




GUILTY
. Aged 23.—


Transported for Seven Years.

(There was another indictment against the prisoner.)

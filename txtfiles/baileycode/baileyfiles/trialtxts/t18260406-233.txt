            . I am servant to Mr. Soane, of Lincoln's-inn-fields


. On the 20th of February, about nine o'clock in the evening, I saw a man in black,(not the prisoner,) on the top of the ladder of a building next door - he went over the wall; I asked what business he had there - he made no answer; I went round and saw two men talking - I called my fellow-servant, and saw the prisoner go up the ladder with the basket of tools on his back; I asked him what he wanted - he said he came for his tools; I said "If they are your tools why did not you take them before the place was locked;" he said "They were his tools, and he should take them when he liked;" my fellow-servant asked him if he worked there - he said he did, which I knew to be false, as the key of the building was hanging up in our kitchen - the other person had then got away - my fellow-servant, Catherine Wirlow, took the tools from the prisoner.
Prisoner. Q. Did you see me get over the wall? A. No, going up the ladder with the basket at your back - you said that Mr. Payne had given you the key at eight o'clock that night to fetch the tools - you did not say a person gave them you to carry.


                  CATHERINE 
                  WIRLOW
               



            . I saw the prisoner standing with the basket of tools - I asked what he wanted there - he said it was nothing to me, that he was a carpenter and had come for his tools - I took the basket - I saw another person who looked at the prisoner and laughed; I pushed the prisoner into the yard and told him I would ask Mr. Payne in the morning if he sent him - the footman and the cook took the tools into the kitchen.
Prisoner. Q. You say you pushed me into the yard? A. Yes; you did not say there were two gentlemen who gave you the things to carry - a man came up and asked you what you knew of Mr. Payne; and you said you worked with him.

            . I was passing by - I asked the prisoner what he wanted - he said he was a carpenter, and two men had employed him to carry the tools; I asked him to go to the men - he went on to the corner of Carey-street, and there I saw two watchmen, and gave charge of him - he had attempted to run away.

                  MEADWELL
               



            . I am a carpenter. I had left my tools, at No. 15, Lincoln's-inn fields - the men left work at half-past five o'clock, and no man had any right there afterwards - the key was hung up in Mr. Soane's kitchen - I had left the tools in my chest - they are worth more than a guinea.

            . I am foreman of the works. I had locked the house, and given the key to the servant.

            . Those articles are mine - I had left them on a bench in the building.

            . I claim this fillister; I had been at work with it.(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I went to a sale at the next house, and cleared some of the things - a gentleman called on me and told me to go in the evening, and he would give me a job - I went about half-past seven o'clock and he called me to go up the ladder, which I did - he struck a light, and told me to take some baskets of tools into Carey-street to a public-house.

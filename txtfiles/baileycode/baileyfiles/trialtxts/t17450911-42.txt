            . I am a blind man
, and my wife is blind too; we live upon the charity of good people. The Prisoner was a lodger in the house, as well as I. On the 19th of August my wife and I went out, I took the key of the street door in my pocket, and when I returned I let myself in, my wife undressed the child, and felt for the pillow. Said she,

            , where is the pillow? said I, there it is, where do you think it is, you fool. She went to turn the sheet down and that was gone. She went to the drawer where the child's things were, and they were gone. Said she, I am ruined, the child has not a shirt to wear. I went up to the Prisoner's room. but she was not at home, and did not come home that night. When she came home the next day, she was informed that I designed to prosecute her; and she told the neighbours I might kiss her a - e. She said, to me, neighbour, how do you do? I said, never the better for you. I went to take her to a constable, but she led me there, and I charged her with robbing me. She said she knew nothing of the things, and when I had done with her, she would begin with me.

            . Mrs. Dingey's shift was found upon the Prisoner, wrapped round her body; I nursed Mrs. Dingey in her lying-in, and this is her shift.
The Constable deposed, That when the blind man brought the Prisoner to his house, he charged her with stealing the shift; she said, she had not had one on for a week, and pulled her gown on one side, to shew that she had never a one on; that he said, what do you design to do with her? the blind man said, he would charge her with robbing him; and when she was before the Justice, he turned her apron aside, and there was the shift.

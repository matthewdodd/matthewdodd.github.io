             sworn.
On the 20th of April, I saw the prisoner take a hammer cloth, and put it under his arm: I was in the shop of 
               
                  Thomas
                   Clarke
               



            , a coach-maker, in Green-street


: the prisoner followed me; I saw it belonged to Mr. 
               
                  William
                   Smith
               



            ; and I observed whether he was going home with the cloth; I saw the hammer cloth on his carriage at six in the morning; I was going on other business into Cavendish-square; he ran behind me in Oxford-road; then I pursued him into Orchard-street, and down Somerset-street; and there he threw the hammer cloth from under his arm; I am sure the prisoner is the man; I never saw him before; I gave an alarm, and the prisoner was taken into custody; he never was out of my sight.

I am a coach-maker: I am employed by Sir 
               
                  William
                   Smith
               



            ; his coach was in my shop; the hammer cloth was on it; it was missed the morning of the 20th of April; it was an oil-skin hammer cloth. Between eight and nine in the morning, my man, 
               
                  Zachariah
                   Moore
               



            , brought the prisoner into my compting-house with the hammer cloth.

A man employed me to fetch it, and promised me a shilling.

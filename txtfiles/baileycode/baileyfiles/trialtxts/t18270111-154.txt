            . I am a cabinet-maker; my master lives in Cold Bath-square. On the 28th of December, about eleven o'clock in the morning, I was near Mr. George's, the butcher
, and saw the three prisoners - I watched them for a quarter of an hour, loitering about and playing; I saw Gilmore go to the corner of Bath-street


, which is Mr. George's shop - he stood one house from the other two, and waited a few minutes; they then went up to the window, and I thought Moran was going to take some mutton, but Leary reached over his shoulder, took hold of a piece of beef, and gave it to Moran; they all ran off - I pursued, and caught Moran, with the beef, in Warner-street, and took him back. Gilmore was secured; I took Leary on Saffron-hill.

                  GEORGE
               



            . I keep this shop. I came home just as Moran and Gilmore were brought into the shop - Leary was not taken then.

            . I am a constable. I went home with George from the office, then went with Mitchell, and took Leary on Saffron-hill.
LEARY's Defence. I asked a boy the way to Fleet-market - he sent me down Saffron-hill, and I was taken.
MORAN's Defence. Leary was not with us.
GILMORE's Defence. I was asking Moran the way to Islington.

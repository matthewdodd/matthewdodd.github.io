            . I am a cheesemonger
, and live in Francis-street, Tottenham-court-road


. On the 8th of February, about twelve o'clock at night, I was alarmed, got up, and missed two fowls out of the hen-house in my yard. I saw a man getting over the wall. I went to the street-door to call the watchman. The prisoner stood just below the door, I collared him. He used very improper language, and threw off his great-coat, and in one of his pockets I found one of my fowls just killed. The man who was in the yard got away. I found the other fowl by the shop-door. I knew them to be mine. The prisoner was wearing the coat.

            . I am a watchman. Cousins gave the prisoner into my charge. About a dozen men came round - he asked if none of them would take his part?

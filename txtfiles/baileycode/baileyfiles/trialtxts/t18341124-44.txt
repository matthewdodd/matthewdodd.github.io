ELIZABETH JOHNS
. I am housemaid, to Mrs. Ann Styles, No.84, Gower-street. On the evening of the 30th of September, the prisoner came to the house with a note, directed to Mrs. Styles—I asked if he was

to wait for an answer—he said, "Yes"—I took it up stairs, and as I was coming down, I saw the prisoner run out with a coat of Mr. Herbert Robinson's, and three hats, one of Mr. James Hance's, and two of Mr. William and Mr. Daniel Blyth's, who were at the house that evening—I cried, "Stop thief," but there was no officer near, and the prisoner escaped—I am sure he is the man.

Prisoner's Defence. I was at work at the time in Fitzroy market.




GUILTY
. Aged 20.—


Transported for Seven Years.

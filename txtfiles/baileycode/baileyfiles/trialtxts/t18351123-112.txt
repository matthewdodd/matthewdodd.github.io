LYDIA HILL
. I am sister to Mr. Joseph Hill a baker in Southampton-row. I was at home when the prisoner came to his shop with written request for two loaves and a quartern of hour, for Mr. Mitchell, his master—this is it (read)—"August 8th, 1835—Mr. Mitchell, his master bearer, my bricklayer have two quarters of bread and some flour; charge it to my account. WILLIAM MITCHELL, 38, Golden-street."—I believed this to be true, and let him have the articles—Mr. Mitchell is a customer of ours—I know nothing of the prisoner.





WILLIAM MITCHELL
. The prisoner was in my employ about four years ago—I have dealt with Mr. Hill these twenty years—this is not my writing, nor any of my servants.





DANIEL EDMONDS
. I am a police-constable. I got this certificate of the prisoner's former conviction from Mr. Clark's office—I know he is the man (read.)

Prisoner's Defence. I was in great distress.




GUILTY
. Aged 46.—


Transported for Seven Years.

ROBERT PEARCE. I am a plumber
 and glazier
, and live in King-street, Long-acre. On the 7th of May, between eleven and twelve o'clock, I was in front of the Horse Guards; I had a handkerchief in my right-hand coat pocket. The officer came, and said I was robbed - I put my hand to my pocket, and missed my handkerchief - I had it a few minutes before; he had hold of the prisoner close to me. I saw him take my handkerchief from him.

            . I am shopman to Mr. Craig. The prisoner came into his shop, on the 11th of August, about twelve at noon; she bought a small quantity of print; which she paid for; I thought I observed something thicken out, under her gown; I did not know what it was. When she went away, I missed a piece of print off the counter, measuring twenty eight yards, value twenty eight shillings. That is my master's print; my master's shop mark is on it.

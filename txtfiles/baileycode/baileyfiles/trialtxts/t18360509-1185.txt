CHRISTOPHER NIGLAND
. I was in Curzon-street, on the 13th of April, and in consequence of information, I turned round, and went in pursuit of the prisoner—I saw him run down against the market, and drop my handkerchief—I took it up—this is it, my name in on it—it was safe in my pocket just before.

Prisoner. Q. Did you feel any body at your pocket? A. Yes, I did; and looked round, and the gentleman called out to me, at the same time the policeman caught hold of him.

Prisoner. I was on master's business in Curzon-street; two boys ran by me, and threw the handkerchief at my feet. Witness. I did not see two boys—I saw the prisoner with it—he was running away—there was no other boy—the gentleman who took gave me the information, said, the prisoner was the person who took it—as soon as I turned round, I saw him five or six paces off me.





JAMES HARRISON
, (policeman C I.) On the the 13th of April, between one and two o'clock, I heard a cry of "Stop thief," in Shepherd's-market—a man caught the prisoner in his arms; I collared him, and took him back, and met the prosecutor with handkerchief in his hand—there was a labouring man who said he saw the prisoner take the handkerchief from the prosecutor's pocket, but I could not get him to go down to the station-house.

Prisoner. Q. Was the gentleman who said I took it, in the market? A. He was with the prosecutor, standing in the mob—I saw you running before a mob of persons—you were taken about 100 yards from Curzon-street.

Prisoner. An order was found on me, for some goods for master. Witness. I found no order on him—there was a paper found on him, I forget what it was about—he told me he was working at a play-house in Windmill-street.

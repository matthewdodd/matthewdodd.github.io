            . I am the wife of Thomas Salter, a painter
. On the 13th of July, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, I was sitting in the room at needle-work; the prisoner knocked at the door - my little girl let him in; I asked if he wanted any thing - he said Yes, to change his things; he had slept in that room - I went out of the room for about ten minutes; I then heard the latch of the door go - I went into the room again, and sat down to work; in about an hour I went to the drawer to show my husband's brother a waistcoat, which I had seen in the morning, and it was gone - I then missed these other articles; I went to a Policeman who lodged in my house, and he told me to go to the pawnbroker; I went, and got some account of the prisoner - he had been in that room till near eleven o'clock in the morning.

             sworn.
I live at the workhouse; I am the master of it; on the 28th or 29th, the workhouse was broke open, how I cannot tell, but there was a large hole made through the brick-work, sufficient for any person to go through; I saw it whole on the 28th; the hole was not there then; I always go through the whole house every night, before I go to bed; whether it is ten, eleven, or twelve; that night, according to custom, I went to bed between ten and eleven, and the key was taken into my bed-room; the wall was safe when I went to bed; I got up about six; I was alarmed by my daughter; I came down stairs and found a large hole in the wall, and the bricks apart and piled up one on another, to prevent any body else going through; the hole was large enough for any one to go through; the door was broke open which went into the stair-case, the key of which was in my pocket; we have a cobler's stall in the work-house, and that furnished them with a pair of pincers and that wrenched open the door; from thence was taken, I suppose, between thirty and forty pounds of wool; as soon as this happened, I sent word to two gentlemen that we do business for in the spinning way, and in consequence I was sent to; and there I saw the wool and the prisoners.

             sworn.
I am a worsted maker and hosier; the prisoner Jacob came to me on Friday week; the prisoner came to me and pulled a slip of wool out of his pocket, and asked me if I would buy it, I said it looks as if it had been laid upon; he said, he knew nothing about it, it belonged to a man at the other end of the town, who had got a quantity;he said, our sabbath will begin soon, will it make any difference if I bring it on Monday; and he came on Monday, and he says, there Sir is the fair sample; I weighed it, and agreed with him for seven pence a pound; but he says, eight-pence; I saw him again about five or six on Friday, he brought a bag; says he, here is the work; he opened the bag; says he, where shall I put it; I said, empty it out; I found a parcel which had been delivered up for what we call twitches; having had information from Perry, I put it into the scale and weighed it, and it weighed thirty-two pounds and a half; says I, I will send down to the master of the work-house, and if it is not his, I may buy it; says the prisoner, I will carry the note myself; no, no, says I, I have people enough myself to carry it; I let the prisoner go that time; the prisoner Angel was behind him when he came to offer the wool, but I never saw him after; Jacob came to me that evening, and asked me if I had any suspicion; says he, if you have, stop me; he then went away, and the next morning I expected him, but a woman came for the money; I did not see Jacob till Saturday, then he came and brought another man with him; I saw the prisoner Angel in the street at that time; he did not come in with him on the Saturday; the tall one came for the payment of some goods; says I, I must be under the necessity to stop you; to stop me, says he, why you might have stopped me yesterday if you pleased; says I, I have now a full authority; we sent for an officer and I took him; as we were going to Whitechapel, I saw the prisoner Angel; I run after him and cried out, stop thief; I took him and brought him to the Justice; I am sure the tall one is the man that offered me the wool, and brought it to my house; I am sure the other was with him the first time.
How near was Angel to your house, when Jacob came for the money? - It might be a stone's throw; the wool is here.

I am in the work-house belonging to this woman; this wool belongs to the workhouse; I make it up myself; I am sure this is the wool that was in the work-house in March last; this is the lad's making up that is at the door.
Court. You do not know the wool, but from from its being made up in these bundles? - No, other people make it up differently.

PRISONER JACOB'S DEFENCE.
I have a great deal to say for myself; I was going to the other end of the town, crying old clothes; a sea-faring man called me into a publick-house, and asked me to buy this wool; he asked nine-pence a pound; I offered him sixpence, and gave him seven-pence; I came to Mr. Bennet and asked him to buy it; he said, he could not tell how to buy it by that sample; he offered me eight-pence a pound for it; I brought the wool, he was not at home; I left the wool, and called again in an hour; he then came home and put it in the scale; it weighed thirty-two pounds and a half; then he put it into a large basket, and went backwards and called his servants, and said, I think this wool is stolen; says I, you may stop me; no says he, I do not wish to stop you, you may call tomorrow, about ten o'clock in the morning; I went, and the young woman said, you must call yourself; says I, it is our sabbath, and I dare not touch money; when I came there, they stopped me and the other gentleman too.

PRISONER ANGEL'S DEFENCE.
I only went with my brother through curiosity hearing my brother was stopped; I know nothing about it.
Court to Smallwood. What is the value of this wool? - About seven-pence a pound; there was about thirty-four pound.

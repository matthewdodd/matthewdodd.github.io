PETER BARRY. I am a seaman
, and lodge at the Black-horse, Dowgate-hill. On the night of the 30th of July, about half-past twelve o'clock, I was going across Tower-hill


; the prisoner came up and struck me on the right cheek, and with that he caught hold of the chain of my watch - I closed my arms, and he could not get it out; another then came up and struck me with a stick - I sung out Murder! and the other ran away - the watchman came up, and the prisoner got away, but he took him.

            . I am the watchman; I went up and saw the prisoner and another running - I pursued and took the prisoner; he asked "What was the matter?" - Barry came up and said, "I will swear that is the man who struck me, and tried to take my watch."
Prisoner. Q. Was not I walking about? A. Yes, when I took you - but you was running when I first saw you.

            . I am watch-house keeper. I asked the prisoner how he came to assault the man in that way? he said, he knew nothing about it.

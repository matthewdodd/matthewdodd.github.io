JOHN VANDOME
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
22nd of October, 22 lbs. weight of cheese, value 12s., the goods of 



William Wheatley.






WILLIAM WHEATLEY
. I keep a shop in Brick-lane, Bethnal-green. On the evening of the 22nd of October, this cheese was taken off my window-board—some young girls came in and acquainted me with it—I went out, and the policeman had got the prisoner.





JAMES STOKES
 (police-constable H 178.) I saw the prisoner come down Hare-street, with the cheese under his left arm—I heard a cry of "Stop thief"—I was about twelve yards from him—he ran and dropped the cheese—I pursued and took him.

Cross-examined by
MR. PAYNE. Q. Did you stop and pick it up? A. Yes, but I did not lose sight of him—two civilians stopped him, and I took him—he was about a hundred yards from me—it was about ten o'clock at night—I could see two hundred yards off if my sight was not obstructed.




GUILTY.* Aged 24.—


Transported for Seven Years.

            . I am a cow-keeper
, and live in White's-yard, Saffron-hill


. On the 3d of May I received information, and found my gutters completely stripped of the lead, and part off the next house. It was afterwards brought to me; I fitted it to the gutters, and it corresponded exactly.

            . I am a watchman of Saffron-hill. About two o'clock in the morning of the 3d of May I met the prisoner coming up Red Lion-court with the lead; I went up to him, and he threw it down. I sprang my rattle, but he got away - I knew him before, and am sure he is the boy. On the Sunday following I saw him; he ran off, but I secured him in a cellar in Field-lane.

            . I heard the rattle sprung, and picked the lead up. The prisoner ran into an empty house - he must have got out the back way.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

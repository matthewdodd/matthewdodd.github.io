            . Four Pewter Plates, &c. My Maid asked me if I knew any thing of the Company the Evening before. I answer'd I did, and that they belong'd to the Six Clerks-Office: So I went to one or two of them I knew: I asked, if they knew any thing of such and such Things I had lost; I told them we had had no other Company in the House that Evening but themselves; and they guessing at the Prisoner, one said, he knew the Place where he used to pledge Things; and at that Place we asked for such and such Plates, which the People produced directly, with mine and my Wife's Name upon them.
Q. Where were they pawned?
Ward. At Mr. Singleton's, the Corner of Feather-stone Buildings, Holborn.
Q. Did Mr. Singleton shew them to you?
Ward. He gave them me with his own Hands. And taking out two Warrants, one for the Prisoner, and the other for the Goods, we brought the Prisoner that Night before Justice Burdus, to whom he made some Confession.

            .) Do you know the Prisoner?
Singleton. I have known him a Year and a half, and upon the 4th of this Month, bringing me four Plates, I lent him 2 s. upon them.

            .) What have you to say for yourself?
Cust. My Lord, there were a great many of us in Company. We went to Mr. Ward's to play a Game at Skittles, where we were drinking hard till Night. As to confessing the Plates, there was no Confession made; the Plates being convey'd into my Pocket without my knowing any thing of it.
Q. Have you any Witnesses?

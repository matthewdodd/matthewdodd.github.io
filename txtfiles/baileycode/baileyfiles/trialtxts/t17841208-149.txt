             deposed, that she took the prisoner to mind her children, and she robbed her of the things in the indictment, while the prosecutor was gone to Covent-Garden market, and left the house and her child crying in the cradle; she ran over to the pawn-broker's, Mr. Lane's, and found the buckles and the rest of the things at different pawn-brokers. Several pawnbrokers produced the things pawned by the prisoner.
(The things deposed to.)
Prisoner. I have nothing to say.
The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave her a very good character as a very dutiful child.
The prisoner's mother was sworn, and said, the prisoner was not fourteen, and had been deluded from her six weeks, and knew nothing of her till she found her at the prosecutor's house.

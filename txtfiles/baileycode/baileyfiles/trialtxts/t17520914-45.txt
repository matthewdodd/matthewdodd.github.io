            . I am a salesman
 in Rosemary Lane


. I went out on the 20th of June; when I returned, I missed a silk brocade waistcoat, which I left on a shelf under the care of Richard Burks; he was my servant. I advertised it on the third of July, and on the fourth a pawnbroker brought it to my shop. Produced in court, and deposed to. I desired him to detain the person that brought it if he came again. The day after he went again, and there was detained, and I sent for.

            . I was servant to Mr. Roberts at that time. I made this waistcoat out of two old ones for Mr. Roberts; I am certain it is his property. It was in his shop upon the twentieth of last June. It had hung out, but rain came, and I took it in again. The prisoner came in and asked for a linen waistcoat and black breeches. I had none, but went, as is usual, to get them at another shop, and when I returned he was gone.

            . I am a pawnbroker. I lent the prisoner five shillings upon it, and seeing the advertisement, carried it to the prosecutor.
The prisoner in his defence said, it was given him by a Captain of an Indiaman.

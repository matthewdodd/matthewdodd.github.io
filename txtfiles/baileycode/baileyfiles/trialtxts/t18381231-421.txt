 was indicted

 for stealing, on the

Richard Painter; and that he had been previously convicted of felony.






GEORGE CASTLE
. I live with Mr. Painter, in Broad way, Westminster. I was standing at his door at three o'clock on the afternoon of the 10th of December, at the horse's head, minding the gig—I saw the prisoner snatch my master's cloak out at the side of the gig, roll it up, and give it to another boy—they both ran off—I gave an alarm, the boy dropped it, and it was picked up—the prisoner was taken the same evening—I am quite certain he is the boy.





WILLIAM GREEN
. I live with Mr. Booth, of Princes-street I was standing by Mr. Painter's gig, and saw the prisoner take the cloak, and give it to another boy—they both ran off—a woman picked the cloak up at the corner of the street—I had not seen it dropped—about a quarter to seven o'clock the same evening, I was going on an errand, and saw the prisoner walking down Princes-street, with another boy—I followed him to Tothill-street, and gave him in charge.





RICHARD PAINTER
. I live in Broadway. This is my cloak—(looking at it)—I heard the alarm, and a woman gave it to me.





RICHARD COLLER
. I am a policeman. I have a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from the office of the Clerk of the Peace, at Westminster—(read)—I was in Court when the prisoner was tried, and am quite sure he is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 18.—


Transported for Seven Years.

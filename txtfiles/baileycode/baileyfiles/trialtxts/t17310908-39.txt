            , the 22d of July
 last.
It appear'd by the Evidence, that the Linnen was stolen cut of a Street, where it hung up to dry; that the Prisoner being observed to lurk about, was suspected; and being watch'd, was seen to go in, and having stolen it, was pursued and apprehended with the Goods upon him. The Fact being fully proved, the Jury found him 

               guilty
             of the Indictment.

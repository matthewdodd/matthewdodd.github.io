            . I am a cotton manufacturer
, I live in Grey Eagle Street, Spitalfields. On the 9th of November I sent 
               
                  John 
                  Smith
               



             my nephew to Sir 
               
                  James 
                  Esdaile
               



            's with two five guinea Birmingham bank notes to be changed for Bank of England notes.


                  JOHN 
                  SMITH
               



            . Q. How old are you. - A. Fourteen next birth day. On the 9th of November between the hours of one and three o'clock, I was going to Sir 
               
                  James 
                  Esdaile
               



            's to get two five-guinea Birmingham notes changed for Bank of England notes, and on my returning home, opposite of the London Tavern, the prisoner came after me and tapped me on the shoulder and said, the notes that I presented at Sir 
               
                  James 
                  Esdaile
               



            's were forgeries, and I was his prisoner and must go back with him to the banker's. After we had gone twenty or thirty yards back, he said he could not go back to the banker's, he had other business to transact, he asked me where I got them, I told him my uncle gave them to me to get them changed, he said he should take me to Bridewell, and said,
"give me the money, you are not fit to be trusted," he asked me where my uncle lived, I told him in Grey Eagle Street, he asked me how far that was off, I told him about three quaters of a mile, he asked me if I could bring my uncle to Sir 
               
                  James 
                  Esdaile
               



            's within an hour, I told him I thought I could, he said,
"go, make haste, be no longer than an hour," and I went. I gave him the notes when he threatened to send me to Bridewell and said, give them to me. I gave them to him as if he had a right to them.
Q. Look at him, are you sure he is the man. - A. Yes, I heard that a man of the same description was taken to the Compter, I went there to see him. I am certain he is the man.
Prisoner. Q. Did not you say at the Poultry Compter, that you believed I was the man. - A. I did, I had not a doubt in my own mind, and when I had a full view of you I said you were the man.
Prisoner's Defence. I could bring an Admiral and other officers of the British Navy to give me a character. I assure you they have taken me for the wrong person.

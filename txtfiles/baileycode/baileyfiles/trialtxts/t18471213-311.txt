MOSES MAYERS.
 I am a carver and gilder. Eustoe was in my service—I went to bed on 6th Nov., and when I awake in the morning my purse was gone, and thirty-one sovereigns and two half-sovereigns in it.





MARY ANN RANDALL.
 I am searcher at the station-house. Bullock was handed to me—she was dressed in a new brown stuff dress—I told her she must be a very wicked woman to take so much money from the girl—she said, "Who told you?"—I said, "The girl"—she said, what the girl had bought her and given her, she was very willing to give up, she had taken no money from her—I found on her this gown and other things—she said she met the girl in the Mint on the Tuesday night, and went out shopping with her, and she bought her these things, and gave her 5l., or five sovereigns. I do not know which.

Prisoner's Defence. The girl came to lodge with me, and asked me to make her some dresses; next morning she went out shopping, bought a gown for herself and one for me, a pair of shoes, a bonnet, and some other things; she gave me the five sovereigns which were taken from me.

BULLOCK—


NOT GUILTY.

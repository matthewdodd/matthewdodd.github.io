JOSEPH BLIZZARD
. I live at Cottage-place, Vauxhall-wharf. On the 6th of August I was at work at Cow-cross, and went to sleep in the pens in Smithfield, about half past nine o'clock, with my boots on, I awoke about ten o'clock, and the boots were then off my feet, and the prisoner bad them under his arm—I gave an alarm, and he ran through the posts—I lost sight of him, but I took particular notice of him—I stopped till I got another old pair of shoes—I went to different shops, but could see nothing of my boots—I came back and saw the prisoner in the same place where I had been robbed, with a gang of people—I went to the officer and gave him into custody—my boots have not been found—the prisoner was rising from the ground when I saw him—be let my foot drop—I was perfectly sober—the prisoner said, "You will never find the boots again, they are far enough off now."





ANDREW TWEE DALE
. I am a City police-constables I took the prisoner to the Computer—he said, "I have sold the boots, they are far enough off now"—I did not tell the Magistrate this—I was Dot examined—I told the clerk so—he has omitted it in the deposition.

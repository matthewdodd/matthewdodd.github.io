for stealing, on the

Edward Marsh Browell, from his person.






EDWARD MARSH BROWELL
. I live in Tunbridge-place, New-road.

At a quarter past four o'clock in the afternoon of the 27th of January, I was in Long-acre, going home—I felt a tug at my Coat, and a pressure on my left side—I turned round and saw the prisoner in the act of concealing a handkerchief under his left breast—I seized him—he threw it down, and ran off—I pursued him, crying, "Stop thief"—I had him in my eye till I saw a policeman in the act of catting him—this is my handkerchief.

Prisoner. It was not in my hand, it was in my breast—I picked it up, and put it in my breast—I was passing that gentleman, and happened to touch him, he turned round, and the handkerchief was in my breast.





JOHN AGATE
 (police-constable F 49.) I saw the prisoner running down, Mercer-street—I took him into custody—this handkerchief was produced, and the prosecutor said it was his—the prisoner dropped his hat, and the gentleman picked it up—I asked the prisoner if it was his hat—he said it was, and he put it on his head—he ran very fast.

Prisoner. If I had any intention of picking the gentleman's pocket, I should have turned back.





EDWARD MARSH BROWELL

re-examined. The handkerchief was in my coat-pocket—I felt the tug all down my left side—it was the second pressure that made me turn round—I saw it in the prisoner's hand—he begged me to let him off, and then ran away.




GUILTY
. Aged 18.—


Transported for Seven Years.

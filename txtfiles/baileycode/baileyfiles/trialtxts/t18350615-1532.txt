1532. 




RICHARD JONES
 was indicted

 for embezzlement.






WILLIAM BATE
. I am a baker, and live in Clare-street, Clare-market; the prisoner had been in my employ for six or seven weeks—he was employed in the bakehouse, and received various sums of money—he was to account for it when he came home—it was his duty to come and give it to me.





MARY ANN SYER
. I deal with the prosecutor. On the 13th of June. I paid the prisoner for two half-quartern loves, 5 1/2 d.—he did not give me any receipt.





LOUISA PERRIS
. I deal with Mr. Bate. On the 15th of June, the prisoner received 2s. 8d. of me, but gave no bill or receipt.

Prisoner. She did not pay me the money. Witness. I can say with a clear conscience that I paid him the money.





JOHN RANSON
 (police-constable H 156.) I took the prisoner into custody—I found him at the farthest end of a skittle-ground in a little shed.

MR. BATE. The prisoner never accounted to me for these bills, nor a great deal more—he said, the parties had a bill, and they never had any bills—he received the money every day—he left my work in an unfinished state.

Prisoner's Defence. I never received the money.




GUILTY
. Aged 23.—


Transported for Seven Years.

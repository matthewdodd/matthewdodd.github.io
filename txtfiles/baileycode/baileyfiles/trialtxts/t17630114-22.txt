                  James 
                  Colhoun 
               



            . On the 13th of Dec. I went to Mr. Colcroft's office in the morning, and received of Mr. Roberts 3 bank notes, one of 100 l. and two 50 l. each; I wrapt them together, one of the 50 l. notes was on the outside, which was indorsed on the back with Mr. Colcroft's name, number 149. Returning into the city about midnight, much in liquor, I went with a woman nam'd 
               
                  Mary 
                  Cartwright 
               



            , to the house of the prisoners in Fleet-lane



; we remained there about an hour, then 4 women came into the room in a riotous manner, the prisoner 
               
                  Catherine 
                  Haines 
               



             was one of them, 2 of them pushed down the chair in which I was sitting, and the other 2 forced 
               
                  Mary 
                  Cartwright 
               



             out of the room. A few minutes after this, upon hearing a great disturbance and noise in the lane, I went out of the house into the street, I had not been gone far when I missed my purse; I returned to the house, and there I found 
               
                  Mary 
                  Cartwright 
               



            , the constable, and watchmen at the door, but we could not get admittance, the door was fast; the watchmen got it open some time after, but there was nobody in the house but an old servant woman, she was taken to Wood-street-compter, and about 10 or 11 o'clock in the morning the 2 prisoners were taken by the constable, and carried before Sir 
               
                  Charles 
                  Asgill 
               



             sitting Alderman at Guildhall, there I charged them with my notes and money, they both of them denied knowing any thing; after that he was sent for from the Compter before Sir Charles, there I heard him confess he received the 3 notes from his wife in a house in Fleet-lane adjoining to his own, they and my purse had been found upon him before I came there, I think he said he received them of her in the night time; I think he added, that he said to his wife and the others, that they must give back these notes. Sir Charles then committed him to Newgate.
Q. Do you remember you on any occasion produced your purse while in the prisoners house?
Colboun. Yes, I did 2 or 3 different times, to pay for some negus, and some money that the servant demanded of me soon after I went into the room.
Cross Examination.
Q. Was you much in liquor?
Colboun. I was.
Q. When you was first before Sir 
               
                  Charles 
                  Asgill 
               



            , did you remember the woman at the bar to be one of the women?
Colhoun. Yes, I did, immediately upon seeing of her I knew her to be one of the 4 women that came into the room.
Q. When the constable and you went to apprehend her, did not you say upon seeing her, you did not know that woman?
Colhoun. I told him then she was one of the 4, and bid him apprehend her, and said she was a person concerned in it, and I swore with great certainty that that was one of the women, before Sir 
               
                  Charles 
                  Asgill 
               



            .
Q. Who is this 
               
                  Mary 
                  Cartwright 
               



            ?
Colhoun. I know nothing of her but being a girl of the town that picked me up.
Q. Where has she been since?
Colhoun. She has been under the care of one of the constables, in order to give evidence here.
Mr. Sabertine. I am a cashier at the bank of England; this note I signed, (holding the 100 l. note in his hand) and the other two 50 l. notes I believe to be Mr. Tomlinson's writing on them.
Q. Have you seen Mr. Tomlinson write?
Sabertine. I have several times.

Mr. Atkerson. On the 13th of December this draught was brought to me, for the payment of a thousand pounds; I am cashier for Mr. Hoar, I paid 700 l. in bank notes and 300 l. in money, these 3 notes here produced were part of the 20 l.
Mr. Roberts. I am cashier to Mr. Calcrost. I received 700 l. in bank notes of Mr. Hoar, on the 13th of Dec. I paid 200 l. of these notes, one of 100 and two of 50 l. each, to Mr. Colhoun.
The bank notes read.
N 196, B. signed Tomlinson, for 50 l.
N 224, C. signed Tomlinson, for 50 l.
N 130. C. for 100 l.
Q to the prosecutor. Can you undertake to say when you pulled out your purse you put it into your pocket again?
Prosecutor. I am very sure I did. I was not intoxicated so far as not to remember that; I remember it exceeding well.
Q You say you was very fudled when you went into the house, was you not more so after you was there?
Colhoun. I was a good deal better after I was there than I was when I went in.
Q. Are you certain you did not drop your notes out of your pocket?
Colhoun. I am very certain I did not.
Q. Did not James Haines say Mary Holmes gave him the notes?
Colhoun. He once said one of the women gave them to him, and once he said his wife gave them to him.
Q. Was he in liquor at that time?
Colhoun. He pretended to be in liquor, and I believe he was in liquor.
Q. Had you any particular specie of money about you?
Colhoun. I had 7 or 8 guineas, and 2 German ducats, these were in my purse; I had some silver in my pocket, but I had given that away, and had occasion to change some gold.

            . On the 13th of Dec. last, about 12 at night, I met Mr. Colhoun on Ludgate Hill. I asked him to go and give me a glass of wine, he told me he would; I carried him down Fleet-lane, to 
               
                  James 
                  Haines

                  Sarah 
                  Edwards

            ; Holmes goes sometimes by the name of Elizabeth, and Brown goes by the name of Ann Thompson, they 4 came up and rushed into the room upon us, Mrs. Haines and her maid pushed me out of the room, and the other 2 were with Mr. Colhoun, they flung him on the bed before I could well get out of the room. I ran with my gown, apron, and stays, on my arm to the watch-house, and got the constable and watchmen with me, but coming along there was murder cried in the lane, they stopt, and went into the house where it was called, then they came out, and we met the prosecutor, he said he had been robbed of his money, and 3 bank notes. for 200 l. 2 of 50 l. each, and 1 of 100 l.
Q. Did he mention what money he lost?
M. Cartwright. He said about 8 l. in cash, and 2 ducats. We went to the door and knocked a great while, and no body at all answered, then we went back again to the watch-house, and about half an hour after 3 I insisted upon the door being broke open, they went and broke it open, and there was only an old woman in bed with a child; I insisted upon her going to the compter along with me; and in the morning came Jemmey Haines to me in the compter, he said, if I would be quiet and easy he would give me snacks, and if I would not be quiet and easy he would lagg me.
Q. Did you understand the meaning of that?
M. Cartwright. That is, as they told me since, to hang me. I said, I did not care, what I had said I would stand to, and what I was about I would go through with; presently after he and his wife were taken and carried to Guildhall, and I was fetched from the compter, there I gave the same account as here.

            . I was constable at that time, it was my watch night. On the 13th of Dec. when the last evidence came to the watch-house, we were going to Haines's house, we heard murder cried at the next door, or a door or two from his house; we went in there, but we staid there a very little time, then we went to the watch-house, and then to Haines's house, there we found nothing but an old woman and a child: when it was morning, the prosecutor came to my house, about breakfast, and said, will you go down to see after these people? I went with him, we found Mrs. Haines first, and after that the man; we brought them before the sitting Alderman, and one was put into one compter, and the other in the other. Coming back the beadle asked me for something to drink; somebody said, a very foolish constable not to search them; then we went to Sir

            . I am one of the warders of St. Sepulchre's parish, I was assisting the constable. After the prisoners had been examined and committed by Sir 
               
                  Charles 
                  Asgill 
               



            , we came to the Red Lion in Fleet-lane, Mr. Dolman told me, he had heard Haines had got the notes about him. We went to Sir Charles again, and he gave orders to have him brought to him again. He was brought. Sir Charles asked him several times to deliver the notes up; he called God to witness, he knew nothing of them. Sir Charles ordered us to take him into another room and search him. I had hold of his breeches, and heard something crime in one of his hands: I forced his hand open, and took out that of 50 l. dated the 18th of Oct. I took out half a guinea from his breeches pocket; at that time one of Sir Charles's servants, or one of the company, said, he has got something in his mouth; I seezed him by his jaw, I saw him turn up his tongue in order to swallow something, I clapt my right hand to his throat and my left behind his neck, and squeezed him till two notes came up out of his throat. (He takes them into his hand, they appeared very bloody.)

Q Did not Mrs. Haines promise to find out the people that were in the room?

Sir Charles asked him some questions; after that, we were ordered to search him. We went into another room. The beadle said, he had got something in his mouth like a chaw of tobacco; we catched hold of his mouth, and squeezed his throat, and took two notes out of his mouth, and we found a 50 l. bank note in his hand, and I found this red purse in his waistcoat pocket ( producing one).
Prosecutor. This is my purse, and it was taken out of my pocket with my money in it that night.

            's Defence.
I know nothing at all of the matter, no farther than I was drinking with my friends at the Orange-tree in Fleet-lane. My maid came and told me, there were people in the house. I went up stairs, hearing Cartwright scolding and mobbing in the room; I said, I wish you would go about your business, I do not understand why you should make a noise in my house. She went down and out of the house. I never laid my eyes upon the gentleman; I only went to the room door.

I know nothing about them, only when I came home between 4 and 5 in the morning, I went to pull the bed-cloths off to look for my watch, these papers fell upon the ground, I took them up and put them into my pocket; looking for a chamber-pot, I saw a purse, I took it up and said, here is a purse, but no money in it.

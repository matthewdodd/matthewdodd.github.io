- HAWTHORN sworn. - I am a constable: On the night the three prisoners were brought to the watch-house with the handkerchiefs, I saw this bonnet on 
               
                  Rebecca 
                  Reeson
               



            ; I asked her how she came by it, and she told me that her sister made it; I asked her what she had got under her apron; I looked, and found an old bonnet, which gave me reason to suspect that it was stolen in Cranbourn-alley; I locked her up in the watch-house, and went to inquire in Cranbourn-alley for the owner of the bonnet, and I found the owner.

             sworn. - I live at No. 18, Cranbourn-alley


; the constable, Hawthorn, brought the bonnet to me; I had seen it in the day, it was only made the day before, I am quite sure it is mine; I do not know how it went out of the shop.
Q. What is it worth? - A. Three shillings and sixpence.
Prisoner's defence. I never went into the shop; a young girl lent me the bonnet, and I was waiting at the place till she came back.

            . I am a letter founder
. I live in West-street, Smithfield



. The prisoner was in my employ, and left me early in 1820. I use casting moulds to make letters. I have not sold any for fourteen years, and then it was to the East India Company.

            . I keep the St. Luke's Head, public-house, near St. Martin's church. The prisoner lodged with me three quarters of a year, and left a fortnight ago, when 
               Read
             the officer came. About four months ago he delivered me some moulds to take care of, I gave the same to Read. He left the lodgings suddenly without notice, and owed me 3 l. 15 s. for rent and a score.
Prisoner. Q. Did I desire you to conceal them - A. No. He told me to keep them dry. Some acquaintances of his once came to see them, they were in a drawer in my parlour, which was locked at times. They were shewn to persons both in the parlour and tap-room.

            . I am an officer. On the 21st of August Hughes gave me ten moulds from his bed-room. I had been at the house all night, waiting for the prisoner, and was in search of him eight or ten days, but could not find him.

            . I am mould maker to the prosecutor, and have worked twenty-seven or twenty-eight years for him. The prisoner came to work there, and left at the beginning of 1820. Some moulds were missed about the time he left, and while he was there, and some since, but they might have been taken before. I made these moulds, their value was from 3 l. to 3 l. 10 s., but they are not worth that now. He worked their ten or twelve months, we missed none till he came. We have from twenty to thirty workmen.

            . I apprehended the prisoner in Palace-yard. He denied the charge.

             was again indicted for 


               stealing, on the 20th of August

, fifty-six pounds of types, value 50 s., and one mould, value 10 s.
            , the goods of Vincent Figgins.


                  WILLIAM 
                  BASS
               



            . I am a printer, and live at No. 3, Redcross-court, Barbican. I work for Mr. Macdonald, of Great Sutton-street, Clerkenwell. I have known the prisoner four or five months - about that time ago, he told me he had some printing materials to sell, which were the remaining stock of his business, as a letter-founder at Bristol - he gave me a sample of the type as a specimen to sell for him; and shewed me some in a box, but I did not understand them - he said one Williamson was his partner - I offered the type to Mason, six or seven weeks ago, and shewed him the sample, and in consequence of what he said, I brought him the rest of the type. I got it from Hughes's, the prisoner helped me to carry it - it was 56 lbs. It was weighed at Masons; the prisoner did not go into Mason's with me, he brought it to the door, I said I would take it in myself; a mould was with it, like those which printers use - I told the prisoner to write a bill, he wrote it in the name of Williamson and Co., and asked me to copy it - he said Williamson was more known in the trade as a letter-founder, as he was the principal workman - he gave that as his reason for having the bill in that name - I copied it to alter the price, as I was to have a profit on the sale - I delivered the bill to Mason, and after that, called several times for the money, as he was busy; I told the prisoner from time to time that Mason was putting me off, but as he was poor, I gave him 1 l. in advance. The last time I went, which was the 18th of August, Mason told me he had his suspicions, and that Figgins had claimed it. I immediately went to Figgins (no charge was made against me), this was on a Saturday - I arranged with Figgins to meet him at the Lamb and Flag, public-house, Clerkenwell-green, on Monday - I told the prisoner of it, he said he would be there at one o'clock - I returned and told Figgins the hour appointed; I went, according to appointment - Figgins, Mason, and a man named Williamson came, as his name had been used, but I did not know him - we waited an hour, then Williamson and I were taken up - I was in custody a fortnight, and then admitted to bail - I had seen the prisoner at times, at his lodgings at Hughes's, and think I remember his taking some type out in a pocket handkerchief to be weighed, opposite to where he lodged - I was to ask 18 d. a lb. for the type; I agreed to sell it to Mason at 1 s.
Prisoner. Q. Did you not offer it to M'Donald first - A. Yes; and told him I had it from one Hopkins, who had been in business at Bristol, and said I became acquainted with him through my brother - I never said I took it for a bad debt; I told Mason that I had it from Hopkins, I did not say at the office that I had it from Williamson, I said he was in the business.
Q. Did not the Magistrate send you to the House of Correction for prevarication - A. He committed me, I do not know what for; I might say the type weighed about 51 1/2 lbs.
MR. BRODRICK. Q. Did you tell Mason you had it from Williamson - A. No; I copied the bill which was in that name - As soon as the prisoner was in custody, I and Williamson were discharged.


                  WILLIAM 
                  MASON
               



            . I am a printer, and live on Clerkenwell-green. About seven weeks ago, Bass brought me a sample of type, which he said was the property of two persons who had been in partnership at Bristol; that they had dissolved partnership, and he had it for sale - I said, I must see it before I could buy it; he afterwards brought it, and a mould, and gave me a bill of parcels, which I produce - it is made out in the name of Williamson. On examining of the type, I suspected it was not honestly come by, as there was none of some letters, and very few of others - I made enquiry, and sent to Figgins, and appointed to meet him, and Bass (whom I had told that Figgins claimed the property) at the Lamb and Flag - I went on Monday, Figgins, Bass, Williamson, and Read were there; the prisoner did not come - Bass and Williamson were taken into custody. I was to give 1 s. a lb. for the type, and 10 s. for the mould - Bass had worked for me about a year and a half ago; I told him it was Figgin's; he was willing to go to him - Read took the type.
Prisoner. Q. Did Bass say he had it from Williamson - A. At first he said from Williamson, and then from Hopkins.

                  HUGHES
               



            . I have seen Bass at my house with the prisoner - the prisoner delivered me some type about four months ago, to take care of, he asked for part of it at the time he was treating with Bass - I gave him all, he took what he thought proper for a sample, and returned the rest - I heard him agreeing with Bass to sell it for him - he and Bass took it out of my house in a handkerchief, to weigh it; they brought it back, and afterwards Bass took it all away and a mould. I do not know whether Hopkins went with him then.


                  WILLIAM 
                  READ
               



            . I am an officer. Mason delivered the mould and type to me; I went to Hughes's, but could not find the prisoner - I went to the Lamb and Flag, public-house, on Monday, the 20th of August, he did not come there; I went to Hughes's immediately, and stopped till three o'clock in the morning, but the prisoner did not come.

                  FIGGINS
               



            . I am a letter-founder. The prisoner left my employ about last January - on Saturday, the 18th of August, Bass called on me and made a communication about the type; I attended at the Lamb and Flag, public-house, and sent for Williamson, who was in my employ at the same time as the prisoner - the prisoner did not come, the others did - the type is my manufacture, and was never sold in this state, the mould has been altered since it was stolen, but it is mine.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

                  THOMAS
               



            . I am in Mr. Figgins's employ. The prisoner left in January, 1820; Williamson left in November, 1819; he came in August I know the type.


                  JOSEPH 
                  WILLIAMSON
               



            . I was formerly in Mr. Figgins's employ. I was never at Bristol in my life, and was never in partnership with the prisoner, except that I did some work for Mason, and the prisoner and I parted the money which the mould earned, that was before Christmas, 1819, This is the mould we used; he brought it to me; he was at that time in Figgins's employ; it was not in this state when I had it - it was in a stereotype state - I have used it both before and since it was altered - that was before Christmas, 1819; also, I put this board on it - I believe it to be the mould, but will not be certain.

Prisoner's Defence. As to Bass he has quite contradicted what he said at the office. As to my leaving my lodgings, I was in Hughes's debt and went to live in Clerkenwell.

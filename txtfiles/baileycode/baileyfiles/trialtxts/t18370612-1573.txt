JOHN JONES
. I am a policeman. On the 14th of June I met the prisoner in Frederick-street, Portland-town, at ten o'clock at night—I suspected him and took him in charge—I found six trowels on him—he said he had been working at a building and had finished his job, and was taking them home—he did not say where he worked.





EDWARD PEASGOOD
. Some of these trowels are mine—I left them in a building in Frederick-street on the 14th—the prisoner did not work there—he is a stranger—I had fastened the building—I found the staple drawn.





WILLIAM DOBNEY
. I was at work at the same building—these trowels are mine.

Prisoner. I did not break open the place.

            . I am a labourer. On the 16th of December I was working on Mr. Cubitt's premises, in St. Pancras


 - the men who lost their tools were at work for him; they went to dinner, and I staid there - I saw two men coming out of the premises, a little after twelve o'clock, and getting over the fence which is round the enclosed ground; the prisoner got over, and the other man handed the basket of tools to him over the fence - the prisoner took it; I caught him about four hundred yards from the premises - the other man got away.

            . I was at work on these premises. I went to dinner, left my tools, and William Bugdon did the same - they are all here; I know his tools and mine.

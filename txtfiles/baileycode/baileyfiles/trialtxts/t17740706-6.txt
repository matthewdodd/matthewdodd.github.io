I am servant to Mr. Wright: as I sat at the Green Dragon in Aldersgate-street, on the 7th of June, about twelve at night, I saw the prisoner bring the iron out of my master's yard; a young man that sat with me and I pursued him, and he put it down; I asked him where he had it from; he said out of Mr. Mott's yard; that is through ours; I said be that as it would, I would take them back; he d - d me, and said I should not; I brought them back; (the bars of iron produced); I know them to be my master's property.
Prisoner's Defence.
I found the bars of iron I had that night in the street; the bars produced are not them.
The prisoner called a master bricklayer, who had known him nine years, and gave him a good character.

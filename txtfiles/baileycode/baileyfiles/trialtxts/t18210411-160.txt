            . I am a constable - I was watching the prisoner for ten minutes, and observed him very active about this shop, and saw him looking at the prosecutor's pocket. I watched and saw him put his hand in and take the handkerchief out - he pushed out of the crowd - I went after him, and took him with it in his hand.

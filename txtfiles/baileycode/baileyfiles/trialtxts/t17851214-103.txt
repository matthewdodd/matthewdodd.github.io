I am shopman to the prosecutor; the prisoner, on the 24th of November, came into Mr. Baggally's shop, and asked me to let him see some dark spun silk-stockings, nobody else was in the shop, I shewed him a pair of the pattern, but they would not do, I then told him I had some silk that would come very low, which I would let him see, and I went to look for them, and I saw a pair of stockings concealed in his hand, I collared him and began shaking him, and he threw down the stockings on the counter, and in his defence he said he had got nothing, he only threw down the stockings, there were other stockings laying on the paper which I opened to shew him, he threw them among the others, and I instantly separated them.
(The stockings deposed to, marked L. A.)
The prisoner called three witnesses who all gave him a good character.

2381. 




EDWARD TUNNICLIFF
 was indicted

 for feloniously forging and uttering a request for the delivery of goods, with intent to defraud 



William Barwick.






WILLIAM BARWICK
. I am an ironmonger. I have known the prisoner four years as a bricklayer—Mr. Warman is relieving officer of the Greenwich Union—on the 10th of July the prisoner came to me, and presented an order for a trowel and hammer, as from Mr. Warman—I asked him twice if it was a genuine order from Mr. Warman, he said it was—I gave him the hammer and trowel—this is the order—(looking at it—read)—"Mr. Barwick, Please to let the bearer have one trowel and one hammer. G. WARMAN."






GEORGE WARMAN
. I am relieving officer of Greenwich Union. The prisoner's wife receives relief, and he occasionally has relief—I never sent him with this order, but about a year ago I took him to Mr. Barwick's house—this order is not my writing—I never authorized him to get the articles.





RICHARD BOULDEN
. I am a policeman. I took the prisoner, and found the bill of the tools on him, and other tools as well.




GUILTY
. * Aged 40.—


Transported for Seven Years.
(There was another indictment against the prisoner.)

Before Mr. Common Sergeant.

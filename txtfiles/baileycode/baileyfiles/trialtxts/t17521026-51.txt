The prisoner had lived servant
 with the prosecutor, but gone away about five weeks before the goods were missing. She was taken up upon suspicion, having left a pair of shoes in the house which were known to be hers. Most of the goods being found upon her, she confessed, that she got into the house over night; the key being carried up when the family went to bed, she was obliged to abide in secret till the servant maid got up in the morning, unlocked the door, and went up stairs again, at which time she went out with the things mentioned.

            . The prisoner was my journeyman
; I went into the country, and when I came back again, I missed two pair of breeches; I found the prisoner had been left by himself; I took him before Justice Cox, there he confessed he sold one pair to a Jew in Westminster, and another pair, which were new, to a person in Monmouth-street.

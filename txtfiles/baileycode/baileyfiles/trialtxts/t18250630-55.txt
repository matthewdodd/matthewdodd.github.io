. The prisoner is my apprentice
 - I received twenty guineas with him; he was entrusted to receive money for me. Sophia Ball was indebted to me in the sum of 3 l. 4 s. On the 4th of June I sent the prisoner to her to receive it - he returned, and brought me two sovereigns, and said Mrs. Ball had given him that, and if he called the following week she would settle the remainder. I received information on the following Monday, and had him taken.

            . My husband is an upholsterer - he was indebted to Mr. Stanton 3 l. 4 s., which I paid to the prisoner on the 4th of June, in three sovereigns and four shillings.
Prisoner's Defence. My master has frequently let me out of an evening, and given me the key of the side door - this led me into bad company, and I had gamed, and lost money. On the 4th of June I went and paid that money at the house, or else they would have exposed me to my father, but it was my master's letting me out of an evening, which was the cause of it.



               GUILTY
            . Aged 18.
JAMES STANTON. He has been four years and a half with me, and has been robbing me three years - he is very dissolute in his habits. He never had the key of the private door from me; his father is a butler in a respectable family, and has a good character.

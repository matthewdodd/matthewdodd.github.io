WILLIAM PHIN MURRAY
. I am a piano-forte maker. I was walking with my wife in George-street, St. Giles's, on the 2nd of June, between six and seven o'clock in the evening—I felt something—I turned immediately and saw the prisoner walking away from me; but he must have been walking towards me—when I felt the touch, I felt my pocket, and told my wife I had lost my handkerchief—I ran round Broad-street and up Plumtree-street, where I knew I should meet the prisoner—I saw an officer and I told him, and I had hardly got the words out of my mouth when the prisoner passed, and the officer took him—the handkerchief was found in his trowsers—this is it.

Prisoner. Q. Can you swear that it is yours? A. Yes; I had it in my pocket the minute before.





THOMAS WIGGINS
 (police-constable E 26). The prosecutor spoke to me, and I took the prisoner with this handkerchief concealed in his trowsers. 


GUILTY
*. Aged 20.—


Transported for Ten Years.

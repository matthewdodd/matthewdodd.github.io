MARY BUCKLEY. I am the wife of Paul Buckley. On the 18th of December, about three o'clock in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner in my drying ground, at Millbank


, taking down my shirts; he had pulled down part of my pailing, which is three feet high, to get in. I called out to him, and he made his escape out of the yard. I did not lose sight of him until he was taken.
PAUL BUCKLEY. I heard my wife give the alarm, and saw the prisoner with the shirts under his arm. I saw him stopped. He struck the man who took him, very violently.

            .
ANN McCARTHY. I live as nurse
 in a family. I had the property stated in the indictment in a brown paper parcel; in my hand, on the evening of the 22d of January. I was in Orchard-street, Oxford-street


; I was knocked down, and the parcel was snatched out of my hand by two soldiers

, but I do not know their persons; I gave an alarm, but I have never got my property since. I followed the soldiers, and one of them went into the barracks in Portman-street; I asked the sentinel if he knew the man who had just gone in - he said Yes, it was Stanton; I went into the guard-room, and told the serjeant; he told me to come again the next morning, and he sent some men after Welch, whose person I described, as having spoken to him just before, when I had inquired of him my way to Baker-street. I went to the barracks again the next morning, and the two prisoners were produced by the colonel.
Prisoner WELCH. Q. Where did you see me? A. At the corner of Orchard-street; I asked you the way to Baker-street, and you directed me; there was another soldier with him, whose person I did not notice.

            . On the 22d of January I was standing at the corner of Portman-street, about five minutes past six o'clock, and saw the two prisoners in company with each other; they passed me, and went on towards Orchard-street.

            . I was the sentinel at the barrack gate that evening; Stanton came in from ten to twenty minutes past six o'clock - the prosecutrix came up, and asked me if I knew the man who had just come in - I said Yes; she said she had been knocked down and robbed; I told her to go and tell the serjeant of the guard: no one had come in but Stanton.
WELCH'S Defence. This woman cannot swear that she saw me after she asked me the way to Baker-street; I am very well acquainted with the place where she says she was knocked down, and there are two or three turnings about there. I had been with two of our men from ten minutes past six o'clock till half-past; I had seen Stanton about six o'clock, when I parted with him, and he was going to his own barracks; about half-past six o'clock I saw two men and a corporal, who told me they were come to look for me, as there had been a crowd about the barrack gate, and my name had been mentioned - I said I would go with them, as I had not been absent from any duty.

            . I am a drummer in the second batallion of the Coldstream Guards - Welch belongs to the same company: I met him on the 22d of January, about a quarter-past six o'clock, in Orchard-street, about three doors up from Oxford-street; I did not see Stanton at all.

            . I am in the same batallion. On the evening of the 22d of January, I came out of the barracks at ten minutes or a quarter past six o'clock, and saw Welch at the corner of Portman-street, about fifty yards from the barrack gate; he had nothing with him at that time; I went up to the barracks soon afterwards, saw a crowd, and heard that two of our soldiers had been robbing a woman- I went out again in about five minutes, and met Welch: I told him his name had been mentioned: he said he had missed no duty, and did not know what it should be mentioned for; I told him what I had heard, and he said, so held him God he had not seen any soldiers or women that night.

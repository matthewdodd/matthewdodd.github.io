WILLIAM COOPER
 and 




JOHN JONES
 were indicted for

stealing, on the 
30th of March, 1 handkerchief, value 5s., the goods of 



Thomas Young, from his person.






THOMAS YOUNG
. I am a solicitor. On the 30th of March I was in the waiting-room, at Somerset House; on business at the Stamp Office—I saw the prisoner Jones at my back, and Cooper on my right—I felt my pocket touched three or four times—I got my stamps, turned to the table, and missed my handkerchief—I looked at the prisoners, and saw Jones reach over something to Cooper, which he put under his apron—I said to him, "Let me see what you have got under your apron"—he avoided me, and turned off—I saw the handkerchief drop from under his apron, took it up and gave them both in charge.





JACOB WOODWARD
. I am a policeman. I took the prisoners into custody.

Cooper's Defence. I was waiting there for my master's property—I took this lad in to show him the place, and this gentleman accused me, but I am innocent—I think he found the handkerchief under a gentleman'i feet.


Janes's Defence. I went in with Cooper, and stood by the fire—I was
not near this gentleman at all.
(Cooper received a good character.)

COOPER—


GUILTY
. Aged 15.—



Confined Six Months.

JONES—


GUILTY
. * Aged 15.—


Transported for Ten Years.

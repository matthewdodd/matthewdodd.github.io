JOHN SMITH. I live in Banner-street. On the 26th of March, about five o'clock in the afternoon, I was on the City side of Temple-bar


, and was on the watch, having lost handkerchief before; I felt a motion at my pocket, put my hand down, and missed my handkerchief; I saw the prisoner putting one inside his coat, and directly called Stop thief! he ran across into Chancery-lane, and was stopped - I am quite sure of him.

            . I live at Mr. Davis', in Fleet-street. I was in Fleet-street, and saw the prisoner take the handkerchief from Mr. Smith's pocket; I ran across after him, calling Stop thief! but did not see him stopped, as a carriage came in the way; I am certain he is the boy - the handkerchief was found under his coat.

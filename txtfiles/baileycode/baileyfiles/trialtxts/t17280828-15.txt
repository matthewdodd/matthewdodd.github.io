            , on the 25th of June
, the Property of Mr. 
               
                  
                     William 
                     Buckland 
                  




                
            .
Mr. Buckland depos'd, That the Prisoner being his Servant
 at the Time he had the Goods stole from him, and it being his Turn to sit up every other Night; upon the Goods being missing he was suspected to have taken them.


                  Edward 
                  Jones 
               



             depos'd, That he took Notice the Goods were missing on those Nights when the Prisoner sate up to watch.


                  John 
                  Byron 
               



             depos'd, That the Prisoner ask'd him to let him put the Beer in his Store-house: But the Court strictly examining the Matter, found that this Deponent had bought both the Beer and the Ale of the Prisoner, at a Price which must satisfy him it was stolen, for he gave but 2 Shillings a Barrel both for the Beer and for the Ale, but the Prosecutor willing to favour him, suffered him to escape with Impunity: The Fact appearing plain upon Biddle, the Jury found him 

               guilty of Felony
            .

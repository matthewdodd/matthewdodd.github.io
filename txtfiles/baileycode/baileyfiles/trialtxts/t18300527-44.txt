JOHN WOODBRIDGE. I am a carpenter
. This building was unoccupied, I had the care of it; it is at Harrow


 -I was at work there, and the prisoner worked for me; the copper was fixed in an out-house - I saw it in the morning of the 4th of May, and in the evening it was gone - I had seen the prisoner that evening, going up towards the house- I went afterwards, and the copper was gone; the prisoner was gone from the premises then - I went in search of it that evening, and found it next day in a pond near the prisoner's father's; the prisoner lodges with a man named Chapman, four or five hundred yards from the pond.

I was going to Harrow school on the 4th of May, about twenty minutes before nine o'clock in the evening, and saw the prisoner standing under the porch of the door of the house in question; I went into my own house, and watched him -I saw him come out with the copper before him; he put it on his head - I told the witness' wife of it; he was sent for and came.

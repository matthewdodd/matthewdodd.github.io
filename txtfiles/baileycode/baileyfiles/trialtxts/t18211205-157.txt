            . I am a watchman of Cockspur-street. At three o'clock in the afternoon the prisoner came and borrowed a shovel and pick-axe of me; he worked at the next building to Chandler's; he returned it about four o'clock, and asked if I would have any thing to drink; we went and had a pot of beer; he went out while I was was drinking with my wife, and I suppose he thought I was going to remain at the public house, but in five minutes, as it was getting dark, I went to the back of the building, found a board taken down, and missed the lead from its place, and found it a few yards off. I went to the public house, he came over, and I saw sand on his shoes; I had seen footmarks on the sand by the board. In about an hour he returned to the premises, and took up the lead, lifted it on his shoulder, and I seized him.
(Property produced and sworn to).
Prisoner's Defence. He took me and showed me the lead.

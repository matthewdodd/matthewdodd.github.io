                   TOPHAM
               



             sworn.
Tell us what you know relative to Neven only? - In consequence of a letter that was intercepted from 
               
                  Robert
                   Gilbraith
               



             to Neven the prisoner, we had a suspicion that some goods were lodged at his house; we had lost a great quantity; and on or about the 8th of September, we went with a warrant to search Neven's house; the constable, named Brockley, and Mr. Lavender and 
               
                  John
                   Gee
               



            : Neven was at home; I stood at the door; I was not a witness to what was found there; I was in the house after they were found; I heard the husband say he knew nothing of them, but he believed his wife had bought them.


                  JOHN
                   GEE
               



             sworn.
I was present when the house of Nevenwas searched; I saw, found there, a callico napkin, the same thing as a towel, a chintz muslin shawl; I think there were two calico handkerchiefs; I do not recollect any thing else, any more than some patterns which we used to sell the handkerchiefs by; no pieces of handkerchiefs; they were found in the drawers of a bureau up one pair of stairs in a bed-room.
Did you hear from Neven himself, that it was his apartment? - I do not know that I did; I took it to be so; he said, he knew nothing of them, he supposed his wife bought them.
Were you present in Court when Gilbraith was tried? - I was.
Were those things produced on that trial? - I believe not.
Do you know whether they were a part of the things for which Gilbraith was indicted? - They were not; we supposed them to be things stolen by Gilbraith.
But were they included in the indictment against Gilbraith; how many chintz muslin shawls were there in that indictment? - Two.
How many altogether were found? - I I do not know; Lavender has a list.


                  EDWARD
                   LAVENDER
               



             sworn.
I have a list which contains the things in the indictment, and where they were found.
How many chintz muslin shawls does there appear? - Two; one was found at Neven's, and the other, I think was found in 
               
                  Mary
                   Gilbraith
               



            's box.
How many calico handkerchiefs were in the indictment against Gilbraith? - I suppose near twenty; the goods that were found at Neven's are described, except the shawls, separate by themselves, to those found at Molloy's, and in 
               
                  Mary
                   Gilbraith
               



            's box.
Did you hear Neven say any thing about the things? - He was asked by the Lord Mayor how he came by them; I cannot say whether he made any answer, or his wife; there were also found at Neven's, four pieces of handkerchief patterns; the drawers where the goods were found were locked, and Neven had the key.
Do you know of any connexion between the prisoner Neven and Gilbraith? - Only by intercepting a letter addressed to Neven from Gilbraith.
EDWARD M'CARTY sworn.
I live in St. Luke's; I am a baker; his general character has been very good; he has been a customer of mine the last eight years.
The prisoner Neven. called four more witnesses, who all gave him a good character.
Jury. We are perfectly satisfied on the whole of the case.

Topham. I went with Lavender and others to the house of Molloy's; Gilbraith's box was found in Molloy's house locked; when we asked him who it belonged to, he said, the box belonged to 
               
                  Thomas
                   Gilbraith
               



            ; we asked him if he had the key; he said, he had not; I never found whether he had the key or not.
Were any things found at Molloy's, except what were found in the box, or in the charge of 
               
                  Mary
                   Gilbraith
               



            , exclusive of the box? - There was a remnant of calico found in Molloy's own box, valued at 6 d. about three quarters of a yard; one calico handkerchief, six tambour muslin cap cauls, and two pair of calico mints; I do not recollect whether that box was locked or not; he owned it was his box: 
               
                  Mary
                   Gilbraith
               



             lodged there; she was present; I do not recollect she said any thing of the things; she owned to the box in which it was found; in her box was found a calico check handkerchief, a chintz muslin shawl, four half shawls, tambour muslin for cauls, a calico handkerchief, pink and blue pattern, two calico handkerchiefs, purple and pink stormont borders; one calico towel, twelve pair of black silk mitts, the mitts are not in the indictment, and four yards of calico muslin is inthe indictment, to the best of my recollection; she said, her brother had given them to her.
Did she know that her brother was in your service? - Yes, I believe she did; she said, she always thought what it must come to, when she was apprehended; that she was very sorry she came from Ireland.


                  JOHN
                   GEE
               



             sworn.
I was at Molloy's.
Did you hear any conversation of either of the prisoners? - No; I know that Molloy's box was locked, and his wife had the key; he was present; she said, there was nothing of our's in the box, but we were very welcome to search; the calico we found in the box with a private mark upon it.


                  Edward
                   Lavender
               



            . I was at Molloy's cellar before the gentlemen; I asked Molloy if he knew 
               
                  Robert
                   Gilbraith
               



            ; says he, yes, extremely well; says I, is his sister not at your house; no, he said, she is not, nor he had not seen her for three weeks; I told him, he certainly must be mistaken, for she was at his house that day; on my pressing him, he acknowledged she had been at his house that day at six o'clock; but she was gone to lodge in the city; it was then eleven; then this gentleman came, and I asked him if he would let me search, and he said no, without we would produce our authority; upon which, I immediately went down, and found her in bed; I believe Gilbraith was taken up the fore part of the same day.
Do you know whether they knew before you went there, that Gilbraith had been taken up? - No.
Topham. I do not know; I should rather suppose they did not.
Mr. Schoen, prisoner's counsel. Did the man say to you, that he had not seen her for three weeks, or known her above three weeks? - That he had not seen her for three weeks.

             told me she had an acquaintance in Wapping, and that there were some goods there.
Was there any promise made her? - No; in consequence of some information, we found that Mary Gilbraith had an acquaintance at Wapping; we went there, and found a remnant of tambour muslin, about two yards, with our private mark, at the house of Mr. Creagh.
Was there any menace held out to her? - None that I know of.

             sworn.
Where did you get the things that were found at the house? - The woman prisoner brought them to me to make up; she told me her brother bought them and gave them to her; she brought tambour muslin to make into caps; I asked her how much it was a yard; she could not tell me; but said, her brother bought it for her.
Prisoner Molloy. I leave it to my counsel.
Mary Gilbraith. I leave it to my counsel.
The prisoner Molloy called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.

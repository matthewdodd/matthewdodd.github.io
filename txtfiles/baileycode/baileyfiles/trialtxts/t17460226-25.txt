Best. In May last.

Q. How long did he continue in the Lodgings ?
Best. 'Till he was taken up .
Q. How came you to take him up?
Best. We had a Suspicion .
Q. What follow'd upon that ? Did you examine him about it?
Best. Yes; and he told me where the Things were, and we had a Warrant and found them.
Q. And you found them where he told you?
Best. Yes, my Lord .
Q. What did you find there?
Best. Three Blankets , a Pair of Sheets, a Pillow and Bolster, and Tea-kettle.
Q. And these were your Goods? They were Part of the Furniture of his Lodgings?

                  Q. 
               


            (to the Prisoner) Will you ask this Witness any Question?
Prisoner. Please to ask him how long it is that he knew those Things were pawned?


                  Q. 
               


            (to the Witness) How long is it since you found these Things?
Best. I found some missing about ten Days ago.
Q. When did you take him up?
Best. Last Thursday .
Q. When had you first a Suspicion of him?
Best. About ten Days ago.
To the Prisoner. He says he entertain'd a Suspicion of you about ten Days or a Fortnight ago.
Prisoner. Please you, my Lord, 'tis above three Months since: 'Tis a very bad Time of the Year; I paid Half a Crown 2 Week, and they teaz'd me for the Money; I said I must be obliged to make away with the Things, if they must have the Money. After that, my Lord, I told him, that the Rent of the Room was too dear for me; as soon as ever I could make it good I would quit his Lodgings; but I never quitted my Lodgings, 'till he obliged me to it. I could bring a Gentleman, my Friend, that would have laid down the Money: He made an Agreement with me, not above a Fortnight ago, if I would pay him five Shillings a Week, that he would be easy with me and bring the Things out by little and little as I could; but there is something that vexed him that made him do it. I had no design to wrong him.

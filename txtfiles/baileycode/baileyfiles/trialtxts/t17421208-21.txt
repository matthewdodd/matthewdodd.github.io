            . I lost a Cambrick Handkerchief , the 24th of November last, about six or seven at Night, out of my Right Hand Pocket; as I was going through the Postern of Ludgate


, towards the City, I felt a Hand in my Pocket, and saw my Handkerchief in the Prisoner's Hand, and took it from him; but he said he knew nothing of it.
Prisoner. Were there any more Men by, besides myself?
Southerton . Yes; there was a Gentleman with me, and another.

             . I was standing by Ludgate Prison Door, where I keep a Stall; I saw a Stop in the Postern, and saw the Prosecutor take a Handkerchief out of the Prisoner's Hand. I went for a Constable , but he made his Escape; and Mr Ogilby, one of my Lord Mayor's Officers, caught him again; and I went with him before my Lord Mayor.
Prisoner. When the Gentleman turned round, there were two more Men by him, and the Handkerchief was hanging out of his Pocket. I had not the Handkerchief in my Hand at all; he knows between God and his Conscience, I did not do it; he said to another Man, You have picked my Pocket .
Southerton . He was not a Quarter of a Yard off me: I took it in his Hand before he got from me. 


               Guilty 10 d.

, he is a hardwareman
. On Monday last I saw the prisoner take six knives and forks from the shop of 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Clark
               



            . I ran after him and took them from him.
Q. Did you know any thing of the man before. - A. I have seen him pass about half a dozen times before he stole them.
Prisoner's Defence. I wanted to buy these knives and forks, I was going to ask the price of them, and the man came and gave me a blow on the head.
Q. (to Witness) Did he ask the price of them. - A. No, he walked backwards and forwards, I think he had his hand upon them, that gave me a suspicion, I watched him, he took them and put them by his side, and walked away with them.

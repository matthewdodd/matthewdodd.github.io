            . I live in Norton-fa lg at


 and am a
linen-draper
. On the 17th of June, between two and half-past two o'clock, I was standing in my shop - a woman came in, and told me that she saw another run away with some print; she was pursued, and brought back with twelve yards of printed cotton, which had been in my shop within two feet of the door; I think she might reach over, and get it without coming in at the door.

STEPHEN WHITAKER. I keep a pawnbroker's shop
, in Long-lane, Smithfield


. These trousers hung inside my shop, but within reach of a person who was passing - I saw the prisoner come to the door, snatch them down, and run away - I pursued, and did not lose sight of him, till he turned into Charterhouse-lane, where he threw them down; the beadle stopped him - I am sure he is the man.

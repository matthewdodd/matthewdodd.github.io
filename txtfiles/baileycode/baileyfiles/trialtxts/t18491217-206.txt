RICHARD AYRES



; stealing 1 hat, value 10s.; the goods of 



Lucy Williams: having been before convicted.






ELIZA SUTTER
. I am the wife of Edward Sutter, of 14, North-place. On 3rd Dec. I was standing next door to Lucy Williams's shop; the prisoner came up and said he was badly off, like me, and was obliged to sell matches; that he was going to steal something, and if I saw him take anything not to tell, and he would give me a pint of beer; that he had 4d. a night to pay for his lodging, and had nothing to pay it with—I said, "You had better go on; I don't want to know your business"—he left me, crossed the road, and I saw him standing at the door of Mrs. Williams's shop—I saw his hand up with something bright in it, and then I saw a hat in his hand—he ran across the road with it—I gave information.





THOMAS CHARLES CORPE
. I am in the service of Mrs. Lucy Williams. I

received information, and missed a hat from the door—I had seen it safe five minutes before.





WILLIAM HARRIS
 (policeman). I took the prisoner, and told him it was for stealing a hat, and asked if he recollected speaking to a matchwoman—he said yes, but he knew nothing about a hat—I found a pair of scissors in his pocket.

Prisoners Defence. I am a grinder, and had the scissors to grind; I was not there at the time.





WILLIAM HARRIS
 (re-examined). I produce a certificate—(read-Richard Jyres, Convicted March, 1849, and confined six months)—the prisoner is the man.




GUILTY
. † * Aged 20.—


Transported for Seven Years.

            . I am a Police-constable. I met the prisoner on the morning of the 30th of April, about twenty yards from where the property was taken - he was in Judd-street, carrying this glass, which I took from him; this is a part of a sash which was dropped, and two pieces of glass found on the prisoner belong to this sash, and fit exactly; I asked how he became possessed of the glass - he said it belonged to his master, Mr. Cumming, in the Edgware-road; he stated before the Magistrate, that he bought it of a man coming along the street - he lived in the same place from where the property was taken.

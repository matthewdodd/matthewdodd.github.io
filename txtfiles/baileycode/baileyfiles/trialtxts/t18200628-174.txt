. The prisoner was brought to my shop with the caddy, which I saw safe on the parlour table just before, in the middle of the room; he must have got in at the window - mine is a corner house.

            . I am a butcher, and live in King-street, Seven Dials. I was going up Langley-street, Long-acre, and saw the prisoner and two other boys walking by, and looking in at Thompson's window, which was open. I went on, and as I returned, I saw the prisoner lift another boy up to the window. I ran and told my master, who was at a house just opposite - he told me to watch them. I ran down the street and caught the prisoner in White Lion-street, with the tea-caddy in hishand, wrapped in a handkerchief - the other two ran away.

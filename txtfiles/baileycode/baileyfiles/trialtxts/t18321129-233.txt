CHARLES HOLLEY OSWIN. I am the son of Charles Oswin - he lives in Harley-street, and is a dentist. On the 24th of November, I was in Vere-street


, taking a letter to the Post, and the prisoner passed me - he took my cap, and ran on to Old Cavendish-street; there he threw it down, and I took it up - the officer followed, and took him in Oxford-street.

             (Police-constable D 84.) I saw the prisoner running - Oswin charged him with taking the cap- I followed him to Oxford-street, and took him.

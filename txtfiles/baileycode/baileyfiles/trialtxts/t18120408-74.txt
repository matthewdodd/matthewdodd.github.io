. On the 2d of March, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner and another woman came into the shop, they seemed to be companions; her companion asked to look at some printed cottons; I shewed her a great many printed cottons; the other woman agreed for a yard and a half of print; I was cutting it off at fourteen pence a yard, and the prisoner went out of the shop. I went after her, and brought her into the shop, and she dropped from under her clothes twenty-two yards of printed cotton; I saw it drop from under her clothes, and while I was securing the prisoner the other woman made off, and left the yard and a half of print that I was cutting off in my hands.
Q. You had other shopmen in the shop - A. Yes, four or five.

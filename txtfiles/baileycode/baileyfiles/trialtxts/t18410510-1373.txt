CHARLES SPRENGELL GREAVES
. I was walking on the left side of Lincoln's Inn-fields, at half-past four o'clock, on the 23rd of April—I had a short time before put my pocket-handkerchief into my right-hand pocket behind, and when I got about twenty yards from the turning to Little Queen-street I felt a touch, and my pocket felt lighter—about the same time a boy, about the size of the prisoner, passed on my right, and another boy passed on my left—shortly after the witness pointed out the prisoner, who had taken my handkerchief—I went and took him by the shoulder, and said, "Where is my handkerchief?"—he said, "That other boy has

got it"—I sent the witness after him, and I kept the prisoner—he said several times, if I would let him go, he would get the handkerchief—he then pat his hand into his bosom, and pulled out the handkerchief now produced, which is mine—I took him to the policeman—he said he had eight or nine brothers, if I would let him go he would never do to again.





WILLIAM ADMUN
. I was walking on the north side of Lincoln's Inn-fields, about a quarter before four o'clock that day—I saw the prisoner take the handkerchief from the prosecutor's pocket, and I gave information.

Prisoner's Defence. I saw a young man walking behind the gentleman; I he took the handkerchief and chucked it on the railings—I stood about two I minutes—I saw no one, and took it—the gentleman came and said, had I I got his handkerchief?—I said yes, I saw a young man take it.

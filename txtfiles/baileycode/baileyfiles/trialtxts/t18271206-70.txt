            . I am in the employ of Mr. John Bann, shoemaker
, of New Bond-street - the prisoner was in his employ - he was a blocker
. On the 23d of November I was directed by another shopman to look into the pocket of his coat, which hung against the wall - I put my hand in, took out one shoe, and asked the prisoner if he knew any thing about it - he said, No - I said, "Do not deny it, for you know the fellow is in your pocket;" he said, "It is all right;" he took the other shoe out of his pocket, and told me to say nothing about it.

                  John 
                  Purser 
               



             depos'd, that he was a Hackney Coachman, and about 11 at Night driving home, the prisoner call'd Coach, he came down and open'd the Door and let her in; She threw her Arms round his Neck, and hugg'd him close to her, grew familiar with his Breeches, and then ran away; She was not gone far from him, when feeling in his Pocket he mist half a Crown: he followed and taxt her with picking his Pocket. The Watch came to them, she said she had but a penny about her, and offer'd to strip herself before them all that they might search her, and one of the Watch upon examining took 3 s. and 6 d. out of her Mouth. The prisoner in her defence said, that about 1 o'Clock in the Morning she was going to Market to buy black Cherries, and took 3 s. 6 d. with her which she put in her Mouth, for fear of meeting with rude Fellows who might pick her Pocket; and that she took nothing in her Pocket but a half penny worth of Tobacco, a short Pipe, and a penny for her Mornings draught; as she past by the prisoner, who was feeding his Horses on Ludgate Hill, he call'd and ask'd her to come into the Coach: she was frighted out of her Wits at his rudeness, and ran away from him; he follow'd her, call'd the Watch and charged her with what she was as innocent of, as the Child unborn. 


               Guilty to the value of 10 d.

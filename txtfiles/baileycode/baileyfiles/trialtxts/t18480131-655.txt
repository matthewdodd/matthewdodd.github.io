EMMA BEDFORD
. I am servant to Mr. James Willis, who keeps the Nag's Head, Clerkenwell. On 19th Jan., the prisoners came together into the tap-room, and had some beer and bread and cheese—my master went out, and after he was gone, the prisoners asked me if they might go up stairs to play at bagatelle—they went up to the play-room, the first-floor front room—I had been there ten minutes before—the balls were all safe, and there was an odd ball in a box on the mantel-piece-Elson afterwards came down for half-aquartern of gin—he took it up stairs—in a short time he came back with the glass—he went up again, came down, and went up again—he at last came with Elderkin, and they both went away—I went up stairs before they had hardly got out of the house—I missed nine balls off the board, and the odd ball also—I have not seen them since—the prisoners were not up stairs above a quarter of an hour—no one went up stairs but them.





GEORGE CRICK
 (policeman, L 40.) I produce a certificate of Elderkin's former conviction—(read—Convicted 10th May, 1847, of stealing nine bagatelle ball, and confined six months)—he is the person.

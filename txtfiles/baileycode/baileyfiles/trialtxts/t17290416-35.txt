            , of St. Clement s Danes

                           Philip

                  , and taking from him 39 Yards of Holland
            , the Goods of 
               
                  
                     Mary 
                     Graves 
                  



                
            .
The Prosecutor depos'd, As he was in Bell-Court, near Brooks-Market


, and having the Goods under his Arm, that the Prisoner came up to him and knock'd him down, and then pull'd the Holland from him; upon which he cry'd out, and the Neighbours came immediately to his Assistance.

                  Miles 
               



             depos'd, That hearing the Prosecutor cry out, he immediately pursued and took the Prisoner, who had dropp'd the Goods, and hid himself in a Corner of the Alley, where 
               
                  Mary 
                  Miles 
               



             inform'd him she saw him run to hide himself: The Prosecutor indeed was positive that the Prisoner was the Man that knock'd him down, and robb'd him; but, as it seem'd, the Prisoner had an Accomplice, who got off, and the Prosecutor being old, and Lamp-Light, and the Disorder he must of Necessity be in, it being possible for him to be mistaken, they found him 


               guilty only to the Value of 4 s. 10 d
            .

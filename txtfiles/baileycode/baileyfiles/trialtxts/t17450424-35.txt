            . On the 27th of March last I went to bed between 10 and 11, and all was safe. In about an hour's time I was called up by my brother. I struck a light, went into the parlour, and found the Prisoner there, and the window open. He had got a bag or a sack with two table-cloths and three towels of mine, and he said, For God's sake let me go, for I have taken nothing out of the room. I never saw the Prisoner before that afternoon, and then he drank a pint of beer.

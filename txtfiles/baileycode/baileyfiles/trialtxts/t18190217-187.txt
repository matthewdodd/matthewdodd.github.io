            . I am a shoemaker
, the prisoner was my apprentice
. On Sunday, the 21st of February, he asked leave to go out - I gave him leave. I suspected him, and as he was going out I called him back, and asked him for a handkerchief which he had taken sometime before, he denied it. I searched him, and found the handkerchief in his breeches, and the leather in his pockets. I asked him who induced him to rob me? he refused to tell me.

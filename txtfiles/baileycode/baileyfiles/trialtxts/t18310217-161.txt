            . I live in Vine-street


, and am overseer of the district of Saffron-hill - I am a bookseller
. On the 20th of January the prisoner came to my shop - shesaid, "My son, whom you sent to the hospital, is dead;" I said, "I did not send any one to the hospital, but I think my brother overseer has;" she then said her two children at home were starving - I told her I would come down to her house; I then missed two books - the prisoner had then got into the passage; I called her back, lifted up her shawl, and found these two books, which are mine.
Prisoner. I did not go out of the shop; when he asked about them I said, "Here are two on the chair, perhaps these are them." Witness. No, it was not so - she had got out into the passage; I have since found she had no child dead.
Prisoner's Defence. I did not say he was dead then; it is eight months ago since he died.

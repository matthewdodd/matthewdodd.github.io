, at about ten o'clock at night, nearly opposite New Turnstile, the prisoner at the bar crossed upon me, and made a snatch at my chain the chain broke from the watch, and he ran; I hallooed stop thief, and ran after him. A young man of the name of Drew ran also; and we seized him at the top of Gate-street; I never lost sight of him.

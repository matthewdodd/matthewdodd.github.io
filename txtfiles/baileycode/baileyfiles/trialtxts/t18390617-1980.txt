ADOLPHUS BROME RADDEN
. I am a copper-plate printer. I was at Greenwich fair on the 20th of May, facing Richardson's show—I felt a tug at my pocket—I thought there was somebody pressing me, but I took no notice—I then felt it again—I turned, and saw the prisoner close behind me—I took hold of him, and took my handkerchief from his breast—I gave him to the policeman—this is my handkerchief.

Prisoner's Defence. I picked it up, and asked a gentleman if it was his—he said "No," and then this gentleman took me.

MARY BAKER
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
26th of January, 1 half-crown and 3 shillings, the monies of

SAMUEL ADAMS
. I am a waiter at the King's Head tavern, in the Old Jewry. On Sunday evening, the 26th of January, I was in Hackney-road, about half-past eleven o'clock—the prisoner accosted me, and asked me to go with her—I went to Caroline-street, Hackney-road, to a lower room—I sat and talked with her—I had 11s. or 12s. in my right-hand breeches-pocket, and among it was a half-crown—I know it was secure when I went into the house—she sat on my right-hand side—I was sober—(I had been at home till the evening, and then went out for a walk to the Eagle)—I gave her a shilling before I went into the house, but I did not like the situation I was in, and got up to go away—I had taken no liberties with her at all—when I got to the door of the room I missed my money, and told her she had got it—she denied it—I told her she had robbed me of my money—she said she had not—the policeman was passing, and heard us—he took her—she said she had not got the money, nor had she taken it—the policeman found a half-crown and three shillings in the grate, which, I believe was part of what I had lost.





JOSEPH SMALLEY
 (police-constable H 175.) I heard the noise, and went into the house—I asked the prisoner if she had taken the money, and said, if she had, she had better give it up—the landlord and landlady came into the room—I said, "This girl has been robbing this man, and if she don't give it up, I will take the whole three of you to the station-house"—the landlady begged I would not for the sake of her husband's character—I then heard them whisper together, and some one said, "The ashes"—I then got a bit of paper, and found this money in the ashes.




GUILTY

Transported for Ten Years.

1922. 




WILLIAM VICE
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
6th of June, 1 handkerchief, value 4s., the goods of 



Henry Hammond Ogden, from his person.






HENRY HAMMOND OGDEN
. I am a master mariner, and live in White Horse-street, Stepney. On the 6th of June I passed through Stepney fair, between six and seven o'clock—I felt my handkerchief leave my pocket—I turned round, and collared the prisoner—I commenced feeling about his body to see if he had it concealed—I was told it was under his feet—I picked it up—I went with him till I found an officer, and handed him the handkerchief.

Prisoner. It was two or three yards from me when you took it up. Witness. It was immediately under his feet.





JOHN KINGSTON
. I was in the fair, and curiosity led me to observe the prisoner—he was rolling a red coloured handkerchief under his waistcoat, and casting his eye down to the ground—the prosecutor came up presently, and attempted to collar him—the prisoner cast his eye round, drew the handkerchief from his person, turned round, and faced the prosecutor.

Prisoner. When the prosecutor came and tapped me on the shoulder I was in a crowd of people, and this witness was four or five yards off. Witness. There was a crowd, but I was close to him as I am now.





JAMES PARSONS
 (police-constable K 179.) I took the prisoner, and have the handkerchief—he said he did not take it—it was on the ground.

(Property produced and sworn to.)




GUILTY
. * Aged 21.—


Transported for Ten Years.

            . I live at Pimlico


: I lost a pair of sheets out of my house; there were two cloth coats, a nankeen waistcoat, three stocks, a pair of shoes, and two handkerchiefs, the property of

            , my apprentice
. I know nothing of the robbery; I was out; I left my sister 
               
                  Mary
                   Johnson
               



             in the house.
Rice Williams. I was going to Chelsea on the 4th of May; when I came to the Five Fields I saw the prisoner at Holmes's window that looks into the field at the back of the house; he took two bundles out of the window, put one under his arm and took the other in his hand, and carried them to the middle of the field, and sat down on them for about a minute; then I saw him come back to the window, and take another bundle out and put it in his pocket, and go again to the things; I told a gentleman that was coming along I did not know what to make of the prisoner, I thought he was a thief, and if he would watch which way he went, I would go and let Mr. Holmes know of it; I went and informed them, and they found the parlour stripped; he attempted to run away; the gentleman pursued and took him, and I saw him drop the bundles.

            . Mr. Williams informed me of his suspicions of the prisoner; I saw him drop these two bundles in the field (producing them); he ran into a pig sty; I followed him, took him, and brought him back to the house; he cried for mercy. In the bundles were found all the things that were missing, except the shoes and buckles, which I found in the field next morning, just by where he dropped the bundles.

             deposed to the two coats, the nankeen waistcoats, the handkerchief and shoes.

            . I did not see the prisoner in the house; I was not very well, and was in the kitchen; I saw the people running, but did not know what was the matter till my little girl informed me the parlour was stripped.

Prisoner's Defence.
I heard the cry of stop thief; I pursued the thief a-cross the field; a man stopped me and said I was the person.
Q. to Williams. Are you positive the prisoner is the man that took the things out of the window?
Williams. Yes; I am positive to his clothes and every thing.




               Not guilty of breaking and entering the dwelling house, but guilty of stealing to the value of 4 s. 10 d.

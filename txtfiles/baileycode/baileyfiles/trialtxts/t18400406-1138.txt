MARY FITZWATERS
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
15th of February, 2 sheets, value 3s., 1 quilt, value 2s., 2 shifts, value 1s. 6d.; 1 shawl, value 1s.; 1 table-cloth, value 6d.; 1 handkerchief, value 6d.; 1 pinafore, value 8d.; 2 aprons, value 1s. 6d.; and 1 curtain, value 6d.; the goods of 



John Harrold; and that she had been before convicted of felony.






SARAH TRIMBY
. I keep a mangle, and live in North-place, St. Luke's. On the 15th of February I had these articles stated to mangle—when they were done the prisoner came and said, "I have come for a dozen of clothes that my girl brought"—I said, "I have got no clothes of yours"—she said, "Yes, these are mine," pointing to my drawers, where these things laid—there had been a girl there with some things, and I said, "Did your girl tell you about a place of nursing?"—she said, "Yes, and I am much obliged to you for it"—she then paid me for these things, and, took them away—I am sure she is the person—I met her crossing the City-road about ten days afterwards, and watched her to where she lived—I had her secured.





SUSAN HARROLD
. I am the wife of John Harrold. I took these articles to Trimby to be mangled—the prisoner is a stranger to me—I did not authorise her to go for them—a part of the property is here—(looking at it)—the rest is lost.





JAMES SUMMERS
. My father is a pawnbroker, in Bath-street. I produce a quilt and a shift, pawned by the prisoner, in the name of Jones.





ANN COULTHORPE
. I lodge in the house where the prisoner does—she offered me two sheets and a curtain on the 15th of February—I bought the sheets of her for 3s.





JOHN KERSHAW
. I am an officer. I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got at Mr. Clark's office—(read)—she is the person who was tried in the name of 


Mary Adcock.




GUILTY.* Aged 28.—


Transported for Fourteen Years.
(There was another indictment against the prisoner.)

            . I am servant to David Farrell, who is a salesman
. I heard a scratch at the shop door, and missed a pelisse. I saw the prisoner running, and followed him - he turned up the next street, and was stopped without my losing sight of him. The pelisse was dropped - I did not see him drop it.

            . I was going down Store-street, and met the prisoner running. I attempted to stop him, he dropped something which appeared like a pelisse. I am sure he is the man.

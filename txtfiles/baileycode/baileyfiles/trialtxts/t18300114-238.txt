            . I am a labourer
. On the 26th of December I was at the Royal Hospital, near Chelsea College


, between nine and ten o'clock in the evening; I was sober; the four prisoners were all there in company, and the two girls sat one on each side of me; the men were in the box - I had a watch in my fob, which I missed while I was there; I got up and went to the bar to explain it to the publican, and one of my witnesses said they knew the party who had drawn it - I never got it again.
Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Were you quite sober? A. Yes; I went on Monday morning to the watch-house keeper.
THOMAS DAVIES. I was at the public-house, and saw Lee there, and the prisoners - I saw Collins hand a watch to Cornby, who walked off with it; I suppose he went out - I did not see the others go.
Cross-examined. Q.What are you? A. A shoemaker; this was up in a corner in the tap-room - I do not think it was the girl's own watch; I did not give an alarm that moment, but when I was asked, I did - I thought it looked rather suspicious, for the girl to give the man the watch, and he to go out with it: I did not know who it belonged to - Cornby came back to the place, but did not stop; he was not taken that night - he could not be found.

            . I just stepped into the house, being rather cold; I saw these two girls right and left of the prosecutor - they were trying his pockets; the young woman took the watch from his pocket and the signal was given to Cornby - I went to the bar and told a young woman; Cornby went out and returned to the tap-room in about ten minutes.
MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Did you ever say that John David Ousley went out with the watch? A. No; he crossed to the end of the table, but the others went out with the watch.
Cross-examined. Q.Then he had no part in stealing it? A. No - I saw it delivered from one to the other - Cornby was on the side of me with a basket, but had no fruit in it; he was not near, nor aiding, or assisting in stealing it.

            . I took the two female prisoners on the night of the robbery, and Ousley on the 7th of January, from information which I received; he said he knew who had the watch, but he would see us d-d before he would tell us.
John David Ousley. I did not say any thing of the kind.
Cornby's Defence. I had apples - I went in, and Collins sold them to the landlord's sister for 6d.
Collins' Defence. I went and sold the apples, and when I came back this young woman asked me to have a drop of something to drink; I took it, went to the fireplace, and was there when the man said he had lost his watch.
WILLIAM COLLINS. I am a constable of Chelsea. I have a certificate of the conviction of 
               
                  Mary 
                  Ouswell
               



            ; she had three months in the House of Correction - I was at the trial before your Lordship; the prisoner Ousley is the person.

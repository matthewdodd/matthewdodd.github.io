, in order to go to Snow-hill; and at the farther end of Cheapside where the conduit stood, I felt somebody draw my handkerchief out of my pocket; I saw it in the Prisoner's hand, and took it from her and put it into my pocket; she fled cross Cheapside and run down into Watling Street. I had got the gout and could not run very well, but I cried out stop thief, and some People stopped her: when I came up to her I took hold of her by the arm, she said, you will hurt me, take hold of my collar, said I, You have nothing to take hold of there, and I said, Child, I will not hurt you, but I am resolved to prosecute you, then she cried and begged for mercy.
Prisoner. The gentleman wanted to pick me up and would have given me a shilling and I refused it; but he still came after me, and because I would not do as he would have had me, he charged me with stealing his handkerchief.

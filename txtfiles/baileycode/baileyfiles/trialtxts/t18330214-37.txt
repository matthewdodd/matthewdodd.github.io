. I knew the prisoner for about two months, and in August last he met me - he represented himself in great distress; I said I would give him a night's lodging - he went home with me; I gave him three nights lodging - I went home in the middle of the day afterwards, and missed this property; he was then gone, and I did not see him again till he was taken, which was five weeks ago - I asked him what had become of my things; he said he had sold them to a Jew who travelled about the streets.

            . I was going home on Saturday night, the 3d of July, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, and observed a quantity of people followingthe Queen's carriage from Berkeley-square


 to South Audley-street


, I saw a man draw a watch from a gentleman's pocket, and pass it to the prisoner - I saw him receive it, and put it into his pocket. I took him aside, and asked him for the watch which he picked from the gentleman's pocket - he said he had none. I told the people I saw him take it, and offered to feel for it. He then put his hand into his pocket, pulled a watch out, and said he had none but his own. I knew it to be the same that I saw pass from one to the other. I did not know the gentleman.

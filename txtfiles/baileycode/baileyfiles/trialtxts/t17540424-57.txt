            . I live in Primrose-street


, and am a handkerchief printer
; the prisoner was my apprentice
; I went into the dressing-room where the men finish the handkerchiefs, a man said, here are two handkerchiefs cut off from a piece of work. I asked whose goods they were, because we print them for the weaver, and found they were Mr. Thompson's; I observed them to be cut off by a knife, the prisoner was at dinner. My sister told me there was a silver pepper-box missing, I took the prisoner up stairs, and examined him as to the things; he said, he had cut the handkerchiefs off and sold them in Rag-fair, but could not tell to who; and he had carried the pepper-box into Smock-Alley, and a gentleman had stopped it; I went to the silversmith's, and he gave me the pepper-box; I took him before my Lord-Mayor, and he owned the same there.
Peter Pollard. The prisoner brought this pepper-box to me, [produced in court and deposed to;] he said, it belonged to his mother, and she was sick, and had sent him to sell it, and that his name was Harrison, and lived in Hare-street, Spittlefields; I stopped it, and desired him to send his mother for it: the next day his mother came and owned it.
The prisoner had nothing to say in his defence.

                  Fuller 
               



            . On the 19th of October this Sutton came into my Yard, ours is a Car-Yard, in Moor-Lane


, and we found him in the Stable, and he run away, and kept out of Sight a Matter of a Fortnight; and I sat up later than ordinary, thinking of the Iron that I had lost.
Q. Did you find any of this 24 lb. of Iron upon him? How had he it?
Fuller. In his Hand. We had lost Streaks and Horseshoes, what we call Tire-Streaks for our Cart Wheels. He has own'd to me the selling of this Iron at London Wall, and at one Richardson's.


                  Q. 
               


            (to the Prisoner) What have you to say in your own Defence?
He said nothing to that Purpose, but asked a thousand Pardons. 

               Guilty

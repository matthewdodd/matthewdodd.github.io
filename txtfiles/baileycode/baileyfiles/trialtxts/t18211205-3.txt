            . I produce the office copy of the conviction of

                  Fletcher

            . On the 8th of December 1818, I was clerk to Mr. Wilson wharfinger
, at the bottom of Tooley-street, St. Olave's


. 
               
                  George 
                  Fletcher
               



             was occasionally in his employ - I went to the wharf at seven o'clock in the morning, rang the bell, and the watchman let me in; and on entering the wicket, I saw Fletcher with his truck, it had a candle box, a soap chest, and two or three empty casks in it - he was allowed to convey these things from the wharf. There was a great many tin blocks on the wharf, which weighed about 3 1/2 cwt. each, and were worth 15 l. or 16 l.
Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. You saw two other men with Fletcher - A. Yes, Griffiths and M'Cormack, they were taken up with him.

                  KEY
               



            . I am a bedstead-maker. On the 8th of December, 1818, I lived in Hollywell-lane, the prisoner lived next door to me - I had seen 
               
                  George 
                  Fletcher
               



             come there with his truck several times; I saw him on this morning with his truck at the door - Foy came out and seized the handle of the truck, and turned it round; there was a small cask, and as I thought empty boxes, but when it was lifted up, one of the boxes fell out with something very heavy, it was metal - Foy let go the handle, and came and covered it over with one of the empty boxes with the things that fell out; I took it to be lead, it was about two feet long and ten or twelve inches wide - Fletcher and Foy took the box together, they turned it over and over till they got it in doors, and I saw no more. About half an hour after, Garton the officer brought out the same thing as I saw go in - It was a block of tin, which I saw drop from the box; I did not see Foy for two years after, he absconded - I did not know he was going to leave.
Cross-examined by MR. CURWOOD. Q. You are a tenant of Foy's brother-in-law - A. Yes. There was a dispute about my paying an advanced rent, I have had no quarrel with Foy - I think he has been home twelve months, I have seen him pass my door every day, I did not give information of his being there, as I supposed he had made the matter up.
COURT. Q. Did you know any reason for his absconding but this business - A. No my Lord.

                  GARTON
               



            . I am an officer of Worship-street. On the 8th of December, about nine o'clock in the morning, I went to the prisoner's house in consequence of information, he stood at the door - I said, "Foy you have had some metal or lead in this morning;" he said, "No, I have not." All in a moment, I saw a man across the way looking at me, he made off directly, and ran down Shoreditch as hard as he could, and I pursued, I said "I want you my friend," and immediately took him back to Foy's shop. (It was 
               
                  George 
                  Fletcher
               



            ) I there saw Foy, and said "Foy I want you too" - he then went back, and went up a ladder, he had no sooner got up, than his wife came down the ladder to me; I saw Kean at the door, and sent him for Armstrong, Foy escaped - I never saw him again till last Friday; I had a candle and searched the house, and at the bottom of the ladder, I found a block of tin - the ladder led up to the room over the shop, Fletcher appeared a porter. I found the truck, with the empty boxes, against a pump in Shoreditch, about one hundred and fifty yards off.
Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. The prisoner and another man could not lift that tin - A. I can lift one end of it. I overtook Fletcher, about one hundred yards from the shop - I had left Foy at the door, and found him in the shop, he saw me pursue Fletcher.
COURT. Q. Was the tin concealed - A. It was in a dark place at the bottom of the ladder, which led from the shop into a chamber - we could not see it without a light, I did not see it till I brought Fletcher back.


                  JOHN 
                  ARMSTRONG
               



            . I was present when the tin was found. I never saw Foy.


                  JOHN 
                  BUNDOCK
               



            . The block of tin belongs to Mr. R. Wilson, I cannot say when I saw it safe - I am certain it was on the premises; I saw it most every day among the tin - I did not miss it, I know it by the quality, mark, and number, which is put on at the smelting-house, in the country, it is B. 65, each piece has a distinct mark, and all that manufacturer's tin comes to our wharf.


                  RICHARD 
                  WILSON
               



            . I am the proprietor of Smith's wharf. The tin was consigned to our house, from a smelting-house which has stopped seven or eight years before the robbery - I know it to be the block that was on our wharf. After the robbery, I compared the numbers with the blocks, and missed this and two others, it is worth 15 l. or 16 l.
Cross-examined. Q. Was any of it sold - A. Yes, seven or eight years before. The blocks are all marked different. I took stock two years and a half before the robbery, it was safe then - I cannot say when it was stolen; Fletcher had formerly been employed by me, but being weak, I allowed him to stand on the wharf with his truck, to convey empty boxes and light things for people. I was present when he was convicted of stealing the tin.


                  ROBERT 
                  KEY
               



            . I believe this to be the block, I saw carried in.
Prisoner's Defence. The man came to my shop about nine o'clock in the morning, and said, "Here are some goods for you Foy," I said "Very well" - I generally workedout, and left the shop to my wife's care; he asked me to give him a lift - I took hold of the truck, he told me to help him with it; I said my wife was not in the way, and she knew more of the business than I did. Garton came in, and said I had bought some stolen lead - I said to my knowledge, I had nothing of the kind; I never saw the man before, I did not leave the shop for some time - I had occasion to go out, and never heard that any charge was against me.


                  ROBERT 
                  KEY
               



             re-examined. I had seen Fletcher at Foy's many times before - they were together. I did not give the information to cause him to be apprehended.


                  THOMAS 
                  GARTON
               



             re-examined. I apprehended him by accident - I heard he had been at home some time, but could never meet with him; he lived a mile and a half from his former house. Kean gave me no information - I waited opposite his house on Friday morning, an hour and a half, but did not see him; in the afternoon I saw him at his door, and took him.

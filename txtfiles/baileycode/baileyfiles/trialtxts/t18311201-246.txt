            . I am a watchman on Westminster-bridge


. I met the prisoner on the Middlesex end of the bridge on the 20th of November, after nine o'clock at night; I saw him go and take this bundle out of a four-wheeled chaise, it was behind the driver - he had his right hand on the spring of the chaise as it passed me, and then I saw his left hand draw the bundle out; I took him - the chaise went on, but I advertized the property, and found the owner.

            . I am a widow
, and live in Alfredplace, Bedford-square; this cloak and handkerchief are mine - I was in the chaise, returning from Vauxhall, about nine o'clock in the evening; the parcel was in the back of the chaise - I did not miss it till I got home; I know no thing of the prisoner.
Prisoner's defence. I saw the bundle in the road, and the watchman came and took me; I never had it in my hand.

            . I am a candle-wick spinner
; I live at 63, Tower-street. I sent a truck containing about eight bags of cotton to the West end of the Town. The porter had not left the house ten minutes when he returned with a constable and the prisoner.

            . I am a porter to Mr. Plummer. I was going up Philpot-lane


, on Tuesday evening, with this bag of cotton among others on my truck; in going up Philpot-lane, I placed my hand on the particular bag in question to prevent its falling off; I then turned round for a moment, and when I looked again, the bag was gone; it was rather dark, but I turned back, and saw the prisoner with the bag under his arm; that was in Philpot-lane; I made towards where I saw him, and he ran across the street, and then he dropped it; I picked it up, and he ran away. I ran after him, and cried stop thief; then he was stopped in East Cheap. I am sure he is the man; I never lost sight of him. I got a constable, and took him to my master's.

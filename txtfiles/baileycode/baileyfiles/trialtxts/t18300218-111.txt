            . I am a constable, and live at Harley-bush cottage. On the 15th of February I was on duty, and saw the prisoner and some other boys between four and five o'clock, in the High street; the prisoner had a fowl rolled in this cloth, under his arm, and was running- I pursued and took him; he threw the fowl over a garden wall; I secured him, and gave him to another constable - I went and got the fowl from the place where I saw him throw it - he said a boy named Harding gave it him; I took Harding - he said a boy had stolen the fowl from Hampstead-heath; he was discharged by the Magistrate.

            . I keep fowls
. This was mine, and was the only one which happened to be out on that occasion; I keep them on the common.

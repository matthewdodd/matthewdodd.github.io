            , Esq; the prisoner married a fellow servant of mine; they were permitted to live in my master's house, while the family were in the country. They came to town on the 24th of October; then the goods mentioned in the indictment were missing.
Court. Name the things.
J. Baterson. There was a silver saucepan, 7 linen tablecloths, 2 shirts, 1 damask napkin, and a pair of black velvet breeches; these were the property of my master: one pair of black silk stockings, a crimson velvet shag waistcoat, and a black coat and waistcoat; these were my master's son's. We had a suspicion of the prisoner, because the young woman said nobody was in the house but him and her. We took him up, and he confessed he had taken the things, and where he had pawned them. I was at the finding them at the several pawnbrokers.

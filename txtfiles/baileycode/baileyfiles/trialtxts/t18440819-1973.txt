JOHN ROBERTSON
. I am in the employ of Charles Wilson, a linen and woollen-draper, in Ludgate-street. On the 3rd of July I saw the prisoner lurking about—she passed the door, and immediately a hand was passed round the door-way, and this piece of goods taken—I went out as far as St. Paul's Churchyard, and saw her on the other side—I went and lifted her cloak, and took this piece of woollen cloth from her—it is my master's.




GUILTY
.* Aged 36.—


Transported for Seven Years.

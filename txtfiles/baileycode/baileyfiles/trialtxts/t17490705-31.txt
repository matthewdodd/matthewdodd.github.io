The prisoner was a German, and could not speak English; he was tried by half the London-Jury, and half the Jury of Foreigners, and had an interpreter, to let him know what each witness deposed against him. The things being found in the prisoner's possession, and he gone off with them as far as Kingston from London, he was found 

               Guilty

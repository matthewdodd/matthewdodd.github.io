            . I am servant to Mr. Cricket, a proctor
 in Doctors-Commons. On the second of March about eight o'clock at night, I was walking along Fleet-street


 with a napkin of my master's in my pocket; the prisoner followed me; I saw him put his hand in my pocket; I seized him with the napkin in his hand; he threw it down immediately.
Two other witnesses deposed to his confessing the fact.
Prisoner's Defence.
It is my first fact.

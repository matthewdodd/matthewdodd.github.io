, on the 16th of April; I saw the prisoner near Mr. Cane's shop - he had two boys with him, and was there twenty minutes or more; I then saw the prisoner go towards the shop, put something into his apron, and run away - I followed, and took him into custody; I found this ham wrapped in his apron - he began to cry, and said he had picked it up in the street.

            . I am a single woman; I take in washing
. On the 17th of January, about five o'clock in the evening I heard myself called down by my opposite neighbour; I was up stairs hanging the clothes to the fire; I came down; my neighbour said there was a man gone out.
Q. From what place did you miss your sheets - A. From off the bed in the parlour; I had seen them there about twenty minutes before they were taken: I missed the sheets. I saw the prisoner walking along the street, I immediately called stop thief; he was stopped; he laid the sheets down; my neighbour took them up, and brought them to me. These are the sheets; they are mine, and the same that I lost. The prisoner was a stranger to me. I know the sheets are mine by my own work.
Prisoner's Defence. I never was even in the street; I came from the East India House at the time the alarm was.

MR. GRIFFITHS
conducted the Prosecution.






MART ANN FOXALL
. I keep the Sun and Punch Bowl, Holborn, next door to the baths; it is my dwelling-house, and in St. Giles's parish—at the back-part of the bar there are three doors on a line, adjoining each other; one goes to the staircase, one to the bar-parlour, and one to a passage which leads to the yard, which is very small—a portion of the back-parlour projects into the yard, and there is a skylight at the top—there is a cupboard in the yard where we keep a pair of steps—the firstfloor back-room window is close to the leads over the back-parlour—a person by getting on the leads could get in at that window—we keep the staircase-door locked—my bed-room is on the second-floor, and I have an alarm-bell fixed there, which rings a bell in the bar—the bell-wire is on the outside of the door, so that any one could cut it—on Thursday night, 9th Jan., I went to my bedroom, about half-past ten o'clock, to get some change, and then left 51l. in gold, and 9l. in silver, safe in my drawer—I did not lock the door, because my daughter was coming up, but I locked the staircase door by the bar—the bell-wire was then safe; the bell rang when I went into the room—I went up again with my daughter at twenty minutes to one, after an alarm had been given—the window on the first-floor, that comes on to the leads, was then partly open, and the room-door wide open; I went to my own bed-room, and found the drawers wide open; all turned out, and all the money gone—the bag in which the silver had been, was left behind—there was a peculiar coin among the money, which I had had eight or nine weeks—I found the bell-wire cut and hooked up, so that the bell should not drop—it would have rung if it had not been so prepared—Roberts has been my potboy two months—the lower bedroom bad been occupied by a person named Haskins, and he has also occupied the room adjoining mine, and the prisoner White used to call Haskins his brother, and come and inquire for him—I am a widow—the potman was the only man who slept in the house.

Cross-examined by
MR. PARRY. Q. Is your house next door to the Casino? A. Yes; it is not what is called a night-house for ladies and gentlemen—we generally keep open till one or two o'clock—persons who

have been to the Casino come in and take refreshment—we only keep open as late as three or four in the morning, on bal-masque nights—the ladies and gentlemen sometimes come in in character—the house is very much frequented by fancy ladies and gentlemen—our busiest time is between twelve and one—we were not very busy on this night—from nine till twelve or one, we had about sixty in and out—there is a water-closet in the yard—that bad been whitewashed, as well as the whole of the yard—if a gentleman had been there, he might have a little whitewash on his coat—the walls are whitewashed—there is a urinal there also, open to all the customers—I have got back 41l. 8s. of what I lost.





MART ANN SUSANNAH FOXALL
. I am the prosecutrix's daughter, and assist in the management of the business—Roberts was our potboy, and I know White. On 9th Jan. I came home about ten o'clock, and went up-stairs at about a quarter to eleven—the first-floor bed-room door was then shut—I went to my room which is the same as my mother's, and remained there a few minutes, putting away my bonnet and shawl—the drawers were all safe then, and the alarum also—it rang very loudly when I went into the room—when I left the room I shut the door, I did not lock it, sod came down to the bar—I locked the staircase door—from about twelve I assisted in the bar—the prisoner White was not then there—about twenty-five minutes to one, the barmaid left the bar, and went down the passage to the yard to the kitchen to get her candle to go to bed—I saw her come back again—she unlocked the staircase door and went up—immediately after, she came running down again, opened the staircase door, stood there, and beckoned me across the bar, and while I was talking to her, White passed me, coming from the passage door leading to the yard—he shook his head in my face, and said, "Oh! Miss Foxall what is the matter?"—I said, "Mind your own business, do not bother me"—he had a dark coat on which came up to his face, and his arm and side were white—he went out immediately—there were several persons in the bar—I went up-stairs, found the first-floor room door and window open, my mother's room open, and) the drawers lying about the floor in confusion, and the alarum bell-wire put—when I went up, and came down before, the lower-room door was shut—from the time I came down till the barmaid went up, no one had the key of the staircase—on the following Saturday, in consequence of what the barmaid told roe, I went into the bar—I did not then see White there, but I ran out and saw him, and took him by the arm at the corner of Little Queen-street, and said to a policeman, "Policeman, take this man into custody"—the prisoner said, "What for?"—I said, "For robbing our house of 60l. on Thursday night"—he said, "Miss Foxall, I have not been into your house these three days"—I said, "Not been into our house these three days; did you not ask me what was the matter? and did not you leave a letter at our a house?"—he then came. back to the house, and then said, "Miss Foxall you must be mistaken"—I said, "Policeman, I am quite sure as to his being the person; take him into custody"—a man named Haskins has lodged in our house, sometimes in the lower room, and sometimes in the upper, and White has very often come after his brother, and when we asked him who was his brother, he said, "I mean Haskins."

Cross-examined. Q. Did his coat collar stand up so as to conceal the sides, of his face? A. Partly—it came just under the ears—all the people

who frequent the house know me as the landlady's daughter—I do not go by any other name—we have had both Mr. Haskins and his brother lodging at our house—those are the only two we have had for three weeks before the robbery, with the exception of one person we know very well, a gentleman, a respectable man, who is in the habit of sleeping at our house occasionally—his name is Davis, but I do not know him beyond that—he is not a particular friend of mine—I am not in the habit of going out with him—during those three weeks the only gentleman we had visiting us who had occasion to go up-stairs, was Mr. Harker, my brother-in-law—we have a sitting-room up-stairs, but only our private friends use it, not the common customers—our family only consists of my sister and brother—I am not married—I have no children—on my oath I am not married, and have not three children, my sister, Mrs. Charles Harker, has three children—I have never had any children—I never was married—if any one has said so it is thoroughly untrue—I had been alone that evening to Mr. Harker's, 14, Argyle-street—I never went to the Casino but once, and that was four years ago, to see the Bedouin Arabs—there are no children at our house—what you have put to me is a downright falsehood.

MR. GRIFFITH. Q. The collar of his coat did not conceal his whole face? A. I had seen him two or three times before—I know his voice—I undertake to swear, from his person and voice, that it was White.





EMMA HOLDEN
. I have been barmaid to the prosecutrix two years. On this night I left the bar to go to bed at twenty-five minutes to one o'clock—I went down the passage into the yard to the kitchen to get a candle—I lighted it in the kitchen, and looked round to see if any one was there, as is my usual custom, and also into the water-closet, and duitbin, and in the yard, and there was no one there but Roberts, who was moving a ladder or steps close to the cupboard in the wall—I said to him, "What are you doing there? why don't you do what you are told?"—he said he was only getting a duster—there was then no one but him in the yard—I came back to the bar, got the key, unlocked the staircase door, went up and found the first-floor bedroom door and window open—I went up further, and found my mistress's room door open, and I heard a noise above on the third-floor like footsteps on the stairs—I came down again—Miss Foxall came to me at the bottom of the stairs, and I told her what I had seen, and while doing so White came from the yard door—he had a coat fastened up to his chin, and went out—I stayed in the bar while Miss Foxall went up-stairs—White had been in the habit of coming for three weeks to see Mr. Haskins, who he called his brother, and who had been lodging up-stairs in both the back rooms—on the Tuesday before the robbery White called with this letter (produced)—I know his voice, and speak to him from his face, and figure—I saw no one come out of the yard except Roberts, who came almost immediately after him, and went out.

Cross-examined by
MR. PARRY. Q. Have you ever before to-day said that White was the man? A. Yes, at Bow-street police-court—I signed my deposition, and the clerk asked me whether it. was the truth—he did not ask me whether I had anything to add or take away—White called several witnesses there to prove that he could not have been the man—that was the whole question before the Magistrate (the witness's deposition being



read, did not contain anything about White being there)—when it was read over to me, I told Miss Foxall they had Dot got down all I said, and she said, "Perhaps they have written down only a few of the particulars"—I did not say anything about the omission—there has been a little conversation about the case, but no discussion—I saw Roberts and the waterman speaking together that night—the waterman was in the house when we found out the robbery—an attorney appeared for us on the last examination, but no evidence was read over.

MR. GRIFFITHS. Q. Was it because Miss Foxall told you that, that you did not tell the clerk? A. Yes; it is a true statement—I swear White in the man who passed—I saw him come in the same evening, at half-past ten o'clock.





WILLIAM ANDERSON
. I am a waterman, and act as a constable. On this night I was at the prosecutrix's house, and about twenty minutes to one o'clock I saw Miss Foxall and Holden at the bottom of the stain; and while they were there, I saw White come out of the yard and speak to Miss Foxall; he had on a dark coat, buttoned up, and had white on his left sleeve and hip—I had not seen him before on that evening—I have no doubt he is the person—after Miss Foxall pushed him on one side, he went out into the street.

Cross-examined. Q. What do you mean by calling yourself a constable? A. I am told by the proprietor of the Casino to keep the gangway clear—I have not been sworn in—I have a waterman's badge—I bad not been talking to Roberts on this evening, he stood by my side—I have never been in any trouble or before a Magistrate—I was not sent for at the police-court by Roberts—as he was going across to the cells he beckoned to me, bat I did not go.





JOSEPH THOMPSON
 (police-sergeant, F 11). From information on 15th Jan. I traced Roberts to Gravesend, Chatham, Faversham, and Canterbury, where he was apprehended by a Canterbury policeman at the entrance of the theatre, and I asked him if he knew me, he said, "Yes, your name is Thompson"—I said, "You must consider yourself in my custody for—" he there interupted me, and said, "It is all right, I have got missus's money; I did not steal the money; I found the money, you know; I shall tell all about it at another place: have you got that man in prison yet?"—I said, "There is a man remanded for Mrs. Foxall's robbery"—be said, "That is all right, he is in it"—after that, the constable who had apprehended him produced two bags (produced), and said, in his bearing, that he had found them on him, and 40l. odd—I said to Roberts, "You hear what he said, he says be found these bags on you"—he said, "Yes, that is all right, that is my bag," pointing to one, "and that bag," pointing to this one, "is mistress's bag, that the silver was in; I had the money given me; you must have another one," describing a man who perhaps will be a witness to-day—the Magistrate said it was not necessary for me to describe him, and it is not in the deposition—he said that a stout old man that was with White gave him the money down Holborn, and told him to run away, he gave him all the gold, he had no silver—in hit pocket I found this silver Spanish coin, with a hole in it (produced), which Mrs. Foxall identifies—he said he had spent 7s.

Cross-examined. Q. Did you find Roberts had been spending money on the way? A. Yes. I found 41l. 10s. in gold, and 8s. 6d. in silver on

him—after White was in custody, he made a statement to me—I made inquiries, and found it correct to the greatest extent—a duplicate was found on White for a coat, pledged for 1s. 6d., on the morning after the robbery—I have made inquiry, and heard nothing against White's character.





MART ANN FOXALL

re-examined. This is the bag in which the gold was—the silver-bag has not been found—this is the coin I spoke of—it was safe when I left the drawer.

Roberts's Defence. The money was given me by an old man, who told me to go away for a few days, and he would let me know all about it.

MR. PARRY
called






MATTHEW TRUMBELL
. I live at the Model Lodging-house, 27, King-street, St. Giles's—I am a school-assistant, out of employ—White lived there also, and occupied the next bed to me. I remember the Thursday evening previous to his being taken on the Saturday—I was in the kitchen; and about ten o'clock White complained of the closeness of the place, and I walked down Holborn with him—on the way, he met a gentleman; stopped and spoke to him a few minutes, and we returned to the lodging-house about half-past ten—about eleven, he borrowed 6d. of a man named Bumbury, clerk to a barrister in the Temple, and went out to get something for supper, he returned in about ten minutes with some bacon and potatoes, and we had supper together, and I went to bed about a quarter to twelve—the prisoner came a few minutes after—I am able to say that from the time of his bringing in the supper and going to bed he did not go out—I saw him go to bed—three others slept in the same room, in separate beds—White laid awake talking to me and Hall till nearly two, when I went to sleep, and I believe the prisoner also—I awoke about nine or ten next morning, and found him in bed—he and I were in very distressed circumstances—I know Haskins, he is an organist—he has a brother—I have seen Roberts at the Sun and Punch Bowl, but do not know him in any other way—in the morning, a fellow-lodger came to White and took his coat away to pawn it—the person who pawned it brought back something to eat, of which I partook—I did not have any of the money.

Cross-examined by
MR. GRIFFITHS. Q. Do you still live at this place? A. Yes; I have been there since 1st or 2nd Dec, and I was there at the conclusion of last Midsummer vacation—I held a situation up to the end of Nov. at Mr. Dynes.' Bolton-house, Turnham-green—I have not been in regular employment since—I have been employed by Mr. Haskins—I do not know that he lived at the prosecutrix's—I have heard that he slept there occasionally—he lives at Mr. Green's, 89, Leather-lane, tallow-chandler, who is also an auctioneer, and has an office opposite the Mansion-house—Haskins is organist at a chapel in the Hackney-road, of which I do not know the name; he is also a teacher of music—I have written notices of a musical book for him, which were stitched as advertisements in the reviews and country newspapers—to the best of my knowledge Haskins still lives at Green's—I received 1l. 1s. for writing the notices, which I was paid at Mr. Green's office—I had received sundry small sums from him in the last two months—I have not received all he owes me yet—he is to give me 5l.—that is all I have earned in the last two months—I may have received about 2l. 1s. of it before the robbery, and sundry small sums—I have always said that 5l. was what he was to give me—I will not swear

I have not said five guineas—I may have said that at the time of the robbery he owed me five guineas—T had done work for him for which be owed me 5l. or guineas, and I had received at sundry times sums on account; and I may have stated that he owed it me, not deducting those amounts—upon my oath I did not say at the time of the robbery, that Haskins owed me 5l. 5s., and that I had applied a great many times to him for it, and could not get any portion—I have applied a great many times for it—this letter (the one produced by Holden) is my writing—I gave it to White to give it to Haskins—White saw me write it, and read it afterwards—the address on the envelope is my writing—I wrote this last paragraph in the letter, "This at Foxall's, to secure its falling into your hands," because I knew he was in the habit of going there of an evening—I knew he lived at Green's then—I have stated that my reason for writing that letter was because I had asked Haskins several times for the five guineas, and could not get it—(the witness was here allowed to refresh his memory by reading over the letter)—I do not believe I have stated that I could not get any portion of it—this is my signature—(looking at his deposition, part of which was read: "I considered Haskins owed me 5l. 5s. for the work I had done for him—I had asked him several times for a portion of it")—I do not know Roberts, except by seeing him at the public-house six or eight times, when I had been there—I never saw him at the lodging-house—I know White intimately, and am in the habit of going out with him—the rules of the lodging-house are, to be in by half-past twelve, unless you get permission from Mrs. Davis the superintendent, to be out later, and she then gives permission to a person who has lodged there some years to let you in—when White got the supper this night, there was a man named Kemp, and Courtney, Green, Brown, and Harley, I believe in the kitchen; and I think some others who I cannot name—I think almost all the twenty-seven who lodge in the house were present—Curling and Barclay I believe were there—Courtney, White, and I, had bacon and potatoes for supper, and Brown, and Green also, had bacon at the same time; that was a few minutes after eleven o'clock—Curling fried the bacon—I left White in the kitchen when I went to bed—I do not remember who else I left there—there is no partition between my bed and others—there is a door to the room—Hall's bed is next the door, White's next, and mine next—there is gas in the room.

MR. PARRY. Q. What did the small sums you received consist of? A. About 2s. at a time—this is one of Lord Ashley's model lodging-houses.





GEORGE BROWN
. I am a draper, out of employ, and live at this lodging-house. I let those in who are late—they must have permission to come in late—I recollect on 9th Jan., when it is alleged White was at Foxall's, my attention was called to it at once, and I went to the police-court to give evidence—that evening White was at the lodging-house from half-past ten till half-past eleven o'clock—I remember his borrowing 6d. of Bumbury, going out and bringing in some bacon and potatoes—he ate his supper with Trumbell; I went to bed at half-past eleven, and left them at supper—I did not let White in after that; if he had gone out and, come in after half-past twelve, I should have had to have done so—I sleep on the ground-floor, and when a person comes, he has to knock at my window which abuts on the street—the door jars against the partition of my room, and I should hear if any one came in—I saw him in bed next

morning—about two next day I pledged his coat for 2s. a portion of which I laid out for him for a meal—Trumbell partook of it, and I had some for going the errand—I gave White the ticket.

Cross-examined. Q. How long has this place been a model lodging. house? A. I cannot tell, I have known it three years—Trumbell has lived there six weeks or two months this last time, and he has been there casually when he has been in London; he has not been there constantly for the last twelve months—some of the men go out in the morning at five—they let themselves out—the house opens for the day at half-past six; I do not know who comes in then—this supper was bought about ten, or half-past—I believe White boiled the potatoes, I cannot say who did the bacon—there are two tables in the kitchen—I believe Kempster and George Barclay were at supper on herrings and potatoes at another table—I had some supper with White, and Trumbell, and Green also; and when I went to bed Courtenay was going to have some also—I have been employed fourteen months in letting people in—I get 2d. each time from the men I let in—I do nothing but that, and call them in the morning—for the last few weeks I have been delivering circulars—there is only one door to the house.





JOB FARLEY
. I am a hosier, out of employ, and sleep in the room adjoining White's at this lodging-house. On 9th Jan. I went to bed about a quarter-past twelve o'clock—White was then in his bedroom—from my room I can hear people there—it was just gone one when I went to sleep, and up to that time I had heard White and the others talking—I had supped that night with Kempster on herrings and potatoes—White and Trumbell had bacon and potatoes—I recollect the bacon being fetched—I saw White in the room about seven next morning.

Cross-examined. Q. How long have you lodged at this house? A. About two years—I was employed last, about three months ago, at Chad-wick's hosiery-warehouse, Gresham-street—White had supper about half-past eleven o'clock—Brown and Green were there—I was not at the same table—Bartlett and Kempster had supper with me—we had finished before White had supper—I do not know who cooked their supper—Courtenay, Green, and Leicester were with him—I do not know whether Brown was—I saw White go up-stairs—it was then gone twelve—two or three others had gone to bed also—there is no clock, but we bear one strike outside—Leicester is the first witness who was called.





MATTHEW TRUMBELL

re-examined. My name is Matthew Leicester Trumbell—I am sometimes called Leicester, particularly by Farley.





WILLIAM HALL
. I am a painter, and live at the Model Lodging-house. I remember the night of this robbery, but am not positive about the date—I sleep in the bed adjoining White, and Trumbell sleeps on the other side of him—I came home on this night between ten and eleven o'clock, and saw White and Trumbell getting supper ready—I went to bed between eleven and twelve—I had heard that Curling intended to play a joke upon White by making what is called an apple-pie bed, and in consequence of that I was awake—Trumbell came up first, and White came after, not long after, because the light was not out—when White got into bed he found this trick had been played upon him—he had a difficulty in getting down, and had to get out of bed again and remake it—Curling came in and laughed at it, and White began to pummell him with the pillow, and

by that time it was nearly one o'clock—White then got into bed—there was some talking after that, and it was between one and two, or nearly one, before we got to sleep—I got op about seven, and White was there then—I do not think he could have gone out after he went to bed.

Cross-examined. Q. Are you in employ? A. Yes; I was at that time—I was not examined before the Magistrate—I was subpoenaed to attend here—I was asked to go to the police-court, but I considered his innocency was so clear that my testimony was not necessary—I think Green bad gone to bed before me—Trumbell must have heard what was going on about the apple-pie bed.






JAMES CURLING
. I live at the Model Lodging-house, and am a painter out of employ. I was examined before the Magistrate. On 9th Jan. White, Brown, Green, Courtenay, and Trumbell supped on bacon and potatoes—White went to bed about half-past twelve o'clock, and I had made him an apple-pie bed, which is the sheets turned up so as to prevent any one getting in—after that we had a bolster-match, and I was in my own room and a bed by a quarter to one—I remember hearing White, Trumbell, and Hall talking after that—I cannot say what time it ceased as I went to sleep—I saw White next morning—he did not leave the house in the night that I am aware of.

Cross-examined. Q. You cannot say he did not? A. No; I have a small connexion I work for on my own account—about five years ago I kept bad company, and was induced to rob my employer—I was convicted, and since that I have been generally out of employment—I have lived at this house three years and a half—White has lived there twelve months—he is not a friend of mine—I have not walked about with him—I heard one o'clock strike after I was in bed—I sleep on the second-floor—Trumbell went to bed about half-past twelve, and White about the same time—I believe White went up first, I should think five or ten minutes before Trumbell, and I went up ten minutes or a quarter of an hour after—I believe Brown went first—I think Hall went about eleven—Trumbell or Hall did not join in the bolster-match—the gas was alight all the time.





JOHN KEMPSTER

I came home about ten o'clock—I supped with Farley and Bartlett, on fresh herrings—White was at an adjoining table—I did not notice what he had—I went to bed before be did—I sleep on the same floor as him, in an adjoining room—that night I heard Trumbell, White, and Hall talking till between one and two, going on for two, and I spoke to White and told him to make less noise—I went to work next morning about half-past nine, leaving White in his room.

. I am a teacher of languages, and live at the Model Lodging-house—I have known White four months—he sleeps in the room directly over me. On 9th Jan. I came home about half-past ten o'clock—shorty after that I saw White come in with some

potatoes and bacon—I afterwards had tome with him at the same table, and Trumbell, Brown and Green, but not of the same food—Trumbell, or the other, gave them some potatoes—I went to bed about twelve—White and I went up together, and parted at my door, as he went higher—I heard talking till after two over head, and remember calling out, "It has gone two, pray have mercy"—I was suffering from gout and in great pain—I did not go to sleep till after Brown came up, between four and five, to call some one.

Cross-examined. Q. How long have you been a teacher of languages? A. Since my childhood—I have only one pupil now—I have done some writing, and am engaged for another work connected with a musical work, of which I have written a pamphlet, but I am doing nothing at present—I have lodged there four months—during part of that time I have attended at Bow-street as a reporter for "The Sun," upon which I was previously engaged for twelve years—the potatoes and bacon belonged to one as much as the other—we generally took our meals together—I had not paid for any of them—I do not know who cooked the potatoes—I went to bed just upon twelve—the gas is put out at twelve, and we have notice before that—it sometimes then remains a light ten minutes, and sometimes five; I think it is all put out at once—the prisoner Roberts has accused me of being the person who gave him the bag of money; I deny it—I am fortynine years old.

On this night I had bacon and potatoes with White and Trumbell—I do not recollect Courtenay—Brown was at the table—I went to bed at a few minutes to twelve o'clock, before White or Trumbell—I sleep in the same room as them—I was kept awake till after the gas was out by talking-White was then in bed, and I saw him there when I went out between seven and eight in the morning.

HENRY JOHN CRAWFORD
. I am managing clerk to Mr. Wontner. White was in his office two years; during that time he bore a respectable and honest character—Mr. Wontner has been here nearly the whole day to give him a character—you (Mr. Parry) were instructed to ask the questions you have done.

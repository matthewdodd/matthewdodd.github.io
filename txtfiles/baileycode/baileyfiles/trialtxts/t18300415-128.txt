. On the 1st of April I missed this carpet from the warehouse; I went out, and saw the prisoner with it on his shoulder, in Bucklersbury - I collared him, and charged him with the robbery; he said some person had given him a job, and he did not refuseit - he did not describe the person; I placed the carpet in a warehouse, and told him he must go to the Mansion-house; he said if I would let him go he would go quietly, and as I crossed towards the Mansion-house he closed in with me, and broke my umbrella in two - I would not let him go; he bit my fingers, and gave my arm a twist - I was obliged to let go, and he ran off; I kept within a yard of him, and gave him a blow on the head, which rather stunned him - a person came before him, stopped him, and lodged him in the watch-house.(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I was standing at the corner of White Lion-street, Whitechapel - a man came up, and asked if I wanted a job, and said he had a large parcel to carry out of the City; I went with him to near the church - he told me to stop while he went and brought this carpet; he gave it to me, and took my hat in his hand - he gave me the bat again immediately, before this gentleman came up.

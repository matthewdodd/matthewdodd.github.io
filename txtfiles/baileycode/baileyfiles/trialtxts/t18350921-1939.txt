WILLIAM HARDWICK BROWNING
. I was walking through Smithfield-bars on Tuesday, the 1st of September, about four o'clock in the afternoon—I felt my pocket touched—I put my hand to it, and my handkerchief was gone—I returned, and saw the prisoner move his person in a way which convinced me he had taken it—I laid hold of him—he twisted from me, and ran away—I followed, and he fell down—I secured him, and took him into a house—I did not find my handkerchief on him—the officer has it.





CHARLES HENRY BAGNELL
. I am a policeman. I produce the handkerchief which I got from Mr. Grace.





HENRY GRACE
. I was with the prosecutor, and saw the prisoner run away, and throw the handkerchief into a waggon—I got it and took it to the prosecutor.




GUILTY

                   WARD
               



             sworn.
I am a watchman
 belonging to St. Sepulchre's: I lost the things in the indictment; the prisoner was caught with the property upon him.

Court. What will become of you, if youtell an untruth? - Go into everlasting punishment.


                  PETER
                   WARD
               



             sworn.
Did you ever see the prisoner? - Yes, in my father's room, in Cow-lane. My mother was bad abed in an inner room; I was going down to the privy; I put a hasp on the door; I came out of the room, to come down stairs; I came back, and the hasp was gone; and I knocked at the door, and called mother; and then the prisoner came out, and asked for Mrs. Davis? and I told him there was no such person; then he said I was a very wicked boy for leaving my mother; and I pushed him in, and kept him in, and called my mother; he had the things under his arm when I stopped him.
When had you last seen these things? - The Sunday before; this was on a Friday; they were in the lower drawer.
Was the drawer locked? - No.
What was done with the things? - The constable had them.

                   WARD
               



             sworn.
I am wife to the prosecutor; I was ill: the boy called me, and I got up: the prisoner was putting the things on a chair; all the things in the indictment were there; the drawer was unlocked the last time I saw them there; I never lock the drawer: the things were put into a constable's possession.

             sworn.
Mrs. Ward called me to assist her: the prisoner said a man came and took them away, and gave them to him; the things were on a chair; he was committed.

                   WILLEY
               



             sworn.
I am a constable; I have got the things I have had them ever since.

             sworn.
I saw the boy in the room, and the clothes in a chair by him.
(Mrs. Ward deposes to the things.)
PRISONER's DEFENCE.
I was going after a place, and a man met me, and asked me to carry some things for him; and I went to the door, and took the things, as he told me; and the little boy came up and took me.

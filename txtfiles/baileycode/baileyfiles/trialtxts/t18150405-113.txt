            . On the 20th of March, I was coming along Chiswell street


; there was a crowd at the picture shop, and before I came to the crowd, I was going out into the highway, to get clear of the crowd, the two prisoners joined their hands, and come before me and would not let me pass; they each of them put their hands to my shoulder gave me a push and took my watch from me, it is a silver watch, gold chain, and gold seal, I did not perceive my watch go by reason of this pushing me. I clapped my hand down and missed it instantly; they both run away, the cry of stop thief proceeded, both the prisoners were taken by the crowd, and brought back, I saw my watch again, this is the watch, I am sure it is mine; I am quite certain the two prisoners are the men that would not let me pass, they gave me a thrust and took my watch from me; I am certain I had my watch about me, when they gave me a push, and a thrust that took my attention.

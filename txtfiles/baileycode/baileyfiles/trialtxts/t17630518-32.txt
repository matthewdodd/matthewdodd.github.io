                  Wooley 
               



            . I met with 
               
                  Mary 
                  Williams 
               



             at the Black Horse in Well-street, she carried me to a wake at Saltpeter-bank (that was there was a man lay dead, and they sat up all night) I being very sleepy, prevailed with her to let me go to her lodgings to bed; I went to bed with another young man; when I awaked, I missed my two coats; I found Smith with one of my coats on his back, and before the Magistrate I heard him confess he sold the other at Rag-fair, and had parted the money betwixt Williams and himself. Williams, when before the Justice, denied knowing of the cloaths being taken, she not being there at the time. (The coat produced and deposed to.)

            . I am the officer. Smith had this coat on in the watch-house.
Smith in his defence said, he bought the coat in Rag-fair for 8 s. 6 d. on the 5th of May.
Williams's Defence.
We were sitting up at a wake; the young man said, he would be obliged to me if I would let him lie down to refresh himself; I did; I went for some tea and sugar; Smith knocked me down, and took the key from me, and 
               
                  drew
               


             a knife and said, he would have my life if I said a word; then he went and robbed the young man of his two coats, and sold one in Rosemary-lane.

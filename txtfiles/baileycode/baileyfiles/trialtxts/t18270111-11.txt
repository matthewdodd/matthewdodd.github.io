GEORGE MARTIN BROWN. I live in Bell Square, Broker Row, Moorfields


, and am a whalebone manufacturer
. The prisoner was nine months in my service. The workshop behind my house was broken open about four months ago - I suspected him, and brought him to the Mansion-house; he was dismissed, and I discharged him; I have since taken him again - I told Smith, my other boy, to watch him; he gave me information, and I sent for an officer, who found this whalebone in his trousers and inside his stockings - there was 1 lb. of it; he said nothing; it is part of my stock; I never sold him any.

            . I am fifteen years old. My master told me to watch - the prisoner told me, if I could get any thing, to take it to his mother, as she would receive it - he wanted me to thieve as well as himself; this was on the evening he was taken; I told my master, and was present when the officer took the bone out of his stockings.
Prisoner. He had some about him, but his master told him to take it away. Witness. That is not true.

            . I was sent for on the 15th of December - I found this bone on the prisoner, four pieces in one stocking, and three in the other; I searched Smith, by the prisoner's request, but found none on him.

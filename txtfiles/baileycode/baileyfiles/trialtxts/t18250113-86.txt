            . This gown was pawned at my master's shop, for 1 s. 6 d., in the name of Ann Williams. I do not know who brought it.

            . I received charge of the prisoner on the 21st of December. I told her she must go with me to the watch-house, and by the description of the person who pawned it, she must be the person. She then began crying, and admitted that it was her.
Prisoner's Defence. I have been in very great distress. I have been out of a situation nearly five months, and have two children. The woman said, in the morning,
"Walker, don't come here to sleep to-night if you don't bring something to pay for your lodging." I returned home very much distressed - I took the gown and thought I should be able to return it in the morning.

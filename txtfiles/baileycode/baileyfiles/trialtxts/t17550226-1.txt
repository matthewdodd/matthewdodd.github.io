            . I live in Long-acre


, I am a wine-merchant
. On the 18th of last month my door happened to be open, the prisoner came up stairs, and there being a hair-cloth on the stairs, we did not hear her. She went through a little parlour into the dining-room; I saw her there, and as she was going down stairs I stopt her. She had seven cups, and seven saucers, a tea-pot, a bason, and sugar-dish, all china, in her apron. I sent for a constable; she was taken before a justice, and committed; I have brought a cup and saucer of them.
Q. Was all the china you found in her lap your china?
Filks. It was; my wife was by, and saw it.
Mrs. Filks. I and Mr. Filks were sitting in a room beyond the dining-room; we heard some china rattle; my husband and I went, and my husband took hold of the prisoner as she was going down stairs, and saw my china taken out of her lap; there was a cup and saucer broke in taking it out
Prisoner's defence.
I leave it to the mercy of the court.

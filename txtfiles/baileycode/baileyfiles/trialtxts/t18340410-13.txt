                  , from his person
            .
THOMAS KEELING. I was on Ludgate-hill


 on the 5th of March, about eight o'clock in the evening - I felt somebody at my coat pocket - I turned instantly and saw my handkerchief in the hands of the prisoner - he ran away instantly across Ludgate-hill, St. Paul's churchyard, and under the archway at Doctors' Commons - I lost sight of him for an instant, and when I caught sight of him again I could not see the handkerchief - it was picked up by a person - I have not a doubt he is the boy in whose hands I saw it.

            . I am a printer, and live in Webb-street, Southwark. On the night of the 5th of March I was passing through St. Paul's Church-yard, and saw the prosecutor stop the prisoner - he told him he had picked his pocket of his handkerchief - the prisoner said he had not, and attempted to run away - I saw the handkerchief drop close at the prisoner at his feet - I took it up.

            . I am an officer of Castle Baynard ward - the prisoner was given into my custody.(Property produced and sworn to.)(The prisoner put in a written defence, stating that he was resting on the step of a door when he was charged with the offence, of which he was innocent.)




               GUILTY
            .* Aged 17.
Recommended to mercy by the prosecutor, believing his parents had set him a bad example. -

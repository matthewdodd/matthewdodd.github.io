WILLIAM LITTLE
. I am a greengrocer, and Jive in Adam-street Rotherhithe. On the 24th of September, at a quarter past seven o'clock in the evening, I had a horse and cart, with two boxes, a large hamper, bed and bedding, in it, at the door of the White Horse, Cripplegate—I went in leaving nobody in charge of it—I came out in about two minutes, and it was gone—I ran towards London-wall, and there found the prisoner in the cart driving it away—I called out, and he jumped out of the cart and ran away—I followed him—he was secured—I got the property back.

Cross-examined by
MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. Did you see him jump out of the cart? A. Yes—the mare stopped directly it heard my voice, and I saw him jump out in London-wall, about two stones' throw from Cripplegate-buildings—I saw him secured.





FRANCIS LEWIN
. I live at Rotherhithe. I had hired this cart to fetch my goods from the White Horse.





JOHN MYERS
. I am a policeman. I took the prisoner into custody in Moor-lane, as he was running away.




GUILTY
.* Aged 28.—


Transported for Ten Years.

Before Mr. Justice Maule.

             sworn.
I keep a linen-draper's shop
 in Coventry-street, St. James's


; on the 26th of March I lost four yards and three quarters of printed callico; at twelve o'clock at noon the prisoner came into the shop, and desired to look at some remnants of callicoes; after looking some time, she bought a small quantity, a yard and three quarters, or two yards, and this she took; I had a suspicion of her myself, as I had twice had her at the publick office in Bow-street; I concealed myself in a part of the shop, and saw her take it off the counter; she bought some others, and gave a false address where they were to go to; she went out of the shop; I immediately followed her, and brought her in again, and took it from her.
PRISONER's DEFENCE.
This gentleman called me back again, and he said he owed me spite; the bit of cotton was sent to my brother; the gentleman said if I can hang you I will; I never was in the gentleman's shop in my life.

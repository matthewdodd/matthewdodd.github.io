GEORGE WITHERS



, stealing 1 handkerchief, value 2s. 6d.; the goods of 



Johan Gutte, from his person; having been before convicted.






WILLIAM GIFFORD
 (policeman, H 153). On 9th June I saw the prisoner and another in Mulberry-street, Commercial-road—the prisoner had hold of the skirt of the prosecutor's coat, and the other who was with the prisoner had his hands in the skirt pockets of his own coat, and was spreading them out to screen the prisoner—they saw me, and the prisoner drew his hands from the prosecutor and stood still—I went and stopped the prosecutor—I asked him if he had lost anything—I spoke English, but there was a gentleman with the prosecutor who told him what 1 said—he felt his pocket, and said he had lost his handkerchief—I then ran after the prisoner, and asked him what he had about him—he said, "Nothing"—I said I should search him, and he drew this handkerchief from his breast, and said, "This is my own property, so help me God! I bought it, and gave 1s. 3d. for it in Petticoat-lane"—I took it back to the prosecutor, and he identified it.





JOHAN GUTTE
 (through an interpreter). This handkerchief is mine—I missed it when the policeman spoke to me—I had had it five minutes before.

Prisoner's Defence. I bought it in Petticoat-lane; this man never saw the handkerchief in his life before.





EDWARD WIGLEY
 (policeman, H 142). I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction at this Court—(read—Convicted, May, 1848, and confined one year)—the prisoner is the person.

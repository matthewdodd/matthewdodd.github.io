WILLIAM WOOD
. I am in the employ of Edward Gaubert, a book and shoe maker, who lives in Lawrence-lane. On the morning of the 30th of September I was at the back part of the shop, and saw the prisoner run rat of the shop—I ran, and caught his coat—he dropped 2 pairs of boots about half-a-minutes walk from the shop—I took them up, and taw the officer with the prisoner—I am sure he is the man.

Prisoner. I was walking along when the officer took me—I never saw the boots nor yet him till the officer took Mr. Witness. Yes, you did—you said, There are the boots."





CHARLES INMAN

Prisoner. I never offered to run.

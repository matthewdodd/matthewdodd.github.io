. On the 26th of September I was standing in the shop, about half-past twelve o'clock in the morning; I saw the two prisoners, who I suspected - I watched them some time, and then went into the parlour; I looked through the blind - one of them came to the sill of the door, lifted up a pair of boots, and then let them down again; I then saw Simmons come and take them -Oliver was close to him, and another person was with them- they walked away: I pursued, and took them next door - Oliver then had the boots in his apron; these are them.
Oliver's Defence. Another boy took them, and ran away.
Simmons' Defence. Another boy took them, who had no shoes on - he threw them to Oliver's feet, and he took them up.
OLIVER - 

               GUILTY
            *. Aged 13.
SIMMONS - 

               GUILTY
            *. Aged 13.
NOTE. - Those prisoners who are marked with a star, have been in custody at a former period.

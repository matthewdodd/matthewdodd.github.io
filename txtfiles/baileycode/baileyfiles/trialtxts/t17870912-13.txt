, nearly opposite the church, on the month of July,cannot recollect the day of the month; I had a small bamboo stick in my hand; a man behind me trod upon it; I did not particularly notice his face, but I saw he had a blue apron on; he picked the stick up, and put it into my hand, and said he hoped he had not hurt it; I suspected something, and immediately told him he had not; I was going on, and somebody hallooed out, your pocket is picked; and there was a cry of stop thief; I followed the rest of the crowd, and this man was given to me as the prisoner that had taken the handkerchief; the handkerchief was put into my hand by a person of the name of

             sworn.
I was in High-street, St. Giles's, at the time, on the opposite side of the way, and I saw the prisoner at the bar take the handkerchief out of the gentleman's pocket; I went and told the gentleman his pocket was picked, and he was pursued, and in Stacy-street he dropped the handkerchief, and I picked it up; Mr. Hughes has it; during the whole time the prisoner was never out of my sight, and I am sure he is the man, and that is the handkerchief.
Court to Hughes. Is that the handkerchief the witness Boyd gave you? - It has my mark on it, and it is precisely the sort of handkerchief I wear.
PRISONER's DEFENCE.
I was going to High-street, St. Giles's, and I heard a cry of stop thief; I joined in running with the rest of the mob, and was stopped, and taken up as the thief.

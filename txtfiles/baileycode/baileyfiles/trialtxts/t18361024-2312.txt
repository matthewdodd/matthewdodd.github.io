THOMAS DODDS
. I live in Adam-street, Adelphi. On the morning of the 3rd of October I was on the London side of Temple-bar—in consequence of somebody speaking to me, I missed my handkerchief—the prisoner was pointed out to me—I went and took my handkerchief out of his pocket—this is it—I know it by some marks and stains upon it.





ROBERT NUNN
 (City police-constable 17.) I was on duty, and saw a mob collected—Dodds had got the prisoner by the collar—I took him.

Prisoner. I was going down Temple-lane, and picked it up on the pavement—I put it into my pocket.

MR. DODDS. I could not have dropped it—it was quite safe in my pocket—I had felt it not five minutes before.




GUILTY
.* Aged 19.—


Transported for Seven Years.

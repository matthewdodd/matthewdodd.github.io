            . I am a tailor
, and live in Oxford-street. The prisoner was in my employ - I gave him a coat and trousers, on the 26th of May, to take to a customer, at No. 7 Barlow-street, High-street, Marylebone; he never returned.
ANGELIOS BETRAUN. I am a constable. I was employed to go to the prisoner's lodgings - he was in bed; I made him no promise or threat - I asked what he had done with the clothes; he said he had pawned them at Mr. Sowerby's, in Long-acre, and had been robbed of the duplicate and part of the money.

                     SAMUEL THOMAS 
                     CHARLES
                  



               
             was indicted for 


               feloniously stealing, on the 15th day of December
 last, a man's hat, value 4 s. and three ounces of black taw, value 6 d.
             the property of 
               
                  
                     Alexander 
                     Flaherty
                  




               
            .
The prosecutor detected the prisoner, who was his shopman
, going out of the shop with one of his hats in his breeches, which he deposed to.
Prisoner. It is my own hat, one I had to dress and clean, and I wanted to conceal it; I have a licence to deal in hats.
Prosecutor. I am sure it was my hat.



               GUILTY
            .
Court. Prisoner, your defence is a very great aggravation of your crime, for nothing can be more suspicious or improper, than for a journeyman to deal in the same commodity which his master does on his own account; therefore, under all the circumstances of this case, I think I should not do my duty if I was not to order you to be 


               transported for seven years
            .
Tried by the second Middlesex Jury before Mr. RECORDER.

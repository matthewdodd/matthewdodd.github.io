             sworn.
On Friday the 7th of June, at three in the morning, I was coming from Butcher-row. The prisoners asked me to give them something to drink. We took a coach, and went into Holborn, and had half-a-pint of brandy. The coachman brought it out to us. From thence we drove to the Goose and Gridiron, in St. Paul's church-yard. There I got out of the coach. I went to pay the coachman, and missed my money, my pocket-book, and my handkerchief. The women were still in the coach. I was in liquor. I felt my money in my pocket before I got into the coach, and afterwards, when I paid for the brandy; and I think I felt it in my pocket at the end of Fleet-market. I charged the prisoners with robbing me, and told them, if they would give me my property again, I would let them go about their business; if not, I would call the watch, and give charge of them. They would not give it me again. I called the watchman, and charged him with the prisoners; and they were taken to the watch-house. As they were going along, I saw Thomas drop the pocket-book. I took it up, and said it was mine: and in the watch-house she dropped the handkerchief. She was searched afterwards, and my money and some more was found upon her.

             sworn.
I was constable of the night. The prosecutor brought the prisoners to the watch-house, and charged them with robbing him of a pocket-book, a handkerchief, a guinea and half, and 8 s. I searched

                   Thomas
               



            , and found upon her a guinea and half, 16 s. and three pennyworth of halfpence. The pocket-book was brought in by the watchman, and the handkerchief was found in the watch-house by the side of 
               
                  Ann
                   Thomas
               



            . There was nothing found on the other prisoner.

             sworn.
I am a watchman . The prosecutor gave me charge of the prisoners. I saw Thomas drop the pocket-book, as she was going to the watch-house .
(They were produced in court, and deposed to by the prosecutor.)
THOMAS's DEFENCE.
The money is my property. I never saw the pocket-book till I saw it in the man's hand. I think I saw one in his pocket: he dropped it in the coach, and the other girl picked it up.
ROBERTS's DEFENCE.
I know nothing of it.

ROBERTS 

               NOT GUILTY

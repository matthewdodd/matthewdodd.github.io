                  Draper 
               



            . I am a carpenter
, and live in Philip-lane, Aldermanbury. The prisoner took a two pair of stairs room of my wife, by the week, about the 4th or 5th of April; he lived in it about three weeks, and had no visible way of employment; he said he had a mother living, of whom he had a dependance for cloaths and money. He wanted to ride out one day, and it being showery sort of weather, my wife lent him my coat a first and second time; but the last time he took it without asking for it, although it was a fine afternoon; he returned without it. We lost a teaspoon, which was part of the furniture let with his lodgings.
Mrs. Draper. I lent the prisoner the great coat twice, and he brought it again; I was in my room, and saw him in the street with it on a third time; it was a very fine afternoon; he came home that night. I asked him where the coat was? he said he had left it at one Mr. Kilbourn's, at Rotherhithe church, and he should be there in two or three days, and would bring it home.
Q. Did you lend him the coat that third time?
Mrs. Draper. No, I did not; he never asked me. A little after this, I went to clean the room, where he lodged, and missed a silver tea-spoon; I asked him after it, but he did not then tell me; but afterwards he told me he had pawned the coat and spoon too: I found he deceived me about money being sent out of the country, so we took him up, and carried him before the Alderman, and he was committed; the Alderman knew him by the name of 
               
                  William 
                  Death 
               



            ; he had taken the lodging in the name of 
               
                  William 
                  Barton 
               



            .


                  Mary 
                  Coy 
               



            . I am servant to Mr. Day, a pawnbroker; on the 6th of April the prisoner pawned a tea-spoon with me for a shilling, in the name of 
               
                  John 
                  Barton 
               



            ; he said it was his own property. Produced and deposed to by Mrs. Draper.
- Davidson. I am servant to a pawnbroker, and live at London-wall; the prisoner pledged this coat with me on the 13th of April at night, (produced and deposed to by Mrs. Draper); he had pledged things with us before: the first time he came, he said he lived in Lothbury.
Q. What name did he pledge the coat in?
Davidson. In the name of 
               
                  William 
                  Inis 
               



            ; he said it was his own.
Prisoner's Defence.
I was in the house three weeks after; I did not go away; I had no design to defraud them; I expected money out of Essex, from about nine miles on the other side of Colchester; I was brought up in the country, in the grocery and linen-drapery way.

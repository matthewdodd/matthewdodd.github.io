            ) sent up to me for some money for butter, and about half past four I heard a hue and cry of stop thief in the street, I immediately looked out of the window, and I saw a large bundle laying out in the middle of the street; but I did not then know they were my things; the prisoner passed my window, that was the first time I ever saw him to my knowledge, the person that took him, brought him to our house, and said, this is the house you have robbed; I ran down stairs and found the parlour door was broke open, I keep a shop, and there are lodgers in the house, very honest people; the drawers which were not locked, were thrown about the room.
Had you left your door locked when you went up stairs? - The girl locked the door, I ran into the street, as soon as I found my place was robbed, and I owned the things; an officer was sent for, and the prisoner was committed. I was not in the room when the prisoner was searched, the bundle is in the hand of the officer, and the prisoner owned to the handkerchief in which the things were tied, and said it was his, and wanted to have it all dirty; another fellow made off with all the rest of my clothes, they did not leave me a gown to put on; I saw the officer take the bundle, and carry it to the justice's, his name is Bamford; the things that were in it were mine.
Who has had the care of the bundle since that time? - It has been in the care of the officer.
Mr. Garrow, prisoner's counsel. Is your servant girl here? - Yes.
What did your family consist of? - Two children, her and me.
Who were the persons at home at the time you lost these things? - One Mr.

Court. Did you leave the street door open, or upon the latch? - Upon the latch.

             sworn.
On the 30th of March last, I was coming along Blossom-street, and I saw the prisoner and another come out of 
               
                  Mary
                   Laycock
               



            's house with a bundle under his arm, and the other had property in his blue apron; the prisoner came towards me, and I laid hold of him, and accused him of the robbery, he made no answer; he had a bundle on his left shoulder, he threw the bundle out of his hand, he clapped both his hands to my breast and broke from me; I never lost sight of him, and he was taken directly.
Prisoner. I asked him to go back with me to the house to lay hold of the man.
Martin. The other man turned down Magpie-alley to go to Shoreditch, and the prisoner came towards me.
What became of the bundle? - I saw the officer pick it up.

             sworn.
On Thursday the 30th of March, I heard a noise of stop thief; I came from the back part of the house, and I saw the prisoner running, and Mr. Martin following him, crying out, stop thief; I then went out from the door into the road, and Martin cried stop him, that is him; I immediately seized the prisoner till Martin came up.
Court to Martin. Was the man that this witness laid hold of the same man? - Yes.


                  HENRY
                   BAMFORD
               



             sworn.
(Produces the bundle.)
I received these things from Mr. Martin; he had the prisoner in custody, and the bundle was near them, some person had it in their hand, I had it in the presence of Martin; this is the same bundle, it contains the same things; the prisoner begged I would be silent; I searched him directly, he had an apron on, and upon the back part of his apron I found this false key.
Prisoner. That was the key I had of my landlord, it is not a false key.
Bamford. He owned the handkerchief before the justice's being his own, and asked for it.

Prisoner. I lost my handkerchief in a scuffle; that is not my handkerchief.
(The things deposed to.)
Mrs. Laycock. This petticoat I swear to by a darn, and this apron I stained with some rabbit's blood, and my child's stay has three streaks of ink, and I believe all the rest of the things to be mine, by their general wear, and I had such things in my drawers.
Have you recovered all your things? - No; these are all I have seen since, here is a cotton petticoat, a cloth apron, a child's frock, seven clouts, and a number of little articles, and a quantity of new cloth, which I can swear to; they are all worth two guineas.
Mr. Garrow to Bamford. Do you know this Pickering? - Yes, I have seen him, I was present in about ten minutes, or a quarter of an hour. I believe the account this boy gave, was, that Pickering told him he was acquainted with Mrs. Laycock, and that he asked him to carry some things.
What is become of Pickering? - I do not know, I could not find him.
PRISONER's DEFENCE.
I was going to the Black Dog to have a pint of beer yesterday was a month, and one Pickering came in to ask for a porter; I asked him what for? he said to carry a bundle into Crispin-street, No. 13, up two pair of stairs: I said, can I do? he said, if you will go with me, you may do as well as another; I went with him to Blossom-street, and he bid me to go on till the man took me.
The prisoner called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.

             sworn.
My pocket was picked, on Thursday, in Grace Church Street


, about eleven o'clock; I was informed of it; I turned round and saw my handkerchief in Ruff's hands, and followed him (I gave no alarm) and saw him give it to Scruton; I took them to a constable, and from thence to Guildhall; the constable has the handkerchief.

             sworn.
I produce the handkerchief; I received it from this Gentleman, the prosecutor. (Prosecutor deposes to the handkerchief.)
The prisoners in their defence said that Ruff had picked it up, and that too by accident; and the other (Scruton) said he was a sailor, and that seeing the boy Ruff pick up the handkerchief he cried out, halves.

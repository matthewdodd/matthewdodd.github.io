            , MARCHIONESS OF DOWNSHIRE, AND BARONESS SANDYS
. Q. Is your house situate in the parish of St. George, Hanover-square



 - A. It is.
Q. In the night of Monday the 29th of March last was your ladyship's house broken open and robbed - A. It was, and the property stolen was of the value of some thousand pounds.


                  JAMES 
                  HAZARD
               



            . I am groom and chamberlain to the Marchioness of Downshire. On the night of the 29th of March I shut the windows of the back drawing-room. There are three windows. I shut the first window and the second, and fastened them; the third window I put the sash close down; I did not fasten that; I let the Venetian blinds and the curtains down.
Q. Is that third window next to the bow window - A.It is.
Q. What time in the day was it when you fastened these windows - A. Between seven and eight o'clock.


                  ANN 
                  ORAM
               



            . I am housemaid to the Marchioness.
Q. On Tuesday morning did you go into the back drawing-room - A. I did, a little after seven. I was the first that came down stairs. When I went into the back drawing-room I found the window nearest the Bow window open; the Venetian blinds were half down, and the sash quite up. There is some leads underneath that window; I there saw one of these ink stands and a gold cup tied up in a pocket handkerchief. I afterwards examined that room; I saw the drawers open, and the papers about the floor. I went into the adjoining-room; the cabinet was open, and all the boxes.
Q. Did you observe whether the contents of the cabinet and boxes were gone - A. No, sir. I then went and communicated it to the man servant.


                  CHARLES 
                  BRIAN
               



            . I am porter to the Marchioness. On Tuesday morning I was called by the last witness; I went first into the anti-chamber, and then into the front drawing-room. Nothing was broken open in the front drawing-room. This was a little after seven o'clock. I then went into the back drawing-room; I found the cabinet broken open, the table drawer, and some boxes that were in the room were broken open. There were papers about the room. There were things gone out of the cabinet and drawer.
COURT, Q. to Marchioness. Was it in this cabinet and drawer that you kept your valuable things - A. Yes.
Mr. 
               Pooley, Q.
             to Brian. Did you look out of the window of the back drawing-room - A. Yes.
Q. It adjoins the bow - A. Yes. There are leads under that window, the back drawing-room. That window was open. On the leads was a bundle tied up. I went down to it; there I found a bundle containing two ink stands, and on the top of the bundle some small ornaments of silver. I found a gold cup quite in the corner of the leads, under the window. It was pressed quite flat to make it portable.

Q. The ink-stands and cup you found there were the Marchioness's, I suppose - A. Yes.
Q. Do you know how the persons got in the window - A. Apparently by what I saw by a frame tied to the rails, and a lamp-lighter's ladder; the frame was used, and the ladder; the ladder upon the frame. That frame had been there perhaps for years.
Q. Did you afterwards procure the ladder which the lamp-lighter used to use - A. Yes.
Q. Was the ladder long enough to have got in the window without the frame - A. No; so it appeared by the tying of the frame.
Q. When you found the frame that morning was it tied - A. It was tied to the rails in three place.
COURT. What rails - A. At the back part of the house. That old window frame had been brought from the lumber-room, and fastened there.
Mr. Pooley. Did you see where the ladder was found the next morning - A. No; I did not see the ladder found. On my going up the area steps on the landing-place the lamp-lighter came; he asked me if there had been anything the matter. I said, yes. He said, because I found my ladder there this morning.
Q. When you went into the room how was the door between that and the stair-case - A. That door was open.
Q. Was the back drawing-room door fastened - A. I cannot tell. I did not go there last at night.
Q. to Hazard. How was the back drawing-room door at night - A. It was shut, but not locked. I shut it a quarter before one; the time that the Marchioness went to rest. I shut both the doors, but not locked them; I am sure of it. I shut the back drawing-room door, and the front drawing-room door.
Q. Do you know how the anti-room door was that night - A. I shut it at the same time. I think I was the last person up.
EDWARD BIGNELL. I am a lamp-lighter; I light the lamps for the Marchioness of Downshire; I fasten my ladder behind the rails of the stable wall with a padlock and a chain. It was a strong chain, like a brewer's chain.
Q. On the night of the 29th of March, do you recollect fastening your ladder there - A. I did, about six o'clock in the evening. In the middle of the night, about two o'clock, I go about for the purpose of re-lighting the lamps, and when I went to relight the lamps, the ladder and the chain were gone. I found the ladder about eight o'clock; it was standing upon the area steps of the Marchioness, inside of the rails.


                  JOSEPH 
                  BECKITT
               



            . I am a servant to Mr. Adkins, the Governour of the house of Correction.
Q. Do you know Richardson - A. Well, sir. I met him on the evening of the 6th of April, between nine and ten o'clock, in Little Earl-street, Seven Dials.
Q. Did Richardson see you - A. By his actions it appeared he did; by his turning down a street, and then running. He slipped off two great coats in running. I came up to him, and apprehended him in Little White Lion-street. I secured him. He asked me what I wanted. I told him not to talk to me in that way. He appeared as if he did not know me. He said, Mr. Beckitt, I shall be hanged. I took him into a back-room of a public-house, and searched him. I took from his person five hundred and twenty-three pounds in bank notes. He then asked me to get him a coat. He had not a coat or hat. I sent for a coach, put him in, and then he offered me the money to let him go. He said, I might keep the money for my own use, provided I would let him go out of the coach. In about ten minutes after that, in our way to the House of Correction, he acknowledged to me of robbing the Marchioness of Downshire; that he had been very lucky in respect of robbing the Marchioness of Downshire of a large property; he said he was one of the party that was concerned in it. I then declined having any further conversation until we got to the House of Correction. I then took him into the office in the Governor's house, to the Governor, and there I believe he made a confession to the Governor of the robbery. After that, me and the Governor and Richardson went to 
               
                  Reuben 
                  Joseph
               



            , and a person of the name of Wheeler. In our way we called upon Harry Adkins. We went under Richardson's directions, and knocked at Joseph's shop door, the street door being open.
Q. Where was this house of Joseph's - A. In Chandler-street, no great distance from the Marchioness's house. Richardson pointed out the house as we were going. We knocked at 
               
                  Reuben 
                  Joseph
               



            's shop door, and got admittance. 
               
                  Reuben 
                  Joseph
               



             opened the door. We got a light and searched the place. The Governor and Richardson asked for a couple of rings; Joseph and his wife denied having them. Richardson said, they had them, and they might as well give them up. Then we took Joseph in custody, and left his wife in custody of Wheeler. Then we went to the 
               
                  Brown 
                  Bear
               



            , Bow-street, with Joseph and Richardson. I stopped with Richardson while the Governor and Harry Adkins went with Joseph to apprehend old Simons. They brought Simons and Frankil back.
Q. What day was this - A. This was the same night I apprehended Richardson. I took charge of old Simons and Frankil, and the Governor went away again, Then after that we took them to the House of Correction.
Q. Had you any articles delivered to you - A. Yes, on the 13th of April, by 
               
                  Levi 
                  Hart
               



             It was delivered to me at 
               
                  Levi 
                  Hart
               



            's house, Monmouth-court, Seven Dials.
Q. Had you tried to find Simons - A. I have, when he was out of the way, over the water.
Q. How long have you been trying to find him - A. Two or three months, or longer.
Q. Did you know where Simons lived - A. Yes, well. I went there several times to find Simons. I searched his house, (that is in Crown-street, Soho), and I could not find him there. These rings I received of 
               
                  Levi 
                  Hart
               



            , at the house in Monmouth-court, a gold ring, a diamond ring, a serpent ring, and a small green smelling-bottle, and eight silver coins.
Q. Who has got the bando - A. I don't know. I have enumerated all the Marchioness can speak to. Richardson was the means of our recovering the property.



                  WILLIAM 
                  ADKINS
               



            . I am the Governor of the House of Correction. I know Richardson. On the 6th of April, Richardson was brought to the House of Correction by Beckett, one of my turnkeys; Beckett brought Richardson immediately into my office. I said to Richardson, I was very glad to see him back again; Beckett said he had taken a great deal of money from him; I said whatever you have taken. I said let me take an accompt down before Richardson; I then said to Richardson, from the manner in which the Marchioness's house had been broken open I had no doubt he was one concerned in it; he sat about a minute, and then he said, sir, I will not tell you an untruth; he said, I was concerned, and his part he sold to Simons's, meaning Simons and his wife, as I understood.
Q. You knew the Simons's, did not you - A. Yes. I asked him if he could give me information where I could find Simons; I meaned the father and son; he told me he could not tell me where they were at that time. I then asked him if he thought there was any chance of recovering any part of the property; he told me there were two rings, which he had given to a Mrs. Joseph, and that I might recover them again, for he was certain that she had got them; he then told me that old Simons and young Simons had lodged at Joseph's house, and by going to Joseph's house, I was likely to find some of the valuable boxes that had been stolen; he had seen them in a drawer in a bureau in a room in which the father and son had lodged; in a chest of drawers I believe; I am not certain whether he said in a chest of drawers, or a bureau; he then said that Joseph could give me the information where to find old Simons. I asked him the name of the street in which Joseph lived; he said he did not know the name of the street, nor the number of the house, but if I thought proper to take him in a coach he would take me to the place; I sent for a coach. I went with Richardson, 
               
                  Joseph 
                  Beckett
               



            , Wheeler, and 
               
                  Harry 
                  Adkins
               



            .
Q. Before you got to Joseph's house was anything said by Richardson to you, how he came by the five hundred pounds in notes - A. I omitted that in taking down the number of the notes, I asked Richardson if that was the produce of what he had stolen from the Marchioness of Downshire; he said part of it was, about three hundred pounds. Richardson took me to a house in Chandler-street, No. 13, he told me the house door would be open; I found it was, that Joseph had a shop and parlour. Richardson said, you had better knock at the door, and when Joseph comes, say it is Joe; Richardson's name is Joseph; I understood he meant the shop door; I did so. Joseph came and asked who is there; I said Joe. He opened the door, and when he found there was more than one, he then attempted to shut the door again; however I bursted it open again and got in; Joseph and his wife slept in the back parlour; they were both undressed; it was near twelve o'clock. I said to Joseph, do not make any resistance, it is of no use; I want two rings of your wife; Joseph said have you got two rings, give them to the gentlemen if you have got them; Wheeler then brought a light; I then said to Mrs. Joseph, I want two diamond rings of you, which have been stolen from the Marchioness of Downshire; she said she had got no rings, nor had she had any. Richardson then went up to her, and said you had better give them up, because you know I gave them to you. She positively denied knowing anything about it. We then proceeded to search the two rooms belonging to Joseph below, and found nothing. I then went upstairs to the second floor where Richardson, understood, had lodged. Richardson had described old Simons and young Simons had lodged there; I saw the drawer that Richardson had named to me, and found nothing. I came down stairs; I then told Joseph and his wife, that unless they gave up the rings I should take them in custody; said that she had not got them I took Joseph of oneside, I said do you know where old Simons lodges to night; he said he did not know. I told him I should take him to the House of Correction, and I should leave his wife at home with Wheeler; We got into the coach, and went to the 
               
                  Brown 
                  Bear
               



            , Beckett, myself, Harry Adkins, Richardson, and Joseph, five of us, went to the 
               
                  Brown 
                  Bear
               



            , and from the information, got at the 
               
                  Brown 
                  Bear
               



            , I went to No. 4, Seymour-court, Chandos-street. I went with 
               
                  Harry 
                  Adkins
               



            ; I knocked at the door several times; I could make nobody hear me; but a woman that lives at the house adjoining; to this opened the window she asked me what I wanted there; she said it was her house. She lent me a key, and we got into the house. I broke open the back room door below; I found the two prisoners, old Simons, and 
               
                  James 
                  Frankil
               



            , they were in bed, and as soon as we got the light in, I said to Simons, your name is Simons; he said his name was not Simons; I asked him what his name was; he refused to tell me his name; I desired them both to dress themselves; when Simons hod got his clothes on, then I recollected him; I told them both I should take them in custody. I said I knew you now, I shall take you in custody; I asked them if they had anything belonging to them in that apartment; they said no, they had not. I opened a drawer I found a small tea-caddy, and two purses, one a gold purse, the other beads and silk, they have been identified by the Marchioness. I asked Simons and Frankil if they belonged to them; they both denied it positively; 
               
                  Harry 
                  Adkins
               



            , my brother, and I took them to the 
               
                  Brown 
                  Bear
               



            .
Q. Before you took them to the 
               
                  Brown 
                  Bear
               



            , did you find anything else there - A. Not at that time. We locked the door and took the key with us; I left Frankil at the 
               
                  Brown 
                  Bear
               



            , and desired he might be put in a room at the 
               
                  Brown 
                  Bear
               



            ; and then conveyed Richardson and Simons to the House of Correction. 
               
                  Harry 
                  Adkins
               



             and myself went to Simons's lodgings again in Seymour-court, to search the lodgings of the same room that we had been at before, where we found old Simons and Frankil; under the bed that they were in, 
               
                  Harry 
                  Adkins
               



             found a box in my presence; he has had it ever since; I saw what it contained; it contained diamond rings, a gold watch, some silver coins, a pearl broach a black silk purse, some two guinea pieces, and three pieces of gold coin about the size of a shilling.

Mr. Knapp. to Marchioness. Look at these things - A. I have seen them all, they are my property; I had seen them in my house a day or two before the robbery; my drawer in the cabinet was broken open.
Q. to William Adkins. After you had found the box under the bed where Frankil and Simons laid, what took place - A. On the next day Richardson wished to speak to me; he told me that he had got two rings which were taken out of the Marchioness's house, and a pocket-book at his lodgings, No. 13, in the Colonade, Brunswick-square; he gave me two keys, and said if I would go to a chest of drawers, I should find two diamond rings, and a pocket-book. I went according to his direction and found the lodging; his wife was bed, this was Thursday the 8th, about eight or nine o'clock in morning. I there found two rings in a pocket-book, and this black silk purse.
Q. Did you find anything else there - A. No, except this iron crow; it is a new one, it has never been used; it is what they call a jemmy.
Q. to Marchioness. Look at the rings, and tell me whether they are yours - A. Yes, I know them; they were in my house at the time the robbery was committed, and I know the purse; it is mine.


                  William 
                  Adkins
               



            . On the 13th I received from a person of the name of 
               Levy
             a number of articles which have been identified by the Marchioness; the first is a musical snuff-box, a blood stone box, a locket watch, and two keys, eleven seals, seven gold, five small seals, and a gold ring, a diamond and granet ring.
Mr. Hanly. I received these pieces of ivory from the witness Adkins; they are piece of ivory upon which eyes have been painted.
Mr. Knapp. to 
               
                  William 
                  Adkins
               



            . Where did you get these pieces of ivory - A. I received them from 
               Levi
             I have a silver fillag ree box, I received it of Levi, and four gold purses, a gold breach, and part of a butterfly with the granets set in it, a neck broach, a watch-chain and slider, a necklace of Irish diamonds.
Q. to Marchioness. Has your ladyship seen these things before - A. I have; I have no doubt they are all mine; they were in my house on the night of the robbery.
Adkins. These are all the things delivered to me at the Green Man public-house, Bow-street. Levi was not in custody.
Mr. Andrews. From whose information was it, Adkins, that you wet to Seymour-court - A. Joseph I went there about two o'clock in the night.
Q. Frankil lived there - A. I found him there. This is the box that was found under the bed, on the side that Frankil was laying. Frankil said that Simons had only come there for a nights lodging. I have known Simons a good many years; he lived in Crown-street, with his wife; he left his home about eleven or twelve weeks previous to his being apprehended. The wife remained in Crown-street until she was apprehended.
COURT. Do you know the reason of his leaving his home - A. Simons had bought some stolen property of Richardson, and that was the reason of his leaving his home.
Mr. Adolphus. Richardson knew you, and you knew him. Was not his disclosure a desire to return the lady the property as far as he could - A. Yes. I found all correct. I do not think any part of the property would have been recovered had not it been for Richardson's discovery.
Q. He did every thing in his power to atone for the offence that he had committed - A. He did.
Mr. 
               Knapp, Q.
             to Hazard. Did you observe a wax candle in the morning in a candlestick - A. They took a candle in the drawing-room; they did not use it; and there were some short pieces on the carpet. There was one piece that did not belong to the family.
Q. Was there a small candle of the marchioness's used - A. Yes. The next morning that candle was burnt shorter than it was the over night. I found that candle near the window where they got in. I left it the over night upon the writing-table in the same room. It was not on the writing-table the next morning; it was upon the other window.

                  ADKINS
               



            . I am an officer of Bow-street. On Tuesday night, the 6th of April, I went with 
               
                  William 
                  Adkins
               



             and Beckitt to No. 16, Chandler-street; there I found 
               
                  Reuben 
                  Joseph
               



             and his wife.
Q. Did you take 
               
                  Reuben 
                  Joseph
               



             away from there - A. I did, and left Wheeler there to take care of 
               
                  Dinah 
                  Joseph
               



            . We brought Reuben Joseph to Bow-street. I afterwards went to Seymour-court, Chandois-street.
Q. Did you there find old Simons and Frankil in bed together - A. We did. I assisted in taking them. I took these keys from them. One of these keys upon the ring applied to the tea-caddy. We asked Simons if the tea-caddy belonged to him; he said it did not. I then went to the windows to see if they were secure in the inside. I found they were. The prisoners then were taken to Bow-street. I locked the door, and put the key in my pocket. My brother went with the prisoners to the house of Correction, leaving Frankil. I waited until he returned, and when he returned we went back to Seymour-court. As soon as we got there we searched the room. I found that box under the bed, at the head of the bed, under that side of the bed upon which Frankil was laying. They were both laying in the same bed. All the things that I found have been in my custody or my brother's.
Q. to 
               
                  William 
                  Adkins
               



            . You parted with three boxes and a watch to Mr. Hanley - A. I did, and the thing I now produce are the things that I received from Mr. Hanley.


                  Harry 
                  Adkins
               



            . The other things I have in my custody.
Q. Did you go to Levy's house - A. I did, at Poplar. I found 
               
                  Joseph 
                  Levy
               



             at home.
Q. Who did you find there - A. James Simons; he was locked up in a back washhouse. I took him in custody. I told him I took him upon a charge of robbing Lady Downshire's house. He said he knew nothing at all about it. I took him into custody. 
               
                  James 
                  Simons
               



             had got on a long coat and a pair of pantaloons.
Q. After the robbery had been committed did you go to the Marchioness's house - A. I did.

Q. How had the thieves got in - A. By a ladder at the back window. There is an area, and there are pallisades, and a sash was tied with three strings to the pallisades. The ladder was put on the top of the sash. There were the marks of the sash upon the ladder. In the evening I got the ladder, and the ladder reached the window within four or five inches; any person so disposed, by the assistance of the sash and the ladder, might very easily get in the window.
Q. Now, what was the appearance of the room where you supposed they had been in - A. The first room I went into was the anti-room. As soon as I went in I observed a kind of a writing desk with a drawer for paper and pens; it appeared to have been cut by a knife, and to have been wrenched open. Upon this writing-desk I observed drops of a wax candle. Upon the floor I found the knife which is in that trunk; a clasp knife. This is the knife. I then went into the back drawing-room where they had entered. I found there the cabinet broken open, boxes broken open, paper and every thing throwed about the floor. I found an iron crow upon the floor and a small centre-bit, and a piece or two of dirty candle. In different parts of the room I found some spots occasioned by the droppings of a wax candle. I then went into the bow-room; I found that room in the same state; the sash was up. That is all I know.
Mr. Gurney. In searching old Simons did you find any money upon him - A. Fourteen pounds, sir. In the box under the bed was an hundred pound bank note.
Q. And how many guineas did you find also - A. Seventy-nine guineas, and two half-guineas.

                  Simons
               



             scratched the glass of the window with something on his hand. I asked him to shew it me; he said it was only a bit of glass; if I had a bit of glass I could do the same. It appeared to me to be a diamond, and from the appearance of the scratch I was induced to believe it was a diamond.
Q. In the course of that day did 
               
                  Fanny

Mr. 
               Knapp, Q.
             to Beckitt. I asked you particular about a bando - A. I now produce it; I had not got it then. I received it of

COURT. His father asked him where he had been - A. Yes; he said as far as Russel-square or Bedford-square. I said he could not go that distance in so short a time. He said he had seen the prison, the house of Correction. I went to bed about half past ten.

             said it was brass, and worth nothing; he had seen it before. She afterwards told me that she had sold it to Cohen, her son-in-law, and he had broke it up, and sold it; it was no other value than the pearl and gold.
Q. Do you remember on that Tuesday young Simons shewing you any thing - A. Yes, a pocketbook with a clasp to it.
Q. Was it like this - A. Yes; he desired me to smell it, it smelled like his father's prayer-book. He asked me if the lock was gold. I said I believed it was.
Q. Did you observe any thing about Richardson that you had not seen before - A. Yes; I observed two gold seals hanging to Richardson's watch that I had not seen before.

Q. How was your street door usually kept of a night - A. Sometimes shut and sometimes open.
Q. Could your lodgers go in and out of a night just as they pleased - A. Yes.
Q. You had not been disturbed by Richardson coming in - A. No. I do not know at what hour he came in.

                  Joseph
               



             your daughter - A. Yes.
Q. Do you recollect at any time Dinah giving you a parcel containing a ring - A. She gave me a paper containing something; I did not look to see what it was. She desired me to take it home, and take care of it; it was something that had been given her; her husband was angry at her having received it. I put the parcel into an old glove, and put it in the cupboard between the wall and a cross-bar of wood in a corner.
Q. You were afterwards taken in custody - A. Yes.
Q. While you were in custody did you give your husband any information where to find it - A. My son-in-law came up in the morning, and Mr. Adkins. I was apprehended on the Monday. On the next day my son-in-law told me I had two rings. My husband called; I told him to go home and fetch it, and told him where it was I had put it.

            . I am the husband of the last witness.
Q. Did you go to her while she was in the house of Correction - A. I did. She directed me where to find a parcel in a glove; I went to the place she described; in that place I found an old glove behind the bar. Beckitt saw me find it. I delivered it to him.
Beckitt. The parcel was delivered into my hand; it has been in my custody ever since. I only delivered it to the Marchioness, and then it was delivered back to me.

            . Look at these things, and tell me whether they are the things which Levy sent to you - A. These things came from Levy; they are all the things I had, except some glass I left at Lady Downshire's; I was afraid of breaking them.

            . I am a slop-seller. I live in Rosemary-lane; Mrs. Simons is my mother-in-law.
Q. Do you remember your mother coming to your house on Wednesday, the 31st of March last - A Yes, about two o'clock.
Q. Was Levi there - A. Yes, when I got in we went up stairs together. I went into the front room.
Q. Do you remember your mother-in-law shewing you anything there - A. Yes, she shewed me some diamonds.
Q. Was 
               
                  James 
                  Simons
               



             there - A. No; she shewed me the top of a round-snuff, it was lined with gold, the outside was ivory, the frame of the picture; she shewed me a pair of diamond ear-rings, with a large diamond in the centre, there were some drop but they did not hang to them at that time.
Q. Did she shew you any diamonds like tops of pins, in gold - A. Yes, and a large cross set about in pearls, and a diamond; the pearls were large; that was all that she shewed me that time; she wished to know the value of them; I and Levi went to Benjamin to get them valued; I shewed him the diamonds; Benjamin said, they were worth two hundred pounds. I went back and saw Mrs. Simons; upon my return, Levi asked her what she asked for them; she said there are more at home, and she would sell them together. Mrs. Simons went home then, and left the diamonds with my wife, who is her daughter. About seven o'clock Mrs. Simons came with her son James, they produced a great many gold things; Mrs. Simons had some in an handkerchief; this box was shewed by Mrs. Simons; the musical-box was among them, and the watch; I cannot exactly say to the seals; I believe the seals before me may be the seals; I do not speak positively to them.
Q. What did the son produce - A. He produced a great many seals.
Q. Did he produce a tooth-pick case - A. I believe there was a took-pick case; I cannot swear that is the tooth-pick case, I believe it is. This large case I believe was produced by Mrs. Simons.

Q. Do you remember this book - A. Yes.
Q. Was not there this book full of coin; upon your oath looking at the coin, do not you believe that to be part of the coin in the book - A. No, I do not; I saw him pull it out of his pocket.
Q. Where did you afterwards send them things that you had of Mrs. Simons - A. They were at home; Mrs. Levy had them.
COURT. You delivered all you had of Mrs. Simons, or of James, to Levi - A. Yes.
Mr. Knapp. Did not she say, that she brought these - A. No, she did say it in that way; she said when Mr. Levi offered her the money, she could not take it until she had told her husband, for fear she should do wrong.
COURT. Young man, look at that watch-chain - A. Yes; I remember seeing it; James, the son, produced that.

Mrs. Simons came with her son, she brought a bundle there in a handkerchief; I saw the bundle opened.
Q. Look at these articles - A. This is one; this musical-box, and this watch-chain another; this locket-watch was in this gold purse. These three purses I cannot say whether they were produced by her or by James; part of these seals I am most sure

                  Daniel 
                  Bishop
               



            , and my son, both officers; I never could find him.
Richardson's Defence. My lord, and gentlemen of the jury, a just sense of horror at my present awful situation, and being unwilling to attempt to justify my conduct, I plead guilty; which guilt originated in the dangerous acquiescence of most dishonest practices. Pardon my presumption; having only attained my twenty-six years, bred to a stonemason. I cannot be supposed to have transgressed the laws of my country, to that extent as I humbly acknowledge to be the case without wicked advice, by characters whose chief dependance were to trace the steps upon various mansions, for advising me, and other unfortunate persons like myself, to rob and plunder every thing to themselves, they acquiring the property; to such characters I have fallen a prey. I can assure you that my actions have never been that of a self-premeditated thief, and it is the only reparation I can make. Sorry I am to make my own condemnation, justice makes me do it; I never carried any offensive weapon about my person, and so far from doing violence on these occasions, upon the least noise or alarm sooner to risk violence I ran away rather than by violence endangering the lives of valuable subjects. I have too frequent fallen into and adopted the mode of systematical house-breaking. Mrs. Simons and her family, who are now indicted with me, they have been the chief persons that I have been connected with since my being in London three years, who have informed me what houses to break into, and when and what part the most valuable property was contained, which property I was obligated to sell to them at the sixteenth part of the value, and when I have so done there have been persons in the street to rob me of the same. My escape from Cold Bath-fields prison is too notorious, it is well known I escaped from there; when being moneyless I went to Mrs. Simons; Mrs. Simons then mentioned the robbing of the house of the noble Marchioness. I have pleaded guilty, and am therefore determined to tel of the Simons's family. They gave me instructions about the house; which after their giving me several times, they set me to rob the house, which I humbly beg pardon for the same. On my apprehension I acknowledged my guilt and contrition. I have been the chief instrument of restoring the property back again. Pardon me, my wife is only seventeen years of age, entirely without any protection by the recent loss of her father. I humbly implore your mercy; spare my life; I have transgressed in the extreme, yet as I have endeavered to discover the present robbery and to restore all the property in my power, I humbly hope you will save my life. Banish me wherever you please; I implore mercy, for which I and my family will for ever pray.

THOMAS M'MINN

the afternoon, I received information and missed a piece of cotton—I went to the door, and saw the prisoner crossing from our shop—I went after him, and he had this piece of cotton, which is my father's.





GEORGE HIGGINS
 (police-constable N 161.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person.

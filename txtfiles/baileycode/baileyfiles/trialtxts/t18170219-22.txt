FRANCIS BRABAZON WALLACE. I live in Bath-place, New-road. On the 7th of February, about ten o'clock in the day, I was in Cornhill


, stopping to look at a horse that had fell down, I felt something at my pocket, and turned round, and found the prisoner putting my handkerchief in his bosom; I said, ah! he dropped it, and ran off; I picked it up and pursued him, an alarm was given, and he was taken before he got out of my sight. I am sure the prisoner is the man that I saw with my handkerchief, when I first turned round.

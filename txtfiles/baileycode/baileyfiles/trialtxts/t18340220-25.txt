             (police-constable, 43 S.) On the 30th of January, at half-past five o'clock, I was on duty in Aberdeen-place, Edgeware-road - I saw the two prisoners coming along, each of them had a sack across his shoulder - Row passed me and wished me a good morning - Green stopped for a moment and then crossed the road, as if to shun me - I followed him about two hundred yards - I then asked what he had got - he said mushroom-spawn, which he had brought from Brentford; I said,"I should like to look at it;" he then called out to the other prisoner, "Jack!" - I said, "Never mind him, if you have nothing but mushroom-spawn, you may go on;" he then said, it was some fowls they had found on the road - I said he must consider himself as my prisoner; he said he should like to speak to his mate; I said he might - he and I both ran after him - I found a sweep, and left Green in his custody while I went after Row - I found him in Paddington - in Green's sack I found three geese and six fowls, and on his person I found a clasp-knife and some poison; and, in Row's sack, were four wet shirts - they both said they found the things.

I am a hair dresser
; I lost six tea-spoons on the 29th of August; they were in the parlour; I saw them at breakfast; they were always kept in the cupboard; I saw them an hour and a half before; I came home just after the man had taken them.

             sworn.
On Friday morning I was going round to my customers, and as I got to the prosecutor's door; the prisoner, Mr. and Mrs. Cook, and a man was standing at the door; the man said, he wanted a pennyworth of precipitate powder; he went from the door up Duke-street and turned round; he had the spoons loose in the pocket of his great coat; I went after him, and heard them rattle loose in his pocket; he put his hand in his pocket and held them off from touching his thigh; I then caught hold of his collar, and said, by God you have something there, and I will see what it is; he said, oh, my good fellow do not! they are only a few silver tea-spoons; they are not missed; I told him I would take him back; I took thespoons from him, and put them into my breeches pocket.

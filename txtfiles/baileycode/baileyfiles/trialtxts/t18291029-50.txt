, and live in Southampton-place, Camden-town


. On the 17th of October, about half-past four o'clock in the afternoon, I left my niece in the shop for a few minutes; a neighbour called Smith! I ran down, and my niece said, "Uncle here is another pair of stays gone" - I had lost two pairs the day before; I saw the prisoner running across the road with them under his arm - I followed, and took them from him.(Property produced and sworn to.)

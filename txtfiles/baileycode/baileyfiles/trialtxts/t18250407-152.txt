JAMES M'KENZIE. I am a servant
, and lodge at John Cater's, Harcourt-street, Mary-le-bone


. On the 11th of March I went to bed about eleven o'clock: I had three sovereigns in my box, which was locked; every thing but the trowsers were in the box; I had the key in my trowsers' pocket; the prisoner slept in the room - I awoke about five o'clock - he was in bed then - I went to sleep - awoke about eight and he was gone - I got up and missed all this property - it was all safe the morning before - I found the box unlocked, and the key left in the padlock.

            . I rent the first floor in this house. The prisoner engaged the back room on the 10th, for a week - he said he had come from Norwich to learn a business, and hoped to remain with me two years. I never saw him after the 11th - the house belongs to Mr. Burrows.

            . I am an officer. On the 5th of April, after the prisoner was committed, I heard the prosecutor had lost a pair of trowsers - he came to Newgate and identified those the prisoner had on.

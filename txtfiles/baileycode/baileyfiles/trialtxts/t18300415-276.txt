WILLIAM BARTON. I am a carpenter
. On the 22nd of February I worked till breakfast - I then went away, and left my saw and plane in a house in Kingsland-road - I had to go to another place; I came back next morning, and missed this saw and plane.

            . I am an apprentice to a pawnbroker. This saw was pawned on the 22nd of February, between seven and eight o'clock, by the prisoner, I believe.(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I keep a stall in the street, and sell bells, locks, and other things - a man brought these things, and sold them to me for 5s.; I wanted some money, and pawned the saw - I then took the plane to another pawnbroker; I said it was my own, because I thought they would let me go.

WILLIAM COOK
. I am footman to Mr. John Anthony Fructuozo, who lives in Portland-place, in the parish of St. Marylebone. On the 21st of July, at two o'clock in the day, I was going into the pantry, and saw the prisoner come out with a black bag—he was quite a stranger—he ran out of the pantry and shut me in—I opened the door and followed him up the area steps—he dropped the bag on the steps—I caught him as he was opening the gate—he got from me and ran across the way—I pursued and never lost sight of him—he was stopped—I took him back, sent for a ploiceman, and gave him in charge—I found five tea-spoons and two tablespoons in his pocket, and the rest of the articles in the indictment were in the bag.

Cross-examined by
MR. CLARKSON. Q. You cannot be mistaken in his person? A. No—I tore off the skirt of his coat—it is my master's dwelling-house.






PRISCILLA ANSTEAD
. I am a servant on of place—I was passing the prosecutor's house, and saw the prisoner run up the area steps—he dropped the bag, and the tea-pot fell out—he ran away—Cook secured him—I am sure he is the man.





JACOB MILLER
. I am a policeman. I searched him, and found the spoons in his pocket, and a life-protecter.





WILLIAM COOK

re-examined. I have examined this plate—it is my master's, and is worth about 8l.




GUILTY

Transported for life.

Before Mr. Justice Bosanquet.

WILLIAM EBBEN
. I am a watchmaker, living in High-street, Islington. On the 8th of August, about half-past eight o'clock in the morning, I was outside my house, within ten yards of it, I saw the prisoner come out of my house—I suspected something—I went in and missed a watch and its appendages, which I had seen not two minutes before—I then followed, and saw him go near a butt belonging to a publican—I saw him put something on it—when he saw me he ran round the butt—I met him, caught hold of him, and said, "Where are they?"—he pointed to the butt—I took these articles off the butt, and took him back—these are the watch and case.

Cross-examined by
MR. PAYNE. Q. How far had you got before you saw that watch on the butt? A. Fifty yards—he begged to let him go, and said it was his first offence.





CORNELIUS SAVOY
 (police-constable N 160.) I took the prisoner—he said a tall gentleman in black told him to go in and take the watch, and he would give him some money.




GUILTY

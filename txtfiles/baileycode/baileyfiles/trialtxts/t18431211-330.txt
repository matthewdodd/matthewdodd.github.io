CHARLES HERITAGE
. I am shopman to John William Vaughan, linendraper Whitechapel. About four o'clock, on the 7th of Dec., the prisoner was brought into the shop with thirty yards of Orleans cloth—we then examined and missed the cloth—I am quite sure this is my master's cloth—I know it by the mark.





EDWARD BURGESS
 (policeman.) I was on duty—I saw the prisoner and two more females go into the prosecutor's shop—I saw the other two stand in front of the prisoner, while she took this piece of Orleans cloth from a pile inside the door—she came out—I followed her down Goulston-street, and said, "What have you got?"—she said, "Nothing"—I stretched my hand to take the piece, and she let it fall in the dirt—I took it up, and carried it to the shop, where it was owned.





WALTER O'BRIEN
 (policeman.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
.* Aged 18.—


Transported for Seven Years.

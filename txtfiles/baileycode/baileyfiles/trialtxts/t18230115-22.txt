            . I rent a house in James-place, St. Pancras


; the prisoner lived servant with me. On the 18th or 19th of December, in consequence of missing property, I sent for the constable between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning - she was then out, she came home soon after, and was searched - a waistcoat was found concealed under her clothes, which is my son's. I provide him with clothes.

            . I am a constable. I was fetched. The prisoner came home between eleven and one o'clock - I told her she was suspected of having taken the property, and that she must go up stairs with me; she did so; I asked if she had any property about her; she said, No - I found the waistcoat under her gown, tied up by her petticoat string. She began to cry, and begged her master's forgiveness.

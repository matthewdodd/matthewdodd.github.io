JOHN OWEN. I have a butcher's-shop
 in Fitzroy-market


. About half-past ten o'clock on Saturday night, the 12th of February, I was returning from my other shop, and met the prisoner and another boy
 - they came in front of my shop, where my wife was weighing some mutton; my servant had just gone away - they both took hold of the piece of beef; they came right into my arms with it -I caught hold of the prisoner, and the beef; the other got away - I had seen them take the beef off my board; it weighed 7 1/2 lbs.
Prisoner. This is the first crime I ever committed - I was returning home last Christmas, and saw four men round the prosecutor's shop; I went and told him of it.

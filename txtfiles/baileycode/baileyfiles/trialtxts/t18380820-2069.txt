JOHN BARNARD
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
13th of July, 1 handkerchief, value 6s., the goods of 



William Rennell, from his person; and that he had been previously convicted of felony.






THOMAS HESSELTINE
. I am a tin-plate worker, and live in Ann-street, St. George's-in—the-East. I was in Blackman-street, on the 13th of July, at a quarter to ten o'clock in the evening, and saw the prisoner in company with another, by St. George's Church, attempting a gentleman's pocket—I followed them down Blackman-street, and saw the prisoner take a handKerchief

out of the prosecutor's pocket—I told a policeman of it, who was on the opposite side of the way—I do not know what he did with the handkerchief—it was red and white one.





HENRY HUNT
 (police-constable M 91.) In consequence of information from Hesseltine, I watched the prisoner, and saw him in the act of taking handkerchief from Mr. Rennell's pocket—I made towards him, and saw him take it—he looked round, saw me, and went up Suffolk-street—I ran after him—he was close to the other man, and could have given him the handkerchief—they appeared acting together, both keeping close on the gentleman—I secured him.





WILLIAM RENNELL
. I live in Windmill-place, Camberwell. I was in Blackman-street on the 13th of July—the policeman spoke to me, and I missed my handkerchief—on turning round I saw the prisoner—he ran off as fast as he could.

Prisoner. I was merely going to get my brother's washing—I saw the mob, and went up, and the policeman said, "This is the one, I think."





HENRY HUNT

re-examined. He is the man—there was a mob when he ran away—I never lost sight of him.





PETER LOGAN
 (police-sergeant M 12.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction—I was present when he was tried and convicted last June Sessions—(read)—he is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 18.—


Transported for Ten Years.

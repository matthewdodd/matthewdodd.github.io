            . I am shopman to Mr. Salter, he is a hatter
, No. 17, Beech street, Barbican


. On the 30th of December, about seven o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came into the shop in company with another woman; she asked to look at some hats, she said she would call the next day and bring the little girl; she went away and did not purchase any. In about five minutes after she was gone I missed a hat from the counter; I went after the women and overtook them; the prisoner was looking at the hat that I had lost, I saw the hat in her hand, I asked her for it, I told her that she had stolen it; I was going to take the hat from her, she immediately threw it behind her and said she knew nothing at all about the hat; I took her back to the shop and gave her in charge of the patrol; the other woman made off, I did not see what became of her.
Q. Had you seen this hat on the counter before - A. Yes.
Q. Have you seen the hat since - A. Yes. I am sure it is my master's property.
Prisoner. Ask him if I was the person that took the hat and throwed it away.
Witness. Yes, you was the person that throwed it away.
Prisoner's Defence. I am very innocent of what I am here for.

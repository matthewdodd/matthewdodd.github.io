JAMES CONNOLLY. On Thursday, the 8th of November, I went into the George and Crown public-house, Broad-street


, with these goods, consisting of some locks and other articles - I put them down by my left-hand side, and turned round to show the goods I had to sell to some other persons, and this pocket was gone; I do not know who took it till the Saturday following.

             (Police-constable F 78). I stopped the prisoner with this pack on the Thursday night - I asked what he had got; he said he did not know, but a cab-man gave it to him to carry; there were thirteen padlocks, some cork-screws, and other things - a key was found in his pocket, which fitted one of the locks.(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I found them.

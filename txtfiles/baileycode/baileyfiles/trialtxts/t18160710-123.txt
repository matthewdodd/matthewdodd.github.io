JESSE PHILLIPS. I keep an earthen-ware-shop
. I was in the back part of my shop on the day in the indictment, and in consequence of some information which my son gave me, I went forwards, and saw the prisoner taking away the plates in question from my door. On seeing me, he directly threw them down, and broke them; but I secured him.
THOMAS PHILLIPS. I saw the prisoner and another man lurking about my father's door, and presently the other man took the plates, and gave them to the prisoner; I immediately called my father.

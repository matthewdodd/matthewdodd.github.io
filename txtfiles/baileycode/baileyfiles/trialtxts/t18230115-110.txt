            , a linen-draper
, of Ratcliff-highway


. On the 13th of December, about eight o'clock in the evening, I was informed some boys were endeavouring to take something from the shop - I ran to the door, and saw the prisoner and another running away. I pursued, and lost sight of them; but overtook them. I found a boy holding the prisoner by the tail of his coat - the boy took this print from him, which had hung inside the door. He must have come in at the door.

            . I am sixteen years old, and live at Mr. Hartley's. A gentleman gave me information; I ran out, and saw two boys running, and the prisoner with the print under his arm, which I missed from the rail. I followed him, came up, and caught him by the coat in Blue Gate-fields with it.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. It is false. I had no property; he talked to me full five minutes before the gentleman came up. He picked the print up, and said
"Here it is."

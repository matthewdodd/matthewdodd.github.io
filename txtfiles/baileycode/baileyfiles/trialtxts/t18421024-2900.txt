DORCAS HAZLEWOOD
. I am the wife of James Hazlewood, a grocer, at Hoxton. I was in the parlour at the back of my shop on the morning of the 3rd of October—I heard a jink of money in the till—I looked up and saw the prisoner leaning across the counter taking money out of the till—I saw the money in his fingers—he saw me and ran away down Hoxton—I went to the till and saw that between 2s. and 3s. were gone—I went to the door and saw he was stopped by somebody—I had looked into the till a quarter of an hour before, and it contained between 2s. and 3s., when I looked at it afterwards there was no silver in it.





JAMES BREMAN
. I am a policeman. At eleven o'clock that morning I was

in plain clothes, in Hoxton Old-town—I saw the prisoner with two others—I watched him—I saw him go into a shop and come out again—I watched him about a quarter of an hour more—I saw him go into the prosecutor's shop, he stopped a few minutes and then ran out—I caught hold of him, and asked him, "Have you got anything?"—his two companions ran away—he said he had got nothing—I saw he had one hand clenched—I caught hold of it, and on opening it I took two shillings and two six-pences out—I took him to the shop, and the prosecutrix said, "He is the lad that was in my shop"—he said, "The money is my own."

Prisoner's Defence. I went into the shop to buy a penny worth of Spanish liquorice; I saw a boy going by, and I ran out.

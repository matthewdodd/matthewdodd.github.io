MR. WOOLLETT
conducted the Prosecution.






WILLIAM FISHER
 (policeman). On 25th March, between seven and eight o'clock, I was in Chadwell-street, and saw the prisoners in company on the opposite side—I watched them about a quarter of an hour, and saw Bryant go up to several doors and try to open them—he did not succeed—he then went up to 121, St. John-street-road, and opened the street-door—Montague was a few yards away on the same side—Bryant then joined Montague, and they conversed together about a minute—Montague then walked up the steps into the house—he closed the door after him, and afterwards came out with a coat on his arm—we stopped him with this coat on his arm—Bryant had crossed to the other side—I took him—he threw something away which sounded like keys—they were picked up and taken to the station—they are all latch keys; one of them opens Mr. Jones' door.





HUGH LEWIS
. I picked up these keys in St. John-street (produced) and took them to the station.





CHARLES AUGUSTUS JONES
. I live at 121, St. John-street-road, St. James's, Clerkenwell. On the evening of 20th March I missed my coat—this is it (produced.)

Bryant's Defence. I never had the keys.

Montague's Defence. I don't know this man—I saw the door open, and went into the passage.





ALFRED SPICE
 (policeman, V 77). I produce certificates of the conviction of both prisoners—(read—Central Criminal Court, James Bryant, Convicted March, 1850, having been before Convicted, confined six months)—I was present—Bryant is the person—(Central Criminal Court, John Henderson, Convicted March, 1850, having been before convicted, confined one year)—I was present—Montague is the person.

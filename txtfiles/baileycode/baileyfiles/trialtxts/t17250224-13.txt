 last. Giles Hanwell depos'd, that being backwards, he heard somebody in the Shop; and coming forwards, he saw the Prisoner Thrusting the fourteen Pound Weight down her Bosom, As soon as she perceived him, she took it out, and pretended to be in Jest. How easily, says she, could I have taken this away, if I had had a mind to have been a Thief? He thought her to be in Earnest. But it seems she had carry'd the left too far; for upon searching her, he found a Seven Pound Weight under her Armpit.

            , who is an inn-keeper
. The prisoner and a sailor came into the tap room; the sailor came into the kitchen to speak with the cook; the prisoner followed him in; they eat some beef with the cook: within five minutes after they went away, a silver table spoon and a marrow spoon were missed;

             pursued them, and brought them back; they were searched, but the spoons were not found. The prisoner went out and I followed him under the gateway; I saw him scratching among some ashes; soon after that I saw him again scratching among the ashes; then he and the sailor went away. I examined the ashes but could not find the spoons; I watched them into a public house at Smithfield; then I got a constable and secured the prisoner; I put him in a coach, and as we were going along, we took the spoon out of his hand: he dropt the other in the coach.

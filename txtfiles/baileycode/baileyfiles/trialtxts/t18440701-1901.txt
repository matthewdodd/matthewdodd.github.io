AMELIA TOMKINS
. I am the wife of Thomas Arger Tomkins, and live at Stock well-place, Lambeth. I had a coat, a pair of gloves, a handker chief, and an account-book safe at twelve o'clock on Saturday last, on my bed—I have missed them—these are the coat, the account-book, and gloves—they are ours.





THOMAS EMERSON
 (police constable V 16.) On Saturday evening last, I was in the Clapham-road, near the Swan, at Stock well—I saw the three prisoners together—Simpson had hold of Lee's hand—I followed them, and saw Lee had something in her apron—when they were near Southampton New-road, I took them, with the assistance of another constable, who took a coat from Lee's apron.





EDWARD JAMES KNIGHTLEY
 (police-constable V 178.) I produce the coat, the gloves, and the account-book—about a quarter past six o'clock I saw the prisoners coming along South Lambeth, from the prosecutor's neighbourhood—I saw Emerson behind them—I stopped the prisoners—Lee had this coat,—the gloves and book were in the pocket of the coat.

                   COURTLAND
               



             sworn.
On the 17th of April, I had been washing, and hung seven shirts out of the window to dry, about a quarter after eight in the evening; in a quarter of an hour, I missed one of them; 
               
                  Henry
                   Barlow
               



             saw the prisoner going out, and bid me see if every thing was safe: on missing it, he followed her, and brought her back.


                  HENRY
                   BARLOW
               



             sworn.
I saw the prisoner go out with a great cloak on; I followed her, and told her, I suspected she had something she should not have; she said, here, take it, and let me go; and gave me the shirt from under her cloak in the street; I took her to Bridewell; I could not get a constable.
The shirt was produced in court by Barlow, and deposed to by the prosecutrix.
The prisoner did not say any thing in her defence.



               GUILTY
            .
Tried by the first Middlesex Jury before Mr. RECORDER.

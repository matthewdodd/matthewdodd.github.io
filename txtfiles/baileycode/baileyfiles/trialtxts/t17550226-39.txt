                  Bird 
               



            . I live with Mr. Barrington, in Red-lion-street; I went out of town with the family last May, and came to town again on the 22d of December; the things mentioned in the indictment were left in the care of 
               
                  William 
                  Bagnal 
               



            . We told him the things were missing; he said the prisoner had laid them in that room; we took him up on the 24th, we had him before the justice, where he confessed, in my hearing, he had taken the things mentioned out of the room, and pawned them at three separate places; he could not tell the persons names, but he went and shewed us them, that is, my fellow servant and the constable; we found, I think, my coat at a pawnbroker's the corner of Featherstone-buildings; 
               
                  William 
                  Bruce 
               



            , my fellow-servant, at another pawnbroker's in Leather-lane, found either my coat or breeches, I think the latter; and the other was found at another pawnbroker's, I can't tell where he lives; and my hat the prisoner had on his head when taken up, and my waistcoat we found in his lodgings.


                  William 
                  Bruce 
               



            . I am servant to Mr. Barrington. He confirmed the evidence of Richard Bird.


                  William 
                  Bagual 
               



            . I am a chairman; I knowing the prisoner when he lived with my lady St. John, and he wanting a lodging, I let him lie with me; the goods mentioned were in the same room at the time; I knew nobody could come at them but me and the prisoner; I suspected him, we took him up, and he confessed he took them away.
The prisoner had nothing to say in his defence.



               Guilty

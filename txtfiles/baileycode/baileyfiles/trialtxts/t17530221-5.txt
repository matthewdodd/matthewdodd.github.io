Q. Had you ever seen the prisoner before?
Rawlins. No, not to my knowledge.
Prisoner's defence.
I have been under the character of an honest man, I never did any thing to prejudice mankind in my life, I was coming through the change to see for a wine merchant, the gentleman's handkerchief was hanging out of his pocket, and by the pressing of the croud, the handkerchief came upon my arm, so I took it in my hand; and the gentleman came and took hold on me.

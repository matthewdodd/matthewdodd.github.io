JOHN MARRS. I am servant to John Robert Green, who keeps the Bull's Head, Peter-street




. The prisoner came in on the 28th of January, in the afternoon; I was in the yard - he opened the kitchen door, looked in, pulled the door a little too, and looked round to see if he was watched -I saw him take some candlesticks, which he found were too big to put into his basket; he put them down, took three small ones, and went out with them in his basket, into the yard, from the tap-room - I went and told Mr. Green, who came; he shoved Mr. Green down, and ran away - I ran after him, and secured him not far off; he had left the basket behind, with the candlesticks in it.(Property produced and sworn to.)

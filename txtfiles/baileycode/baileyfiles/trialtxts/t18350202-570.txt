NEWSOM GARRETT
. I keep a shop in Commercial-road. These trowsers were hung outside my door—they could not be got down without a ladder—the string was broken, and a nail almost pulled out—I saw the prisoner, and watched him for about half-an-hour—he was walking backwards and forwards—he came and snatched the trowsers down, and ran down the road, and down Berner-street—I pursued him with Chapman, who took him—"he threw the trowsers down.





SAUL GEORGE CHAPMAN
. I saw the prisoner pull the trowsers down—he doubled them up—I went with the prosecutor, and took him.
(Mary Mead, and George Clark, a weaver, of No. 15, Cutter-street, gave the prisoner a good character.)




GUILTY
. Aged 18.—


Transported for Seven Years.

WILLIAM PAXTON. I live at No. 9, New-terrace, Kensington


, and am a baker
 - the prisoner was servant
 to Mr. Edwards, a fishmonger, next door but one. About nine o'clock one night, about three months before Christmas, I lost my watch and seal from a nail over my parlour fire place - I had seen it safe in the course of the day, and the prisoner had been in the house that day for bread. I did not find it till the 3d of May.

            . I am a constable. I took the prisoner into custody on the 3d of May, on another charge; I searched her, and upon the top of the calf of her right leg I found this watch, seal, key, and knife; they were tied in a piece of flannel, and confined between two garters.

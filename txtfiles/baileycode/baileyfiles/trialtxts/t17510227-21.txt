            . I am wife to the prosecutor. I hung the coat with the other things in the pockets up behind the door in the entry. On the 15th of this month I went accidentally to the shop door, and there I saw the prisoner stand; it was gone betwixt six and eight o'clock in the morning. I had some knowledge of the prisoner, for I once met her by Aldgate, and she ask'd me if I would have my fortune told. I went into Rosemary-lane, and the first woman I met with was the prisoner with the coat in her apron. The things were not in the pocket when I found it again.
Prisoner's Defence.
I met an old woman who desired I'd go and pawn this old coat of her son's for her, saying she should be obliged to me. I went along with it, very innocently ; and I met with this good woman, who said it was hers. Said I, if it is yours take it, I never wrong'd man, woman, or child in my life.

JOSPEH BAYLIS
. I live in High-steet, South wark. On the 18th of November, I was in Aldgate, and near the end of the Minories, I felt a twitch at my pocket—I immediately turned, and saw the prisoner close behimed me—I caught him immediately, and said, "You have my handkerchief, you thief"—I pressed him against a door saw him put his

hand behind him, and throw the handkerchief down in the cormer—he said that a boy, who gone before, had done it—there was a boy in his company, who passed me—I caught him at the same time, but finding this prisoner had the handkerchief, I let the other boy go—an officer came up, and I gave him the prisoner and the handkerchief—It has my intials on it.

Prisoner. The handkerchief was lying on the ground—It was not on me. Witness I saw him throw it down, and took it up myself.





JOHN BRYANT
. I was passing on the 18th of November—I saw the prisoner and Mr. Bryant in the lobby of a shop—I saw Mr. Bryant try to put his hand into the prisoner's pocket to search him—he turned from him—he put his other hand, and the turned again, and dropped this handkerchief.

Prisoner's Defence. I am a shoemaker. I know nothing of the handkerchief.

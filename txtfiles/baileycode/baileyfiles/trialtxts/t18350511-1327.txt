1327. 




HENRY MELLISH
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
20th of April, 1 handkerchief, value 1s., the goods of 



William Hogg, from his person.






WILLIAM HOGG
. I live in Queen-street, Horsleydown. I was at Greenwich fair on Easter Monday, between two and three o'clock—I did not feel my handkerchief taken—the constable tapped me on the shoulder and showed me my handkerchief—I am sure it is mine—I had been in the fair about three quarters of an hour.





WILLIAM DYKE
. I am a policeman. I was in the fair about a quarter-past two o'clock, and saw the prisoner following the prosecutor, who had a friend with him—the prisoner was alone—I saw him poll the handkerchief about three inches from the prosecutor's pocket at first, and when he got about twelve or fourteen yards further, I saw him take it out entirely—I caught hold of him directly, and he dropped it on the ground—I detained him—there wat not much crowd then—he denied the charge.





WILLIAM HOGG

re-examined. I know the handkerchief to be mine, by a little hole in the middle, and the letters "W. H." in the corner.

Prisoner's Defence. I heard that Mr. Shillibeer wanted an omnibus-man, and went to Greenwich—I wat at the fair, but was never in custody before.




GUILTY
.* Aged 24.—


Transported for Seven Years.

Third Jury, before Mr. Sergeant Arabia.

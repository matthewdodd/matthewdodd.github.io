                  Plumridge 
               



             deposed, that the House was broken through, and a Window, that there were four of them who did it; that two Men came to her Bedside with Pistols, threatning to shoot her if she did not discover where her Father's Money lay; broke open several Locks in her Room, and took what they pleased; she telling them she did not know of any Money, they went away to Search in other Rooms, threatning her that if they found any Money they would certainly kill her. Then they went into the Maid's Chamber and broke several Locks there, took what they pleas'd, and threatned her if she made any Noise they would murther her. then they went into her Father's Room, an ancient Man of Fourscore Years of Age, and threatned him to make him discover where he had any Money, and fired a Pistol at him which discharged a Buffer through a Flannel which was wrapp'd round her Father's Head, and though it did not go through his Head, yet it hurt his Forehead and fetch'd some Blood: that then one of them came into her Chamber again, and took her Pocket which hung by the Bed side, wherein was about 19 s. and put it in his Pocket: that after they had been in the House about two Hours they went away, carrying with them what they thought fit: But she being in a Fright could not swear positively the Prisoner was one of them.

             deposed, that two Women lodg'd in her House, to whom 
               
                  Patrick 
                  White 
               



             and 
               
                  Matthew 
                  Hunt 
               



             used to come, and owing her some Money, and she urging them to pay her, they desired her to be patient telling her there was an old Man lived at Hammersmith where was only his Daughter and the Maid in his House, that he had a great deal of Money, and they were to go thither, and would soon pay her, saying there was another or two to meet them: to which she reply'd then perhaps they'd be taken and hang'd: That the next Morning about ten a-Clock, a Sack was brought in by the other Men and the Prisoner full of divers sorts of Goods, several of which she saw, and two Silver Spoons and a Cup which was given her to sell to pay her her Debt, which she did sell; that the Spoons were marked with the first Letters of the Prosecutor's Name, one of which she got from the Goldsmith again, and was produc'd in court, and owned by the Prosecutor, as was the Sack the Goods were in, and some other things: That when they were in the Room (the Prisoner being present) she heard one of them say, how hardy the old Dog was that would not tell where his Money lay, though we shot at him. That she not knowing where the Robbery was committed, goes to Covent-Garden Marker, and upon enquiry found out where the Prosecutor liv'd and gave him notice. The Prisoner call'd several Evidences to prove that he being a Grenadier was then upon Guard at the very time that the Robbery was committed, but the Evidence not satisfying the Jury they 


               acquitted him of the Burglary, but found him guilty of Felony
            . The bringing of the Goods to Conners House, and the Prisoners being one of them was confirm'd also by another Evidence.

            . I live in Goswell-street


. I lett the prisoner a ready-furnished lodging on the 28th of April, and he asked me the next morning for a pen and ink to go to write a letter. He went up, came down again and went out. We found immediately he had taken the things laid in the indictment. He was pursued, and taken with the things upon him.

I came from Hertfordshire. I had no money, and I took the sheets in order to pawn them till my things came up by the waggon. I meant to fetch them out again.

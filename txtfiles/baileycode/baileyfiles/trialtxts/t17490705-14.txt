, near Round Court


, the 16th of May about eleven at night, I felt my periwig going from my head, upon which I clap'd my hand to my hat to save that, I turned and saw the prisoner at the bar, with my wig in his hand; he run, I pursued him, crying stop thief! he did not run above a hundred yards before he was stop'd; he was never out of me fight, and it was a very moon-light night; he ask'd me what he had done, I told him he had rob'd me of my periwig; he had drop'd it between his legs, and I took it up.
Prisoner's Defence. I happened to be coming by at that time, being a little way up the Court, I heard somebody cry, stop thief! I happen'd to light of the wig that lay there; there were two men laid hold of me, I knew nothing of the wig.

ELIZABETH BRANCH
. I am the wife of John Branch, a bookseller in

Plumbers'-row. On the 25th of March, between five or six o'clock in the evening, I was in a room behind the shop, and saw through a crevice the prisonercome and take five books, he put them under his coat, and went away—I told my husband—he went and brought him back—I am sure he is the man.

Prisoner. I was looking at the books—I took none—it was forty or fifty yards from where she was. Witness. It might be twelve yards.





PHILIP BUTTERY
. I was passing at the time, and saw the prisoner throw the 'books in at a pawnbroker's shop, but I did not see him take them from the stall—Mr. Branch took him.

Prisoner. The pawnbrokers have shut up these six months. Witness. The door was open, and he threw them in.

Prisoner. I was merely looking at the books—I went away, and Mr. Branch came and collared me—I came back, and some one brought in the books.




GUILTY
.* Aged 21.—


Transported for Seven Years.

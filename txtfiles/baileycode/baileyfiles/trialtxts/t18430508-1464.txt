1464. 




SUSAN TAYLOR
 was again indicted

 for stealing, on the 
21st of April, 2 spoons, value 14s., the goods of 



William Hazlewood.






SAMUEL LAURENCE
. I am footman to William Hazlewood, Esq., of Upper Gower-street. On Friday, the 21st of April, about seven o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came to the house, and wanted to wait to see Miss Hazlewood, who was not at home—I asked her to walk in—I had seen her once before—next morning I missed two silver spoons from the kitchen she had been sitting in—these are them.





JAMES STEWART
. I am a pawnbroker. To the best of my belief these spoons were pawned by the prisoner, on the 21st of April, about seven o'clock in the evening—here is the counter duplicate.





JANE JOHNSON
. I am searcher at the station. I found nine duplicates on the prisoner, and gave them to the officer.





WILLIAM HOLLAND
. I am a policeman. I received the duplicates from Johnson—one corresponds with the one the pawnbroker has produced.




GUILTY
. Aged 26.—


Transported for Seven Years.

(There were three other indictments against the prisoner.)

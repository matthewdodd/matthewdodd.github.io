MR. SAMUEL GARDENER. I live in Upper Charlotte-street, and am a merchant

, going to the theatre - the officer gave me information by St. Bride's church - he had my handkerchief in his hand, and was holding the prisoner.

            . I am a lapidary. I was on the opposite side of Fleet-street, and observed the prisoner in company with two others, following the prosecutor, and trying his pockets several times. I saw Hesketh, and told him I saw the prisoner take the handkerchief from the pocket and put it under his coat; I ran over, collared him, and said, "You won't leave this gave off;" his companions ran away in different directions. I took the handkerchief from him.

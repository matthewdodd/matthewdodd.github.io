            , who is a bricklayer's labourer
, we live at No. 8, Field-lane


; our son John was six months old, on the 6th of this month. I had the prisoner in the house as a servant
 for six weeks, and gave her a shilling a week, and her board. On the 19th of July, I went to market to sell my things, and left her in care of the child, she went away, and took it forty-three miles; I advertised her in three papers, and had 400 bills printed - she kept it twelve days; it had a coat and a black beaver hat on,

            . I keep the George, at Brickhill. The prisoner brought the child to Brickhill, and took private lodgings, and was taken extremely ill; her landlady applied to me as overseer, for medical assistance; the medical gentleman found her in a dangerous state - she was speechless for twelve hours. When she came to herself, I believe, the woman taxed her with stealing this child. She had been stopped at Hockliff on suspicion. She acknowledged stealing it, and said it belonged to

            , of No. 8, Field-lane. I gave the child in charge of the woman until I ascertained the fact, by sending the guard of the Cobourg coach to enquire, and on the 30th the prosecutrix came down, and took it to London.

            . The prisoner was given into my charge. I took a coat and hat from her in town, which the prosecutrix claims - she had it on.

                  BRADY
               



            . I have the child here; I got it from Brickhill - it was in a very bad state. When I found it its two hands were in its mouth, and it was quite forced with screaming. It was not weaned when it was taken - I understood she used to give it her empty breast, to pass as a mother. I had no dispute with her, I believe she is single.
Prisoner's Defence. I was taken in a fit, and did notknow where I was - I sent her a letter to come for the child.

WILLIAM HOFFRATH
. I am watchman to the London Docks. On Tuesday, the 21st of October, I saw the prisoner at the Shadwell-gate of the Docks—I asked him where he came from—he said, from the Claphyra, which he belonged to—I told him he could not come out with his clothes, and I proposed to take him on board the ship—he had a bundle containing a jacket and pair of blankets—when I got him to the ship, I asked the first officer if he belonged to it—he said, "No"—I called the people in, and Thomas claimed the clothes.


Prisoner. I told him they belonged to a man whom the hammock belonged to Witness. No. he said they were his own.





JOHN THOMAS
. I am a mariner on board the bark Claphyra. On Tuesday, the 21st of October, we came into the basin of the dock, and I saw the prisoner in the basin—this jacket is mine—I did not give him authority to take it—I know nothing of him—I had left it in my berth in the forecastle—the prisoner had no business on board.





JOHN CELER
. I am a seaman on board the Claphyra. This blanket belongs to me—the prisoner had no authority to take it—I did not see him on board—I saw him standing on the quay as we hauled into the dock.
(The prisoner put in a written defence, stating that he had found the jacket in the dock basin.)




GUILTY

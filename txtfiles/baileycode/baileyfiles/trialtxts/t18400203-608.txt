ELIZABETH RODDICK
. I am the wife of William Roddick, and live in Old Pye-street, Westminster. The prisoner lodged in a back house of ours for six months—we furnished her room—last Tuesday week I missed a sheet and blanket from it—these are them—(looking at them)—the prisoner had left without giving us notice, and had not paid her rent—I do not know how she got her living—when I found her out she said she had not left.





WILLIAM CORNISH
. I am a policeman. The prosecutrix came to the station-house for a constable—I went with her to the house, and found the duplicate of the property on the prisoner—I went to the pawnbroker's, and there found the property.

Prisoner. I leave myself to the mercy of the Court.

. The prisoner came into my house between eight and nine o'clock last Monday night. He called for a pint of beer, and sat some time over it; he paid for it and went away. My boy cried out, He has got a cheese. I pursued and took him with the cheese in a sack on his back. There were eleven cheeses on a table in a box, near where he sat. I had put the bill of parcel under the uppermost cheese, hanging a little out. When I looked, the bill was lying down, and the uppermost cheese gone. They were all marked T M The prisoner pretended he did not know how it came in his sack.
Prisoner's Defence.
A man came in and desired me to carry that cheese for him. I took it to carry, and the man here came and brought me back.

FRANCIS HARRISON.
 I am mate of the Malta, which was in the Thames, at Wapping. On 11th March, a little before daylight, I awoke, and saw Johnson, on his knees, at my chest—he did not belong to the ship—he had no business there—he put the light out directly—I found a quadrant, a pair of trowsers, and two waistcoats beside the chest—they were safe in it when I went to bed—I missed my watch from under my pillow; it has not been found—these things are mine (produced)—Waler had no business in the hold—I never saw him before.





JOSEPH SMITH
 (Thames-policeman, 71.) I went on board about four o'clock in the morning, and found Johnson in the cabin—I asked what he was doing, and what he had about him—he said, "Nothing"—I searched him, and found this powder flask, two silk handkerchiefs, and knife on him.





GEORGE JOHN BRIDGES
 (Thames-policeman, 47.) I found Walker on a beam in the hold, without his shoes—which were in a barge by the vessel—I searched him, and found some things of his own—I found a lot of things strewed about the cabin.

Walker. Q. How long was it after Johnson was taken? A. About ten minutes.

Johnson's Defence. A man in blue asked me if I wanted a job, and took me on board; I was not on my knees at the chest, I was standing up

Walker's Defence. I was sleeping in the barge; it rained, and I went into the ship's hold.





JOHN IRWIN
 (policeman, L 54.) I produce a certificate of Walker's conviction—(read—Convicted Sept., 1847, and confined three months)—he is the man.

JOHNSON—


GUILTY. Aged 21.—



Confined Six Months.

GUILTY. Aged 18.—

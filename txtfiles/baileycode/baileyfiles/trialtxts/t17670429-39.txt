            . I am a carpenter
; on the 25th of February (the indictment has the date wrong) I lost the things mentioned in the indictment, from where I was doing business, in Queen-Anne-street, Marybone


.
A witness. I am a carpenter, and buy and sell brokery goods. The prisoner came to me and said, brother chip, will you buy a saw. I am going into the country, and want money; I gave him half a crown for it.

            . I was at work in the Minories; the prisoner came to me, and offered a pannel-saw to sell; I said, is it your own: he said, he was as honest a man as any in the world; he said he was at work in Rosemary-lane; he had a good many tools in a bag: I followed him; he went into a public-house, I followed him in; he put the tools down and ran away. Then I advertised them; after that the prosecutor came and owned them; there was a tennant-saw, two smoothing-planes, an oil-stone, a plough, a stock, a hammer, and a pair of pinchers.

Prosecutor. They are all my property.
Prisoner's defence.
I met a person, we went to drink in King-street, Golden-square; he had these tools on his back, he desired me to take and sell them for him.

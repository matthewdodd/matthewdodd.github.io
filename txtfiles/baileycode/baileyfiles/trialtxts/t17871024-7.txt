The prisoner came to our house on the 25th of last month as a gentleman's servant
 out of place, he only lodged there three nights; the night he did not come home, we missed the things; he told us, he was going to Astley's, and should not come home, but he always left the key of his lodging before; that night he took it, we missed the things mentioned in the indictment.

             sworn.
The prisoner came to lodge as a young man out of place; on the night he went away, he said, I am going to Hughes's to see the performance; I have an acquaintance I shall sleep with, I shall not return till the morning; I gave him the key of the door to take what he wanted, he did not bring the key back again, which he always did before; I had to make his bed, his not bringing the key, I had a suspicion there was something amiss; that night I went up stairs, and knocked at the door, and the lodgers in the next room, said, they believed he was gone to bed; I did not know he was gone out, because he had not brought me the key; I had not made the bed that day before; I had no opportunity before six in the evening, when my husband came home, that is the time I always go up to make the bed; I missed out of the room, four gowns, a blue silk for one.
How came they to be in his room? - They were in a box standing in the room, there were several boxes standing one upon another, the box was locked to the best of my knowledge; when I went in that night it was open; I also missed the child's robe, there were two silk gowns, a cotton gown, a linen gown, and a black silk gown trimmed with love, they were all in the same box; we sat up all night, thinking he might come back; the next morning about seven, or half after, he came back; when he came in, he said, good morning to you; I said, good morning to you, how did you like the performance at Astley's? very well, he said, I have taken the key of the door by mistake; I said, it was all very well; then he said, the passage door was fast, I cannot get through; I told him, he might go through the parlour, which he did, and I followed him up stairs; when I came into the room, he was standing at the window, untying a handkerchief with dirty linen; I said, I am come to take something out of one of these large boxes; I listed off one of the boxes for that purpose, and I lifted up the lid of the box, and I said; mercy! here is my box open'd, and my clothes gone; I knew that before; then I took hold of him by the collar, thus, and taxed him with them, and he immediately said; do not make any hurry, and I will bring you your things again; then a neighbour,

I live with Mr. John Lane, in Drury-lane; I took in a silk gown for 15 s. on the 25th day of September last, about eight in the evening; he said, it was his wife's; he pledged it in the name of Walton; I am positive he was the man that pledged it; I never saw him before, but I took very particular notice of him; I took nothing else of him; this is the same gown, I have had it ever since the constable came with some duplicates and found it.

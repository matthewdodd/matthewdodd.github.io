            . I am a coach-maker. On Saturday morning, the 2d of March, between nine and ten o'clock, I saw the prisoner in Upper Thornaugh-street, with a young woman; I took them both, the woman had pots about her, which were not flatted; I took a pint pot from the prisoner's hat, and another from his waistcoat.

            . I live in Sambrook-court, Basinghall-street. On the 30th of December I sent a parcel by my clerk, directing him that it should go to the Saracen's Head for the coach; I did not pack it up, but I saw it when it was opened - it contained an abstract of a title which I have now in my hands: I am an attorney; I saw it again before the Magistrate - the prisoner was then in custody.
THOMAS FELGATE. I am a book-keeper at the Swan with Two Necks, Lad-lane;

                  Waterhouse
               



             and Co. keep it. On the 30th of December, between one and two o'clock, I received a parcel, directed "Messrs. Jervis and Co., Hinkley, Leicestershire," and booked it; it was given to the porter to take to the coach - the prisoner was a stranger in the yard; I was fetched from the office into the yard about five or ten minutes after I had given Thurlow the parcels; I saw the prisoner standing by the Hinkley coach-door, and the guard holding him - he charged him with abstracting this parcel from the coach; he said he was only standing by there.
Prisoner. Q. On which side of the coach was I standing? A.On the near-side, the left side; I was coming across the yard when I saw you - you were standing by the near fore-wheel of the coach.
JOHN THURLOW. I am a porter at the inn; I convey the packages from the booking-office to the different coaches. On the 30th of December I took this parcel out of the office, and put it at the bottom of the coach with others: I put it at the bottom of the coach - I put the off-side door too; the prisoner, who was quite a stranger, was on the near-side of the coach - I put the off-side door too; the prisoner, who was quite a stranger, was on the near-side when I saw him; I did not see the near-side door open then - I told the guard I had better begin to load the fore-boot; I got up on the box to do so; I had not observed the prisoner then - I put the luggage into the boot as the guard gave it up to me, and I heard the guard call out to the prisoner,"What business have you there?" I did not hear him give an answer; the guard jumped over the pole, and said, "You have got a parcel under your arm" - I did not see it under his arm myself; the guard brought the parcel from the near-side of the coach to shew it to me -I could not see where he took it from; the prisoner stood at the side of the coach: I am certain I had put the parcels at the bottom on the off-side, and closed the door; I put it down at the bottom, not under the seat - this was a quarter of an hour before the coach would set off; the guard and the prisoner walked across the yard to the book-keeper - the guard had not laid hold of him; the book-keeper came out - the prisoner had a large bag on his shoulder when I saw him by the side of the coach; it appeared to be empty: he was taken into custody.
Prisoner. Q. How many parcels did you put into the coach? A. About seven or eight; I did not count them - I put this one on the top of the others at the bottom of the coach, where the people's feet go; I put them there for the guard to sort them.
JONATHAN COOK. I am guard of the coach. The prisoner was a stranger to me, and a stranger at the yard; I observed him against the pole of the near-side door of the coach - the door was then open; there was no other person near that I could observe: I asked what he was doing there - he said nothing at all; he had a bag over his shoulder - he did not appear to have any thing in it: after.I spoke to him I observed this parcel under his left arm -I asked what he did with it; he went to the coach-door, and threw it into the coach - I did not know what it contained; I am sure I took the same parcel from the coach - this is the cover of it; it is directed "Messrs. Jarvis and Power, solicitors, Hinkley, Leicestershire" - I sent to the book-keeper to come out, and told him he had taken a parcel; he said he could take his solemn oath he had never meddled with it: an officer was sent for, and he was taken - he did not tell me what brought him into the yard.
Prisoner. Q.Did you see me take it out of the coach? A. No - I might be three-quarters of a yard or a yard from the near fore-wheel; when I saw you, you were just opposite the door, as it stood open.
Q. If I had a parcel under my arm, what occasion had you to ask what I did at the coach? A. I did not perceive the parcel under your arm till I spoke to you - you had the bag over your arm, and the bag did not quite cover it; it did not cover any part of it: there were seven or eight parcels in the coach; I did not say at Guildhall there might be nine or ten.
MR. GREEN. This is the cover of the parcel.

            . I am an officer. I took charge of the prisoner for stealing a parcel from the coach; he denied having taken it: I asked what brought him into the yard - he said he had no business there, curiosity brought him there, merely to see the coaches load; seeing that he had a black bag, I asked what he dealt in - he said he was a dealer in old clothes: I found 1s. 3d. on him - there was nothing in the bag.
Prisoner's Defence. Does it seem feasible, that if I wanted to steal the parcel I should take the smallest, when I could have taken others much more handy, and from the shape it is evident it could be of no value.

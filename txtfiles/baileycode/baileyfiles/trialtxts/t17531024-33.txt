            's house; he lived with her sometimes, he carried them there; I was present at the time, we threw them down, and said, we got them last night, we asked her to go out and sell them ; she said, she could not, but she would get a girl to go out with them; she knew what we went out a doing, and had seen what we used to bring into her house ; we told her we did steal them.
Q. Who told her so?
Degen. He, the prisoner Fairbrother, told her so; she put them under her bed; we threw some of the shoes over Bridwell Bridge ; and sold an apron full for a shilling.
Q. Were they all shoes?
Degen. They were all shoes; he had a pair of them himself upon his feet.

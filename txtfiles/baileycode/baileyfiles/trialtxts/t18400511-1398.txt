 was indicted

 for stealing, on the

Samuel Vale.






SAMUEL VALE
. I am a fruit-salesman, at Covent-garden. On the 5th of May I bought eight baskets of radishes—I left them on my stand, about half-past nine o'clock at night, packed up—I returned about five o'clock hi the morning, and missed one basket—I afterwards found it at the station-house—this is it—(produced)—I have frequently seen the prisoner about the market.





WILLIAM REID
. I am errand-boy to Mr. Hodson, in the Haymarket. On the 5th of May, between ten and eleven o'clock at night, I saw the prisoner carrying the basket of radishes, and another lad by his side—I followed them into Bedfordbury, where they pitched them—I told the policeman, and they both ran away—we waited there some time—I saw the prisoner standing at the top of Bedfordbury, and gave him into custody.





GEORGE HOLLIS
. I am a policeman. Reid gave me information, and I saw the basket in Hop-gardens—I remained there a short time, and was taking it to the station-house, when Reid pointed out the prisoner, and I took him into custody.

Prisoner's Defence. I was coming from Hungerford-market, where I am a porter, and in New-street I saw two policemen with the basket—Reid said, "That is one," and the policeman took me—I am not guilty.





WILLIAM REID

re-examined. I have not a doubt of him—I knew him well before, having seen him in the market.

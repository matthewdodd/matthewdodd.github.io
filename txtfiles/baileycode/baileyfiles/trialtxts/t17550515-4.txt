                  Barnet 
               



            . On Tuesday the 29th of April, about nine in the evening, I was near the pump in St. Paul's Church-yard


, I felt something tug at my right-hand pocket, and the prisoner jostling me at the same time I took hold of him, and saw him deliver something to another boy, who ran away towards Cheapside. I took the prisoner to an alehouse on Ludgate-hill till the watch was set, and before the constable charged him; he owned he took my handkerchief out of my right-hand pocket, and before the alderman owned the same, and that he used to sell all he stole to one Balendine in Rag-fair.
The prisoner in his defence said he did not see or meddle with the prosecutor's handkerchief.

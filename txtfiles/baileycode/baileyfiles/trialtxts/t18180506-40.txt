. On the 25th of April, about half-past eleven o'clock at night, as I was shutting up, I saw the prisoner go into the shop - I got in as soon as I could; he asked me if I had any second-hand braces to sell? I told him I had some new ones at 18d. a pair - He said they were too dear. He was going out, I suspected him, and asked him what was under his apron? laid hold of him, and found eight yards of kerseymere between his legs. I gave him in charge.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

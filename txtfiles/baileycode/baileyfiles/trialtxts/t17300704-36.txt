            , of Christ-Church, Spittle-Fields


, was indicted for 


               feloniously stealing two Silver Snuff-Boxes, a Ring, and other Goods
            , the Property of 
               
                  
                     Jonathan 
                     Haskins 
                  




                
            , the 11th of June
 last.
It appear'd by the Evidence, that the Prisoner was a Wet Nurse
 in the Prosecutor's House, and carried the Goods at several times to pawn; that the Pawnbroker suspecting her, sent Word to the Prosecutor, and he came and owned the Goods; that he examining her, she own'd the Fact, and said, she pawn'd them to raise Money to pay a Debt of her Husband's, deceas'd: But this she deny'd upon her Trial, alledging, that she pawned them by the Order, and for the Use of the Prosecutor while he was Sick; but this Plea not seeming probable, she made use of another Plea, viz. That the Prosecutor had given her the Goods to pawn to have carnal Copulation with her; but this also not being believed, the Jury found her 


               Guilty to the Value of 10 d.

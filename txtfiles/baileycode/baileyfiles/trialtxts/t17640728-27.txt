            . On the 24th of this instant, I lost a handkerchief, coming out of the 'Change-gate


: I felt the prisoner put his hand in my pocket, and take out the handkerchief; I took hold of his arm and charged him with it; he dropped it immediately, from under his coat: I got assistance, and he was secured. (Produced in court, and deposed to.)
Prisoner's Defence.
I am innocent of it. While the gentleman was talking to me, another man came up, and said, Sir, is this your handkerchief; he said it was; and he gave it him.

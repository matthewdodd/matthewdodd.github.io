            . I live in Middle-street, Cloth-fair, near Smithfield





, I am an apothecary
. On the 16th of November, about half an hour after six o'clock, I was in the shop. I went backwards and took the candle with me. I returned again in about ten minutes. I found three drawers open, and the things mentioned in the Indictment gone. [ mentioning them all.] A woman had been in the shop, and went out and left it open.
Q. Have you heard of any of the goods again?
Sparrow. I have met with some of them. South being taken up for another fact, I went to him in Newgate. He told me he and Farrel came into my shop at that time and took the things, and put them into Barker's apron, and went into a publick house in Long lane. That there he wrapt them up in the velvet cloak. From thence to their place of rendezvous in Black-boy alley, and 
               
                  Susannah 
                  Barker 
               



             took the things to a house in Chick-lane, except one cap, and the child-bed linen. The cap was given to 
               
                  Mary 
                  Walker 
               



            , and the child-bed linen to Sarah Cuttoe. Then he called his wife and desired her to shew me Farrel and Barker. I took them both up. They both confest it. I took them all three before the alderman, there they all three confess'd it. 
               
                  Susannah 
                  Barker 
               



             said she had none of the money, but she did carry the things to a house in Chick-lane, and that they were sold for 32 s. South had told me it was a shop next to the gulley-hole. I went there and found part of my things. The velvet cloak, black silk cloak, blue sattin cap, black laced hood, and two napkins, [ produced in court.] They were hid in a feather-bed in a back-room. We cut the sacking to take them out. I think the woman's name is Boulton. 
               
                  Mary 
                  Walker 
               



             delivered the cap to me, and

                  Cuttoe 
               



             delivered the child-bed linen. [Produced in court.]

Eliz. Taylor. I keep a grocer's shop in Barbican







, on the 21st of November I had three Canisters of tea upon my counter, I was taken ill and obliged to go into my parlour. I had not been there above 3 minutes before a young lad called and told me I had been robbed. I went into the shop and missed a canister No. 8. I went to the door and saw Mr. Hill holding the prisoner by the coat. I begged he would secure him. South went to unbutton his coat, then Mr. Hill secured him by his coat and waistcoat. I saw at the time the canister fall from under the prisoner's waistcoat. There was a pound and six ounces of tea in it. [The canister produced in court.]
Mr. Hill confirmed that of securing him, and seeing the canister fall from him.
Prisoner's Defence.
Coming along the street I kicked against something, I stooped and took it up, it was that canister. When I was got about 4 or 5 yards, they took hold on me and asked me where I was going to carry that? I said, What Business was that of theirs? I am going to carry it home.

            . I keep a chandler's shop on one side, and a haberdasher's on the other side
. On Wednesday the 13th of November, I dined at home and served some customers in the shop, then the goods were there. I went out, when I came home, my wife told me I had been robbed of the goods mentioned, and that the wooden till was found in Jewin-street. On the Thursday se'nnight following, we heard Mrs. Taylor had been robbed, and the person taken in the fact. That his name was South, and that when he was examined before alderman Asgill, he owned he was concerned in robbing me, and mentioned the two prisoners, upon whose information they were taken. South and Farrel were brought to Guild-Hall on the Monday. Sir 
               
                  William 
                  Smith 
               



             thought necessary to examine them separate. There Farrel gave information where some of my things were. After that he told me how he committed the robbery. That he came into my shop, being best acquainted with it, (as he was apprentice to a shoemaker near me, and has been in my shop often.) He said to Barker, you may as well tell where the things are. Then she told me that she and a woman whom she called Long Sue, sold the tea chest for 3 s. to one Costers, that keeps the Queen's Head in Chick-lane. That they went to one Ferguson's in Barbican, and pawned the stays for 4 s. and the Spoons and Tongs for 6 s. in the name of Cob. I went there, and upon examining their books, there were a pair of stays pawned in the name of Cob, but were fetched out the next day by the same person that brought them. I inquired after the tea chest, but could get no account of it. The people said they knew the prisoners, and that they had been at their house.

             came and told me, the prisoner was come out of our warehouse loaded with sugar, I saw him walking up the gateway with his coat taken off his back and wrapt up with a bundle in it under his arm, I went and took him in Thames-street and brought him down the Key, and found 15 lb. and an half of sugar, apron and all; he walked very well up, when I brought him down again, he seemed to be in liquor.
Q. Had he been at work with you?
Taylor. No, he had not that day; he occasionally had worked there.

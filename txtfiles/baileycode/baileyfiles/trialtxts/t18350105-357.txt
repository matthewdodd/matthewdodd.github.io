WILLIAM WILLIAMS
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
29th of December, 1 handkerchief, value 3s., the goods of 



Lloyd Llewellyn, from his person.—Second COUNT stating it to belong to a man unknown.






RICHARD LUCKINS
. I am a labourer. About four o'clock in the afternoon, of the 29th of December, I was at the bottom of Ludgate-hill—I saw the prisoner, and watched him—I saw him snatch a yellow silk handkerchief from the pocket of a gentleman, who felt the tug, and instantly turned round—the prisoner bolted directly, passed the gentleman, threw the handkerchief into an area, and tried to make his escape—a policeman close on the spot pursued, and very soon captured him—I never lost sight of him till he was in custody—the gentleman identified the handkerchief with his mark upon it, "Lloyd Llewellyn," which is the name he gave—I don't know what has become of him.





SAMUEL NEAL
. I saw the handkerchief in the prisoner's right hand—he flung it away—I pursued and secured him—I have the handkerchief—the gentleman gave his name as "Lloyd Lewellyn"—I do not know what has become of him—I understand he is gone to Wales.

Prisoner's Defence. I had been over the water—coming up Ludgate-hill, two young men, walking before me, threw the handkerchief into my breast—I tore it from my breast, and that is how it came from me—he said at Guildhall that I drew something yellow from the pocket—now he says it was a handkerchief.




GUILTY

Transported for Fourteen Years.

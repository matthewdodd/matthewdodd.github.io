            . I am a patrol. On the 24th of July, I was with Thompson in Holborn, and saw the prisoner, in company with three or four others, following Mr. Killick and two other gentlemen; the prisoner put his hand into Mr. Killick's pocket and took his handkerchief out; I immediately laid hold of him, he dropped it, and tried to get away; Thompson came to my assistance and picked it up.
Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. It was just by Hand-court. I am certain he is the man - I took him immediately.

            . I saw the prisoner with three or four more, and watched them; the prisoner went up to Mr. Killick, and I saw him draw his handkerchief from his pocket. Gay laid hold of him - We had a terrible scuffle with him.

. On the 5th of October the prisoner hired a bed, and paid me at the bar - he left next morning at a quarter to seven o'clock - my wife sent the girl up-stairs, and the sheets and other property were gone.

            . I am in the prosecutor's service. The prisoner slept in a double-bedded room; I heard him go down-stairs next morning, and saw him go out; I thought he looked rather bulky; I ran up-stairs, and missed two sheets off the other bed - not the one he slept in, and two handkerchiefs; he had broken open the door of an opposite room, and taken a towel.

            . I received the prisoner in charge, in the house, on the morning of the 5th of October - I asked what he had got about him; I found two sheets in his small clothes, with the towel and handkerchiefs; I said,"Is that all?" he took off his hat, and said, "There is another sheet;" I took him to the watch-house, and found these chisels and a phosphorus box in his pocket.(Property produced and sworn to.)
The prisoner pleaded poverty.

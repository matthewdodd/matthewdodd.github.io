             (police-constable N 200). On the 6th of August, in the morning, I was passing a house of Mr. Liscombe's, and observed the sash of the window was moving- I went and gave information to Mr. Liscombe, and he and I and my brother-officer went to the house - they went in at the front, and I went in at the back - we found ten sashes had been removed, and one pane was cut out of the back window - the prisoner was in the house - we took him into custody - I found on him a knife - the blade had putty on it.

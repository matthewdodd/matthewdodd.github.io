 last; and Richard Farthing for being 


               accessary in receiving the same
            . It appeared that the prisoners got acquainted with the Prosecutors Servant, by buying some slips of Buckram of him (which Slips were the said Apprentices Perquisites) and afterwards perswaded the said Apprentice, at several times, to rob his Master of the Goods mentioned in the Indictment, which Beton took out of the Warehouse, and delivered to Farthing at the Door. As the Goods were sold off, they brought the Prosecutors Servant share of the Money; but a piece of Canvas being at last stopt on suspicion, the prisoners were apprehended. The Prosecutors Apprentice confest the Fact, and made himself an Evidence. 

               Guilty of Felony

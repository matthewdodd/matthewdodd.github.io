The prisoner and another man were seen by two of the prosecutor's servants taking coals out of a barge belonging to the prosecutors, into a boat; the other man has not been found since; the prisoner was taken above three months after; the witnesses were positive to him, having known him several years; he had a black dog with him in the boat, which had but one eye, and which they knew before to belong to him.
The prisoner called seven witnesses, who gave him a very good character.

Mr Simmonds. The Prisoner brought these things to me to pawn, she said they were her own Cloaths, and wanted 4 Guineas on them; said I, these Cloaths do not look to be your's, they do not fit you, she said she lived over the way, I would have sent my young Man with her to know where she lived, but she would not let him go, then I had a stronger Suspicion, and sent for Mr Harper the Constable; the Prisoner said she was undone, and owned they were her Mistress's Cloaths; and confess'd she open'd her Drawers and took them out.

            , of S. Dunstan's in the West


, was indicted for 


               privately stealing from the Person of 
                     
                        Tho.

                   two Guineas and Half a Crown
            , on the 28th of November
 last. Tho. Burgess depos'd, that as he was going by S. Dunstan's Church in Fleetstreet


, being indifferently drunk, the Prisoner and another Woman ran full against him, held him fast, and pickt his Pocket in half a Minute. He call'd to the Watch; upon which three or four Men came up, beat him, and threw him down; but the Mob gathering, and the Watch appearing, the Men and one of the Women that assaulted him ran away; but the Prisoner was secur'd, and carry'd to the Watch house. The Fact was plainly proved upon her: But the Indictment being laid for privately stealing, and this appearing to be an open Assault, the Jury found her 


               guilty of the Felony only

            . I am a cheesemonger
, and live at Stoke Newington. I was driving my wife in a cart across Newington-green


, on the 25th of July, towards Islington - there was a shawl laying between us both in the cart, and she had her hand upon it - there was no part of it out at the tail of the cart; I am positive it did not fall out - we sat with our faces towards the horse; the prisoner was driving some sheep - he came and put his hand throughthe rails at the back of the cart, and took out the shawl; I turned my head, and saw it in his hand - he ran away with it; I got down, and chased him some distance - he put the shawl into his hat, and ran off; I lost sight of him - I could not get clear of the sheep; this was on a Sunday afternoon; I saw him again when he was taken, and am sure he is the man.
JOHN VINN. I heard that two persons had been driving the sheep, and on the 7th of October one was taken - he said it was not him, it was the pieman, meaning the prisoner, and the prisoner was then taken.
Prisoner. The prosecutor said I had a long brown coat on.
MR. GANTLEY. No; I said a brown jacket.

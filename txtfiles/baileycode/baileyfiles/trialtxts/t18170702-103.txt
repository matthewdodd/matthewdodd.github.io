            . I am a publican
, and live in Greenstreet, Spitalfields. On the 30th of May, at half-past four o'clock in the morning, I was walking down Whitechapel-road; when I got to Mile-End turnpike


, some people passed me-some pushed me on one side, and some on the other - I was quite sober. Just as one of them had passed me, I saw my watch in his hand, and said, "that man has got my watch - He must have snatched it as he passed me." I did not feel it go, but saw it in his hand before he could conceal it. I called stop thief! and ran after him, the watchman stopped him, and found the watch upon him.
Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. I had got up to take a morning walk. I had not been to Bow Fair.
HENRY SHOOTER. I am a watchman. I had been on duty. I was walking down the road between four and five o'clock in the morning, and heard the cry of stop thief! saw the prisoner running, and several people after him - He was stopped; I saw him throw the watch from his right hand, I picked it up, and took him to the watchhouse. The prosecutor was quite sober.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

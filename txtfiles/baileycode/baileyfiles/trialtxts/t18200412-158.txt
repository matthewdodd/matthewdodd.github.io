            , and live at Limehouse


. I am no business. The prisoner came to my house, on Thursday, the 9th of March, between four and five o'clock in the evening, and asked for lodgings - he was in the house all night. He had breakfast in a back room, and about ten o'clock he asked to go into the parlour to wait for a gentleman whom he expected to meet him there. During the time I went into the room and saw the watch there on the mantle-piece, where I am in the habit of keeping it. It was a silver watch - it had a ribbon, two keys, and a seal to it. He staid there an hour and no one came - he went out and said he should return again before one o'clock. I immediately went into the parlour and missed the property. I ran after him, and saw him running - I called to him to stop for I would have him, and he did. He came back without any force. When we had got back he gave up the watch without any officer. I sent for an officer.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner. I leave my case to the Court.

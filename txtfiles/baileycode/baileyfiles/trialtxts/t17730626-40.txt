Rosannah Row. I live in Nag's-head-yard in New-cross-street


: the prisoner lodged with me. I missed the things mentioned in the indictment; the prisoner confessed she had taken and pawned them; she had lodged with me but four days before she began taking them.

            . I am a pawnbroker in the Hay-market: I have a shirt and two pair of ruffles; I took them of the prisoner on or about the 7th of May. (They are produced and deposed to by the prosecutrix.)
Q. Were they pawned without your knowledge or consent?
Nash. Yes, they were.
Prisoner's Defence.
I was out of place and did lodge at this woman's house; three other people lodged there besides me. I know nothing about the things; I did not pawn them.

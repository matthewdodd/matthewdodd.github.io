CHARLES CONSTABLE
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
7th of March, 1lb. weight of tobacco, value 4s. 5d., the goods of 



Thomas Alexander Mansford.






MARY MANSFORD
. I am the wife of Thomas Alexander Mansford, a tobacconist, in St. John's-lane, Clerkenwell. About eleven o'clock in the morning of the 7th of March, the prisoner came to our shop for a box of Lucifer matches; I served him, and he went out—I returned to my back parlour and an alarm was given—I went into the shop and found about 1lb. of return tobacco was gone out of a jar which stood on the counter—the

prisoner was soon afterwards brought in by a policeman—I believe the tobacco produced is what we lost, it resembles it in every respect.





WILLIAM HANNAM
. I live in St. John's-lane. About half-past eleven o'clock on this morning I saw the prisoner go into the shop to buy some lucifer matches; he went to the corner, turned back, and saw Mrs. Mansford go into the parlour; he then went into the shop and came out with something in his apron—I ran after him and he was taken by a policeman—he threw the tobacco down about a yard from him, and there were the remnants of it in his apron.





JOHN DAWS
 (police-constable G 71.) I heard the cry of "Stop thief,"—I took the prisoner, and picked up the tobacco (producing it.)

Prisoner. I have neither father nor mother, and I have no home: I have been getting my living in this way for two or three years.




GUILTY
. Aged 15.—


Transported for Seven Years.—Convict Ship.

            . I live in Hungerford-street


. The prisoner came to my house for a night's lodging; I let him have one, for which he was to pay a shilling; and he went to bed at about half past ten. The things named in the indictment were let to him with the lodging; he paid me for his bed the night before. He came down at six o'clock in the morning, had a glass of gin, and then went out; and I missed the things in about five minutes afterwards.
JOHN BRADLEY. I belong to St. Martin's watchhouse, and on searching the prisoner, found the counterpane wrapt round his body, and a sheet round each thigh. Here are the things.

            . On Christmas Day, about 3 in the Morning, I happened to meet the Prisoners in Drury Lane


. We went to the Grey-Hound Inn, and went to Bed together, and I am sure I then had my Watch in my Pocket. About 5 in the Morning I 'wak'd, and missed Madam and my Watch too, and upon Examination in the House, I found she had given the Maid a Shilling to let her out, and had left a Hat and a Pair of Stockings behind her. She was afterwards apprehended, and confessed that she had taken it, and given it to one Cummins for a Guinea and a Half. She offered me a Crown in this Man's House not to prosecute her.
Prisoner. A wicked, vile Man; he was as drunk as any Thing, and had other Women before me.

            . The Prisoner confessed the Fact in my House, and said she had given the Watch to Mrs. Cummins, who keeps the Horse-shoe and Rummer in Drury-Lane, for a Guinea and a Half.

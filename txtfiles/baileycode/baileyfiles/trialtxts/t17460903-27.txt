                  Lyon 
               



            ) Do you know the Prisoner at the Bar?
Lyon. I have seen him before; the 19th of June, about four o'Clock in the Morning, I thought I saw him unlocking 'Squire Barber's Door; he was down upon his Knees and looking thro' the Key-Hole; when I saw him I directly ran down Stairs and stepp'd to him; he had got the Escutcheon off the Door; I took the Chisel in his Hand; and he own'd to me that he took an Escutcheon off a Door the Moment before, at the Corner of James-Street: I carried him from thence to the Crown, then we acquainted Mr. Barber's Folks of it before we went before the Justice; we examin'd him before the Constable, and he had 13 of these Brass Escutcheons; we also found a Pick-Lock in his Pocket.


                  Q. 
               


            (to the Prisoner) What have you to say for yourself? Have you any body to call to your Character?
Prisoner. I was a hard working Man and in Liquor.

                  Levenston 
               



            .) What have you to say on the behalf of the Prisoner?
Levenston. I work'd Journeywork with this Man at one Mr. Jones's; he is a Locksmith
 by Trade: That which the Man calls a Picklock is what they always carry about with them.
Court. Very proper to take off Brass Escutcheons.
Levenston. He work'd with one one Mr. Jones on St. Mary-Hill, as I did; he is a Fellow that will get drunk sometimes.

. On the 17th of January, between five and six o'clock in the evening, I was shutting up the shop, and saw the prisoner pass down the mews, which is no thoroughfare; a chaise of my master's stood there. I went down to it, found the cushions unbuckled, and put into the body of the chaise; I watched and saw him come into the mews again, and come out in a minute with the cushions under his arm, and took them from him twelve yards from the chaise.

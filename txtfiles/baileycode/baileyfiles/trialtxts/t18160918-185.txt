JOSEPH SMITH. This cotton was taken away out of my shop, on the 8th of August, between six and seven o'clock in the evening. I was in the parlour when it was taken. I heard the cry of stop thief, and when I got to the door, some man flung a piece of print into my arms. I recollect that that piece of print had been upon the counter at six o'clock.
ROBERT SHEARMAN. I am an officer. I keep a green grocers shop opposite Mr. Smith's, about a quarter past six o'clock, I saw the prisoner walk into the prosecutor's shop about three or four feet, and take the piece of print in question, and put it under his coat. I immediately ran towards him, and he dropped it. Some person picked it up, and gave it to Mr. Smith. I pursued the prisoner, and took him.

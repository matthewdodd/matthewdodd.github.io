            . On the 7th of this instant I found the prisoner in the buildings, or warehouses, at Young's-Key


, he had 18 lb. weight of sugar about him, some under his arm in a lump, and some done up in an apron, so I secured him. Then he went back and shewed me where he took it from, and would have put it in again, it was the property of Messrs. Drake and Long.

             . Ferguson called for assistance, so I went to him and found the prisoner in the warehouse with the sugar; he went to the tub and would have put it in again, it belonged to Messrs. Drake and Long.
Prisoner's Defence.
I went up there for some hoop-sticks and found this sugar tied up in an apron. They met me in the passage, so I went up and shewed them the hogshead it was taken from.

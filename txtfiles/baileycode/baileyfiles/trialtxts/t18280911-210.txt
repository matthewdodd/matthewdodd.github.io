JOHN JAMES RIPPON. I am an ironmoger
, and live in Well-street, Oxford-street


 - the prisoner was my errand boy
. In consequence of suspicion, my clerk, in my presence, marked some half-crowns, shillings and sixpences on the 5th of July; they were put into the till the first thing in the morning - I counted them at twelve o'clock, and they were all right; I counted them again at two o'clock and four shillings were gone - we sent for an officer, and found some shillings on the prisoner, three of which were marked - the other marked shilling has not been found; I produce three which were marked in the same way.

            . I am in the service of Mr. Rippon - what he has stated is quite correct.

            . I was sent for and took the prisoner; I found three marked shillings on him, but I have left them at home.

            . This is the mark I put on all the money; I saw the three shillings taken from the prisoner - they had the same mark on them.
Prisoner's Defence. I was sent at different times to give shillings, and cannot say whether it was marked or not.
MR. RIPPON. He was not sent between the time I saw it right at twelve o'clock, and the time it was missed - I kept a watch on it.

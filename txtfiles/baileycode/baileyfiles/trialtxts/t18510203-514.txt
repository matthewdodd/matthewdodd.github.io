GEORGE THOMAS ROE
. I am assistant to Mr. Richard Attenborough, a silversmith and jeweller, of Piccadilly, in the parish of St. James', Westminster; it is his dwelling-house. On 13th Jan. I was in the shop—the prisoner came in about ten minutes past five o'clock—he said he wanted to look at some guard chains—I took some from the window, and laid eight before him on the counter—he asked if I had any stouter—I said, "Yes," and I went to another part of the shop and returned with two more—I observed that the chains on the counter were displaced, and I missed one—I said nothing, but laid down the two and affected to go to get some more, turned round sharply and saw him in the act of patting another in his pocket—I said, "That won't do, pull those chains out of your pocket"—he said, "What won't do; what chains?"—he tuned from the counter, but I saw his hand go to his pocket, and take out first one chain and then another, and throw them on the counter—I took hold of him, and called for assistance, but be struggled and got away—he was taken by a policeman.





WILLIAM PALMER
 (policeman, A 313.) I was a little way from the shop—the prisoner was given to me by a man—I told him what he was charged with—he said nothing—he bad ten shillings, one halfpenny, and a piece of wax candle on him.




GUILTY

Transported for Seven Years

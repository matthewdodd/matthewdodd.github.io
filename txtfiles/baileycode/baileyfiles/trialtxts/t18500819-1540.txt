HUGH ROBERT DOWNING



, stealing 1 coat, value 30s.; the goods of 



George Wall: having been twice before convicted.






GEORGE WALL
. I am an undertaker, at High-street, Deptford. On 28th

July, I had a funeral at Brockley-lane—I went to the house to dress the mourners, and left a coat in the lower room while we went to Church—we were away about an hour, and as we returned, I met the prisoner with a coat on his arm; I had no idea it was mine; but when I got back to the house, my coat was not there—this is it (produced).





THOMAS SHIRTLEFF
. I lire in Grove-street, Deptford, and am in the employ of the East Country Dock Company. On 28th July, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came to me, and asked me to buy a coat—I did not know him before, but I knew his brother, who is a doctor—he said it was worth 4s.; he had just left the Union, and his brother had given it him; I bought it of him—in consequence of what I afterwards heard, I delivered it to Mr. Wall—I should say this coat(produced)is the same.





JAMES WILLIAM CROUCH
 (policeman, R 361). I took the prisoner on 29th July, at the New-road, Deptford—I told him I wanted him for stealing a coat at Brockley-lane—he said he knew nothing of it, and denied being there—I received this coat from Mr. Wall.

Prisoner's Defence. I was very groggy; I had been in the Union twelve months, where I had had no drink, and the liquor had such an effect on me.





JOSEPH CARPENTER
 (policeman, R 38). I produce a certificate of the prisoner's conviction—(read—Convicted here July, 1848, and confined three months)—I was present—he is the person.





WILLIAM GEORGE OSBORNE
 (policeman, R 13). I produce another certificate of the prisoner's conviction—(read—Convicted here Jan. 1849, having been before convicted; confined eight months)—he is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 45.—


Transported for Seven Years.

 for stealing 5 yards of doe-skin, value 2l., the goods of 



Peter Shield.






WILLIAM BROCKLISS
. I am a tailor, and live in Villiers-street, Albany-road, Camberwell. On the 11th of Oct., 1843, I was foreman to Peter Shield, of High-street, Shoreditch—he had some doe-skin, which I missed from the door—I attended here at a former session, when the doe-skin was produced by Kemp, and 1 swear that was the doe-skin belonging to Mr. Shield, which was lost—here is the ticket which was on it—it has our private mark.





GEORGE KEMP
 (policeman.) On the 11th of Oct., 1843, I was on duty in Shoreditch, and saw the prisoner, and one Freeman, who has since been tried for this, go into Mr. Shield's shop—the prisoner took a piece of doe-skin cloth off the counter, and gave it to Freeman—the prisoner escaped, and has been taken lately by another constable—I produced the cloth at the last trial, after which it was given up to the prosecutor—this ticket was pinned on the cloth at the time—I kept this by me after marking it—I am sure the prisoner is the man that took the cloth.

Cross-examined by
MR. ROBINSON. Q. This was at nine o'clock at night? A. No, between seven and eight—it is twelve months ago—I knew him very well, and have no doubt of him.

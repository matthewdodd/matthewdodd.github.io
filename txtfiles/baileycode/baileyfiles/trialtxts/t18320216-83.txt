            . I am a watch-maker
, and live in Holywell-street


. On the 3rd of February the prisoner came to my shop, and asked to be shown a watch then hanging in my window - it was ticketed 3l. 10s.; I took the ticket off, and showed it to him; after a few trifling remarks he went to the door, and cried out "Hoy! Hoy!" as if he saw some one he knew; he then ran off with the watch in his hand - I and my man pursued him, but I lost sight of him; he was brought to me the same evening by the Policeman - I am quite sure he is the person; I did not know him before, but I looked at him particularly.
Prisoner. When he saw me he said he did not think I was the person. Witness. 
I never said such a word.

            . I am a Policeman. On the 3rd of February I heard a cry of Stop thief! - I drew back, and saw the prisoner run very swiftly across the road; I stopped him, and found this watch in his hand.

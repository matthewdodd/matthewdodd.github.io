THOMAS MARRIOTT
. I keep a public-house in High-street, Bloomsbury. The prisoner was in my service not quite a month—I was induced to take him by a person—he said he had got no money—he was employed to take money at the bar—on the 28th of March I marked four shillings and put them into the till—I missed them—after that I marked other money, and on the 2nd of April I sent for an officer and had the prisoner taken—his box was searched, and 5l. worth of silver was found in one bag, and two papers of silver in another box, containing 2l. and some odd shillings in a purse, 7l. 10s. 10d. in all—among it I found these four shillings which I had marked and put into the till on the Tuesday.





HENRY BERESFORD
 (police-inspector.) I was called, and found these 4s. in the 5l. of silver.




GUILTY
. Aged 18.—


Transported for Seven Years.

            . I live in Cranbourn-Alley


, my husband's name is Gabriel. I was at work with my two apprentices in the parlour, on the 20th of Jan. about three in the afternoon; I look'd through a glass door and saw a little girl take something out of the shop; my two apprentices ran and brought her back, and this piece of gauze; produced in court and deposed to. She desired I'd forgive he, and said she'd never do so any more. This gauze was in the window just before.

            . I was in the parlour with my mistress and fellow apprentice; my mistress said a girl in a brown cloak had stole something. I and my fellow apprentice ran and took the prisoner. She fell upon her knees and beg'd forgiveness; we took the gauze from her, and brought her and that back.

I met a woman with a scarlet cloak, who gave it me and bid me hold it.




               Guilty of stealing, but not privately in the shop
            .

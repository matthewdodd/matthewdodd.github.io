            . I am a constable; I searched the apartment belonging to Sheppard, and found these three keys, a neckcloth, and a pair of stockings (producing them) locked up in his box; he said he was very sorry for what he had been guilty of, that things were very hard with him: (the neckcloth and keys deposed to by the prosecutor.)
The prisoner said nothing in his defence, but called several witnesses who gave him a good character.

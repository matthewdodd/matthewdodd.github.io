            . I am a bricklayer
. I lost a jacket about three weeks ago; I had it in the morning about twenty minutes before twelve o'clock; I pulled it off to load some scaffolding, and put it on some stones in Mr. Stratwood's yard, and left it while I went a short distance, to put some more poles in the cart - I was absent about ten minutes when I heard it was stolen; some persons were running, who cried
"Smith, here is the man:" they had got the prisoner, who they charged as the thief.

            . I saw Smith put his jacket on the stones in the yard - I saw the prisoner go in and take it, and come out with it; I went to him, and he threw it down on the stones - my master took hold of him by the collar.

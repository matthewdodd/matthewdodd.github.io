JAMES BAKER
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
30th of Jan., 1 gelding, price 4l.; the property of 



John Mays; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






ROBERT MAYS
. I am the brother of John Mays—the prisoner worked for me—I had this horse safe on Saturday night, the 30th of Jan., 1842—on Sunday morning I went to the stable, and it was gone—I found it again the same day in Fulham-fields—it was my brother's.

Prisoner. This man knew I was in the country at that time; I used to send letters to him. Witness. No, I did not.





JOHN GREEN
. On Sunday morning, the 31st of Jan., 1842, between six and seven o'clock, the prisoner came to me with a grey horse, to know if I could put him up to bait—I put it in the stable at the Greyhound, Fulbam-fields—I was there when the prosecutor came to own it—it was the same horse.





GEORGE GROSMITH
. I am a horse-slaughterer. An order was sent to our firm to go and fetch the horse—I went, and the prisoner wanted me to sell it.





TIMOTHY WELLS
 (police-constable V 83.) I took the prisoner in Duke-street, Chelsea.

JAMES LIGHT (police-constable B 128.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 19.—


Transported for Ten Years.


Sixth Jury, before Edward Bullock, Esq.

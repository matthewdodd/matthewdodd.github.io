HENRY WEST. I am a salesman

. The prisoner was taken in my shop on the 4th of February, about eleven o'clock in the morning, with these articles; they have my private mark on them; I had seen them on the chest of drawers near the parlour door. I saw her throw them out of her hand.

            . I am nurse to Mrs. West. On the 4th of February I saw the prisoner come in, and put her hand on these things, and then put something under her arm; I went and asked what she had got - she said nothing. Mr. West then came in, and the prisoner threw the coat on the counter, and the two waistcoats behind it.

Prisoner's Defence. I have a small family. I am innocent of the charge; there were plenty of things in the shop if I had a mind to have stolen them - I never touched any of them.

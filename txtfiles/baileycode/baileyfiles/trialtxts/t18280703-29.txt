THOMAS COOK. I am a clerk
 in the Custom house, and live at Brixton. On the 17th of June, about ten o'clock in the morning, I was crossing London bridge on the back of the stage, and a few yards from St. Magnus's church


 I felt a pressure at my outside coat-pocket; I turned round, and saw the prisoner hanging behind the coach with one hand - and saw him in the act of conveying my handkerchief into his bosom; he then dropped from the coach - I stopped the coach; got down, and overtook him about half way across the bridge without loosing sight of him; he ran - I asked him for my handkerchief; he took it from between his shirt and flesh, where it was concealed - and said, if I would forgive him he would never do so any more.

            . I am an officer, and took the prisoner with the handkerchief.(Property produced and sworn to.)



               GUILTY
            . Aged 14.

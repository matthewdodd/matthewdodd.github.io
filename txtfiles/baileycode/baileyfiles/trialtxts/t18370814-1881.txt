1881. 




WILLIAM SMITH
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
8th of July, 1 handkerchief, value 4s., the goods of 




Amos Mulley, from his person.






AMOS MULLEY
. I am a wine-merchant. On the 8th of July I took a cab from Bishopsgate-street—the prisoner was the driver—he put me down at the Peacock, at Islington—a policeman immediately came and spoke to me—I then felt for my handkerchief and it was gone—the policeman after wards produced it to me at the station-house—this is it—I missed it directly I left the cab.






THOMAS PETERKIN
. I am a policeman. I was on duty at Islington, and saw the cab arrive—I was about twenty yards off—I saw the prose cutor get out—he made a stagger backwards, and the prisoner took the handkerchief from his pocket, and put it into his own trowsers pocket—he was standing up in his seat at the time—the prosecutor got out on the near side—the prisoner and the prosecutor both went into the house, and I went and took the prisoner into custody—he was drawing the handkerchief from his own pocket as I took hold of his arm.

Prisoner. Why not take me immediately—it was a quarter of an hour before you told the gentleman? Witness. I took him within five minutes.

Prisoner's Defence. He came and said, "I think the gentleman has lost a handkerchief," and he searched the cab, and took it himself out of the cab—it was not found in my pocket, but in the bottom of the cab on the straw—the gentleman and I were a quarter of an hour drinking together before he came. Witness. There is not a word of truth in what he says.




GUILTY
.—Aged 36. 


Transported for Seven Years.
(There was another indictment against the prisoner.)

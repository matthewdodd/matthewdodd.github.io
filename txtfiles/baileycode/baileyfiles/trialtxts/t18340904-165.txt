            . I live at Esher. On the 25th of August, I was on Ludgate-hill


 - there was a gentleman there whom I do not know, but I saw the prisoner draw the handkerchief from his pocket, and endeavour to conceal it - I seized him, and took it out of his hand - I called for the police, but no one answered - a person came up, and said he was an officer - he took the prisoner - the gentleman went on - I do not know who he was
Prisoner. You and another gentleman caught hold of me, and I said, "Why not call the gentleman back?" - you said, "I don't want any gentleman - I am sufficient to take you," and then the officer came - they dragged me to the watch-house - the keeper would not take me, and then they took me to Fleet-street - this gentleman said he was a barrister, and he could make a case of it. Witness, He wanted me to let him go, that I might go after the gentleman.

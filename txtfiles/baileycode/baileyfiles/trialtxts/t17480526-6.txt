                  Maidley 
               



            . I lost two gowns, one a silk gown, and the other a scarlet camblet.
Q. Where do you live?
Maidley. In Angel-Alley, Little Moorfields


.
Q. Did you find them again?
Maidley. I found the silk gown under her petticoat , as she was going out of the house, and found the scarlet gown upon her back the next day.
Q. Did you lend it her?
Maidley . No.
Q. Had she any cloak, or any thing to hide it?
Maidley . No.
Q. Was she in liquor?
Maidley. She was in liquor.
Q. When you found the silk gown under her petticoat, did you know that the camblet gown was gone?
Maidley. No; but when I found it upon her back, she pulled it off and gave it to me directly.

            . My sister lost two gowns, and the Prisoner was very ready to deliver them back again; for she cried, and said she was heartily sorry for what she had done.
Q. How long have you known her?
Maidley. About five months.
Q. Is she a sober woman?
Maidley. She is not apt to drink much.
Q. What is she?
Maidley. She is in the millenery business, but she has made away with her cloaths, and she cannot get employment in the milliners shops till she can get her cloaths again. I was present with my sister when the scarlet gown was found upon the Prisoner's back; but she was very much in liquor, and had behaved very well before this, and I believe she did not know what she did when she took them.

            . I am mother of 
               
                  Elizabeth 
                  Maidley 
               



            . I am upon my oath. The Prisoner lodged with my son and daughter at this time, and there were drawers open, and she might have robbed them a great many times; and please you, my lord, I will tell you as true as there is a heaven and a God, I take her to be as honest a creature as any in the world; whether it was liquor, or what, or how it came, I cannot tell.




               Guilty, 10 d

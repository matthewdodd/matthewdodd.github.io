            - he is a tobacconist
, and lives in Vine-street


. On the night of the 2nd of June I lost seven snuff-boxes from my window; some of my little children had broken a square of glass, and I had put something against it - I did not see the prisoners.
WILLIAM CLARKE. I stopped the two prisoners close against my own place, trying to lift up a baker's window to get a loaf out; I had lugged the ears of one of them for taking things from my own place - they were then about five minutes walk from the prosecutor's; I took them, and found three boxes on each - they first said they belonged to their fathers, and then that they brought them from Stepney-fields; on our way to the station-house Dawes told me they had taken them from the prosecutor's - I have seen them repeatedly, and have threatened to take them before.

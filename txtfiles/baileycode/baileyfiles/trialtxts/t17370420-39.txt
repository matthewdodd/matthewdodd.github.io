William Shooter. The Prisoner was my Journeyman
 - according to Perriwig-making; the Wigs and these Cloaths were taken out of the House unknown to me the 14th, of March. I suspected the Prisoner; I pursu'd him the 16 of March, and had the good Luck to find him a Bed at 12 o'Clock at Noon; so he confess'd the Robbery, and I got all my Things again.

J. Innocent. I am a silversmith
, and keep a shop
 in Little Newport-street


. The prisoner came into my shop last Saturday, and cheapened a pair of buckles; I asked him 18 s. he bid me 12, and went away; then he came again on the Monday night, and asked to look at different patterns; I shewed him four different patterns; another Frenchman came in (I apprehend one of his accomplices) he said he wanted to sell some gold dust; the prisoner gave the Frenchman his place, and immediately ran out with two pair of silver buckles, I saw him take them; I ran after him, and pulled the other man out of my shop and shut the door; I seized the prisoner near Cranbourn-alley; he begged for mercy, and gave me the buckles, and asked pardon in his language, Monsieur, Pardon. (The backles produced and deposed to.)
Prisoner. I left a guinea and a half on the counter.
Prosecutor. He left none there, neither did he offer me any.

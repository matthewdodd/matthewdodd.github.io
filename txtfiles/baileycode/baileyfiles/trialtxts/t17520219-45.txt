            . On Monday the 24th of January as I was going down Grace Church-street


, betwixt five and six in the evening, I felt a hand in my pocket; I turned round, and took hold of the prisoner, and took him into a shop in order to have him search'd ; a gentleman that was coming along very near me, said he saw the prisoner throw the handkerchief away ; we got a candle, I went out, and found it on the pavement in the street.

            . I saw the prisoner throw the handkerchief out of his hand, I was so near him that his elbow hit me on the breast; I never saw the prosecutor or prisoner before that time to my knowledge.
Prisoner's defence.
The prosecutor took hold on that evidence and me, and carried us both into a shop, there was one run away at the same time, then one went out and brought in the handkerchief.

SIR

                   SOAME
               



             sworn.
On the 8th of July last I was in St. Faith's Church-yard


, I lost a silk handkerchief, I suppose I had seen it in the course of the ten minutes before I lost it.
Q. Then you did not see neither of the prisoners at the bar? - I was told they were behind.


                  THOMAS
                   LEWIS
               



             sworn.
I was in Ludgate-street; I am a truss maker; I saw Sir 
               
                  Peter
                   Soame
               



             and his friend along with him go into a shoemaker's shop directly opposite to my house; I am certain of one, with the red hair, 
               
                  Thomas
                   Cooke
               



            ; I am pretty sure the other is the same, but there is some alteration in his dress, or hair, or something, but I have no doubt of his person, the two prisoners where close at the heels of Sir 
               
                  Peter
                   Soame
               



             and the other gentleman; when they went into the shop, the prisoners loitered and seemed disposed to something; I kept my eye on them, and they separated and got one at each window, and they amused themselves for ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, at last one of them sat down at the private door, then got up and looked into the shop to see if the gentlemen were coming out, as I judged; when Sir 
               
                  Peter
                   Soame
               



             came out with this gentleman, these two men came together and followed them; I saw them several times attempt at his pocket, I don't know whether it was one or both, several times before they got to St. Paul's Church-yard, when they got into St. Paul's Church-yard, one of them, he in the red hair, just as Sir Peter was going between the posts, put his hand into his pocket and took his handkerchief out of his pocket, and immediately rested his arm on the post, there was a gentleman along with me that saw the circumstance; when I came close to him I attempted to take hold of him by the collar, but he caught my eye, dropped down and ran behind the bar to go between the bar and the walls, and while he was running he threw the handkerchief from him; I then turned myself round and took the other as his accomplice; this one that ranby the bar the other gentleman that was with me took, he was bound over to prosecute; Sir Peter was made acquainted with the circumstance, he saw his handkerchief and owned it; we took them to Guildhall, when we came to Guildhall yard I met with an officer, a constable, and he asked me what was the matter with these men? I told him they were pickpockets, and desired he would search them immediately.
Prisoner. Ask the gentleman whether he saw me pick the gentleman's pocket, or found the handkerchief on me?
Court. He says he did, and he says you threw it away.
Lewis. No, it was Mac Ginnis picked it out of his pocket.

                   JOSTLING
               



             sworn.
The prisoners were brought to Guildhall-yard and given charge of to me, and I produce a handkerchief delivered to me before the Lord Mayor.
Court to Lewis. Did you pick up the handkerchief? - No, somebody picked it up and gave it me.
Court to Lewis. Did you pick up the handkerchief? - No, somebody picked it up and gave it me, and I took it to the Lord Mayor. (The handkerchief deposed to.)
Prisoner Mac Ginnis I was going through St. Paul's Church-yard, just by posts I immediately heard the voice saying, there is a young man has picked the gentleman's pocket. I immediately turned round and somebody took hold of me directly; I asked them did I look like any such person? I worked hard for my living; say he, I am authorized so to do by a gentleman; says I, what gentleman? says he, that man; pointing to that gentleman, Mr. Lewis; sir, says I did you give charge of me for robbing any body? it is a false accusation; they immediately took me up to Guildhall before a magistrate and found nothing at all about me; they immediately searched the young man that was with me, and they found three or four handkerchiefs about him, and they committed me immediately, without giving me an opportunity of saying a word.
Prisoner Cooke. I wish to put my trial off, I have got a wife and family, I work very hard for my living; I have not been in London above a twelve month, I came from Rochester, in Kent.

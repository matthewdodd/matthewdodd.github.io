             sworn. - I am a grocer
, in Newgate-street, the prisoner was my porter
: Last Monday week, between eleven and twelve o'clock, or thereabouts, I passed by the prisoner, in a hurry, he was weighing paper; I felt something in his pocket, that I was convinced was sugar, from the feel; he had been at work in the warehouse that morning, beating over sugar; I desired my young man to endeavour to feel it in the same way, and he did all he could to avoid it, for he turned himself on one side when any body passed him; I sent for a constable, and desired him to follow him when he went to dinner; the constable brought him back with the sugar upon him, it was the identical kind of sugar that he had been beating over in the morning; I had often suspected him, but never detected him before.
Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q.Have you any partner in your business? - A. No.
Q. How long has this man lived with you? - A. I think he came the 1st of September.
Q. You had a very good character with him? - A. Yes.
Q.You do not mean to say, that this sugar is not to be had at every grocer's shop in London? - A. It is a very difficult matter to get it exactly the same.
Q. You can make a great number of samples out of one hogshead? - A. Yes; but this was a particular kind of sugar, it is Surinam sugar.
Q. Had you a great many hogsheads of the same sort? - A. Yes.
Q. A vast quantity of course would come from the same country as well as that which you had? - A.Certainly.
Q. The bags, I presume, you cannot swear to? - A. No, they have no marks upon them.

                  PLUSH
               



             sworn. - I am a constable: I was sent for by Mr. Cobb to watch the prisoner; I followed him down Ivy-lane, and almost at the bottom, I stopped him; I asked him if he was not a smuggler; he said, no, he was not; then I told him he had something in his pocket that was not his own; then I went to the Crown public-house, in Cannon-alley, St. Paul's Church-yard; he went to the necessary, and took this paper of sugar out of his pocket, and threw it down; I got it up again with a scraper; then I searched his right-hand pocket, and took this paper of sugar out; after that, we took him back to Mr. Cobb's, and he gave charge of him.
Q. What business had you to take him to the public-house? - A. He would go in there.
JAMES WOODMAN sworn. - I am an officer; I was with Plush, I know no more than he has said.
Court. (To Cobb.) Q. Is that Surinam sugar? - A. It is, it exactly matched with the sugar that he had been beating over.
Q. He told you he had bought the sugar? - A. He did not at first, he did afterwards; he at first said, he had never taken any before, and it was only a little for his own use.
The prisoner left his defence to his counsel.
For the Prisoner.
THOMAS TWINCH sworn. - Examined by Mr. Alley. I am a porter; I know the prisoner very well: Last Monday was a week, I met him in Watling-street, very near the Old-change, and a man that I never saw before, came up to him with some sugar in his apron, and asked him to buy it of him, and he asked me, I told him, I did not know what to do with it.
Q. Should you know it again? - A. Yes, I think I should.
Q.Look at those parcels? - A. They were both in the same coloured bag at that time; this one I can swear to.

Q. When was it? - A. Last Monday week.
Q. At what hour of the day? - A.Somewhere about nine or ten o'clock.

Q. How came he to address you? - A. I do not know, he said he was in distress.
Q. You will swear to that parcel? - A. Yes.

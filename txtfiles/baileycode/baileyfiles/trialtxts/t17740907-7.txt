Stafford Greenway. On the first of August about eleven in the forenoon as I was going up Holborn-hill, a person clapped me upon the shoulder and told me I had lost my handkerchief, and pointed to the prisoner who then was running; I immediately missed my handkerchief; I pursued the boy and cried stop thief! several other people ran after him; I saw a gentleman stop him in Hatton Garden; I saw the prisoner make a motion with his hand, but I did not see him throw any thing out of his hand, being some distance from him; afterwards the handkerchief was handed up to me out of an area in Hatton Garden. (The handkerchief produced and deposed to by the prosecutor).

            . I was standing by St. Andrew's church; I saw the prisoner pick the prosecutor's pocket; I ran after him and cried stop thief; I was very near him till he was stopped; I saw him throw the handkerchief down an area in Hatton Garden, next door to Mr. Taylor's, the oculist; there being no one in the house, a person went over the rails and got the handkerchief, which he delivered to the prosecutor.

I was standing by the church; I saw a mob run; I ran to see what was the matter and was falsely charged with being the person that stole the handkerchief.

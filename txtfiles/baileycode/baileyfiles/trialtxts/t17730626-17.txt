                  Charles
                   Wright
               



            . I live at Hoxton


: I hold a lease of part of a house; there is no communication with the upper part.
Q. What family have you?
Wright. A wife.
Q. Who is 
               
                  Catherine
                   Hyde
               



            ?
Wright. A person I permitted to be in my habitation till she got a place. I am a journeyman taylor
: I go out to my labour daily; I went out on the 7th of May, in the morning; I left 
               
                  Catherine
                   Hyde
               



             in bed; I came home at eight o'clock at night; I went into a large garden at the back of the yard. My wife works with me; she met a gentleman coming home; she went with him a little way, and afterwards she came home; we went up stairs; there a woman brought up an apron, and asked if any body owned it; my wife said it was her property.
Q. Were you all up stairs together at supper?
Wright. Yes.
Q. What o'clock was it when the woman brought up the apron?
Wright. After nine; then Catherine Hyde and I went down to see if my apartments were safe; I found my door open, and the things missing which are mentioned in the indictment, part out of the fore room, and part from the other room; I missed all that night but the bed quilt. I wrote down what things I had lost, and the next morning went and gave information at Justice Wilmot's office; while I was there giving in my information, 
               
                  Charles
                   White
               



             the evidence was brought in, and part of the property upon him. I was ordered to come the Thursday following; I saw a bed quilt, and that I swore to; I did not miss that till the next morning.
Q. Was there any appearance of the door being forced open?
Wright. There was no appearance of any thing being broke as I saw; part of the things were brought into the office upon 
               
                  Charles
                   White
               



            , some others were sold in Fashion-street.


                  Catherine
                   Hyde
               



            . I lodged with the prisoner and his wife; he left me when he went out; I staid at home all the morning and washed my clothes; I went out about one o'clock; I locked the door and took the key with me; I came back about three o'clock; I staid at home all the rest of the afternoon till eight; then I locked the door and went up stairs to the lodgers; I staid all the evening there till Wright and his wife came home.
Q. What time was the alarm about the apron?
Hyde. A little after nine.
Q. Where were your things?
Hyde. A gown and two shifts were folded for ironing; the rest of the things were on the line.
Q. When you came down did you find the door in the same state in which you left it?
Hyde. No; I locked it when I went up stairs, when I came down it was open.
Q. That lock was not broke?
Hyde. No.
Q. Perhaps you made a mistake and did not lock it?
Hyde. Yes, I am sure I locked it; I tried it before I took the key out.
Q. You think you locked it?
Hyde. I am most sure I locked it.


                  Elizabeth
                   Wright
               



            . I came home about a quarter after eight; the door was fast then: there are two steps at the door; I sat upon them and called Kitty; that is the girl's name; she did not answer; I went up stairs with some fish; then a woman came up with my apron.
Q. to 
               
                  Catherine
                   Hyde
               



            . Were your things safe when you locked the door and went up stairs?
Hyde. They were tied upon the line all of them when I went up stairs.


                  Mary
                   Jarvis
               



            . I bought three old sheets and three shifts of 
               
                  Charles
                   Wright

             the prisoner.
Q. When?
Jarvis. It will be three weeks next Friday; I bought them between ten and eleven in the morning; I delivered them up at Justice Wilmot's.

                   Chapman
               



            , the constable, produced the sheets.
Wright. The sheets are mine.
Hyde. These are my shifts; they are marked with my name.
Q. Did you know White and Smith before?
Jarvis. I knew White; he bought a flannel waistcoat the day before; Smith told me his wife was dead; he had buried her and was obliged to sell these things to make up a little money to save his goods; he asked me half a guinea; I bid 6 s. White said he had been bid 7 s. I gave him 7 s. 3 d.
Q. Do you live in Fashion-street?
Jarvis. Yes.


                  John
                   Elliston
               



            . I am a constable: I was sent for by one of our watchmen; he said 
               
                  Charles
                   White
               



             was with a bundle of goods in Leg-alley, near the Ship in Holywell-street, Shoreditch; I went immediately to the house White lodged at; he stood up and said, who do you want? I said one Mr. White; he said his name was 
               
                  Charles
                   White
               



            ; I said he was the person I wanted; I told him he was my prisoner; I took him and the goods to Justice Wilmot's office; I saw the goods and examined him, and he said that they were his property; but the prosecutor had given information before that they were his property.


                  Samuel
                   Chapman
               



            . Mr. Wright came and gave information of his house being robbed; as soon as he had gone down stairs, Elliston brought 
               
                  Charles
                   White
               



             with the bundle; I asked White what he had got in the bundle; he said it was his own, his wife had left him; I asked him if he had got a gown or cardinal; he said yes; I went down to Wright and told him one of the persons that robbed him was taken; the next Thursday following he came up before the Justice to his examination; I went down stairs, but knowing he kept company with 
               
                  Joseph
                   Smith
               



             I went after him; I took him into custody, and brought him to the office the Thursday following. White told where the things were sold; we went to this gentlewoman's house and brought the things.


                  Charles
                   White
               



            . I am a weaver.
Q. What is Smith?
White. A weaver.
Q. How long have you been connected together?
White. I have known him some time, but never to be connected with him.
Q. You were together in this business I understand?
White. I knew the man; I was acquainted with him only a fortnight before this happened. Upon the 7th of this month, in the evening, at the Weavers Arms, Shoreditch, drinking a pint of beer, 
               
                  Joseph
                   Smith
               



             came and asked me if I would go out with him that night; I said I would when the beer was out; I and Lamb Smith went out together to Mr. Wright's, the prosecutor's; when we came there, there was no light in the room and the door was fast; Lamb Smith came back and said the door is fast, lend me the keys; 
               
                  Joseph
                   Smith
               



             had several false keys in his pocket; he gave him the keys; Lamb Smith opened the door; the prisoner went in and I followed him, and brought out as many things as his apron would hold; he went out to the end of the alley; then I went into the room afterwards and brought out some things; I took the things to where I lodged; in the morning the prisoner came to me; we both went out together to this woman's house, where he sold the sheets and three shifts.
Q. What was found in your custody?
White. A gown, cardinal, apron, cap, and half handkerchief.
Q. What became of the bed quilt, and the rest of the things?
White. I had the bed quilt with me; I was carried before Justice Wilmot; nothing was sold but the three sheets and shifts; the stockings were in the handkerchief in the bundle.
Q. How came you to think of robbing such a poor man as this, was he any acquaintance of yours?
White. No; seeing no light in the room and nobody there, he said to Smith, nobody is there, give me the keys.
Q. What time in the evening was this?
White. A little after nine.
Q. Was it dark?
White. Yes, it was.
E. Wright. Here are five pair of sleeves, a cloak, a gown, a stocking and neckcloth; the silk cardinal and the linen gown is the girl's; here are not all the things I lost, nor are they all mentioned in the indictment. Every thing in that bundle belongs to either the girl or me.
Prisoner's Defence.
I met 
               
                  Charles
                   White
               



            ; he said to me, how are you? I said I was going to my master in half an hour's time; I had got some work; he asked me to go with him; I said I could hardly spare the time, but if it would be of service to him I would go for half an hour; as we were walking along he said to me, carry this bundle; he had it under his arm; I did take it, and he went to this woman's, and said he had three sheets and three shifts to sell; he told me before that he was going to a place in Fashion-street, where there was a woman that would buy them; he said will you say these are your's, because this woman knows me, and she will be sorry to think I am in so much poverty; not knowing the things were stolen I consented to do so; he bid me ask the money for the things; I did; she did not give it me but put it upon the counter; I took it up; when she was gone I gave it to 
               
                  Charles
                   White
               



            , as we came out of the door. The property being found upon that man he will swear a man's life away. Butcher, Chapman and Flanagan, when they took me in Crab-tree-row, Hackney, or Bethnal-green, they met with a man; they persuaded the man to swear false against me; 
               
                  Charles
                   Flanagan
               



             touched him on the shoulder, and said, swear against the prisoner, swear against the prisoner, you will not be hurt; the man was dubious; Flanagan stooped down to him, and said, swear against him, I will give you a guinea. I know nothing of the robbery. I have several people to give me a character.
Q. to Elliston. Was you at the Justice's when this man was examined?
Elliston. I was.
Q. Was Flanagan there?
Elliston. White and Smith were there; the Justice asked me to look round if I knew the prisoner; I said I believed I could swear to him; I looked round and swore to him; he swore he would take his oath he never saw me in his life.
Q. Do you remember the prisoner saying any thing to the Justice about Flanagan?
Elliston. No.
Q. to E. Wright. Was you at the Justice's?
Wright. Yes.
Q. Did the prisoner complain to the Justice of Flanagan's wanting men to swear against him?
Wright. No.
Prisoner. Chapman gave Wright written down what he had to swear against me; he has it in his pocket.
Q. to Chapman. Did you write any thing for him?
Chapman. No.
Elliston, the constable. I heard Chapman say that he would give these instructions to White, what he should swear to your lordship, for him to clear himself concerning being an evidence against this Smith.
Q. Where did he say this?
Elliston. At the first public house beyond the blacksmith's shop, towards Clerkenwell-green.
Court. Examine his pockets and see if he has any thing or no.
He is searched but no paper is found.

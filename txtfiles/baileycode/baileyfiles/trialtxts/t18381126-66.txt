GEORGE JOINER
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
16th of October, 1 shirt, value 6s., the goods of 




George Bishop; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






JAMES ALEXANDER
. I live in Lancaster-street, St. Pancras, and am a shoemaker. Mr. George Bishop lives exactly opposite to me—he is a bricklayer-between one and two o'clock in the afternoon of the 16th of October, I was at my street-door, and saw the prisoner put this shirt under his coat, and walk down the street—he took it from a hue in Mr. Bishop's private yard-no one had any right to go there—I gave information about it, and sent a lad after the prisoner—he was overtaken—the shirt was thrown down, picked up, and brought to the station-house.





WILLIAM GEORGE HOWARD
. I live with my parents, in Hampton-court,

St. Pancras. I was in Lancaster-street, and saw the prisoner come down with a shirt in his hand—I ran after him to Cromer-street, and saw him chuck the shirt into Mr. Shoppin's shop—he gave it to the policeman.





JANE ORAM
. I saw the shirt thrown into the shop, and it was given to the policeman.
(police-constable E 68.) I have had the shirt ever since in my possession—Mr. George Bishop is not here—his son Henry appeared before the Magistrate—he is since dead—it has the mark, "G. E. B." on it.

Prisoner. It is all quite false.





ROBERT DOCK RAY
 (police-constable D 56.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction from Mr. Clark' office—(read)—he is the man that was tried and convicted.




GUILTY
*. Aged 46.—


Transported for Seven Years.

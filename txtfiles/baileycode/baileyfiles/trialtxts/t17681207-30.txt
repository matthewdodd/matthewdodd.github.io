            . On the 27th of Oct. I was going through Lincoln's-Inn


 about three o'clock in the afternoon, before I came to Fetter Lane, a woman told me my pocket was picked, and pointed which way the prisoner was gone. I turned and saw the prisoner running with my handkerchief hanging behind him, under his coat. (A blue and white silk one.) I followed him into Flour de-Luce Court, where I saw him throw it down. I took it up, and then took him. (Produced and deposed to.)

Going along, I saw a handkerchief lying on the ground. I picked it up. A gentleman called, Stop thief! I dropped it down. I ran to see who was the thief. I am a draw-boy to a weaver.

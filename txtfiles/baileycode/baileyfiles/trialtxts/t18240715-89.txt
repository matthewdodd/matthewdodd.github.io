JAMES M'CANN. I live in Pancrass-place


. The prisoner came to lodge with me on the 5th of this month, and said his name was Jones, and that he was student to a barrister in Lincoln's Inn
. I had three gold rings in a glass case in the parlour - he dined with us on the following Wednesday - I missed the rings about an hour after dinner - I said nothing to him, but fetched an officer, who searched him, and found 3 s. and a flash note, (apparently a 50 l. note, on him;) he had been out all that morning.

            . I am a pawnbroker, and live in Gray's Inn Lane - On the 7th of July the prisoner brought me three gold rings and a pair of gilt buckles, which he pawned in the name of Robinson - I have no doubt of his person.

                  WILLIAM 
                  HUXTABLE
               



            . I am a tallow-chandler
, and live in King-street, Holborn. On the 20th of February, about six o'clock in the evening, my men went to tea leaving only one in the shop; one of my men came and gave me information. I went directly to the manufactory in Theobalds-road



, and missed three mould-frames and thirty-six candles, which weighed 12 lbs. I have seen some since, which I have every reason to believe to be the same; they correspond in number and appearance. I went next morning about eleven o'clock to 
               
                  John 
                  Martin
               



            's house, in Crown-street, and found them in a bag in a store-room there; he was not at home; I saw Robert there. I compared them with my moulds, and believe them to be the same, from appearance and smell. I have been many years in the trade. The name of 
               
                  John 
                  Martin
               



             is over the door.
Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. - Q. These candles were three to the pound - A. Yes; it is a common size; the smell of tallow depends on the age.
Q. Are there not thousands of pounds of the same size - A. There are.


                  RICHARD 
                  GILBERT
               



            . I am a carpenter, and live in Norfolk-street, Middlesex-hospital; on the 20th of February, about a quarter past six o'clock, I was at the corner of Harper-street, Theobald's-road, fifteen or twenty yards from the prosecutor's manufactory, and saw two men with two mould frames on their shoulders; it was just dark, I followed to the end of Harper-street, where another man overtook them with another frame and joined them. I suspected and followed them - I have no doubt that 
               
                  Robert 
                  Martin
               



             was one of the two first, each had a frame; I followed them to the corner of Queen-street into Southampton-row, Great Russel-street, down Charlotte-street, Plumbtree-street, across Holborn, into Monmouth-street, to No. 26, Crown-street, which house had the name of 
               
                  Robert 
                  Martin
               



             over the door; they all three went in, one of them came out again, and said to those that were in -
"Damn your eyes look sharp;" I looked him hard in the face, and should know him again, it was neither of the prisoners. I watched him so as to know him again; then went home to tea - I suspected Mr. Huxtable had been robbed of them. I went and told him, and we went to Bow-street; there were candles in the moulds. I went to the house next morning with the officers, Ford and Diggins, saw 
               
                  Robert 
                  Martin
               



             and a woman - the candles were found, I found some bits of wood there, which appear to me to have been part of a mould; here is one piece with the mark of tallow on it. There was tallow all about the place, as if it had been broken up there - I seized Robert immediately, and charged him with it - he could make no answer; I said I had no doubt but he was the man I had seen the night before. I did not say I saw him with the property.

Cross-examined. Q. It was rather dusky - A. Yes; but I could see as far as a hundred yards. It was exactly ten or fifteen minutes after six - it was only dusk, for it was a very light afternoon. I was about ten yards from them, their backs were towards me; I got before them and faced them all in Southampton-row.
Q. Did you never say he was the third man and not one of the first - A. Not to my knowledge; he was the last of the two. I never said he was the one who joined them.
Q. Did you mention any particular mark by which you knew him - A. It appeared to me as if he had a coat, and laced half boots - I said I knew him by a dirty apron, and laced boots; he was the shortest of the three, and I swear to his face - they were all three young. I found him at the house next morning, in the same dress as he wore the night before - I said he was the man, I had no doubt; we found some lead melted up at the house - I am sure the wood is part of the frame, as there is one piece that comes out between the holes of the mould; I was near enough to touch them at times - I faced them at the corner of Queen-square; it was dark when I got to Crown-street.


                  THOMAS 
                  FORD
               



            . I am an officer. In consequence of information, I went with Gilbert and Huxtable, to No. 26, Crown-street, Soho. I searched the front shop, and the cellar, and left my brother officer with 
               
                  Robert 
                  Martin
               



            , who was in the shop - Mrs. Martin was in the cellar with me; she said her husband was out, and she would shew me any part of the house - she went up stairs before me in haste, I followed immediately into the back store-house, where metal and things were deposited. There was a ladle with pewter or lead in a molten state, and while I was looking at it, I saw thirty-six candles hanging up in a bag, and on the step of the door I found some small chips of wood, with tallow on them. There were fragments of more having been chopped up on the threshold of the door; and the threshold bore the marks of the chopper. I found 
               
                  Robert 
                  Martin
               



             in the back-kitchen, behind the shop - Gilbert saw him, and as soon as he came out of the room, he said
"That is one of them, I know" - I took him into custody; I asked if he knew any thing of it - he said No. He had a dirty white apron on; I went and apprehended the father that day, at Hicks's-Hall; I never saw him in the house.
Cross-examined. Q. You found some pewter - A. Yes; I have it here; I brought away all that appeared to be melted - here are twelve pieces; there was a quantity of old rags covered over the pewter. Mrs. Martin shewed me every place but that, and then she ran quickly up stairs to that place. Gilbert said he had every reason to believe Robert to be the same person.


                  SAMUEL 
                  DICKINS
               



            . I am an officer, and was with the last witness. I searched the shop, but found no candles there. I kept Robert in charge; he tried to get out at the street door, but I stopped him, and said he should not go - I left him in care of two persons, and went to the kitchen. Mrs. Martin ran up stairs, but we followed, and found the candles - Mr. Huxtable said he believed them to be his. I found a piece of wood on the cill of the door of the back place; there were bits of wood all about, and marks of the chopper - the pieces of wood had tallow on them.
Cross-examined. Q. Was the wood more greasy than now - A. It was; we brought away all we could pick up.


                  RICHARD 
                  SEAKINS
               



            . I am a candle mould frame maker. I saw this wood at Martin's house when it was found; there was a little bit with half a circular hole in it, and another piece appears to be part of the bottom; there were pieces of tallow on it. I saw the candles found - I had made a new frame for the prosecutor, and they appeared moulded from that frame. Twelve of the thirty-six had marks which are in the head of the frame I made.
Cross-examined. Q. Would not that wood answer for a hundred different purposes besides candle moulds - A. No doubt of it. I made the new frame about a year ago; the tops are made of beech, and the tops of the mould were of a spiral form.


                  WILLIAM 
                  EAST
               



            . I am an Excise officer. The prosecutor was under my survey. I saw the candles at Bow-street, and took four of the prosecutor's candles, and compared them, and have no doubt of them being part of his stock. I have been in that department twenty years. Particular melted tallow would have a particular appearance, smell, and colour.
Cross-examined. Q. When they have been made a long time, they get the same colour - A. Yes; but I am certain they are not old candles, not three days old - they were not cold when they were found. They corresponded in smell, size, and age.
JURY to MR. HUXTABLE. Q. Had you some new moulds from Seakins - A. He made up one new frame; I lost three frames; they were made by different manufacturers - he had made one of the frames; the maker of the others is dead. Each frame contained twelve candles; they were on the stones cooling.
The prisoners made no Defence, but the following witnesses were called on their behalf.


                  EDWARD 
                  THOMPSON
               



            . I live at No. 17, Long-acre; I lodge on the second floor, and am a clerk - I am out of employ. I came from Liverpool about eighteen months ago, and have not had any regular employment since. Hollingsworth is landlord of the house. On the 20th of February, last, about two minutes before six o'clock, I was coming down Crown-street, Soho, and a gentleman accosted me, and asked if I had any commands to Liverpool he would take them - I told him No; I did not know his name. He was going to Ireland that way; I had seen him once or twice, only, at two or three inns in London. We stood in conversation in the street, opposite Mr. Martin's door; our conservation lasted upwards of twelve or fourteen minutes, as near as I can recollect, during which time I saw 
               
                  Robert 
                  Martin
               



             twice or thrice, at the door, and inside the shop. I had known him for about fourteen months - I had sold him things belonging to a lady, whose husband was dead, and she is gone to Scotland; it was Mrs. Johnson of Broad-street, at the bottom of Poland-street. Immediately after the gentleman and I separated it struck a quarter past six o'clock, and I have nothing further to say.
COURT. Q. Can you tell me the name of any person for whom you have acted as clerk during the eighteen months - A. I have written several letters, bills, and memorandums for a cousin of mine, and bought books at various sales, and sold them. I have been a good dealsupported by a sister of mine, who lives at Manchester, and my brother.
Q. I want to know for whom you have acted as clerk for the last eighteen months - A. Previous to that time I was six years and three quarters a clerk.
Q. How have you got your living for the last eighteen months - A. I have a great deal of support from Manchester and Liverpool, and from my aunt, 
               
                  Margaret 
                  Kay
               



            , who lives in Ryder's-court, Leicester-square, she lodges there in the garret - she has contributed to my support, in conjunction with my cousin; she has only one room; I have had meals with her. I have lodged in Long-acre six or seven months.
Q. You went over to ask 
               
                  Robert 
                  Martin
               



             how he did I suppose - A. No; I was standing in conversation. I cannot tell the name of the person, who was in conversation with me; he was going to Ireland by way of Liverpool.
A. When your friend left you, why not go over and ask how he did - A. It was of no material consequence; it was on a Thursday. I had sold him a few brushes and various kitchen utensils, and a pan or two belonging to the lady, they amounted to about 10 s. in all. He always paid ready money. I sold them within four months. He was never at my lodgings. I told him where I lived, when I lived in Rose-street, Long-acre.
Q. Did you tell him at any other time - A. Yes; nine months ago or more, I lived in Rose-street about eight months ago. I have been seven months where I now am, and previous to that I was there. I did not keep company with 
               
                  Robert 
                  Martin
               



            . I told him where I lived because Mr. Martin said, he would not buy any thing of a stranger without he knew where he lived.
Q. All the articles you have dealt in, only amounted to 10 s. - A. It might be 1 s. more, they did not ask where I lived, after I had told them once; I lived in Rose-street, then, I do not recollect his asking where I lived afterwards.
Q. How came you to swear, you told him you lived in Long-acre - A. I think I told Mrs. Martin so, because she was mostly in the shop. I will swear, I told her I lived in Long-acre. I told Mr. Martin where I lived in Rose-street, and think I told Mrs. Martin, I lived in Long-acre.
Q. When were you applied to, to be a witness - A. Last Friday, Mrs. Martin applied to me. I was going by the house, on the 21st of February, and saw Mrs. Martin, at the door and asked her how she was; she said she was in a little trouble about her son and Mr. Martin; then she related the circumstance to me; this was about noon.
Q. Noon is twelve o'clock in the day - A. Yes; she told me then, that her son and Mr. Martin were taken up; about noon. I swear that positively; she did not say who had taken them. She said they were taken at her house, at least her son was. I believe Mr. Martin was not taken there.
Q. She told you at noon, that they were both taken up - A. At noon the following day.
Q. She told you this on the 21st of February, at noon, that Mr. Martin and his son were both taken up, do you swear that positively - A. I do - she said her son; was taken there, and her husband at Clerkenwell, she told me so at noon; Clerkenwell, is half a mile from her house; she said they were taken to Bow-street. I said nothing more to her, but wished her good morning.
Q. Did you then tell her, you saw her son the day before, at the time he was charged with this offence - A. Yes; I forgot that; I immediately replied
"I was by here last night and saw your son Robert." I told her the very time I had seen him.
Q. How did you know that the time was material - A. I said I was by a few minutes before six o'clock, talking to a gentleman, and saw him last night; she asked me what time I had seen him - I told her it struck six o'clock just as the gentleman accosted me, and we were twelve or fourteen minutes together. She said they were taken up for some candles I believe; nothing else; she did not mention about candle moulds. I did not go to see Martin.
Q. When was it you told Mrs. Martin where you lived - A. Nine months ago. I told her I lived in Rose-street.
Q. How then could they find you out in Long-acre - A. I believe I told her that four or five months ago. I called in and told her, I believe.
Q. Will you positively swear you told her you lived at No. 17, Long-acre - A. Yes.
Q. Will you swear she said Martin sen. was in custody, as early as noon that day - A. Yes.
MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What house were you employed in six years before you went to Liverpool - A. The house of

                  John 
                  Martin
               



             was at Hicks's Hall with me, waiting to go before the Grand Jury. He was there all day on the 20th till night, and went part of the way home with me; he lives about a mile and a half from Clerkenwell - we staid till nearly half-past five o'clock, and went home together. I live at Knights-bridge; we went together as far as Newport-street, Newport-market - it was six o'clock when he left. It was nearly dark then - he was then nearly half a mile from home.
COURT. Q. Newport-street would be in his way home - A. No; he should have gone up Holborn. I was present on the 21st when he was taken up; I did not particularly notice the time, but think it might be about one in the afternoon.
Q. Then this man could not have heard that he was in custody and at Bow-street at twelve o'clock at noon - A. No; he lives in Crown-street, St. Giles's, and is a dealer in marine stores, which is written over his house - I left at six o'clock.
JURY. Q. What particular circumstance enables you to say what time of the night it was - A. I am out every night; there had been a little rain that day - it was cloudy. There is no particular circumstance to make me say it was dark.

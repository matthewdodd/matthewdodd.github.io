DANIEL CLARIDGE
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
25th of September, 3 half-crowns, the monies of 



Thomas Lewis; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






THOMAS LEWIS
. I keep a tallow-chandler's, shop in Whitechapel. On the 25th of September, about twelve o'clock in the morning, I was at the back of my house, and saw the prisoner coming from behind my counter—I came in and said, "You villain, what do you do here?"—I let him go, but my wife came in, and missed three half-crowns from the till.





SAAH MARTIN LEWIS
. I missed three half-crowns from the till, which I had seen safe half-an-hour before—I left my husband behind the counter when I went up stairs.





CATHERINE RYAN
. I sell oysters in the street. On the 25th of September the prisoner came to me and had 1d. worth of oysters—he went to a shop and changed one half-crown, and I saw two others in his hand—I do not know what time it was.





EDWARD SIMMONS
 (police-constable H 115.) I received information, and went and took the prisoner—he said, "I have taken nothing"—I found his cap in the room—I said, "Where is the change of the half-crown?"—he said, he had no half-crown—I took him to Ryan, and then he said he had changed a half-crown which a lady gave him to get changed—there was only 2d. found on him.

Prisoner's Defence. I went to get change for a lady, and gave her all the change.





THOMAS LIDDLE
. I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got at Mr. Clark's office—(read)—he is the person.




GUILTY

Transported for Seven Years—Convict Ship.

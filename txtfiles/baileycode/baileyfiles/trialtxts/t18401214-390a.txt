WILLIAM SUMMERHAYS
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
12th of November, at 
St. George the Martyr, Southwark, 1 handkerchief, value 6d., and 6 sovereigns, the property of 



James Davey, in hit dwelling-house.






ELIZABETH DAVEY
. I am the wife of James Davey, and live in Gilbert's-court, in the parish of St. George, Southwark—the prisoner was a servant out of place—we took him in to lodge out of charity—he was five

weeks with us—I had a box locked in the front room up stairs—on the 12th of November I found it broken open, and missed from it a handkerchief and six sovereigns, which were all tied up together in a rag—they were safe before—I have not recovered them—I had no other lodger—he left the house without notice.





JOSEPH KENT
. I am a policeman. I went down to Chard, in Somersetshire, and found the prisoner there—I asked by what conveyance he went home—he said by the Great Western Railway, for which he paid 1l. 11s. 6d.—I asked if it was in sovereigns or silver—he said, "Both"—I found only 6 1/2 d. on him.





WILLIAM GREEN
. I am a policeman. I was at the station on Sunday, and saw the prisoner in the cell—I said, "Where do you come from?"—he said, "I have come out of the country"—I said, "Oh, are you here for those six sovereigns?"—he said, "Yes, I am—if I am sent over the water I shall bring some sprats back with me"—the handkerchief has not been found.




GUILTY
. Aged 20.—


Transported for Ten Years.

Before Mr. Justice Patteson.

JOHN EATON
 (police-constable S 193.) I was with another constable in plain clothes in Tottenham-court-road on Saturday evening, the 9th of January, and saw the three prisoners together, walking and talking together—Iknew Howard and Edy by sight before—I watched them down Tottenham-court-road, and St. Giles's, into Holborn, till they came to Red Lion-street—they went through Gray's Inn-passage into Bedford-street, remaining close together all the time—they were looking into the shop-windows, more particularly jewellers and linen-drapers—I had an opportunity while watching them to observe Elliott—when they got to Bedford-street I saw them pass the prosecutor's shop-window two or three times,

looking in at the door and window—I saw them speak to two boys—they were all together, but Howard spoke to the boys—they seemed strangers to them, and the boys went a little distance, as if they were watching for them—the three prisoners all went to the prosecutor's shop-window close together—I saw Howard at the square of glass—the other two were close to him—I saw Howard doing something at the square of glass, but I could not see what, and in two or three minutes I saw them all three come away from the window—Howard appeared as if he was putting something in at the side where the putty was—after they left I saw Howard go directly opposite the window, and pitch some glass in the road—it made a great noise, and sounded like glass—at that time the policeman ou duty in uniform was coming along, and the prisoners walked away towards Gray's Inn-passage—we spoke to the policeman, and he kept out of the way—we went round in different directions, and when we got back found they bad gone to the window again, all three were round it—the shop is two or three houses from Gray's Inn-passage—I went up, tried to seize Howard, and at that moment he threw some silk handkerchiefs on the pavement, which I produce—I tripped him up just as he got across the road, and after some resistance secured him—he tried all he could to kick me, saying, "You b—, if you don't let me go I will kick you"—I took him into the shop—the handkerchiefs were picked up by the shopman—theother two prisoners ran away—while I was in the shop Elliott was brought in by the other constable—I knew him again—I saw Edy in custody on Monday, the 11th—after coming from the station in about three quarters of an hour I looked on the road, and found two pieces of glass broken—it was the same description of glass as the window, which was broken large enough to admit a hand.

Cross-examined by
MR. HUDDLESTONE. Q. How many boys were there about the place at that time? A. Two—no more—they were away from the window when we took the prisoners—I suppose they ran away—the boys did not go the window at all—there are two courts, and one was placed at the end of each court—I saw the boys after the window was broken, lower down than the shop—I do not know whether they walked or ran away—I did not see them afterwards—my brother constable saw them as well as me.





JAMES HERSEY
 (police-constable S 144.) I was in plain clothes, in company with Eaton, on Saturday evening, the 9th of January, and saw the three prisoners in Tottenham-court-road—I watched them through different streets, till they got to the prosecutor's shop—I then saw Howard put his hand to the window, go away, and throw something down in the road—they were all together at the time—another policeman then came up—I went round and met them in another street—when I returned they were all three at the window—I had, before that, seen them speak to two boys—I was on the opposite side, not with Eaton—I saw them all at the window, and Howard was taking the handkerchiefs out—they all stood close together—Eaton went up, and seized Howard—Elliott ran away—Iwent after him, and caught him in Bedford-row, without losing sight of him—I brought him back to the shop, where I found Eaton with Howard.

Cross-examined by
MR. PAYNE. Q. What time did you begin to watch them? A. About half-past six o'clock we first saw them—it was just before eight when they were at the prosecutor's shop—I had been watching them all that time, and had been nearly close to them all the way—I

was standing about three doors above the prosecutor's when I first saw them at the window, near Gray's Inn-passage—Elliott stood nearest to me, I cannot say which was next—I was standing in a line with them—not all the time—I was standing on the opposite side when they took the handkerchiefs out—Elliott was nearest to me then, they kept turning backwards and forwards from the window—I followed Elliott up Gray's Inn-passage, along Red Lion-street, down Princes-street, into Bedford-row—therewere three corners to turn, but I was not above six yards behind him—when I laid hold of him, he said, "What do you want with me; what have I done?"

Cross-examined by
MR. LUCAS. Q. Did you see Edy take the hand-kerchiefs?—A. No—he was in company with them—I saw no one in the street at the time, but the prisoners and the two boys.

Cross-examined by
MR. HUDDLESTONE. Q. Where were the boys? A. One was near Gray's Inn-passage, and the other at the end of a court I do not know the name of—I do not know where they were when the prisoners were taken—I did not look for them—I was standing on the opposite side—I did not notice how many people were in the street—several were passing up and down—the boys were gone when the handkerchiefs were taken—I did not see them then—I was looking at the prisoners.





JOHN FRYER
 (police-constable E 118.) I met Eaton and Hersey on Saturday evening, the 9th, near the prosecutor's shop—they pointed out the three prisoners to me, and I went out of the way at their request, that I might not be observed—I am positive the prisoners are the persons—I saw no part of the transaction.

Cross-examined by
MR. PAYNE. Q. How long were you there before you went out of the way? A. Two or three minutes—I went through Gray's-inn-passage, and met the other two constables at the other end.

Cross-examined by
MR. HUDDLESTONE. Whereabout did you first meet the two constables? A. Within three or four doors of the prosecutor's, at the top of Bedford-row—at that time I saw the prisoners, and could be seen by them.





HENRY RAMSDEN
. I am in the service of John Ballantyne, hosier, No, 18, Bedford-street, Bedford-row. On Saturdy evening, the 9th of January, I was in the shop, and heard a cracking at the window outside, apparently the glass—I attributed it to the frost—some time after I heard a cry of "Stop thief"—I ran to the door and picked up these six handkerchiefs on the pavement, just outside the window—the window was broken—the bottom of the pane had been cut—there was glass enough out for a hand to go through—the handkerchiefs had been in the window about six inches back from the glass, where it was broken—those now produced are them—theyare my master's property—our shop is in the parish of St. Andrew, Holborn-above-bars—it is generally called St. Andrew, Holborn.

Cross-examined by
MR. PAYNE. Q. Suppose any body asked you what parish your master lived in, should you not say St. Andrew, Holbornabovebars? A. No, St. Andrew, Holborn, that is the name of the parish.





BENJAMIN LANGHAM
. I live in Red Lion-street, Holborn. On Saturday evening, the 9th of January. I live passing through Bedford-street, near Mr. Ballantyne's shop, and saw Howard and Elliott at the shop-window—Idid not see Edy at the window, but about a minute before that I had seen the three prisoners and two or three boys standing by a coffee—

shop, two doors from the prosecutor's, and heard them whispering—I stood and looked at them, and Elliott said to me, "What do you want?" and I walked on—I heard the policeman calling, went hack, and saw Howard and Elliott at the window—I did not see any hody else close to the window—Iam not sure the third man was not there at that time—I did not notice him—Howard was pulling the handkerchiefs out, and Elliott was standing to hide his hand—I was going by on the same side of the way—therewas nobody else at the window at that time, I am quite sure—there were some boys close by, but they were not at the window—they were perhaps a dozen yards from it—I ran after Elliott, and saw him taken into custody.

Cross-examined by
MR. PAYNE. Q. Who are you? A. I live with my father, who is a bookseller and tobacconist—I go to school—I was going by the prosecutor's, and heard these men whispering, and inspected they were thieves—we have had different things stolen from our shop—I am sixteen years old—I stood and looked at them for about a minute or half a minute—Elliott asked me what I wanted—I gave him no answer, but walked on—I heard the policeman speaking to another policeman at the corner of Gray's-inn-passage, and then I ran back—he said they were starring the glaze—that means cutting the glass out—I ran back to the window directly, and saw Howard pushing his hand in at the window—Elliottwas hiding him, and directly he got his hand out, the policeman came up and laid hold of Howard—I do not swear there were only two men at the window, but my attention was directed to the men taking the things—I was standing about two yards from them—there might have been more than two—I do not know exactly.

Cross-examined by
MR. HUDDLESTONE. Q. Did you see any boys about at the time? A. Not then—I bad seen them standing close by the prisoners—I did not see them when the prisoners were taken—I did not look for them, because I ran after Elliott—they might have been there for what I know—when we ran up to the prisoners, a great mob came directly—Idid not notice any persons in the street before that—I was looking at the prisoners, and did not see any.

 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
22nd of March, 5 sovereigns, and 1£5 Bank-note, the monies and property of 



William Bernard, his master.






WILLIAM BERNARD
. I live in Upper North-place, Gray's-inn-road, and am a baker. The prisoner was in my service—on the 22nd March I sent him to Major Mureen's, in Argyle-place, with a £5 note and five sovereigns—his usual time of returning was ten o'clock—he did not return at all—I gave him a purse to put it into, that he might not lose it.





THOMAS PADDON
. I am footman to Major Mureen, of Argyle-place. The prisoner did not come to me on the 22nd of March—he never gave me the£5 note nor the sovereigns.





JOHN REEVE
. On the 22nd of March, the prisoner came to my house, in King-street, Hammersmith—he asked me for change for a£5 note—he said he had been saving his wages up—I gave him fire five sovereigns, and he bought some things at my shop.





SAUNDERS SOLOMON
. I live in High-street, Kensington. The prisoner bought a hat, a pair of trowsers, and a coat, of me, on the 22nd of March.





RICHARD HANCOCK
 (police-sergeant T 10.) I took the prisoner on the evening of the 22nd—I found on him five sovereigns and a half-sovereign, some silver, and a watch, which be bad taken out of pledge that day, also this bag, which is his master's, and these clothes.

Prisoner's Defence, I left my master's in the morning, at half-past eight o'clock, and went to serve my customers—I met some friends, we went and had something to drink, it made me foolish—I did not know what I was about—they pressed me not to go back—I must throw myself on the mercy of the Court—the watch was my own.




GUILTY
. Aged 22.—


Transported for Seven Years.

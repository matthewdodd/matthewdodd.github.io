JOHN WALKER
. I am a cheesemonger, and deal in Newgate-market. I have known the prisoner there as a porter—I bought three pigs of Mr. Deadman on the morning of the 1st of April—the prisoner used to bring home my pigs for four months—he came to me that morning, and brought eight which I had bought, and he said that three were not paid for—he said Mr. Deadman had put the three by for me—I said "Take the money back to your master, tell him to pay Mr. Deadman and send me the change—he went back with the horse and cart—I gave him four sovereigns, and 2l. in silver—I saw no more of him till I apprehended him on the 27th of April.





JOSEPH DEADMAN
. I am a salesman in Newgate-market. On the 1st of April, I put by three pigs for Mr. Walker—the prisoner never brought the money—I did not see him till he was taken.





RICHARD COOPER
. I am a carrier. I went to Mr. Deadman for these pigs—they were not paid for—I sent the prisoner to tell Mr. Walker to send the money—he came back, and said Mr. Walker would come and pay for them in a few minutes—I saw no more of him.





WILLIAM PENNY
. I took the prisoner—he told me he absconded be-cause he had lost a sovereign, and that he came back into the neighbourhood to be apprehended.

Prisoner. That is the truth—I lost part of the money—I brought back the horse and cart, and went away.




GUILTY

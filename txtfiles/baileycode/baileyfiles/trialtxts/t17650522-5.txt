                  White 
               



            . I keep a green-stall in Clerkenwell; I was in my bed; the girl that owned the cloak, named 
               
                  Jane 
                  Gray 
               



            , was in bed with me. 
               
                  Jane 
                  Hutchinson 
               



             lodged in the room the same night, but then was up and gone backwards: the prisoner lay in the next bed to me; there are two beds in the room. 
               
                  Jane 
                  Gray 
               



             and Hutchinson lay in one bed, and the prisoner and one Cotterell lay in the other bed: the prisoner was almost always first up in the morning, and many things had been missing. I lay with my hand over my eyes to watch. 
               
                  Jane 
                  Gray 
               



             lay at the foot of the bed, with her cloak under her head, that was her pillow: the prisoner put the cloak under her petticoat: this was about six in the morning; 
               
                  Jane 
                  Gray 
               



             was asleep; I saw her turn her back, in order to pin it under her petticoat: Hutchinson came in and asked her what she was doing; she said she was pinning her shift: she got out at the door before I could get at her: then Jane Gray said I must pay for the cloak: I said I would do my endeavour to get it. In about two days after I met the prisoner, and charged her with taking it: she owned she had pawned it for eight-pence, and she would bring it back again. I never got it again. 
               
                  Jane 
                  Gray 
               



             is since dead and baried; the prisoner was taken up last Thursday three weeks.

                  Hutchinson 
               



            . I lodged at Mrs. White's at the time; I was gone out backwards for water; I know 
               
                  Jane 
                  Gray 
               



            's cloak lay under her head at the time; when I returned again, I observed the prisoner sticking a pin in her coats, as she was by 
               
                  Jane 
                  Gray 
               



            's head. I asked her what she was doing; she said she was pinning her shift. When she was brought back, she owned she knew of the going of the cloak; she said it was pawned for eight-pence, and you shall have it back again.


                  Jane 
                  Smith 
               



            . I heard the prisoner say, Mrs. White, make yourself easy, I have pawned the cloak for eight-pence, and I'll bring it back again. This was after she was taken up.
Prisoner's Defence.
The poor woman came from the work-house when there was a burying: she got out at the back-door; as to the cloak, I never saw it. She said if she could get eight-pence for her cloak, she would, to pay for her lodging.

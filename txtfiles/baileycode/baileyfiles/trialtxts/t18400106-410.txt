JOHN PHILLIPS.
I am a broker, living in Broadway, Westminster. On the 19th of December I lost this shovel—I know it is mine—it was not lost above a minute and a half—it was just inside the shop.





STEPHEN TAYLOR RAMSBOTHAM.
I go about with messages—I was

passing the prosecutor's shop, and saw Harrigan take the shovel from the door—I followed and stopped him—he gave a bit of a run, and dropped the shovel—the other prisoner was close to him when he dropped it—M'Cormack was waiting for Harrigan, about twenty yards from the prosecutor's shop—lie could see the shop—I had seen them both waiting about some time before.

Harrigan's Defence. At that time I was about Clerk en well, looking for work.

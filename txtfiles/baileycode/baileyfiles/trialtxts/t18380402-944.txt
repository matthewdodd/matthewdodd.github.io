THOMAS JONES
 was indicted

for a robbery on 



Elizabeth Rutt on the 
5th of March, assaulting her, and taking from her person, and against her will, 1 reticule, value 2s.; 1 handkerchief, value 3s.; 1 half-crown, 2 shillings, 1 sixpence, and 3 pence; her goods and monies; and feloniously striking and beating her immediately before, and after the robbery aforesaid.







ELIZABETH RUTT
. On the 5th of March, at eleven o'clock in the forenoon, I walked from Clapton to Hackney, and was going up London-lane—there was nobody in the lane—I was forcibly stopped by somebody coming from behind a wall—he placed his hands on my shoulders, terrified me very much, and took my bag—I resisted for a few moments, but he eventually got it from me—he then stumbled and fell, which prevented his going off so briskly—a man came up, and secured him—the prisoner is the man, I am certain—my bag contained about 4s., 6d. in silver, a handkerchief, and some cards—he denied having the bag, but it was found on him—he hurt my hand with my resisting him—the string was round my two fingers, and he got it from me.

Cross-examined by
MR. DOANE. Q. Are you married? A. No.





JAMES SMITH
. I was going up London-lane, and saw the lady—I saw the prisoner come from behind a brick wall—he caught her by the shoulders and took her reticule out of her hand—I stopped him and took him to the station—it was at eleven o'clock in the morning.
(John Saunders, of Crabtree-row; William Faber, of Bethnal-green; James Goodchild, Mount-street, Bethnal-green; Henry Carfield, Friar's Mount; and Charles Jackson, deposed to the prisoner's good character.)




GUILTY of robbery, but not with violence. Aged 20.



Transported for Ten Years.

Before Lord Chief Baron Abinger.

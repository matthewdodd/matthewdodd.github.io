             sworn.
I came across Piccadilly, and saw a man with a bundle in his hand in the Park; the 22d of last January, between three and four in the afternoon, a little boy came running after him, saying, stop that man, he has got my bundle; the little boy had got his breeches down; I followed the man; he went towards Piccadilly to Hyde Park; I overtook him in Park-lane; I said to him, stop, you have something more than your own; he said, if it was mine, I might take it; he would have given me the bundle; I said, it was not mine; he had the bundle in his hand; I stopped till the child came up, and had the bundle; the child said, it was his; I took the prisoner to the Justice's; the prisoner said, he found the bundle; the bundle was delivered to me at the Justice's I have it now; this is the bundle the prisoner had; I have had it ever since.
(The sheets deposed to.)

             sworn.
I keep a musick shop in Leicester-street, Swallow-street; I was going to teach a gentleman; there was a crowd, I asked what was the matter, and they said, he had stole a pair of sheets from the boy; I did not see him steal the sheets; I took the parcel from the little boy before the Justice; I did not see the bundle taken from the prisoner.

What is the consequence if you swear falsely? - I shall go to the bad place if I tell a lye.
And do you know that people are punished here if they speak falsely? - Yes.

             sworn.
I was coming home, and I went into the Green Park to ease myself, my bowels were very bad, and the old man was smoaking his pipe by the wall; when he saw my bundle; and I put it under his arm when I sat down; then I put it upon my knee, and when he saw me put it under me he came and snatched it away.
Did he say any thing to you? - Nothing at all.
He offered no violence to you? - He said nothing to me; the prisoner is the man that took the bundle from me.
PRISONER's DEFENCE.
Coming from Hyde-park I went to ease myself, I found a little bit of a bundle, and I put it under my arm, and two men came and took it from me; some people said to the little boy, you little dog, say he took it from you; the man that took me before the Justice was in liquor, cursing, swearing and blaspheming; I have sent for my witnesses but they are not here.

SAMUEL PERKINS
. I saw the prisoner standing partly in the doorway of Mrs. Haybow's shop in High-street, Shadwell, and in a moment he gave a tug, and locked round, which excited my suspicions—I was not certain whether he had then taken any thing, but he had some thing under a handkerchief—he went from the shop door to the private door, where it dark, and the private door being open, he went a little way into the passage—he came out with something wrapped in his handkercheif—I stopped him, and charged him with they—he begged me to look over it—I brought him back, and found the shoes in the handkercheif.





BENJAMIN BRETT
. I am a shopman to William Hay how. These are his shoes—they hung about half a yard inside the door-way—the officer brought the prisoner into the shop with them.

Prisoner's Defence. About six o'clock in the evening, I was going through Shad well—I saw something lying in a passage—I kicked it—I found the shoes, and picked them up—this gentleman came up, and asked what I had got—I said a pair of shoes, which I found in the passage.




GUILTY
. Aged 27.—


Transported for seven Years.

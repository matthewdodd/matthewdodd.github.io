The record of the conviction of 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Brown 
               



             was read, indicted for stealing butter and a wicker-basket, tried Dec. 10, 1763, at Justice-Hall in the Old Bailey, wherein it appeared he received sentence to be transported for seven years.


                  James 
                  Sullivan 
               



            . The prisoner's name is 
               
                  William 
                  Dukes 
               



            ; he was tried here by the name of 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Brown 
               



            , for stealing some butter out of Leadenhall-market, belonging to Chantlin or Champlin: he was convicted upon it: I took him in Rosemary-lane, and took him coming out of a slop-shop. The young man that came to my assistance was hanged yesterday (meaning Grief). This was on the 31st of July last.
Prisoner's Defence.
Please to inquire into Sullivan's character, how he gets his living. If he had his deserts, he would have been hang'd with his partner yesterday.


                  Francis 
                  Rackham 
               



            . I am a weaver: Sullivan takes young fellows up for returning from transportation; he bears a very bad character.
Q. Is he to be believed upon his oath?
Rackham. I believe he ought not to be believed upon oath: I have heard Delaney say he was a thief.
Prisoner. Please to call my father.


                  Paul 
                  Dukes 
               



            . I believe, if the prisoner had been in Newgate, I should certainly have gone to see him; my only son, my eldest son. I never knew him to be transported by the name of 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Brown 
               



            : I never knew him go by any other name but that of 
               
                  William 
                  Dukes 
               



            . When this man and Grief took him in custody, they carried him from place to place to extort money from him. Sullivan proffered to let him go, if I would give them five guineas: I thought they would have got all his wages from him.
Sullivan. The prisoner told me he had no money.



               Acquitted
            .
After he was acquitted, he acknowledged himself to be the person transported by the name of 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Brown 
               



            , tried in December sessions, 1763. See No. 60. in Mr. Alderman Bridgen's Mayoralty. He desired to be continued in Newgate to go with the transports to serve out the remainder of his time.

            . The prisoner was my servant
. On the 9th of June I went out of town; when I came home again the prisoner had given my sister warning, and was gone. There were but us three lived in the house. I went to see if I had lost any thing, and missed twenty guineas. I found the prisoner and took her before justice Fielding, where she was searched, and twenty guineas were found upon her. The justice ask'd her whether she took it from me or not, and she said yes.

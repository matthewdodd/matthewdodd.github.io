            . I live in Hart-street, Bloomsbury

. I lost a brass knocker from my street door the 24th of July: the watchman stopped the prisoner and took him to the watch-house. The knocker produc'd in court, and deposed to.
Q. What is the value of it?

            . I am a watchman in Bloomsbury market : I stopped the prisoner as he was trying to get a knocker off a door, he had three about him, there was another person with him, he is gone off. He shewed us the doors where he had taken them from; one was this witness's, the other the next door, at Mrs. Ball's house.
The prisoner had nothing to say.

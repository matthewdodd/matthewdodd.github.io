            . I am the daughter of Richard Giles, who lives in Chamber-street, Whitechapel


. On the 12th of February, at half-past six o'clock in the evening, I went up from the kitchen, to shut the street door, which I had heard was open; I had come in about ten minutes before, and had shut it, but there are lodgers in the house - as I came up the stairs, I looked through a casement window, and saw the prisoner, who was a perfect stranger, withsome articles, which he dropped on the staircase; I shut the door, and called for a light: I went to the prisoner, and found these articles, which had been in the garret, and are my father's property - I had seen them safe that day; the prisoner was taken in the house: I asked what he wanted, and he said he wanted a lodging.

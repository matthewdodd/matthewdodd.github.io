THOMAS PERRY
. I live in Upper Greystock-place, Fetter-lane, and am a bricklayer—the prisoner lodged in my house for five weeks. On the morning of the 27th of May, I got up about half-past five o'clock, and left the, prisoner in bed—he told me when I left that he should not be at home that night, I should have the bed to myself—I returned from work in the evening as usual, and went to my box—I unlocked it, and the lid fell off—the hinges had been broken, and my purse and trowsers, waistcoat, and other things were gone—the officer found the prisoner about a week after—these are my articles.

Prisoner. Q. Is there any mark on the purse? A. I know it by one of the ends being peculiar—I can swear to these other things.





FREDERICK POOLE
. I am in the service of a pawnbroker in Shoreditch—these trowsers and waistcoat were pawned by the prisoner on the 27th of May.





JAMES CHARLES PATTEN
. I am an officer. I took the prisoner, and found this purse in his trowsers pocket.
(The prisoner put in a written defence, stating that he left his lodging, being unable to pay his rent; that the purse was his own property, and when first found on him the prosecutor did not claim it; he denied having pledged any of the property.)




GUILTY
.* Aged 23.—


Transported for Seven Years.

RICHARD BICKNELL FRANCIS
. I am assistant to Cornelius Edwin Garman and another, chemists, Tottenham-court-road. On the 7th of February, I was in a room adjoining the shop, and saw the prisoner in the shop—I went to the door, and saw he had his hand in the glass case—he heard me, and ran out of the shop—I followed him, and cried, "Stop thief—a person collared him, and gave him to me—I took him back to the shop, and gave him in charge—the officer brought me these three bottles—I then missed them—I can swear to them, and to the prisoner, as being the person who was in the shop.





EDWARD WALKER
. I am a painter. I saw the prisoner running, and pursued him, as I heard the cry of, "Stop thief"—I saw him throw something from his hand, and found it was these bottles, which I gave to the policeman.

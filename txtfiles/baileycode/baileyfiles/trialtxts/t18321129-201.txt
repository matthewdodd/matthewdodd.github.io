             SMITH. I am in partnership with my brother James - we keep the Angel Inn, Pentonville





 - Edward Howell was our porter
 for about two years. On the 30th of October, in consequence of suspicion, I watched with my brother - I heard a noise, about six o'clock in the morning, of breaking in at the area; I went to the cellar, and head some one removing the bottles -I stood a short time, and saw Edward Howell coming from the cellar, he was in into the one I was in; I knew he must see me, as he had a light - I collared him - he said, "Oh Lord! what have I done," and begged for mercy - a bottle of ale had been removed to the grating of the cellar, and a piece of soap - we had a quantity of soap in that cellar, the whole of which had been taken away but seven cakes; I saw a box searched in 
               
                  Edward 
                  Howell
               



            's bed-room, but the under waiter sleeps with him - James Howell had lived in my service a year before; I went to his lodgings, and found a mahogany case, containing white-handled and black-handled knives and forks, and a number of bottles, two of which I had marked five weeks before in my cellar, and I did not allow them to be sold - he said he had bought the knives and forks, and would not give the officer any answer about the bottles - he afterwards said Mr. Waterhouse gave him part of them: here are my marks on them.
Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You put the marks on the bottles five weeks before? A. Yes, after James Howell had left me - there was nothing on them to let him know they were mine; I had lost a great many - I marked about two hundred bottles: 
               
                  James 
                  Howell
               



             was in bed - he gave us every facility to search his place.
Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. Did you pay 
               
                  Edward 
                  Howell
               



            's wages? A. No, he had no wages, only what gentlemen gave him.
COURT. Q. What reason had you to know that 
               
                  Edward 
                  Howell
               



             had been to the area where the cake of soap and bottle of ale were? A. The grating had been taken up.

                  SMITH
               



            . I am the prosecutor's brother, and live in White Lion-street. I saw 
               
                  Edward 
                  Howell
               



             taken - he begged for mercy; some soap was found in a box in the room in which he slept.


                  JOHN 
                  MATTHEWS
               



            . I am a waiter at the Angel. I have seen the knives and forks produced, and know them to be the prosecutors', from their passing through my hands every day for several years; 
               
                  Edward 
                  Howell
               



             had to clean them ever since he has been there, which is about eighteen months; James has occasionally assisted his brother in a morning.

             (Police-constable N 250). I found EdwardHowell in the cellar - he said, "Oh, Mr. Smith, pray have mercy on me;" I saw the bottle of ale and cake of soap at the window - I asked him at the watch-house for the key of his box; he said I should find it in his jacket pocket -I opened the box, and this other soap was found in it.


                  JAMES 
                  COLLINS
               



             (Police-constable N 94). I saw the key found, the soap taken from the box, and a wine-glass which was marked "Angel Inn:" I found on Edward Howell at the station, another key, which opened the cellar door - I went to James Howell's, and found these articles; he said he bought the knives and forks in Goswell-road, and afterwards he said at Mr. Essex's, opposite the church at Islington.

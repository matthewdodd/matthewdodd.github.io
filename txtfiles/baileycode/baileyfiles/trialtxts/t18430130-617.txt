ANN FOLEY
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
19th of Jan., 11lbs. weight of pork, value 6s., the goods of 



Henry Pettifer; and that she had been before convicted of felony.






HENRY PETTIFER
. I live with my father in High-street, St. Giles's. On the 19th of Jan., about seven o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came into the shop, and bought a quarter of a pound of beef which she paid for, and took a leg of pork with her—I stopped her about half a yard from the door, and asked where she was going to take that pork, I should lock her up for it—she said, "You don't mean to do that, when you ran after me and put it under my cloak."





WILLIAM BOFFIN
. I am a policeman. I took her into custody, and found on her a basked containing sixteen lace caps.

Prisoner's Defence. I do not recollect having the pork; I was rather drunk.





WILLIAM CUNNINGHAM
. I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction—(read)—I know her to be the person.




GUILTY
.—


Transported for Seven Years.

(There was another indictment against the prisoner.)

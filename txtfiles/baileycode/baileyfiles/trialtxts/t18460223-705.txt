THOMAS MILES
 was indicted

 for stealing 1 mare, value 2l., the property of 



Daniel Leverett.






DANIEL LEVERETT
. I live at Walworth—I have known the prisoner four or five years—on the 30th of Jan. I took a mare to Smithfield-market—I saw the prisoner there—I asked him to get on the back of the mare, and ride it backwards and forwards—just as we were coming out of the market I sold it to a man—I told the prisoner to take it to my house—I went home in a cab with the man I was going to sell the mare to, and the prisoner had not taken

it home—I never saw him again till he was in custody—I found the mare at Lewisham, a fortnight ago last Friday.

Prisoner. I was waiting to sell the mare; I did not know who it belonged to.





WILLIAM STANNARD
. I bought the mare of the prisoner on the 30th of Jan.—I paid him the money for it.





WILLIAM MORTON
 (police-constable P 289.) I took the prisoner—I told him it was on a charge of stealing a mare—he said while he was dressing him—self, "Recollect I shall not have the darbies on"—I said, "I mean you to have them on"—he said, "If you attempt it I shall let something into your b—y guts that will do for you"—by persuasion he had them on, and on the road to the station he said he sold the mare for 36s., but was persuaded by Billy Brown to do so—he is a most desperate character, and has committed many assaults on the police.




GUILTY
. Aged 30.—


Transported for Ten Years.

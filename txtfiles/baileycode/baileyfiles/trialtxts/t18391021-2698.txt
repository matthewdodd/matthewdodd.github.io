MARIA MARTIN
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
25th of September, 6 1/2 yards of lawn, value 10s. 6d., the goods of 



Moses Hart: and that she had been previously convicted of felony.






MOSES HART
. On the night of the 25th of September the prisoner came to the shop, which is kept by my uncle in Houndsditch—she asked to look as some silk—my sister made a sign to me—the prisoner said, "You have some calico, let me look at it"—my sister went to get it, and the prisoner went and looked at some mousse line delaine, then the took a piece of lawn, and put it under her shawl—I went and asked her for it—she said she had no lawn—she had only asked the price of the mousse line delaine—she went to the bottom of the shop and sat down—the lawn dropped from under her cloak, and a child, about two years of age, picked it up—it was several feet from the place where she took it—this is it.

Cross-examined by
MR. PAYNE. Q. Did you see what the prisoner did?

A. Yes, clearly—I was about a yard from her—I was pretending to look another way—the child was in the shop—there were two gas lights—I believe the prisoner only pretended to sit down—I do not recollect, in the confusion, whether she sat down or not—my sister had some suspicion of her, and nudged me to stop—I believe there were two ladies in the shop—I was not talking to them.





MOSES HART
. This is my property—I am uncle to the last witness.





CHARLES SCOTT
 (City police-constable, No, 387.) I produce the lawn, and took the prisoner at the shop.

Primer's Defence. I am quite innocent—the witness was playing with two young women in the shop.





JAMES MARTIN
 (City police-constable, No, 94.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—I was present at the time—the prisoner is the person who was tried (read.)




GUILTY

Transported for Seven Years.

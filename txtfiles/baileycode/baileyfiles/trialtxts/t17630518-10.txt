            . My brother John and I am partners, linnen-drapers

. On the 4th of last month, in the afternoon, the prisoner came to our shop, we were very busy, she asked to look at some printed cotton; she gave us great reason to suspect she had stolen some thing We told her before she went out, she must be searched. I took her into a private place, and called my maid down to search her. She had some little pockets under her apron, and in one of them was a southsea handkerchief, the maid took up her gown behind, and there dropt from her 5 yards of printed cotton. (Produced in court.) The handkerchief I believe to be my property, but I do not swear to that; I know the cotton to be our property by the pattern, size, and the sag end with the person's name of whom I had it.

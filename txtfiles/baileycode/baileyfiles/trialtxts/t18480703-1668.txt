HENRY NATHAN
. I live in Stanhope-street, May-fair. On the night of 25th June I put the money stated into my breeches-pocket, under my head—I afterwards went down stairs, came back, and put my trowsers on a chair by the side of the bed, and went to bed again—the money was safe then, and when I awoke it was gone, and the prisoner too—she had only been one day in my service.

Prisoner. He gave me eight sovereigns; two of his gay ladies came into the kitchen. Witness. It was my daughter and my niece, who live there—I did not give her eight sovereigns.





JOHN ENRIGHT
 (City-policeman, 647.) I found the prisoner at 2, Plough-court, Fetter-lane—she had six sovereigns.





JOHN SMITH
 (policeman, S 85.) I went to the prisoner's mother, and found, in a box, seven 5l.-notes, two 10l.-notes, and two portions of a purse, which had been cut, and which Mr. Nathan identified.

Prisoner's Defence. I never spent any of the notes; I put them in my box; his purse was on the floor in his bedroom.




GUILTY
. Aged 21.—


Transported for Seven Years.

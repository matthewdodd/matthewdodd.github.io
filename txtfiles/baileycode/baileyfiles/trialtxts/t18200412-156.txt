            . I am headborough of St. Pancras. On the 28th of February, I saw the prisoners and another going along Suffolk-street, knowing them all, I followed them - Asquith had a bundle, he set off running as soon as he saw me; the others did not run at first. I followed and Asquith dropped the bundle as he turned the corner, I picked it up. Taylor took Smith, the next day he was discharged from Hatton-garden office. I took Asquith myself - they were both together. I found a leg of mutton in the bundle, which the prosecutor claimed; there is a particular mark on it. I am a butcher myself.

            . On the 26th of February, between eight and night o'clock, I lost a very large leg and chine of mutton, from my shop, which is at the corner of Skinner-street; I saw it safe about six o'clock, it then hung on a hook outside the shop. Teasdale afterwards shewed it to me; it was a particular sort of mutton - the chine had been taken away then.
ASQUITH'S Defence. I bought it of a hawking butcher.

            . On Saturday the 2d of this instant, about seven in the evening, going along Ludgate-Hill


, I saw the glimpse of something fly by the side of my face, and turning saw the prisoner with my silk handkerchief in his hand. I took him by the collar. He said he would go with me where I pleased. I took him to the Fountain Tavern, sent for a constable, and he was secured.
Q. When do you remember you had it last?
Appleby. I had used it about three minutes before.
Prisoner's defence.
I never did such a thing in my life. Please to examine Mr. Lilley to my character.
Mr. Lilley. He is a very bad boy, I have seen him a drawer at an alehouse, he has been here two or three times, and is as bad a boy as can be.
See him an evidence on the trial of Fairbrother by the name of Degon, No 467, in Alderman Gascoigne's mayoralty.

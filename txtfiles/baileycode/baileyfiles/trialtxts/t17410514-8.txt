            . I am a Porter at Bear-key, and was going up Stairs into the common Warehouse, and met the Prisoner coming down: I asked him what he did there; and he said, he had only been to take a little Sugar. I got hold of him, and found a Bag full under his Coat, and his pockets full besides .
Prisoner. I was going by, and heard them cry, Who will work? and when I came there, they wanted no body; and I pick'd up this Sugar off the Boards, lying loose. 


               Guilty 10 d.

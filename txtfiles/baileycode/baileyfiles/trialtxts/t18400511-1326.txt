GEORGE GRAVES
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
16th of April, 361bs. weight of lead, value 4s. 6d. the goods of 



Thomas Chandler, his master.






THOMAS CHANDLER
. I five in Bow-lane, Cheapside. The prisoner was in my employ, and was at plumber's work, in Bread-street—I lost a quantity of old lead from there—I have compared the lead produced with the premises in Bread-street, and believe it came from there.





GEORGE CAPON
. I am a policeman. I was in Doctors' Commons on Thursday, the 16th April, about half-past eleven o'clock in the morning, and saw Mr. Chandler's cart come up to a lead-warehouse in Little Knight Ryder-street—they unloaded some old lead there, and had some new lead to take back—I saw the prisoner had something very heavy in front of him—I followed him down Fish-street—he turned into Bread-street, but went by the building where they were at work, and turned down Watling-street—I stopped him there, and asked him what he had got in front of him—I unbuttoned his waistcoat, and found this lead inside his trowsers—I pulled it out—I pulled it with the lead at the house in Bread-street—it corresponded with the other lead.





GEORGE EDIS EVANS
. I am a policeman. I fitted the lead—it corresponded in every particular.




GUILTY

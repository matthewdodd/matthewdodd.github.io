: On Monday, the 19th of August, between five and six o'clock in the morning I got up and observed the prisoner in Mr. Hutchins's garden; I never saw him before to my knowledge; I saw him go up to a copper pump, he took the handle off and wrenched it down from the post it stood against; I saw him carry it into the adjoining yard; I then saw him go intoa shed and fetch out an axe and cut the pump to pieces; he then tied up that and some other things, and put into a bag; my wife called a young man of the name of Simmons, while I went and secured the prisoner; I caught him on the fence, he had left the things the other side of the fence, close to the fence; I delivered him to Simmons.
The prisoner did not say any thing in his defence.

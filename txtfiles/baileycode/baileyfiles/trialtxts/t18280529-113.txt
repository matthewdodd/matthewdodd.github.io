            . I am servant to Mr.
 James Waters. I saw his saddle safe at half-past six o'clock in the morning of the 25th of April, and at half-past one it was gone; the prisoner was in the habit of bringing cattle to my master's slaughter-house.

            . I am a chimney-sweeper. On the 25th of April I saw the prisoner coming down our mews with a stick under his arm, between breakfast and dinner time - he went into Mr. Waters' stable, and came out with the saddle under his left arm; I did not know but he had borrowed it; he knew me, and I knew him.
Prisoner. Q. Where were you? A. I was against my master's door, watching you; I saw you open the stable door and go in; you left the door open when you came out; I went into my master's place, and watched you out of the mews, towards Davies-street.

            . I am apprentice to Mr. Hicks - he is a sweep. I saw the prisoner go down the mews with the stick under his arm, and come back with the saddle.

            . I took up the prisoner; he said he knew nothing about it. The saddle has not been found.
Prisoner's Defence. I got very tipsy the night before, and went home to bed at nine o'clock - I did not get up till three o'clock that afternoon.

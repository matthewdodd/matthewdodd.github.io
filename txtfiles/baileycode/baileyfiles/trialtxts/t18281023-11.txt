GEORGE BLACKBURNE. I am a wine-merchant
, and live in Mark-lane


. I lost a lamp on the 6th of October, from the top of the staircase - it is a large house, and let out in offices; the lamp was to light the stair-case. About a quarter before five o'clock I saw the prisoner coming down the yard, with it under his arm; I seized him before he got out of the yard, and asked what he had got - he said a lamp; I said, "Who does it belong to?" he said Mr. Parker: I took him into the passage - he dropped the lamp, and ran off: I ran and took him - I never lost sight of him.

            . I am an officer, and secured the prisoner; Mr. Black burne was pursuing him - he said nothing to the charge: he would give me no information about his friends.
Prisoner. I leave it to the mercy of the Court.

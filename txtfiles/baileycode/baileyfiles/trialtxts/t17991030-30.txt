, in Pall-Mall


: On the 27th of September, I saw the prisoner, she came into our shop to look at various articles; I observed her draw a handkerchief towards her, and put it under her cloak; I then wentround the counter, and took hold of her arm, and desired that she would stay; she then drew a silk handkerchief from under her cloak, and said, may I not have this; she said it was a mistake, that she was disturbed.
Q. Was that the handkerchief that you saw her draw across the counter? - A. Yes; the next day I saw a piece of ribbon found at her lodgings in Soho; she said they were her lodgings.

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Alley. I am shopman to the prosecutors: On the 27th of September, the prisoner came in and asked permission to sit down; she first asked to look at some gloves, which a young man in the shop shewed her; after looking at various kinds of gloves she went to look at some silk handkerchiefs; she then returned, and looked at the gloves again; she then sat down by the gloves, and soon after she walked down the shop as if she was going out; the witness, Shaw, ran round the counter, and desired her to stop; she then gave him something, but what it was I did not see.
Shaw. I forgot to mention that she dropped upon her knee, and delivered up two pair of cotton mits, begged pardon, and said it was a mistake.

             sworn. - On Friday the 27th of September, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, just about dusk, the prisoner came in, and asked to look at various articles; the first thing she asked to look at was gloves, she remained at the glove-counter some time, and then went away to another counter; then Shaw called out to me, and and I saw her draw a silk handkerchief from under her cloak, she begged pardon, and said it was a mistake; I then asked her if she had made any more mistakes; upon which she put her hand in her pocket and took out two pair of cotton mits; she appeared very much agitated, she begged forgiveness, and hoped I would let her go.

             sworn. - I am an officer; another officer brought the prisoner to Marlborough-street, and then she was given into my custody; I searched her, and found this ball of ribbon upon her.
Lloyd. I know this ribbon to be the property of the prosecutors, it has their private mark upon it.(The mits and the silk handkerchief produced).
Shaw. I cannot swear to these; but the handkerchief is such as I was shewing her; and the mits were such as were lying upon the counter; there was a vacancy for two pair of mits.
Prisoner's-defence. It was orders that I should go there and be bold-keep me up for exposing me, and to find out ten pounds, and a dozen pair of shoes, and false prisonment; I have concealed every thing private, and they have exposed me; I was put in prisoner, I am innocent; it is false prisonment to expose me and hurt my character.

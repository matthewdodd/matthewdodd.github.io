JOHN FARMER
. I am a patrol of Farringdon-street. On the evening of the 28th January I saw the prisoner and two others following two gentlemen in Cheapside—I followed and watched them to the foot of Hol-

born-hill—I then saw the prisoner take this handkerchief out of a gentleman's pocket, and put it into his own—he then crossed the road—he saw me, took to his heels, and ran down Union-court—he threw the handkerchief down George-alley—I took it up—he made his escape then, but I saw him the next evening and took him.

Prisoner. Q. How far do you think the gentleman had got? A. I cannot say, I was five or six minutes before I got to Holborn again.





CHARLES WALLER
. I was in Skinner-street at a quarter before twelve o'clock in the morning—the prisoner saw me and ran off—I pursued him, and took him with this other handkerchief—he said some boys gave it him—I took the handkerchief, and told him to get the boys who gave it to him—the same evening I saw him running, and Farmer after him—I know him perfectly well.




GUILTY
. Aged 18.—


Transported for Seven Years.

Sixth Jury, before Mr. Sergeant Arabin.

            . I am servant to Edward Wain, who is a silk-mercer
, and lives in West Smithfield


. On the 3d of June the handkerchiefs hung in the window, inside the shop; about seven o'clock in the evening the prisoner came in and asked to look at some silk handkerchiefs, I showed them to him - He sat down on a stool near to where they were - He did not like any, and went out; in about five minutes I missed the handkerchiefs, and went after him - I took him about twenty doors from the shop. I asked him to give me the handkerchiefs he had taken; he took off his hat, threw it down, and they fell out - He got from me, leaving his hat behind him. I picked them up, followed, and never lost sight of him. He was secured in Little Britain.

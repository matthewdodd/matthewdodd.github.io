            . The prisoner is an apprentice
 of mine. I am an organ-maker
: I have three chains: I saw a chain advertised, which when I saw, I found to be one of mine: I had not missed it before.

            . I am an apprentice to Mr. Briant, a Blacksmith. The prisoner came and asked us if we bought old iron: he produced this chain. (Produced in court.) My Mrs. weighed it, and it weighed 8 lb. and she gave him 8 d. for it.
Crang. There is no such thing in the kingdom but mine: it is in the same nature of a watch chain.
Q. to Morris. Where does your master live?
Morris. He lives in Thames-street.

            . I seeing this when I came home. I advertised it immediately, that the right owner might have it again. It could not be made under 40 or 50 s. Had I been at home, I certainly should have stopped the person.
Prisoner's Defence.
I found the chain in a yard belonging to Mr. Crang.

The prisoner called four witnesses to his character; who said, they had never heard any thing amiss of him before this affair.

             of St. Butolphs Bishopsgate


, was Indicted for 


               Felony and Burglary, in breaking the House of 
                     
                        John 
                        Miller
                     




                   the 18th of June
, and taking one silver Porenger, one silver Cup, and other Goods
            . It appeared, that on the Dogs barking, it alarm'd the Family; who being jealous of Thieves, it being between 6 and 7 in the morning, upon search miss'd the Goods; and the Prisoner was seen to run from the door into a Neighbors yard, and entering the House, went up one pair of stairs, and hid the plate amongst some ashes; and being hotly pursued was seized there, not being known by any of the Family. The Evidence was 


               plain as to the Felony, but not as to the Burglary, he was found Guilty
            .

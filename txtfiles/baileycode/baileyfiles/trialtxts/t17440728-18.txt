            , and acquitted. See January Sessions 1742-3. Page 59, Trial 90 and 91.
When he was arraigned , and ordered to hold up his hand; he said, What are you going to convict me before my time? I can hold up my hand as well as another; and when the question was asked, how will you be tried? he said, by God and my country, two better persons I cannot be tried by.
+ Jane Johnson was tried in May Sessions 1743, upon two indictments for receiving goods knowing them to be stolen; but there being no other evidence against her than an accomplice concerned in the felonies, she was acquitted. See May Sessions 1743. Page 175, Trial 266. and the following trial.


                  Thomas 
                  Meriton 
               



            . On the thirty first of May I was in bed, and heard a great knocking at my door, I thought it had been some people from on board my vessel. My wife got up and saw 
               
                  James 
                  Martin 
               



             go out at the door, and I heard somebody say I was robbed. I came down stairs, and they had got that young gentleman Mr. Martin [the Prisoner, a boy
 about thirteen years of age.] He immediately confessed the fact, and said, he would carry us where his confederates were, those that were along with him when he did it. He carried us to a house in the parish, which is called the blind woman's house, where I went in, but found nobody; I found nothing but two dead fowls , which they had stolen that night. I went up towards Rag Fair, and by the watch-house we took these three girls, and they carried us to Mr. Johnson's house, where I found the things.
Q. What did you find there?
Meriton. I found five waistcoats, &c.


                  John 
                  Johnson 
               



             [the Prisoner.] Take that man away, he is putting into his head what to say.
Badham [the constable.] I am only telling him that the things are here.
Meriton. The tea spoons were taken out of one of the girls pockets in New Prison.


                  Jane 
                  Johnson 
               



            . You say in New Prison, it was in Bridewell.
Meriton. I mistook, it was in Bridewell.


                  Jane 
                  Johnson 
               



            . You will say any thing.
Q. Does the out-house and dwelling-house join together?
Meriton. There is a yard between the out-house and the forehouse.


                  John 
                  Johnson 
               



            . I beg leave to speak, he has sworn to a cock and a hen, that he knows nothing of, he has made an information that he got them in my house.
Q. Did you ever swear you lost a cock and a hen? Did you swear so, or not?
Meriton. No; I never swore it.


                  John 
                  Johnson 
               



            . Ask him where he got [found] these clothes.
Meriton. The constable will make that appear presently.
Q. Did you see those things in his house?
Meriton. No.


                  Rachel 
                  Lambert 
               



            . On the 13th of May I ironed these clothes, and hung them in the back kitchen to be hardened off, and between three and four o'clock in the morning Martin came and stole them away.
Q. How do you know he stole them?
Lambert. It is by his own confession, I know no more than that, he said it in my master's own parlour. I went along with them into Rag Fair, and stood at Johnson's door, and received the things from the constable - These are my master's goods, and what I received out of Johnson's house.


                  Mary 
                  Fell 
               



            . I heard a cry of thieves, and saw the boy 
               
                  James 
                  Martin 
               



             run along with a quilted petticoat, a waistcoat, and one green stocking: he ran down a turning, and threw the goods into the porch of the door, and the people crying out Stop Thief, I stopped him, and run him up against a door, and he threw me down into the channel, but 
               
                  Benjamin 
                  Amstead 
               



             took him, then he begged Mr. Meriton to be favourable to him: he said he had been about half a year in that gang, and they sent him a thieving.


                  John 
                  Badham 
               



            . Captain 
               
                  Meriton
               


             sent to me in the morning, the boy was taken then; he said he would tell us where the things were: we went into Swan Alley, but there were none of the things there. I told him he had deceived us, then he said he would go and show us where the things were, and he went with us to this Mr. Johnson's. I knocked at the door, and they would not let us in - there was nobody appeared to open the door. I sent somebody round to see if there was not a back door. I looked in and saw a man and a woman go out of the room where they lay, one in his shirt, and the other in her shift, and they went towards the yard; then some of my assistants got in at the back door, and let us in at the fore door, and gave the things to me, and I delivered them to the Captain's maid, and she said here is something more than our due, that was a shirt unmade, and three plates. I went into the fore parlour, and Johnson was sitting with his coat on in the bed with a child by him. I asked him whether he was the master of the house, and he said he was not.


                  John 
                  Johnson 
               



            . Did I say so?
Badham. You would not own you was master of the house, and your wife run into the cellar.
Q. Recollect what answer he gave you when you asked him whether he was the master of the house?
Badham. He said he was not: I asked him where the woman of the house was, and he said he could not tell. I was informed by a little boy that a woman was run out at the cellar window, and run down the street, and was gone into a house. I asked him what house she was gone into, and he said into the Hay-field house. I desired the man of the house that he would assist me, and told him I should be obliged to him if he would, and he went up with me into the garret, and we secured her.
Q. When did you secure 
               
                  John 
                  Johnson 
               



            ?
Badham. We secured him at the same time.


                  John 
                  Johnson 
               



            . I desire he would ask the Prisoner Martin, whether he will not contradict him.
Q. Is that the man that denied himself?
Badham. That is the very man.


                  John 
                  Johnson 
               



            . Did not I ask you what you wanted?

Badham . Yes, and I told you I wanted the master of the house .


                  John 
                  Johnson 
               



             (to Capt. Meriton.) When I was asked whether I was master of the house, what answer did I make?
Meriton . You denied it.


                  John 
                  Johnson 
               



             . He will say any thing, what signifies my asking questions when he denies every thing .
Johnson (to Badham ) You said you would hang me for the reward.
Q. Did you ever declare that you would hang the Prisoner for the reward?
Badham. I never said any such thing.
Johnson . You did in Ratcliff Highway, you did, indeed you did, indeed you did.


                  William 
                  Carter 
               



            . I went with the rest of the witnesses to the back door, and found these goods by the vault door, (I do believe if I had not come as I did, they would have put them into the vault) and I delivered every thing that is here to the Constable. After I had got these things, Mrs. Johnson came out of the cellar, I think with only one petticoat on, and she desired liberty to go down to put on her things, which I gave her, and somebody said she had made her escape out at the cellar door, and was gone into the hay field; and I found her in that house, either in the room up 2 pair of stairs or in the garret, she struck at me, (she can fight a battle,) she struck at me like an ox, upon my foul, Sir.
Q. Did you break open the door to get at her?
Carter. I shoved against the door and it opened. I don't believe it was locked; there were 4 or 5 stout fellows and a woman in bed together. They did not make any resistance, she was very rustical in the house, but when I got her out of the house she came along very quietly.


                  Benjamin 
                  Amstead 
               



            . I went with the Con stable to Johnson's house, the Constable looked through the key hole, and bid us run round, the things were in the yard the outside of the house close to the vault door, and some of them had like to have been down in the vault. I run to the fore door and let them all in, I went into the fore room of the house, and Mr. Johnson was in bed with a young child. I was told that Mrs. Johnson was run out of the cellar window, and into the hay field house. I and the last witness went to the house, and told Mr. Bell the master of the house, that there was a woman run up who had received stolen goods. Then Mr. Bell said he would go up with us, we went up 3 pair of stairs and found her; she was going to shove us out of the room, but when Mr. Bell came up she came quietly out of the room.


                  Jane 
                  Johnson 
               



             . I would ask him whether the goods were at the back door of my house, or the thoroughfare that goes into the alley?
Amstead . They were in the yard belonging to Johnson's house close by the vault door.


                  Jane 
                  Johnson 
               



             . Was the door fast?
Amstead. No , it was wide open .


                  John 
                  Johnson 
               



             . There is a passage with about 50 houses in it, any person might put them in there, the Gentlemen of the Jury will consider this .


                  Q. 
               


            (to Badham .) When was it you first saw the Prisoner in his coat ?
Badham. The minute I came in I saw him in bed with his coat on .


                  John 
                  Johnson 
               



             . Now Gentlemen of the Jury. I hope you will take notice of this, he said it was a man in his shirt that he saw first.


                  Q. 
               


            (to Amstead .) You say you let Badham in, had Johnson a coat on then or had he not ?
Amstead. I cannot say whether he had a coat on or no, but he was in bed.
Carter. He sat in the bed with his coat on, and a child with him.


                  John 
                  Johnson 
               



            . There was a great mob, and I asked whether they had a right to come there, for I thought it was a press gang, and when I found what they were, I said if there's any goods that belong to you take them. I said, ask the boy [Martin] whether I received the goods of him. Ask Martin whether I did not say I knew nothing of them?


                  James 
                  Martin 
               



            . I am guilty of the fact, these girls know nothing at all of the matter.


                  Bernard 
                  Bourne 
               



             . Martin confessed that he robbed me that night of the goods that Mr. Meriton had brought to his house more than his own, and all the girls confessed that they received these goods from Martin, and had delivered them to Mr. Johnson , and had sold them to Johnson for 20 s. - Copeland and Monroe owned it, I remember particularly well, but I can't be positive to 
               
                  Esther 
                  Buck 
               



            ; Martin confessed that he got over Capt. Meriton's wall or pales, took the goods, and threw them over to these girls, and they carried them away.
Prisoner Martin. I did give the goods to somebody, but who I cannot tell, these are not the persons to be sure.
Capt. Meriton being called again, said, that Copeland, Monroe and Buck, confessed that they carried some of these things to Johnson's house. - The boy confessed it mighty publickly.


                  Elizabeth 
                  Davis 
               



            . I lodge in Johnson's house, on the 30th of May there was a sailor, a relation of mine and a ship mate of his lay there that night, they had got a ticket for the Winchester, and their time was out. I got up at 4 o'clock in the morning to call them up to go away, for they were afraid of being pressed . We went out and left the back door open, and I went with them as far as Execution Dock; there's no lock at all upon it, and the lodgers all go through that way.


                  John 
                  Johnson 
               



             . Was I sick in bed or not?

                  Plumberee 
               



             . I lived in that house and let it to Johnson, he is a Smith
 by trade, and has done several jobbs for me, he made something for me between 2 and 3 months ago; he did keep a Smith's shop but does not now: he pays his rent very honestly ; when I lived in this house the cellar window was not secure, and now I believe that it is so closed up that a woman cannot get out , there is no window or window shutter, there is only a great strong board, - it is impossible to get out at the window , there is no way to get out.
Johnson. I make rasps for the Bakers, and I make them better than ordinary. I don't sell them to the Ironmongers , because if I sell to them I must sell at a low price, but I only sell them to the Bakers, and then I have my price.

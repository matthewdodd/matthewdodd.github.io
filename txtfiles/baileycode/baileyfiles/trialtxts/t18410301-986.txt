JAMES MITCHELL
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
13th of January, 1 coat, value 1l., the goods of 



Michael Burns; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






MICHAEL BURNS
. I live in Erith parish. On the 13th of January I was in the Coach-and-Horses' public-house, at Woolwich, and I saw the prisoner there—I then went to the Crown-and-Mason public-house—I pulled off my coat, and laid it on the table—I began dancing—I told Elizabeth Hancock to look after my coat—after dancing, my coat was gone, and the prisoner also—I have not found it—the prisoner was in the room while I was dancing.





ELIZABETH HANCOCK
. I was at the public-house—the prosecutor put his coat on the table, and told me to watch it—I took it up, and gave it to the prisoner—I asked him if he would hold it till the prosecutor had done—when I saw it last the prisoner had it under his arm, and was sitting near the door—when the dancing was over, the prisoner and the coat were gone.





WILLIAM RICHARDSON
. I am a tailor, and live at Woolwich. I was at the public-house, and saw the prisoner deliberately walk out of the room with the coat either on or under his arm.

Prisoner. I saw the man that owned the coat two months or ten weeks ago, and he challenged me with the thing I am now arraigned for—he said, "I saw you in a public-house two months ago"—I said, "Why did you not get somebody to take me?"—he said he was not well—I have been about Woolwich ever since. Witness. This occurred in January, 1840, and he absconded for six or seven months.





DANIEL RIORDAN
 (police-constable R 207.) We had information of this, and were looking after the prisoner for six months. I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the man—I had him in charge.




GUILTY
. Aged 34.—


Transported for Seven Years.

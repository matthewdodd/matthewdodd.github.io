            . I am a taylor
, and live in Little Tower-street


. On the 10th of July, between seven and eight in the morning, I left my house to go to a public-house in the same street, and I left my door open. I saw the prisoner coming out of my house. I went and met him. I asked who he wanted there; I think he said Mrs. Jones. I supposed him to be a thief, so I took him back, and from under his coat I took the things mentioned in the indictment. (Produced and deposed to.)
Prisoner's Defence.
I was going down little Tower-street, and seeing these things lying close by this gentleman's door, I took them up, when the gentleman stopped me, and said they were his things. I went back with him, took them from under my arm, and gave them to him. I sell earthen ware about the streets

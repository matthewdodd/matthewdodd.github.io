 stealing on the

GEORGE TURNER
. I am a policeman. I was on duty on the 21st of November, at Limehouse and saw the two prisoners going down towards the City Canal and after passing us some distance they changed their hats—I and my brother officer followed them down to the canal—they went behind a quantity of timber and in about twenty minutes Martin came up with a long coil of rope on his shoulder and he met Smart about 300 yards off, who took it on his shoulder—my brother officer and I stopped them coming down the hill and found a knife on Martin—they were in company both before and afterwards.





CHARLES HAGAN
. I am an officer. I was with Turner—his evidence is correct.





THOMAS BLACKMORE
. I am a gateman in the West India Dock Company's service. I missed this rope on the Sunday morning—the prisoners were taken on the Saturday evening—It was taken from a boom at the entrance of the dock—It was cut—I swear positively to its being the Dock Company's property.





JOHN FOY
. I am an officer. I produce the Act of Parliament, constituting the West India Dock Company.


Smart's Defence. I was called out of bed, between five and six o'clock, to help this man carny the rope—I did not know where it was got from—the man told me to go on, and he would overtake me—I took the rope off shoulders, and helped to carry it.

SMART—

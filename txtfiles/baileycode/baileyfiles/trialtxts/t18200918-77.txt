            . I am shopman to Mr. Sparkes, a linen-draper, in Southampton-street. I saw Mr. Dent going down Southampton-street, and the prisoner with his hand in his pocket - a boy about twelve years of age was by his side. I ran out, at that time his hand was out of his pocket. I laid hold of the prisoner, and as I was calling Mr. Dent a boy said
"Look behind you." I looked, and found he he had thrown the handkerchief down on a grating, which I picked up. The little boy went off directly.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

Prisoner's Defence. I was coming along and he collared me, but I am innocent.

Dale Ingram. On the first Friday in last month I was coming from the Three-tun-tavern, Grace-church-street; about half an hour after 11 o'clock at night, coming into Fenchurch-street


, where I live, two men followed me: all on a sudden, as I thought, I heard a step near me. I turned about, and saw as it were the shadow of a man standing up near a door. He ran cross the way, and I followed him, having felt, and missed my handkerchief; in the mean time came up a young man; I told him what had happened; he called out watch. I looked and saw my handkerchief lying on the pavement, and took it up.
Q. When had you that handkerchief before ?
Ingram. It was given me by a captain that day.
Q. How near was the handkerchief to the prisoner?
Ingram. I believe about a yard, (produced in court and deposed to)


                  Charles 
                  Sherriff 
               



            . I was coming up Fenchurch-street between ten and eleven o'clock at night, or it might be after eleven. I saw Mr. Ingram and another man walking up the street. I heard Mr. Ingram say, sir you have picked my pocket of my handkerchief. Upon which I ran up and seized a man by the collar; (it was the prisoner) he dropt the handkerchief by Mr. Ingram's leg.
Q. Did you see him drop it?
Ingram. I did. The watch came and took him away.
Prisoner's defence.
The gentleman laid hold of me first of all; and the prosecutor was not near me.

            . I am shopman to Mr. John Brown, who is a linen-draper
, and lives at the corner of Parliament-street


 - I sleep in the shop. On the 2d of February, about ten minutes after seven o'clock in the morning, I was getting up, and heard a crack at the window; I went round the shop, but could perceive nothing. I got down again, and heard it crack the second time. I rose up, and saw the prisoner at the window; I went round to the private door, and saw the prisoner cutting the glass - he walked to and fro, and in the mean time I unfastened the door. He came to the window again, pushed the glass in, and 
               drew
             a shawl out - I opened the door, and seized him with it, I took him into the shop; he threw it on the counter, and said he did not do it.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

            . I took the prisoner in charge; I found a knife on him with three instruments in it - it was marked with putty.

            . I am a basket-maker, and live in Coventry-court, Haymarket, and work in Rupert-street. On the 14th of August, about half-past five o'clock, Bailey and I were walking together, heard the cry of Stop thief! turned round, and saw the prisoners running in the road from the cry in Rupert-street. I tried to catch hold of the prisoner, but missed, and Bailey stopped him - he immediately dropped two spoons.

            . I am a watchman. I saw the prisoner and another man at the corner of Macclesfield-street, the other was fishing down the prosecutor's area, and hooked some spoons up the window. They saw me, and ran away. I followed, crying Stop thief, till the prisoner was secured, he threw three spoons down; I picked one up, and Bailey two.

WILLIAM HANWOOD. I am a porter
 to Mr. Broughton. On Sunday morning I was in George-street, St. Giles'


, just opposite the chapel, about a quarter-past four o'clock; I had been out with a friend, and was going home; I was standing for a minute - the prisoner and two others came round - the prisoner stood for a moment, and then caught these shoes from under my arm - I pursued, and the watchman took him; I am sure he is the lad; I was quite sober; I had lost sight of him; he hid the shoes on a wheelbarrow - I am not quite certain what jacket he had on, but am certain he is the boy; he was taken in ten or twelve minutes - the other two threw me down, or I should have taken him; I looked him full in the face.

            . I am a watchman. I saw the prosecutor - he was quite sober; I heard an alarm - he came to my box, and said he was robbed of a pair of shoes; I went with him - we met the prisoner coming out of a court - he pointed him out; I found the shoes in a barrow, in the court, with a little straw over them; the court is no thoroughfare; he was all of a tremble.(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I had been to market, to carry some fruit for a person, and was coming home, when he took me.

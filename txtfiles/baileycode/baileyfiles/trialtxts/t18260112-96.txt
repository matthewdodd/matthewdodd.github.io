SIMON ISAACS. I live in Field's-buildings, Houndsditch - I deal in watches and other articles
. On the 14th of October I gave the prisoner a leather trunk to take on board a ship, to go abroad; I was going with it - I went to the Custom House, expecting to meet him there, but he did not come; I have seen some of the articles since, which had been pawned - he was a poor man I used to employ for charity.

            . I am a pawnbroker. On the 15th of October the prisoner pawned four pairs of stockings and three half handkerchiefs. I had known him before, as a customer.

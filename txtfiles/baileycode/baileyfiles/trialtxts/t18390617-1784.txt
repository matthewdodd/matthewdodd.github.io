SAMUEL HARVEY
. I am a linen-draper, and lived on St. Andrew's-hill. On the 23rd of May, I was in St. James's-street, a little before ten o'clock—there was a scuffle and crowd behind me—I turned round, and saw the two prisoners in custody—I missed my handkerchief from my coat-pocket—it was produced to me—I had had it five minutes before.





JOHN EATON
 (police-constable S 193.) On the 23rd of May I first saw the prisoners in Pall Mall—Tarsey was trying people's pockets in the crowd—Keate was in his company, covering him—I followed them up St. James's-street, and at the corner of Jermyn-street I saw Tarsey put his hand into the prosecutor's pocket, take his handkerchief, and give it to Keate—I took them both, and Keate threw the handkerchief down.





WILLIAM LIGHTFOOT
 (police-constable S 165.) I was with my brother officer—I saw Tarsey take the handkerchief, and give it to Keate—Eaton took hold of them, and Keate threw the handkerchief down—I took it up, and we took them to the station-house.
(Keate received a good character.)

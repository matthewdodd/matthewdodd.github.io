JOHN JAMES
 and 




JAMES FANNING
 were indicted for

 stealing 1 handkerchief, value 3s. 6d., the goods of 



Thomas Goodson, from his person.






THOMAS GOODSON
. I live in Bartlett's-buildings, Holborn. On the 31st of Aug. I was walking in the Strand with another gentleman—the policeman came and spoke to me—I felt in my pocket and missed my handkerchief,

which ought to have been in my pocket—I think it had been there about half an hour before—I have not seen it again.





ROBERT BRAY
 (police-constable A 43.) Between seven and eight o'clock in the evening of Saturday, the 31st of Aug., I was on duty in the Strand in the neighbourhood of Charing-cross—I saw both the prisoners, and another in company with them—I watched them, and saw James take a handkerchief from the prosecutor's pocket—I went up, and took him by the collar—my brother officer took another—while I went to the prosecutor a gentleman said he would take one, but he got away—there was a great crowd of persons, but I do not know what became of the handkerchief—Fanning was holding the tail of the other gentleman's pocket, while James took the handkerchief out of the prosecutor's pocket.





THOMAS HARDWICK
 (police-constable A 174.) I was with Bray that night—I saw the prisoners and another near Charing-cross—they followed two gentlemen down the street leading to the right, near to Hungerford-market—they turned back again, and met the prosecutor and his friend—James took the handkerchief from the prosecutor's pocket, and Fanning was handling the other gentleman's pocket—I seized the man that has escaped—a gentleman said he would hold him, but he got away—I do not know what has become of the handkerchief.

James's Defence. I did not see Fanning that night; he was not in my company.

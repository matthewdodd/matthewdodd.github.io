            : we had been out last Tuesday, and came home about twelve at night: the prisoner Nichollus was our servant
, to whom we had left the care of the house; in the morning about four she came into my room, and asked me for the key of the street door; she said a man call'd for a basket, to carry some cats down to the horses; I thought it was rather sooner than he used to come; I got out of bed, and could see no man: I made her go to bed again, and took the key of the street-door into my room: about six o'clock our man came, and there was nobody to let him in; I got up and let him in; I found my wash-house window open, then I miss'd the things mentioned in the indictment, (mentioning them) and a 3 l. 12 s. piece. I went in pursuit of her, and found her at Kensington, in the barracks, and a bundle of things, all my property: I took her before a Justice; there she owned she had robbed us the night before, and that she had given some of the things away; that the soldier

             had a shirt, a stone-button, a piece of velvet and a handkerchief: he was taken up, and the things found in his knapsack; he said he did not know that she had stolen them: I asked him if ever he had been at our house; he said he never had. (The goods mentioned produced and deposed to.)

            . I am in partnership with Mr. Taylor: on the Wednesday morning the first thing I heard was, that the wash-house window was open; then Mrs. Taylor looked about and miss'd the things; the girl being gone at the time: we had heard a soldier at Kensington was acquainted with her: Mrs. Taylor went to the barracks, and sent me word she had found the prisoner: I went there and saw the things she had taken: we took the prisoner before the Justice; there she confessed she had a key that opened a closet door, where Mrs. Taylor's bunch of keys were; that with them she opened the drawers and took the things: then she was committed.
Nichollus said nothing in her defence.

When this girl came to me, she told me she lived with her uncle and aunt; and the things she gave me, she said her aunt gave to her; I was in bed, and she sent the things up stairs by the man that was centry at the barracks, about four o'clock in the morning.

            . The prisoner is a soldier, and was in the barracks at Kensington: I had seen the woman at the bar before: she came to me between three and four o'clock that morning, and enquired if

             was within; and gave me a handkerchief with some things in it, and desired me to deliver them to him; and tell him to come to her directly; she wanted to speak to him, for she lived with her aunt, and must be at home before she got up. I went and gave him the things, and told him what she said: he got up and came down to her: I can't tell how long they were together: I did not see the bundle opened: I was quartered with him once about a quarter of a year; I never saw any misbehaviour by him.

            . I am the prisoner's brother, and live at Hammersmith: my brother used to come and see me there: I never saw him and the young woman together, neither do I know that he ever went to Mr. Taylor's house.

            . I am in the employ of Mr. 
               
                  James 
                  Pincott
               



            , a linen-draper
, of Oxford-street


. On the 3rd of January the two Nays came to the shop, about four o'clock, and asked to look at some black handkerchiefs at half a crown each - I looked over the box, but had not one at that price; I showed them one at 1s. 6d. - others laid before them; I turned to speak to a young man, and they went out, without buying any thing - I did not miss any handkerchiefs till the officer brought them back, with the prisoners, in about half an hour; we then missed these five handkerchiefs out of the box which I had shown them.

            . I am a Police-constable. I was on duty, and saw the three prisoners in company in Regent-street - I followed them some distance; I did not see any of them go into the prosecutor's shop, nor come out, but I took Williams in Waterloo-place, about half-past four o'clock - I searched him at the station, and found these five handkerchiefs between his shirt and his skin.

            . When Currie took Williams, I saw the two Nays running; I took them in Pull-Mall - nothing was found on them.

            . I am a Policeman. I have a certificate of the conviction of

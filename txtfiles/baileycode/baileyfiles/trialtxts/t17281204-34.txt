                           Richard 
                           Nutt 
                        



                      
                  , on the 21st of November last, in the Dwelling-House of 
                     
                        Richard 
                        Nutt 
                     



                   aforesaid
            ; and 
               
                  
                     Thomas 
                     Hamnet 
                  



               
             was indicted for 


               receiving the same, knowing it to be stolen
            .
The Prosecutor depos'd, That he being inform'd of the Prisoner 
               
                  John 
                  Ayres 
               



             stealing his Paper, he charg'd him with it; that he confess'd the Fact, and said, he sold it to one 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Hamnet 
               



            , a Cheesemonger
 in Black-fryars



; that he took 35 lb. weight at a Time, and sold it to the said 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Hamnet 
               



            , for three Half-pence a Pound. The Prosecutor being ask'd several Questions, it appear'd by his Answers, that he only, had the the Property of the Books call'd, The Historical Register, that the Quires mention'd in the Indictment had been printed about four Years, and that he did not sell the Books in Quantities to any Person, the Booksellers seldom sending for above two or three at one Time, that it is a Book which still continues to be sold, and for which there is a reasonable Demand; and that the Paper stole out of his Warehouse by Ayres was entire Books, and not waste Paper, neither had he any Right to sell the said Paper as waste Paper, or any other Pretence whatsoever. Ayres's Confession was read in Court, sign'd with his own Hand before Sir 
               
                  William 
                  Billers 
               



            , in which he own'd he sold the Paper to Hemnet for Three Half-pence a Pound, and besides this Confession, Mr. Betterson, Servant to Mr. Nutt, prov'd Ayres's going out of the House with the Paper, and getting off before he could take him, and further said, that he was present when the Paper was found at 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Hamnet 
               



            's House, and that then Hamnet confess'd he bought it for three Half-pence a Pound.
Ayres said in his Defence, That Hamnet persuaded him to sell this Paper; that he first carried waste Paper, call'd Copy, but he refus'd to buy that, but when he carried the Paper mention'd in the Indictment, he bought it, and encourag'd him to bring more; but Ayres being a Prisoner, and Indicted, what he said was no Evidence against Hamnet; and Hamnet bringing several Tradesmen into Court, who severally depos'd, That they bought Paper good and clean for three Half-pence a pound, and some saying, they had bought this very Historical Register in Quires for that Price, and others appearing for his Character, the Jury 

               acquitted
             him, but found Ayres 


               guilty to the Value of 39 s.

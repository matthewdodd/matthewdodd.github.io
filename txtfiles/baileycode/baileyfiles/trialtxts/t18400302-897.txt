ANN STEWARD
. I am the wife of James Steward; we live in Cottage-buildings, St. Pancras. On the 20th of February the prisoner came and asked for a lodging—I had a room empty, and I took her in—(I take in servants out of place)—I said I would charge her 2s. a week—she gave me 6d. earnest, and said she would return in a short time, and when she brought her box she would pay me the other 1s. 6d.—she came back, I was sitting alone, making up caps, and she offered to make up one for me—I thanked her, but did not accept of her offer—my husband came home, and we had supper—the prisoner said she had had her supper—she then went to bed—the next morning she came down, and I asked if she would take breakfast—she said no, she could not take breakfast till she had done some work—after I had done breakfast I asked her if she was going out—she said no—I said, "I must go out to get something for dinner"—she said she would not go out till I returned—I came back in about a quarter of an hour, and found my door ajar—I missed my watch and table-cloth, which I had taken

off the table after breakfast—I then missed the other things—the prisoner was gone—I went to give an alarm—I did not see her again till she was in custody—the property has been found—it is mine—(looking at it.)





MARY ANN HOUSEDEN
. I keep a shop in Monmouth-street. I bought this table-cloth and these other things of the prisoner for 1s. 8d.—she said they were her own.





GEORGE PORTSMOUTH
 (police-constable E 117.) On the 21st of February I received information of this, and found the prisoner in Museum-street—I took her to the station-house, and this watch was found in her hand.

            . I live in White's-gardens, Bethnal-green-road. On the 30th of April, at half-past five o'clock in the morning, I received some information from my wife, and saw the prisoner carrying these things in a basket, on his shoulder; I followed him about one hundred yards - he dropped them, and ran away; I took them to my house; I knew the prisoner well - his father lives next door to me.

            . I am an officer. I produce the property, and took the prisoner.
THOMAS HEMS. I am a carpenter
. These tools are mine; I left them in a locker of an unfinished house, and saw them safe at ten o'clock the night before they were taken: I know the prisoner as a neighbour; his father is an elder in the India-house.

            . I am drayman to Sir Benjamin Hobhouse and Co., at the brewhouse, in Chiswell-street. On the 8th of October the dray stood at the door of the Magpie and Stump public-house


; a man came into the house to me in about ten minutes, and said one of the nose-bags was gone from the horse's head; I went and saw the prisoner with it under his arm, about a quarter of a mile off: he saw me running, and threw the bag away - I caught him, without losing sight of him; he said he did it because he was hungry.

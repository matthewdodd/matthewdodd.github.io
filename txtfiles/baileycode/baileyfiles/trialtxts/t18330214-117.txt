            . I am the wife of George Warne. The prisoner was our errand-boy
 - we had missed articles; I spoke to him about the articles mentioned in this indictment - he said he knew nothing about them; I sent for an officer on the 8th of February, and the prisoner at last told him he had pawned part and sold part.

             (Police-constable T 20.) I was sent for, and the prisoner told me at last that he had sold one spoon in Tottenham-court-road and the other in Holborn, and the flat-iron he had pawned in the Edgware-road; I found the iron accordingly.

            . I live in the New-road, and am a silversmith. I bought this spoon of the prisoner for 1s. 9d. - he told me he had found it in the Hampstead-road; it was bent as it is now - I had no suspicion of its being dishonestly come by; I would have sold it for 2s. to any one.
Prisoner. I did not have half enough to eat, and that was why I took it.
MRS. WARNE. I gave him many meals, and 1s. 6d. a week, and he had money at other times.

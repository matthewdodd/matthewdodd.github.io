            . On the afternoon of the 24th of March I was in Wych-street, Strand


 - I distinctly felt a hand in my pocket; I put my hand into my pocket, and missed my handkerchief - I turned, and saw the prisoner and two boys behind me; I saw my handkerchief behind the prisoner, on the ground - I laid hold of him, and said, "You have my handkerchief;" I had seen one of the boys give it to the prisoner just before - I took hold of him; the prisoner and that boy were within reach of my person - I did not see the handkerchief in his hand, but I saw his hand in the act of giving something to the prisoner; it was all done in a moment.

            . I reside at the Herald's College, Doctors'-commons. I was with the prosecutor on the 23rd of March; I saw him turn round, and saw the handkerchief drop from under the prisoner's coat tail at the instant I laid hold of him - I kept him till the officer came; I saw the prosecutor take up the handkerchief - I did not see the other boy at all.

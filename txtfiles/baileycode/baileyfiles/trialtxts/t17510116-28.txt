            . On or about the 28th of Nov. this stable was broke open, and a saddle, a green saddle cloth, and two bridles were taken out. I know nothing of the prisoner.
Q. Is this your stable?

            . About two months ago the two prisoners came to my house, and said they saw something like a saddle in a pond, and wanted to borrow a pale, I was in bed; when I got up I saw a saddle hang up to dry in my stable; I advised them to take it to Hackney where they lived; they said they would let it hang till they saw it advertised; they came several days after that to look in the advertiser, to know who was the owner.

            . When I heard the prosecutor had been robbed, I went to a prisoner in Bridewell, who told me, he and the two prisoners stole the saddle and things mentioned, and four pewter dishes; then I went and let the gentleman know about the saddle and things.

            . I got over the gate and opened it for the two prisoners ; they helped me up to a window that goes into the lost; I got in and got the saddle and two bridles, a whip and saddle-cloth. We went and hid them in a hollow tree three or four days; afterwards they took the saddle out and flung it into a pond near Mr. Dale's house.

Q. Was you with them?
Lightwood. No, I was not, my lord, but they told me so: they brought me 16 pence, and said they had sold it to Mr. Dale for four shillings; we sold the pewter dish in Shoreditch for 2 s. I sold one of the bridles for six-pence to a man in Newington road, and

                  Nutbrown 
               



             sold the other; we shar'd the money.
The prisoners had nothing to say.
To John Nutbrown's Character.
Mr. Legg. I have known both the prisoners about five years; I always looked upon John to be a very grave, sober, inoffensive young fellow as ever I knew in my life; nothing gave me greater surprise than reading the public papers concerning him.
Faithful Tate. I have known John between two and three years; he is a very sober honest young man, I have worked many a day with him.

            . I have known both the prisoners from their infancy, the eldest, John, always bore a very good character, he has lived in several gentlemens services; I never heard any ill of him.
Both 

               acquitted
            .
They were indicted a second time for 


               stealing one pair of buck-skin breeches, three shirts, three pair of stockings, one hat, one pair of leather shoes, in the stable of

Lightwood being the only evidence in this, they were both 

               acquitted

They were a third time indicted for that they on the 1st of January


, 


               about the hour of one in the night of the same day, the dwelling-house of

                   did break and enter, and stealing out thence one clock, three hoop-petticoats, two hempen sacks, some lead and brass

            . I am beadle, on the 2d of this month, about eight or nine in the morning I was sent for to the sign of the Globe. When I came there, I was informed there were some persons in the hay-stack, which they had seen before. While I was talking with them, the evidence which is here came down out of the field, with a sack on his back, he turned towards London; I followed him and collared him, and saw the two prisoners moving, and said stop them two persons which are gone over the way, so Joseph Mitchel took them; we carried them into the Globe, they had each a bundle; we opened their bags and found some lead, and the brass work of a clock knocked in pieces; the evidence had lead, brass and a lathing hammer, which the prisoner, 
               
                  John 
                  Nutbrown 
               



            , said was his; we carried them to the justice's, there the evidence confessed 18 robberies, and the prisoners were committed upon his evidence.


                  Joseph 
                  Mitchel 
               



            . I saw the prisoners in Mr. Smith's field, he keeps the Globe at Hackney, they were under a stack of hay, and both asleep : I said to my self, I will let you sleep on, so I went into the house, and told the maid, my master being in bed. Some time after I went to see and found them rising; I saw 
               
                  John 
                  Nutbrown 
               



             take the piece of sheet lead up and sling it down upon the hay, it looked white being mouldy; I took it to be cloth at first, then my master was got up. I told him what I had seen; my master sent me for the beadle. The rest as the former witness.


                  William 
                  Lightwood 
               



            . On New-year's-day at night the two prisoners and I got over a high pannel of pales, then over a brick wall; we all went into a stable and got out a short ladder, the stable door was open; 
               
                  John 
                  Nutbrown 
               



             carried it through the garden, he got upon the wall first, and we handed the ladder up to him, and set it into a cistern, which was about a foot deep in water, then John got upon the house, and Miles and I followed him; he had that bricklayer's hammer and untiled the house on the top.
Q. Where is this house?
Lightwood. It is at Hackney




, nobody lived in it; we got down into the ceiling, so down into the garret and then into the house: we got three hoop-petticoats and two hempen sacks; and cut the brass off an old harness that lay in a closet; 
               
                  John 
                  Nutbrown 
               



             knocked the clock to pieces; we took the works away, and then got out at the window. 
               
                  John 
                  Nutbrown 
               



             took a piece of lead from off the cistern, and we went to lie under the hay stack to sleep till morning; we all from thence went up Globe lane, and the men laid hold of us; we were going to Radcliff-highway to sell the things. I had some old lead in my bag; 
               
                  John 
                  Nutbrown 
               



             had some old rags and a bit or two of brass; Miles had two hoop-petticoats and some brass.


                  Joseph 
                  Fackney 
               



             deposed to the house being broke open as the evidence said, and produced the dial plate of the clock, which fitted to the fore plate of the works, and the coach brass he said be believed to be his property, but would not swear to that.
Both 


               guilty of stealing, but not in the dwelling-house
            .

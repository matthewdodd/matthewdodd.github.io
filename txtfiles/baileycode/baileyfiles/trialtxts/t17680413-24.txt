            . I live at the Carlisle alehouse in Shoreditch


. On the 2d of March I lost four silver tea-spoons and half a pound of green tea out of a tea-chest; the prisoner had been in the room about that time; we suspected him, and charged him with taking them; he owned before Justice Girdler that he had taken them, and that he had sold the spoons to Mr. Jones, a silversmith; we went there, and he told us he had melted down all his old silver.

            . I am brother to the prosecutor; the prisoner is a clock-maker
; he was in the room doing something to my brother's clock, at the time the spoons and tea were lost; he was taken up, and charged with taking them, and he owned he had taken them, and sold them for 6 s.
Prisoner's defence.
I was all the day long cleaning the clock up one pair of stairs; he came down to me afterwards, and told me he had lost his tea-spoons; I desired him to send for an officer and search me; he took me before Justice Girdler; the Justice persuaded me to own I took the things, he said it would be better for me.

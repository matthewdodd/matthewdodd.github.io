GEORGE ADAMS
was indicted

for stealing, on the 
1st of June, 50 yards of rope, value 3s., the goods of 



John Mereditch.






ROBERT HILL, 
(police-constable R184.) I was at Woolwich on the 1st of June—I saw the prisoner near the market-place, where the circus is kept—he was carrying this rope, which I now produce, under his arm—I asked how he came by it—he said his mother gave it him to sell—I took him to his mother—she denied all knowledge of it—I then found the prosecutor.






CAHRLES HARDY.
I am foreman to John Mereditch. This rope is his—it was under the carriage where we make the platform—I know it by a knot which I tied in it.

Prisoner's Defence. I found it against the show.

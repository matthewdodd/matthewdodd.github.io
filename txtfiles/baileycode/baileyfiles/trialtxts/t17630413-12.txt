, and live in Threadneedle-street


. On the 26th of Feb. the Barber was shaving me in my compting-house, I heard Holland's voice call stop thief, I went to my shop door, and about a dozen doors from my house I saw the prisoner, and some other people that had taken him bringing him back, he was carried to the watch-house. I missed 13 pair of stockings, which I saw at the Mansion-house on the Monday following. I asked him at the watch-house, how he came to go into people's houses to take things? He at first denied he had taken any thing, but at last he said, he could not go home to his lodging without some money to pay his lodging, which was the occasion he did it.

            . I am a relation to the prosecutor. The prisoner came into our shop, I saw him reach over the counter and take this parcel of stockings (produced and deposed to) from off a shelf, I was at the back part of the shop, he ran out, and I after him, and called stop thief; a man stopped him, he struck the man, and flung down the stockings, I took them up; I never left sight of the prisoner after I was out of the shop till he was taken.

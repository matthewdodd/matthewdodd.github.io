            . I am wife to the prosecutor. My door was broke open on the 23d of July, and a silk and stuff gown, and a silk clock and other things, were taken away: I inquired about, and found the gown and clock at a pawnbroker's: after that he went to the pawnbroker's again, and was stopt: I never saw him till I was sent for after he was taken.
Mr. Barnwell. The prisoner pledged this gown and cloak to me on the 23d of July, between seven and eight in the evening, for 6 s. About an hour after, a person came from the prosecutor, and ask'd if I had taken such things in: I said I had: then Mrs. Hall came and owned them: we bid her be still, and we would stop the man that brought them next time he came; and on the 12th of August the prisoner came again to pledge a hat, and we secured him.

I have nothing to say.

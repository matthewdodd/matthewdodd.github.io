BRIDGET MARY BLAKE
 was indicted

 for stealing 1 candlestick, value 1s.; 1 fire-shovel, 1s.; and 4 plates, 1s.; the goods of 



David Holden; and that she had been before convicted of felony.






DAVID HOLDEN
. I am a broker, and live in Hog-lane, Greenwich. On the 18th of Jan. I saw the prisoner with a candlestick belonging to me—I did not say anything to her, but went home and asked my boy about it—I then missed the candlestick, the fire-shovel, and the plates—I sent my boy after her—this is my candlestick and fire-shovel.





THOMAS MOORE
. I went after the prisoner, and took this candlestick from her—it is my master's.





ELIZABETH BEALE
. I am the wife of Thomas Beale. I saw the prisoner

come out of the prosecutor's house with the shovel and the platesI did not see the candlestick.

Prisoner's Defence. I met a woman coming up against me; she asked me to hold these things while she went up to Mr. Buck's for a piece of pork; I stood at the door where she gave me the things, and as she stopped I walked carelessly up the street; when the boy came to me he said, "Mistress, that is not yours;" I said, "Is it yours?" I thought he was the woman's child; I walked back after him, and said to the prosecutor "If these are yours take them; and if you will come after me to Mr. Back's I will show you the person I had them of;" he would not.

JURY to DAVID HOLDEN. Q. Did she ask you to go and see the person who gave them to her? A. No, she did not.





JOHN BUCKMASTER
 (police-constable R 42.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Maidstone—(read—"Convicted on the 29th of June, 6th Vict., and imprisoned two months")—the prisoner is the person—she has been tried here twice and acquitted.




GUILTY
. Aged 32.—


Transported for Seven Years.

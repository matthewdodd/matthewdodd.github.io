It appeared upon the evidence that the tools mentioned in the indictment were left by the work men in a bay lost belonging to their master, and were missed the next morning; that the prisoner was pursued on suspicion of another robbery, the constable when he secured him found the saws, mentioned in the indictment, in the lining of his coat; (the tools were produced and deposed to by the different owners of them.)
The prisoner in his defence said he bought them of a young fellow he met in the street; he called one witness who gave him a good character.

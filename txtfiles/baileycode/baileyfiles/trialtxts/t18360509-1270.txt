CHARLES GREEN
. On the evening of the 9th of May I was in Bridge-lane—I received information, and saw the prisoner running before me with my handkerchief in his hand—I pursued him, and called "Stop thief"—I saw my handkerchief in St. Bride's church-yard—he passed round there, and could throw it into the church-yard.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

Prisoner. I was in Bride-lane, and heard a cry of "Stop thief", and a young man passed me very quickly—there was a man with a sack of charcoal—I fell down, and as I got up this gentleman came and took me—I did not take the handkerchief—I had another handkerchief in my hand.





ANN PARKER
. I live in Bride-lane. I saw the prisoner, at about half-past six o'clock that evening, in company with another—he made an attempt, opposite my father's door, to pick the prosecutor's pocket—I followed him, and saw him take the handkerchief, and I saw him taken into custody.





ROBERT MASON
 (City police-constable, No. 91) I heard a cry of "Stop thief"—I found the prisoner in possession of the property—and with the prosecutor's umbrella, I got this handkerchief from the church-yard.




GUILTY
. † Aged 21.—


Transported for Fourteen Years.

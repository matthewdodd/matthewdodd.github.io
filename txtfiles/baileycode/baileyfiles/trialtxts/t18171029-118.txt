            . I live in Bury-street, St. James's, and have a house in Smith-street, Chelsea


. In the beginning of September, the prisoner applied to me to rent that house of me. He looked at it, and next day he sent a person to look over the house and furniture - I shewed him over it, I was living in it at the time. I asked him for a reference - He referred me to Mrs. Gunn, No.33, Lainb's Conduit-street - she gave me a good character of him. I entered into a written agreement with him to take the house, furnished, at 130l. per annum - He brought the agreement with him; he was to enter the house on the Thursday following; he had possession on the 13th of September. On the 12th of September, the day before he entered the house, he came and borrowed some linen of me to take to the house - He said his wife was in the country, and he had no linen until she returned I lent him nine pair of sheets, four napkins, six towels, six small tablecloths, six pair of fine pillow-cases, three servants' pillow-cases, and some chamber-towels. I delivered them into his hands on the 13th, with an inventory of them; he compared them with the inventory, I kept a copy of it. He told me he would bring Mrs. Gunn to say what I should have a week for the use of them-she never came, it was never settled with me as to what I was to have; he signed the agreement for taking the house.
Q. The linen is distinct from the furniture left in the house - A. Yes. I delivered the key of the cellar to him on the 13th; there was one eight-gallon cask of currant-wine, and a gallon stone bottle there of mine; he said he would take care of them for me. On the 9th of October I called upon him for 5l. which he had agreed to pay me up to Michaelmas. He said he had not got it, but would go into the City and get it of a friend. He said he was sorry I had not asked him for it before, as he had lent a friend a sum of money for ten days, or he could have let me have money to any amount; he said he would send it to me by twelve o'clock - He did not. I received a letter, which I believe to be in his hand-writing. In consequence of information which I received, I suspected him, and applied to him for a reference to a respectable person - He referred me to Mr. Sandall, No.2, Wilson-street, Gray'sinn-lane. He said he was a Special Pleader.
Q. On the 18th of October, did you go to the house in Smith-street - A. Mr. Paul, the broker, had levied a distress on the premises, and applied to me. I went to the house, and searched for the linen in every place, but could find none of it, except three sheets, three pillow-cases, and a few towels - We never found them. I went to the cellar, found the wine-bottle taken away, and the cask had onlya little wine at the bottom-the prisoner was not then in the house. I saw a boy there. I am not positive when I first went to the house, whether I saw a servant, or not.
Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. Q. The 130l. was to be paid for the rent of the house and the use of the furniture - A. The articles stated in the indictment are not in the inventory of the furniture. I did not agree to let the house with the linen-it had nothing to do with the house.
Q. He was to pay you for the use of the linen - A. He was to have it till his wife returned, for three weeks. When I delivered the linen, I expected Mrs. Gunn to come and say what was to be paid for the use of it. A distress was put into the house about a month after he took it. I asked him for the linen; he said, he would not give it up at so short a notice. Five pounds was to be paid for the house up to Michaelmas. The distress was put in because I could not pay the rent. There was not a basket of clothes in the kitchen.

                  PAUL
               



            . I am a broker. On the 8th of October I levied a distress in the house for rent due to Mr. Foulger, the landlord, and I took an inventory of the goods. I looked over part of the house, and the drawers and closets-the prisoner was on the premises; he refused to open four of the rooms. I told him I would send for a constable if he did not open them - He said he could not, and went away, saying, he would return presently. Finding he did not return I went out for a smith, and when I returned, which was in about an hour, I found him on the premises - I had left a man in possession. The prisoner said he would give up the keys, as he found when the landlord was in possession, it was no use withholding them. I went into these rooms, and took an account of every thing. I was very particular in taking the inventory, as I had received information before I went to the house. I found two sheets upon one bed, two pillow-cases and one sheet on another bed, and thirteen towels in the drawers, among which I reckon dusters, knife-cloths &c.; I found no table-linen at all-there was no more linen in the house. I saw Mrs. Baylis the same day at a neighbour's house where she met me - I left my man in possession. I compared my inventory with Mrs. Baylis's. I did not go into the cellar until six days afterwards, I then found the cask there, with a little wine at the bottom. When I first saw the prisoner, he said, he knew pretty well what it was for, and he expected us there on the Saturday; and that he had a solicitor and counsel, and knew what he was about.
Cross-examined. The prosecutrix desired me to take notice of the linen. I found the prisoner's wife, a girl, a boy, and a man, who was a friend of the female servant's, in the house. A great deal of the furniture was gone.
Q. You saw the boxes under the bed on the second floor-A. There were none. I looked there.
Q. In the second floor front room - A. There was a box, which the prosecutrix said belonged to her, and contained her clothes. The prisoner said the linen was gone to be washed-it would be home on Tuesday, and if we would come then we should have it-it was not brought home on the Tuesday. The prisoner absconded, and was taken into custody on the Tuesday. If there had been any more boxes I must have seen them. I did not examine the servants' boxes; they were in the back-room on the second floor.
Court. Q.What passed between you and the prisoner about the linen - A. He said if I would come on Tuesday, and then I should have the linen; I had said nothing to him about linen-it was not brought back all the while I was possession which was six days.

            . I was left in the care of the house. I never touched the wine.
Cross-examined. I was mostly in the kitchen - I had no friends call on me while I was there.
RICHARD MAYBANK. I am an officer. I apprehended the prisoner and found four duplicates on him; one dated 21st of October, for a hat, pledged for 7s., one on the 15th, for a pair of shoes, pledged for 3s. two fruit-knives, pledged on the 8th of July, for 5s., and one for a shirt; all pledged in the name of

            .
Cross-examined. The hat was bought that day of a man for 27s., and pledged for 7s.
Prisoner's Defence. My servant will prove that the man in possession drank the wine.

                  SULLIVAN
               



            . I am the prisoner's servant. I had lived eight days with him when the execution came in; the man who was in possession, was mostly in the back parlour and the kitchen; he and the boy drank profusely of the wine. I never saw my master take any.
Q. Was there any linen in a basket when the execution came in - A. Yes; in the kitchen on a chair, there were towels, table-cloths, and some of Mrs. Wilkin's clothes; there were two trunks on the second floor-Mr. Paul did not touch them.
Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. I do not know how my master gets his living. I suppose my master gave the washerwoman the linen; I do not know where she lives-my master never drank wine.
Q.Wine drank in the kitchen and not in the parlour - A. Yes.
Court. Q. There were four bedsteads in the house-how many sheets were on your bed - A. One, my master had two-the boy made his own bed.
Q. On your oath, did you ever see more than three sheets - A. No, never.

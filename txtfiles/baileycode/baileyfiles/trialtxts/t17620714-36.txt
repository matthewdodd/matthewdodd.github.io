            . I live in the Strand. I have known the prisoner above a year by sight. I had kept the prisoner out of charity for near a month.
Q. How old is she?
Moise. Her brother told me to-day she is twenty years of age. I left her in charge with these things, and went out last Sunday, about twelve o'clock. When I came home she was gone, and left my door open. She did not come home. I went to bed, and in the morning I missed the things mentioned in the indictment. She owned she had taken the things, and had pawned them at different places.
Three different pawnbrokers produced the several things, and deposed the prisoner pawned them.

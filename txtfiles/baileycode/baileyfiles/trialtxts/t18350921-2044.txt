THOMAS PETRE
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
27th of May, I cruet-frame, value 10l.; and 8 cruets, value 2l.; the goods of 



Emanuel Emanuel, in his dwelling-house.






EMANUEL EMANUEL
. I live in Great Coram-street. My family left town on the 27th of May—the house was put into the care of the prisoner's father and mother—the prisoner had formerly been employed as a porter by me—I had a cruet-frame, before the 27th of May—the value of it was 12l—10l., the frame, and 2l. the glasses—I had eight cruets, worth 40s.,—my house is in the parish of St. George, Bloomsbury—I missed the cruets and stand about a fortnight ago, from a plate-chest at the top of the house.





ARTHUR JOHN NORTH
. I produce these four cruets; they were pledged with me by Ann sneed, on the 28th of May.





ANN SNEED
. I pledged these—the prisoner brought them to me on the 27th of May, and sent me to pledge them on the 28th.





EMANUEL EMANUEL
. These are my cruets—they were in the same box that the frame was in—the box was locked, and when I came home it was still locked—I have not found the frame.





GEORGE COLLIER
 (police-constable E 38.) I produce a duplicate which I found at Mrs. Dibbins', Kentish-town—Ann Sneed left it there—It is for four cruets, pawned for 4s., on the 28th of May.




GUILTY of stealing the cruets only. Aged 22.—


Transported for Seven Years.

JOHN COLLINS



 was indicted for stealing, on the 
29th of April, 101 yards of printed cotton, value 3l., the goods of 




Issac Henley Handscombe; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






JOHN PICKERING
. I am shopman to Mr. Issac Henley Handscombe. He is a linen-draper, and lives in Curzon-street, May-fair—he had one hundred and one yards of printed cotton at his door on the evening of the 29th of April—it was brought to the shop that evening by Luckie, and delivered to the constable (Cowle)—I do not know who took it.





ALEXANDER LUCKIE
. I am baker, and live in May-fair. On the evening of the 29th of April I was in my shop—I saw some person getting over the railing of the prosecutor's shop, by the side of the door, with some things—I went and asked him what he was going to do with them—he said he did not know, and he threw down the bundle—I delivered it to Mr. Handscombe—the person then ran away—I gave an alarm—there was no other person in the street but one who was coming towards him.





EDWARD LATHAM
. I am a baker, and live in Hertford-street, May-fair. About nine o'clock that evening I was going along chapel-street, West—I heard an alarm, and saw the prisoner coming towards me—I made a grasp at him—he got from me and ran to Chapel-street, East—I took him there, and kept him till the officer took him—he had this blue apron on, which he took off.





WILLIAM COWLE
 (police-constable F 105) I took the prisoner about nine o'clock that evening, and found this blue apron in his hat—he said he was a butcher.





WILLIAM HARRIS
 (police-constable 121) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's conviction, which I got at Mr. Clark's office—I remember his being tried in January last.




GUILTY

Transported for Fourteen Years.

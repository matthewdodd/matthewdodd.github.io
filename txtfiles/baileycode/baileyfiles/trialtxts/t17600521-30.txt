Prisoner's defence.
I was arrested for 2 guineas, and wanted money to pay, so I pawn'd these things: when I told her where they were, she would not have patience till the Tuesday; I should have money then to fetch them out; she insisted to go with me on the Sunday; after that she call'd up the watchman and bid him take me away. At first she said, she would take the money at 6 d. a week, and ask'd me who should go with me to the pawnbroker; I told her none but herself.

RICHARD SHIEL
. I am in the service of Mr. Matthew Howitt, a draper, living in Holborn. I know this forty-one yards of challi to be my mas-ter's by his marks on it—I saw it safe at five o'clock on the 9th of June, and missed it about half-past six.

Cross-examined by
MR. PAYNE. Q. What are the marks you know it by? A. These, which are made by Mr. Howitt—I had noticed these pieces at the door at five o'clock—they were tied about one yard inside the shop—there was a pile of goods before these—a person must have come in to take these—I was in another shop of ours.





JOHN BRAIM
 (police-constable F 150.) About half-past six o'clock on the 9th of June 1 saw the prisoner with a female and a man near Turnstile—I thought there was something suspicious, and I got behind a cart, and watched them—I saw the prisoner and the other woman go to Mr. Howitt's shop-door, and the man stood at the window—I came from the cart and saw the prisoner secreting these goods under her shawl—I took hold of her about a yard from the door, and she dropped these—I tried to apprehend the others, but in the confusion they got away.

Cross-examined. Q. How far were you off when you were behind the out? A. About thirty yards—I could not see plainly from there, but when I came from the cart I got within eight yards of them—the prisoner was the person who was secreting the goods, and she dropped them.




GUILTY

Transported for Seven Years.

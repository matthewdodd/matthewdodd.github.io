            . - Q. I believe you are overseer of the ordnance works going on in Pall Mall


. - A. Yes; there is a house building there for the master of the Ordnance: the prisoner was a labourer
 there. On the 8th of November, near 12 at noon, I went on the building to the prisoner. I discovered, by the bulk of his belly, he had got something concealed: I then went up to him, and tapped at his jacket with my knuckles. I said, my friend you have been doing something that you ought not to do; I shall be obliged to take you to Bow-street. He then said, he hoped not; he never would do so any more. I then laid hold of him by the arm, told him to follow me down the ladder: I conveyed him to Bow-street; an officer searched him, and took out the lead in my presence.
Q. How many pounds of lead. - A. Eighteen or twenty pounds; it is worth two or three shillings; that lead was the property of his Majesty.
The property produced and identified.
The prisoner said nothing in his defence; called six witnesses, who gave him a good character.

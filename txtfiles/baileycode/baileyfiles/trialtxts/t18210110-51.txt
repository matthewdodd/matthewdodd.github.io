            . I am a painter, and live in Queen Ann-street, New-road. On the morning of the 19th of December, I was going into the City; when I got to the gate of Carroll's back garden, I was informed a boy was coming out with a sack, and saw the prisoner coming down. I waited at the gate, and desired to know what was in the sack; he said
"Certainly, look at it," and threw the sack down. I collared him, and said I wished him to see the contents as well as me; he began shuffling about and splashing me. The sack contained the articles stated in the indictment. I left the prisoner in Carroll's charge.

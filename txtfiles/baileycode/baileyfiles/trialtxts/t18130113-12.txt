            . I am a carpenter and builder
. About two o'clock at, noon, on last Sunday, I heard a violent knocking at the house door. When I came down stairs I found the prisoner in the custody of the witness.
- CHESLEY. I am gate-keeper to the East India Company's warehouse, Fenchurch-street


. About half past two at noon, on Sunday last, I saw the prisoner go up a gentleman's gateway; after being there about five or six minutes, he came out, and went up Mr. Ponder's gateway. After being there about five or six minutes, I shut him in. He was there about seven or eight minutes. He, by some means, got the gate open again; he came out with the great coat under his arm, and the hat and umbrella in his hand. I collared him, and took him up the gateway, to Mr. Ponder's private door. I knocked at the door, Mr. Ponder came down to the dour, and owned the property. This is the great coat, hat, and umbrella.
Prosecutor. That is the hat, umbrella, and great coat.
Prisoner's Defence. I never opened any door or lock, nor did I go up stairs.

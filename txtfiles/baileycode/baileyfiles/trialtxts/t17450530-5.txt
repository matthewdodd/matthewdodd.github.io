            . I keep the Half Moon Tavern
 in the Strand


; I lost the spoons, and had a suspicion that the prisoner had taken them, and he owned it.
Q. What is the prisoner?
Merle Delerant. He is a gentleman's servant
 who lodges in my house. The master and man both lodge there.
Q. What is the prisoner's master?
Merle Delerant. He is a young officer in the marine service. These are my spoons, they are marked I. M. D. my surname is Merle Delerant.

            . The prisoner brought these spoons to me the 10th of May; I bought one first, and two afterwards.
Q. How came you to buy them?
Kincade. He looked like a gentleman then, and I had no reason to suspect him. They are marked with the same letters as Mr. Merle Delerant speaks of.
Q. Did not you see the letters when he brought them?
Kincade. I did not mind the letters.
Q. What did you give him for them?
Kincade. I gave him 5 s. 7 d. an ounce for them, which is two pence an ounce more than any other person would give; because I bought them to hang up for sale.

            . My husband is a sea-faring man
. I keep house in his absence. He was abroad before the time of loosing these things. I was out all night. I went out about eight or nine. About two hours before I went out, I saw all the things safe in a box just adjoining to my bed, in my own bed-chamber. I returned next morning about eleven o'clock. I missed the things; and I found the prisoner in the street, going to take water. He had a bundle upon him, containing the things mentioned in the indictment. They are my property. They were taken out of my box. The prisoner gave me half a guinea, as part of the money he had taken from me.

            . I was present at the taking of the prisoner.
The prisoner said nothing in his defence.

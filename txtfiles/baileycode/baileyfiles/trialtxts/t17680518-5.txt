             was indicted for 


               stealing a carpenter's ax, a hand-saw, a smoothing plane, and a turning saw, the property of

                  ; a hand-saw, a pair of iron compasses three hundred tenpenny nails, a broad chisel, a pair of iron pinchers, and a wooden stock lock
            , the property of 
               
                  
                     Richard

            . I work under Mr. Skirrett; the things mentioned in the indictment were missing at separate times out of a new building just by Holywell-mount


; the prisoner is a bricklayer's labourer
, and I lives in an alley in Whitecross street; we suspected him; I went to Mr. West's, a pawnbroker in Whitecross street, with a new saw to pawn, and asked him if he had any old ones to sell; he said he had plenty, he produced some; I saw mine which I had lost among them; I was informed the prisoner brought it there; he was taken up, and before Sir

                  Fielding 
               



             he said he found Mr. Skirrett's saw and plane in Moorfields, among a heap of stones.

                  Skirrett 
               



            . We had information of the prisoner by a neighbour of his; this saw and plane is mine, (producing them) the saw was lost about the latter end of March, and the plane about nine days after; the prisoner said he found them both together in Moorfields.

            . The prisoner's wife pawned this saw at my house, (produced and deposed to by Crouch.)
Prisoner's defence.
On the 12th of March I was discharged from the work, there being occasion for but one labourer; I went to another place, and worked till the 19th, then I was taken ill; after I got a little well, going cross Moorfields, I went to case myself among some stones, there I found the plane; I know nothing of the saws.

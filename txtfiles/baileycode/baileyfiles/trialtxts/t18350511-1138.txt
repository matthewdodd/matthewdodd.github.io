HENRY KOOLMAN
. I was on Holborn-hill on the afternoon of the 27th of April. I saw the prisoner take a handkerchief from Mr. Clifton's pocket, and give it to another, who ran away with it across Holborn-hill to Fetter-lane—I stopped the prisoner, and informed Mr. Clifton—the handkerchief was a darkish red—I was about three yards from him when he took it—seeing him go to the other boy, I called out—I am certain he is the person.





THOMAS GEORGE CLIFTON
. On the 27th at April I was on Holborn-hill—I lost a handkerchief, which had a good deal of dark red colour—I heard a call of "Stop thief," looked round, and Koolman pointed out the prisoner as the person—I had felt it safe a moment before.

Prisoner. The policeman told me I should be transported, and told the witness he would get his expenses at the Old Bailer.





HENRY KOOLMAN
. It is false.




GUILTY
. Aged 24.—


Transported for Seven Years.

            . I am a broker, the prisoner came to me on the 4th of February, and asked me to buy a copper, he said it was in Warwick Court; he fetched it and I gave him fourteen shillings for it; I afterwards saw an advertisement, that a copper with two iron handles was stole from the prosecutor; this never had but one; I went and informed him of it, and he came and owned it.
Prosecutor. My copper had but one handle, there was a mistake in the advertisement.

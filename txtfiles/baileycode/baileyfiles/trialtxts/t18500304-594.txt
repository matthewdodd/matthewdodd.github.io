MICHAEL KELLY



, stealing 1 handkerchief, value 5s.; the goods of 



Thomas Brooker, from his person: having been before convicted.






THOMAS BROOKER
, I live at 25, Queen's-road, Chelsea. On the afternoon of 28th Feb. I went to a watering-place in Exeter-street, Lisson-grove—I heard some one say it was his turn next—I turned, and saw the prisoner standing about a yard from me—I came out, went up the road a little way, and then found my handkerchief was gone—I had seen it safe just before I went to the watering-place.

Prisoner. Q. Did you see any one besides me? A. No.





WILLIAM TARRAN
. I live in Exeter-street, and am a stone-mason. I was looking out of my window, and saw Brooker go into the watering-place—the prisoner came out of the public-house, and went as if going into the watering-place—he saw some one there, turned back, and stopped on the footpath—I saw Mr. Brooker come out, and, as he passed the prisoner, the prisoner lifted up his coat tail, took out his handkerchief, turned round, put it up his own coat, which was buttoned, and then went towards Devonshire-street,

Prisoner. Q. Did you call out? A. Yes; you came back to the public-house in about an hour and a half.

JURY. Q. Are you positive he is the boy? A. Yes; I was at the second-floor window—I could not come down, as I had no shoes on, and a baby in my arms.

Prisoner's Defence. I heard some one was charged with stealing a hand-kerchief; I went to the William the Fourth, and was charged with it.





PHILIP STEVENS
 (policeman, S 3). I produce a certificate—(read—Michael O'Donnelly convicted Sept., 1846, and confined three months)—I was present at the trial—the prisoner is that person, I am quite certain.

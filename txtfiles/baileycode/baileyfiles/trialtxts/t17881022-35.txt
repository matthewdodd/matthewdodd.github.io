             sworn.
On the 17th of September, I went to the prisoner's lodgings in Sunbury; there I found a sack, containing a leaden pump, and the pipe belonging to it; (produced and deposed to.) I compared it with the plumber, and fitted it; it fitted exactly in Mr. Berry's garden.
How do you know this was Wild's lodging? - I knew he lived there; he and his wife lived in it; nobody else lives there.
MASON STILES sworn.
I am a plumber; I saw this pump; I was going to repair it for Mr. Berry; I saw it about three weeks before, standing in Mr. Berry's orchard; I took the sucker out; I am sure it is the same pump; I never sold him any lead.

I am gardener to Mr. Berry; I have seen the pump; we had lost a pump about the latter end of August; it has all the appearance of the same pump; it was out of repair.
The prisoner called three witnesses to his character.

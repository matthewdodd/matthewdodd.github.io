            . I am now the wife of Henry Burdett Gast; on the 25th of April my name was Mary Ann Cooper; the prisoner was in distress - and about the latter end of March I took her into my house. On the 25th of April I had occasion to leave my house, and gave her leave to go and see her friends - I returned on Saturday, and missed the articles stated; I never permitted her to take my things - I saw her on the Sunday going into the Catholic Chapel, and told her I must take her up.

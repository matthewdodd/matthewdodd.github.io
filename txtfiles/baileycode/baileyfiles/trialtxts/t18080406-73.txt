             are executors to Mr. Moffet

.
Q. How long has Mr. Moffet been dead. - A. I do not know; I have been in care of the house three months, he was dead before I went there; the house is in Leicester fields


; I was the only person in the house, I slept there continually, Mr. Robins and Mr. Gladston never slept there. On the 17th of March Mr. Robins sent me to the bankers; about a quarter after five o'clock, coming from the bankers, I called into the house, which I did when I came near the house to see if it was safe; when I left the house that day I double locked it; when I called to see if it was safe it was only on the spring lock, somebody must have picked the lock. Upon going in I did not find any thing particular, I did not look about; I staid in the parlour about ten minutes, I neither heard nor saw any body at all, I double locked the door and went away; I returned about ten minutes past eight o'clock.
Q. You are quite sure the second time you double locked it again. - A. Yes; and when I came there at a quarter after eight I found it on the single lock again; that struck my mind somebody must be there again; on my opening the door, and going into the house to get a light, I run against a copper in the passage that had been affixed in the back kitchen below; I halloaed out who is there, I heard somebody run up stairs, I pulled the door to and locked it again, and went to the next house but one, a public house, to get a light, and gave an alarm; coming back I saw the prisoner getting out of the parlour window, the sash was up, he was getting over the rails; I laid hold of the prisoner, he ran away, he broke from me, dropped his hat, and crossed the street; I ran after him.
Q. Did you lose sight of him. - A. No, I was near him all the way, he only ran to Sidney's alley; I called out Stop, he was stopped, and I was close to him when he was stopped by three or four people; it was in the court.
Q. When he was stopped was he without his hat. - A. Yes.
Q. Are you quite sure that he was the same man that came out of the window. - A. Yes, I hit him two or three times, I hit his nose, or he hit himself against the rails because his nose was bleeding on the top of it. I secured him, and brought him back, when I got into the house I found the copper was removed from the back kitchen into the passage; the lead was inside of it, and going into the parlour, I found the bed which had been removed from the front kitchen, it was in a bureau bedstead; when I left it the bed was worth fortyshillings, the copper and the lead about two guineas.

            . I am a constable. I was sent for to take charge of the prisoner; I found the copper and a quantity of lead in it in the passage; the bed was in the parlour tied up in a bundle. In the back kitchen where this copper stood, I found this iron crow, on the rubbish, it appeared as if the copper had been fresh removed.
The property produced and identified.
Prisoner's Defence. I had a job on the 17th of March; coming back a gentlemen asked me if I could stop and help to move a few things; I went in the house with him; he said stop a bit, I will go and get a light; he went out and locked me in, and while he was gone somebody came and and unlocked the door. I jumped out of the window.

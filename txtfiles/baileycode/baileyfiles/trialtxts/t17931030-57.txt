             sworn.
When was it your master lent you the watch? - I cannot positively say the day; some little time before it was lost; I pulled it out of my pocket, and left it in the bake-house, the place where I bake.

Q. Was it between the hours of four and seven in the morning or afternoon? - The afternoon. I missed it the same afternoon.
Q. Where did you first hear any more of it? - I heard the prisoner had sold the duplicate of a watch; I told my master, and he went and examined the watch, and he knew it; I have seen the watch, I saw it in the hands of the person that bought the duplicate, 
               
                  Peter

             sworn.
I am a servant to Mr. Berry, in Aldersgate-street; I took in the watch of the prisoner on the 6th of September in the afternoon, I cannot positively say the hour.
Q. Had you ever seen the prisoner before? - Never. I asked him particularly whether it was his own? he told me it was. I delivered it afterwards to

                   Tuffs

             sworn.
I am a shoe-maker by trade. The prisoner came to my house and told me that he was out of place, when, I cannot justly say, it was the Sunday afternoon, five or six weeks ago, and said that he had the duplicate of a watch to sell; I bought it of him, and I fetched it out of pawn for fifteen shillings, from Mr. Berry's, in Aldersgate-street; I went to get the bruises out of the case, and the young man saw it, 
               
                  Charles
                   Dale
               



            , and said it was his property; when they stopped the watch I went to the justice with it, and the prisoner was taken up.
Q. Who did you deliver the watch to? - To 
               
                  George
                   Deary
               



            , the constable.
Prisoner. Ask him whether I did not mention to him that I found the duplicate wrapped up in a piece of paper when I came to his house? - He told me that when he was being taken before the justice. When he came first he said he was out of place, and that he had got a watch to sell.
Prisoner. I did not say that I was the owner of the watch.


                  GEORGE
                   DEARY
               



             sworn.
I am a constable; I produce the watch; I happened to be in a public house the 16th of September in the morning, and 
               
                  Peter
                   Tuffs
               



             came in to ask if there was any person there that could take out the bruises in a case of a watch? I got the watch of 
               
                  Peter
                   Tuffs
               



            , I produce it now, I have kept it till now by the order of the magistrate.
Tuffs. I believe this is the watch that I fetched out of pawn at Mr. Berry's.

Jury. Are you sure that that is the watch? - Yes, it is the watch by the bruises on the case, and the name on the inside, Goddard.
Sadler. This is the watch that was pawned with me.
Goddard. This is my watch, my name is in full length on it in the inside.
Dale. I cannot positively say it is the watch, I did not take particular notice, I bad it but such a little time in my possession.
Prisoner. On Saturday the 14th day of September, in Golden-lane, on my travels I found, wrapped up in a paper, three half-pence and a shilling, and the duplicate of a watch; and knowing Mr. Tuffs, I mentioned that I had got a duplicate of a watch to sell, and it was fifteen shillings if he would buy it of me, with that he took the duplicate and said he would take it out and see what it was worth, and give me the value of it for the duplicate. I have no witness, I sent to Kensington Gravel-pits, but they did not come.

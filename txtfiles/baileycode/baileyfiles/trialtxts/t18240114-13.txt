             was indicted for

                  WATMOUGH
               



            . I am a carpenter
. I was working at a house in Asher-street West



, and left the house on the 24th of December, about half-past four o'clock. Lindsay and Clark worked in the adjoining house. I left all my tools, which were worth 3 l. or 4 l., locked up in a chest, and the house locked up. I saw five persons lurking about the house on Christmas-eve, after dinner; Weldon was one of them - I cannot be certain of the others. On the 26th, between nine and ten o'clock in the morning, I found a hole cut through the brick work; my chest broken open, and most of my tools gone. I found them at Queen-square office next day, with a glue kettle, which was also taken.


                  THOMAS 
                  PACE
               



            . I am an officer. On the 26th of December, about half-past eleven o'clock, I apprehended all the prisoners in one room - Elsworth was just coming out; I pushed him into the room, and found a quantity of tools under a half-tester bed, and Nuttall was filing a key. I called Handley in; there was only one bed in the room; they all denied knowing anything of the tools. King acknowledged that the room was her's, and said she had been out all night. I know that she lived there.
Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Where did you find them - A. At No. 1, Pump-court, Perkins's-rents, Old Pye-street. Some of the tools were in a cupboard.


                  EDWARD 
                  JOHN HANDLEY
               



            . I was with Pace; his account is correct. Weldon was nearest to the trowels - I asked who they belonged to; he said to a plaisterer up stairs. I went up; there was no plaisterer there.

            . I live at Edmonton


. On the 24th of July, on coming home, between seven and eight o'clock, I heard our drying ground had been robbed. I applied to the constable, and next day I saw a pawnbroker, who described a person to me. I saw the prisoner carrying a bundle on the road, and had him secured, and taken into a public-house; I asked what he had in the bundle; he said two shirts; I opened them, and said they were mine. I had the fellow shirt on - I never saw him before.

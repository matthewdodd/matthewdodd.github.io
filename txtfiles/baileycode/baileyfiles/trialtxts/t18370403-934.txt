JOHEPH STONE
 (police-constable G 212.) On the 20th of February, about five o'clock in the evening, I was in Whitecross-street, and saw the prisoner go a few paces down the street, and look very stedfastly at me—I followed him, and saw him go into a marine store shop, and present a watch to a woman there, and ask her 4s. for it—she asked where he got it—he said he found it in Shepherdess-fields—I took him into custody—he began to cry, and said it belonged to his father, Mr. Edwards of Browslow-street, Holborn—I went to Brownlow-street, Drury-lane, afterwards and found his father.





RICHARD SIMMS
. I am a gold-beater, and lived in Brownlow-street at the time in question—the prisoner is my son—I left him to mind his little brother, on Monday, the 20th of February—my watch was quite safe at two o'clock—I returned home at four o'clock, and found the lock of the door broken, and the watch gone, and the prisoner had run away—he had been locked in the room—this is my watch.




GUILTY
.* Aged 10.—


Transported for Seven Years.

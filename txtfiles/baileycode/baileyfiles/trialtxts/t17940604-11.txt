(The cafe opened by Mr. Jackson.)
GAWEN SHATTER Sworn.
This bag of feathers was taken out of my house the 22d of May, one of my apprentices saw it taken out.
Q. What induced you to apprehend the prisoner? - From the information that was given me; I was sent for home on this discovery, and brought a constable, andgave him charge of him, this was Thursday evening, about eight o'clock.
Q. Was this at your own house? - Yes, the prisoner was a servant, he had lived with me three years and five months, a weekly servant; the next morning I visited him in the Poultry Compter, and he acknowledged that he robbed me of feathers.
Mr. Knapp. I would wish to ask you whether you did not tell him before he confessed, that it would be better for him if he told it? - No.
Q. Did you not say, David, tell me the whole truth, and what you have robbed me of, and it shall be better for you, or I will not prosecute you, or words to that effect? - No.


                  Q. 
               


            Do you mean the gentlemen of the jury to understand, that the moment you got into the Compter, you said nothing to him, and he confessed as soon as you got in? - I told him as to evidence against him, I had sufficient, I had found some property; all that I wanted was to find out where my property was, to bring the people to justice, the I only wanted to know of him where he had taken the property to namely, sacking, feathers, down, and other articles, the answer was -
Mr. Knapp here contended that the confession could not be received under these circumstances.
Mr. Jackson. When did you see your property again? - At the house where I was directed, I had the search warrant the 23d, the same day as I had the conversation with him in the Compter, and I found some bed sacking, a canvas apron, and several other things, that I could not be certain of; I found these things at the house of 
               
                  Sarah
                   Boss
               



            , in Stonecutter street, one door goes into shoe lane. I found a seah bag the 4th of May, marked T. 5, No also two brass cloak pens. It is a linen bag.
Mr. Knapp. You went some where, and found a feather bag, marked as you have described; and two brass cloak pins? - Yes.
Q. The prisoner at the bar was not there, I take it for granted? - No, he was not.
Q. Did you ever learn from any body else besides the prisoner at the bar, that it was his lodgings? - His wife was there present, and his children were in bed.


                  Q. 
               


            Perhaps he had told you during the time of his confession, that they were his lodgings? - There is no doubt about it being his lodgings, I knew his lodgings before that.
Q. Then he did not tell you so at the time? - No, he did not.
Q. You described a feather bag? - yes.
Q. You are a feather merchant? - Yes.
Q. Of course you have considerable dealings in that particular line, in which you are a merchant? - Yes.
Q. Will you take on yourself to swear that among the bags that contain feathers, there are none marked exactly in the same way as you have described this? - Yes.
Q. How lately had you an opportunity of taking notice of the particular number on your bags? - In December, when I took stock.


                  Q. 
               


            Have you seen them since? - Several times, the bags are continually made use of for the purpose of beating feathers, and not for carrying out.
Q. How many may you have in your house for this purpose? - Seventeen or eighteen.
Q. I take it for granted that you will not swear before these gentlemen and my lord, that there may not be two sacks of the same number as the present? - I will.


                  Q. 
               


            When had these bags been numbered; Did you number them yourself - No, my apprentice numbered them.



                  Q. 
               


            Did you see him number them all? - I see him before some of them.
Q. From December, to the time of this robbery, will you attempt to swear no other bag had been marked with the same number, and in the same way as this bag had? - Yes, I will, no man will find two numbers alike in my house.
Q. I am not questioning the regularity of your trade at all, but will you though you was not present, though your apprentice marked them, though he has not marked them all in your presence, will you take on yourself to say that there are not two bags of the same number? - I will.
Q. There are many other feather merchants in town? - There are.
Q. Is it not a common thing for feather merchants to mark them exactly in the same way as you do? - I don't think it is, I have not been in every feather warehouse in London.
Q. Will you swear that they do not? - I will not. I chose to swear to this bag, I can swear to my own property, marked by my apprentice, I will swear to his hand, his mark.
Q. Do you mean to swear to every piece of goods that your apprentice marks in your warehouse? - They are not brought here, but this I swear to from the particular manner in which it is done, as well as I would to his person.


                  Q. 
               


            Describe a little the manner how it is done? - It is as he usually marks them.


                  Q. 
               


            Supposing your apprentice had marked two of a number, would you be able to distinguish one from the other? - I don't say any thing to that.
Q. Now about these cloak pins, they had the same mark on them too, I suppose? - No.


                  Q. 
               


            How long had you had them in your possession? - I had them from Birmingham.
Q. Where were the cloak pins found? - In a room below his house. The landlord said they were given him by the prisoner.
Mr. Jackson. You say the bag was marked 
               
                  T. 
               


            5. does that imply the weight? - It does.
Mr. Knapp. I take it for granted if any other bag, in any other warehouse, had been of the same weight, It would have had 
               
                  T. 
               


            5, on it? - It would.

             sworn.
I am an apprentice to Mr. Shatter, I see the prisoner go from my master's house, the same evening that he was taken to the computer. On Thursday the 22d of May last, about twenty minutes past seven, my master being out he asked me to give him leave to go out, for about a quarter of an hour? I asked him where he was going? he said to London Bridge, or that way; I said he might go if he would return in time to shut up the shop; he said, he certainly would; and I had my eye on him, and as he was going out of the house, I perceived before he opened the door to go out, that he stopped down and picked up a bundle, a coarse bag, that appeared to be Hessings, or something of that nature, with some feathers, which I saw through the bag; he opened the door and went out; as soon as he shut the door, I opened the door and looked out after him, I perceived he turned a turning which was quite a contrary way to London Bridge, which gave me a suspicion that he was carrying away my master's property; then I immediately set my fellow apprentice to watch him where he carried it to; his name is William Evans.
Q. Was you one of those that afterwards searched his lodgings? - Yes, I was with the constable, and we found a bag with a mark on it.
Q. What stuff was the bag made of? - A kind of coarse linen.
Q. Was your master with you? - Yes.
Q. Do you know that bag to be your master's property? - I do. There is the letter 
               
                  T. 
               


            5, signifying tare 5lb. whichwe generally put on bags of that kind, and No. 9, I marked it myself, I know that to be the same bag.
Mr. Knapp. First of all you told my lord and jury that you see the prisoner pick up a bundle before he went out? - Yes.
Q. How came you to alter your manner of statement; saying a bag of feather? - Is not a bag of feathers, a bundle?
Q. If you ask me Mr. Impertinence, I tell you no. How long have you lived with your master? - Five years, the 1st of July.
Q. Have you always marked his bags? - Yes, always down to the present time.
Q. It never happened to you to make the same marks on another bag, exactly as you have done on this? - No, never with that number.
Q. Not during the whole course of five years; your bags are marked regularly down, are not they? - Yes; they are, from one, two, three, and so on.
Q. Then you never marked more than one with that mark? - Never. When I first came there where some of my master's master's marking, but they were never marked as I have marked them, they were much smaller than any that I marked.
Q. What do you think of the mark of tare, the quantity, do you recollect whether any of your master's master's marking might express the same quantity on a bag? - I suppose it might.
Q. On your oath, during the time that you have been in your master's service, have you had the same bags down to this time? - Yes, I never marked but one set since I have been with him.


                  Q. 
               


            Are those all now complete? - No, there are some missing since Christmas.
Q. Will you take on yourself to swear that before this man was apprehended, the one that you have talked of, the No. 9, was not missing before that time? - No, I will not.
Q. Was you in this trade before you came to your present master? - No, I was not.
Q. Have you never, in the course of your trade, been sent to other feather merchants? - No, never in my life.
Q. Perhaps you have seen other feather bags brought to your house? - Yes, I have.
Q. It never occurred to you to happen to see the same number as this bag, on other bags brought to your house? - No.
Q. Don't you apprehend that other feather merchants may have the same tare and number on their bags? - This bag that I am now speaking of was made up for the purpose of beating the feathers in.
Court. Did you ever mark a bag for any other master? - No.

                   FENNER
               



             sworn.
I apprehended the prisoner at his master's house; as we walked on to the compter I asked him where the bag was? he said he had sold it to a Mr. Boss, in Shoe-lane for four shillings and six-pence.


                  Q. 
               


            What had you said to him before? - Nothing.
Q. You had not told him it would be better for him? - I had not, upon my honour; I put him in the Compter and searched him in the Compter.


                  Q. 
               


            Whose house did you first search? - I went to his lodgings first, but I found nothing that night; but on the 24th, the next day, there were several search warrants granted; and I went with the gentleman to Mrs. Boss's house; we light of her in the feather room up stairs, she was coming down out of that room, we searched the under part of the house, and in the one pair of stairs we found a piece of sacking, and in the shop we found this outside piece, it is called a canvas apron; the day after we went tohis lodgings, and there we found a bag which feathers had been in with marks on it, belonging to his master, under the bedstead, on the ground; it has been in my custody ever since; I have it here now; this is the bag, and two cloak pins we found below stairs.
Q. Did you afterwards take the prisoner before the Lord Mayor? - I did before that.
Court. How was that bag marked? - I cannot positively say; there was a 9 on it.
Mr. Knapp. Did you attend the prisoner before the Lord Mayor? - Yes.
Q. Was his examination taken in writing? - I believe it was.
Q. The bag was found where the clothes pins were? - No, not in the same room.
Q. When the prisoner was delivered to you was he ssurried at that time? - He really was trembling; he was charged to me for robbing of his master of a bag of feathers.
Prosecutor. This bed sacking was found in the house of Mrs. Boss, but I cannot swear to it positively, because there is other sacking like this, but the bag I can swear to, that was found at at his lodgings, it is worth about three shillings.
Prisoner. That bag I took for a blanket weapper that was wet, and I took it to go to either William-street, or Bell-yard, Temple Bar, I don't know which. In the Compter I told master of that bag, that it was under my bed, and he said the children were in bed, and he did not search under, and he went the next day and got it.
The prisoner called Henry Welch, who gave him a good character.

CHARLES STONE
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
6th of February, the carcase of a sheep, value 30s., the goods of 




John Onion.—2nd COUNT, stating it to be 70lbs. weight of mutton.






WILLIAM JAMES
. My master's name is John Onion; he is a butcher, and carries on his trade at Rotherhithe. On the 6th of February I was with my master's cart in Newgate-market—the cart was waiting in Collegemarket, Warwick-lane—there were four carcases in the cart—I was absent to get some meat, for five minutes—I put the meat into the cart, and missed one sheep—I went down Warwick-lane, and saw the prisoner with the carcase on his shoulder—I took him into custody, and brought him back—I know it was one I had in the cart—I can swear it belonged to my master—I did not know the prisoner before—I might have seen him in the market, but never spoke to him in my life before.





JOHN SPENCER
 (City police-constable No. 36.) I took the prisoner with the carcase on his shoulder.

Prisoner. A man called me and asked me if I wanted a job—I said "Yes"—he gave me the sheep to carry to Water-lane—the butcher came and said I stole it—I did not know it was stolen—I could not see the man that gave it me to carry.





WILLIAM JAMES

re-examined. I was absent about five minutes—he was going down Warwick-lane towards Water-lane, about fifty yards from the cart.

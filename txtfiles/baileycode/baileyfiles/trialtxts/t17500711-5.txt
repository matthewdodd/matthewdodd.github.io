On the second of June Mr. Warner sent a letter to my master desiring him to come to his house; I went, he asked me if I knew these things, I said they belong to my master; he said, he had got the man in his house who offered to sell them to him, which was the prisoner at the bar; the prisoner told me he stole them out of our one pair of stairs room.

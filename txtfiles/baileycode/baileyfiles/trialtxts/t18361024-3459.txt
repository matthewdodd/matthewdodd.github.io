GEORGE REVELL
. I live in Blackman-street, Borough. On the 22nd of October, about half-past seven o'clock, I was in my shop—I saw the prisoner come and put his arm within the door, and take the stockings away, which hung secured with a strong pin—I followed him and laid hold of his collar, and he dropped them out of his hand—I seized him, and took them up—they are not here, as I never thought of prosecuting him.

Prisoner. I was very much in liquor at the time—I understand you took another man. Witness. No—I told a friend of mine, who was with me, that another man was concerned, and to seize him, but he walked away—I saw the prisoner take them, and the stockings fall from him.

Prisoner's Defence. I know nothing about the stockings—I am positive I never took them—I never knew any thing about it till I was at the station-house next morning.




GUILTY
.* Aged. 


Transported for Seven Years.


Before Mr. Recorder.

                  Q. 
               


            How old are you? - Fifteen. I am a shop lad to Mr. Levick. On the 17th of January, Saturday night, between the hours of five and six, as I was putting up the bars of the shutters, two boys came and enquired the way to Houndsditch; I perceived the prisoner at the bar going into the shop; I immediately left off conversing with these two boys, and was going into the shop to see what the prisoner wanted, and as I was going into the shop the prisoner was coming out with a piece of callimanco in his hand, which I believe to have laid on the counter; as I was going to collar him he enquired of me whether it was paper; I immediately seized him, and the moment I seized him he threw the piece of callimanco down into the shop, and he tried to get away very much, he dragged me into the street.
Q. Have you got the callimanco? - Yes, the constable kept it ever since.
Q. Did he get away? - No, he did not get away, I had him committed.


                  Q. 
               


            Had the callimanco any marks on it? - Yes, my master marked it.
Q. Is it his own hand writing? - Yes.
Q. Do you know the mark as well as your master? - No.
Prisoner. When he first laid hold of me, he said his master was drinking wine up stairs.

Q. What is it? - Camblet. I don't know whether it is callimanco or camblet.
Q. Who delivered it to you? - Mr. Levick.
Q. Have you kept it ever since? - I have.

                  Q. 
               


            Was it a parcel of that colour? - I believe it to be.
Q. To Levick. Did you receive that of your shop-lad, Coe? - I did.

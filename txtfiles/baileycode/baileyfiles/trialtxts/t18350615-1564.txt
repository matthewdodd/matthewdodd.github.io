ANN LAVENDER
. I am the wife of Samuel Lavender; we live at Deptford. The prisoner came to paint the house I live in—on the 18th of May I had these articles all safe—they were my husband's—I went to look for my shawl at seven in the evening, and could not find it—I went out, and when I returned, I looked again for the shawl—I could not find it—I then missed the other things—the prisoner had left that afternoon—I went to his master, and told him what I had lost—no one had access to this property but the prisoner—the things have never been found.

Prisoner. There was another man at work. Witness. No, not in that house.





JOHN MILLER
 (police-constable C 215.) I took the prisoner in Hourglass-lane—I told him he had been robbing where he worked—he said, "For God's sake do not take me, settle it here"—I said no, he must come to the station-house—he said, "You get your living by it, I do not blame you"—he said before the inspector, "I pawned all the things but the silk, and that I sold out and out, I hope you will make it as soft as possible."





MART ANN LIPTRAP
. The prisoner was in my husband's employ—he was taken in my presence, and stated what the officer has said—he told me he had pawned the shawl in St. Giles's.




GUILTY
. Aged 35.—


Transported for Seven Years.

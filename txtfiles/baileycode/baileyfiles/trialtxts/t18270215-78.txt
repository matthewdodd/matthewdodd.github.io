            . On the 7th of February I saw two other persons (not the prisoner), who looked suspicious, lurking about the premises; I went and asked Mrs. Aked if she had lost any thing; (I saw the prisoner receive the cheeses from the others - I did not see them taken;) she said she should have three cheeses, but only one was left.

Prisoner's Defence. I was coming up the New-road, and a man asked me if I wanted to earn 6d. - I said I did; he said, "Take these cheeses to Charlotte-street," and then a man came up, and said, "You are my prisoner."
T. SPARKS re-examined. I saw one boy following him, and the other behind; I had my eye on them in Fitzroy-place, before they got into the New-road.

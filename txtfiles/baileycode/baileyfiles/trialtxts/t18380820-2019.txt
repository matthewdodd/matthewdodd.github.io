CHARLES VANDERSTEEN
. I am a builder, and live in Bethnal-green. On the 23rd of August I was passing the workhouse in Whitechapel-road, and felt something at my pocket—I turned round and saw the prisoner putting my handkerchief in his right-hand trowsers pocket—I laid hold of

him and asked what he had done—he said "Nothing"—I saw my handKerchief half out of his pocket—I asked him if he called that nothing?—he put down his other hand, pulled it out, and dropped it—I took him along till I met a policeman—there was a young man with him, but he left him and crossed the road.





JAMES OSBORN
. I am a policeman. I received the handkerchief from the prosecutor, and took the prisoner—he denied having it.

Prisoner's Defence. I was talking to a young man and his wife—I had just bid them good night, and was going home—the gentleman turned round and charged me with picking his pocket—I said I had done no such thing—he give me to the policeman—he turned round about a yard behind him and took the handkerchief up.

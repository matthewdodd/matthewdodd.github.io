                  , and directed to Mr. 
                     
                        
                           Andrew 
                           Jones 
                        



                      
                  , for the payment of 100 l. sterling; one other, under the hand of 
                     
                        
                           Joseph

                  , drawn upon the cashier of the bank of England, the property of 
                     
                        
                           William 
                           Snell 
                        



                      
                  , and uttering them
            .

                  Snell 
               



            . There were three bills sent me from Liverpool, which were put in the post there the 4th of May. Mr. 
               
                  James 
                  Crosby 
               



             told me he had sent me three bills, value 200 l. but as I had not receiv'd them, he desir'd I'd stop payment if they came to hand. I went to the bank the 14th of May to stop payment, and sent my young man to bread-street, to stop payment of Mr. Jones; I went to the Exchange after three o'clock, and took my clarke with me. I went to Mr. Jones's, and found the prisoner had been there a little before, and had demanded payment of my bill. I told Mr. Jones the bill was my property, and that I must insist upon knowing how he came by it. The prisoner seemed confus'd, and told me he had found it; but that answer not being satisfactory, I sent for a constable, and had him sent to the Compter. I went to him afterwards with Mr. Jones, and he confess'd the whole fact, that he had taken the bills out of the post-office at Liverpool, that he had been drinking with the post-master there in his house, and had taken those letters up, and put them into his pocket. He sent for his pocket-book, and deliver'd up the letters, and the two other bills; they were broke open as they are now; one was a 50 l. note upon the bank, another a bill of 100 l. under the hand of 
               
                  Joseph 
                  Campbel 
               



            , draughted on the bank of Scotland upon our bank of England.

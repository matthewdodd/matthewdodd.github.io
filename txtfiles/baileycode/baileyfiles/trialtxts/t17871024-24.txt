             sworn.
I am officer of excise
; I lost my watch; I had been on excise business; I looked at my watch about three or four minutes before the prisoner accosted me, very unexpectedly, with the usual mode of asking for something to drink; I told her I was in haste, and begged to be excused; but however, she busied herself very much about and in an instant, I detected her hand, right hand breeches pocket, where there was a key hanging; in a moment I found myself totally relieved from that disagreeable pressure, and she moved on; says I, you infamous hussy, you have got my watch; and she went and passed another, and I should suppose she gave it to her, for it was found upon her; I got the watchman and took her to St. Ann's round-house; she was carried on Monday to Litchfield-street.
PRISONER's DEFENCE.
I was going on an errand to my aunt, that gentlemen laid hold of me and asked me to go with him; I said, no; he dragged me into a passage, and beat me with a stick, and shut the door upon me.
Prosecutor. I never went into any house with her.
Jury. Were there any other women with her? - Not in company.
Was you in company with no other woman? - No Sir, I am sure of this woman.

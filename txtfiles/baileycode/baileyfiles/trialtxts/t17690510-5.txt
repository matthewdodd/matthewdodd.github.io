            . I live in Margaret-street, Cavendish-square



. I was at home at the time, but knew nothing of the matter. I went out the next day and returned in the evening. I then was told my house had been robbed the night before, which was the 14th of April. I examined, but could not see any part of the house broke. I found the things mentioned in the indictment were lost, and several odd things, some mine, and some

                  Dean 
               



            's, my servant. I found there was a warrant granted by Mr. Lane and Mr. Spinnage. I went to Mr. Lane's; there I found the prisoner Mallows. Some of the workmen that had been repairing a house just by mine, had been taken up; Bush was one of them. I did not see the other prisoners till the next day. Mr. 
               
                  Robert 
                  Story 
               



            , who is Mallows's master, came before the Justice and asked him several questions; Mallows said he did not rob me, but he knew who did. He was desired to speak what he knew, in order to save himself; then he impeached the other men at the bar, and 
               
                  John 
                  Waters 
               



            , who is an evidence, and 
               
                  Ann 
                  Waters 
               



             for receiving some of the things. I believe Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



             had Bush taken up on another affair. I saw them all at Mr. Lane's on Sunday, except Waters. They all declared themselves innocent except Mallows, who said as he had before.

                  Dean 
               



            . I am servant
 to the prosecutor. Our house was robbed on the Friday night. I did not know of it till Saturday morning the 15th of April, at about eleven o'clock. I missed a black stuff gown and a black silk bonnet from out of the garret.
Q. Did you see any marks of the house being broke open?
M. Dean. No, I did not.

                  Austin 
               



            . I am apprentice to the prosecutor. He is a surveyor
. I came from the Asylum. About eleven o'clock I went up into the garret, and missed my things.
Prosecutor. As she is my apprentice, I find her in cloaths; so have laid her things as my property in the indictment.

                  Jennings 
               



            . I am a pawnbroker. I took in a linen gown (produced in Court) of 
               
                  Ann 
                  Waters 
               



            , on the 15th of April; about nine or ten o'clock in the morning.

                  Crooksbanks 
               



            . I am a pawnbroker, in Silver-Street, Golden-square. 
               
                  Ann 
                  Waters 
               



             brought this black stuff gown to me on the 15th of April. between nine and ten o'clock. ( Produced in Court.)


                  James 
                  Hegath 
               



            . I am a pawnbroker. This blue and white gown and cloak (produced in Court) were pledged by a person that called herself 
               
                  Ann 
                  Waters 
               



            , on the 15th of April. I cannot say that is the same at the bar.


                  John 
                  Waters 
               



            . I am brother to 
               
                  Moses 
                  Waters 
               



            . I am fifteen years old, and he is eighteen. He, Bush, Mallows, and I, went out together. Bush is a carpenter
, my brother is a bricklayer
; we all walked about till between nine and ten o'clock; then we went to the prosecutor's house. Bush got a ladder and went up to a window in a one pair of stairs in the empty house: the rest of us were at the foot of the ladder. He got into the prosecutor's house, came down and opened the parlour window, and my brother got in. He got the clothes out of the garret, and gave them to my brother. I could see him as I stood in the street by the light of the moon in the garret. They came down into the parlour, chucked the clothes to me, and I catched them. Mallows was with me.
Q. How did Bush get into the prosecutor's house?


                  John 
                  Waters 
               



            . He got out upon the leads, and got in at the garret window, which he told me when he came down he found open. They stayed in the house about ten minutes. There were three gowns, a blue cloak, and a pair of shift sleeves. I carried the things to 
               
                  Ann 
                  Waters 
               



            , and desired her to pledge them for us. I told her we had picked them up in the street.

                  Farrington 
               



            . Mr. Lane sent for me, and desired me to go and serve a warrant on some people that were working at the next house to the prosecutor. I, with others, went and took them. In the mean time, Major 
               
                  Spinnage
               


             came and talked to Mallows. Mallows confessed he was not in this robbery, but knew who did it. We went and took 
               
                  Moses 
                  Waters 
               



             in Cranbourn-alley. He confessed it immediately, that he took some of the things out of a box in the garret, and had given them to his younger brother, who had thrown them away. I went to see Bush in Tothill Bridewell; he confessed to me they got in at the window and took the things, and that they had given them to the evidence Waters, who had thrown them away.
Q. to Austin. Was that garret fastened over night?
Austin. It was fast. I shut it myself betwixt four and five o'clock that day; and at the time I missed the things, I found it open. It was a sash window, which was down, and had no fastening to it.
Bush's Defence.
I know nothing of the affair. I know nothing of that evidence, no farther than seeing him with his brother on a Sunday.
Waters's Defence.
My brother and I quarrelled. I struck him, He said, as soon as he got into trouble he would have me taken up with him. I know nothing about this robbery: it is all out of malice.
Mallow's Defence.
I never was along with the lad in my life. I know nothing at all about it.
Waters's Defence.
On Friday night 
               
                  John 
                  Waters 
               



             came up into my room, and said, Let me leave these things of my brother's with you. He is obliged to leave his lodgings, and desired I would pawn them for him for as much as I could; he wanted money to pay his lodging. The gentleman came into my lodging and took me.
Bush, Waters, and Mallows, all three 

               guilty
             of stealing the Goods.

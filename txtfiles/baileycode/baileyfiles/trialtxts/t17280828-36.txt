                  Collins 
               



             depos'd, That the Prisoner being her Servant
, had absented herself from her Service when she was at Church, that she soon miss'd the Goods, and not long after heard that the Prisoner was stopt with the Shoes.


                  Susan 
                  Everage 
               



             depos'd, That the Shoes were brought to her House, and offer'd to Sale, but she suspected them to be stolen, and stopt the Woman who brought them to sell, who said she had them of one Anne Green, and accordingly they went together, and the Woman who brought them to the Prisoner, who own'd them to be her's, and said her Mother sent them to her from Newcastle.
She said in her Defence, That the Prosecutor, her Mistress, did not pay her all the Wages due to her when she came away, but gave her those Goods as Part of the Payment; but this Excuse differing very much from that of her Mother's sending them to her, and the Prosecutor making it appear she paid all her Wages, and that the Goods were taken clandestinely, the Jury found her 

               guilty of Single Felony
            .

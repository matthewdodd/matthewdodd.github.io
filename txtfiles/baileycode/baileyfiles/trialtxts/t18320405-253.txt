EDWARD GRUBB. I am a labourer
; I was walking with my wife in Lower Berner-street, Commercial-road


, between eight and nine o'clock, in the evening of the 25th of March - just as I was turning a corner the prisoner came across the way, and snatched my watch; he ran off- I pursued, and did not lose sight of him till he was taken with it.

            . I am an officer. I saw the prisoner running - he met me, and I stopped him; I tripped my foot against a scraper, and as I arose I saw him throw something from his hand; the prosecutor came up, and said he had taken his watch.

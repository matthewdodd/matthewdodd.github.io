            , ESQ.
 I live at Kenton-park, Sunbury


. On the 1st of November I had a pair of plated spurs in my servants hall; the prisoner came that morning with a parcel - I heard some misunderstanding about the price, and I spoke to him; I did not see my spurs at that time - he shortly after left the house; he was taken by me and my brother, and given into custody.
SAMUEL WISTERTON. I am a servant to Mr. Manners. The prisoner came to the house, and stood near where the spurs were, in the servants' hall; I afterwards pursued him, and saw him throw these spurs away - my master took them up; I am certain these spurs were in the hall when the prisoner came there.
MR. ROBERT MANNERS. I am the prosecutor's brother. I went after the prisoner, and saw the spurs picked up - I did not see him throw them down.(Property produced and sworn to.)

            . I took the prisoner.
Prisoner's Defence. I went with a parcel, stopped there and had some beer; when I came out they pursued me, and one of the gentlemen came up, struck me, accused me of having the spurs, and said I had thrown them out of my pocket.

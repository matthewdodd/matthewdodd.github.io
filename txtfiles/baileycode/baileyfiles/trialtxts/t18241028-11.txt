            . I am a constable. On the 19th of October, about a quarter to nine o'clock in the evening, I was in Thames-street, and saw a man drawing a truck, and the prisoner following it - it turned into Bristow-street, and in a moment he came from it with this parcel of sugar on his shoulder, and I secured him.

HENRY TAYLOR SCOBLE
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
12th of July, 1 watch, value 15s.; 1 guard-chain, value 1s.; and 1 watch key, value 1s. 6d.; the goods of 



John Perrow.






JOHN PERROW
. I am a seaman belonging to the Bride, lying in the London Docks. I went into the Nag's Head on the night of the 2nd of July, for a pint of porter—the prisoner was there, and asked if I belonged to the brig which was lying alongside his boat—I showed him my watch—he put the chain round his neck, and went down the highway to M'Farlane's.





JOHN THOMAS
. I went to M'Farlane's on the 12th of July, and saw the prisoner there—he went out to get change for a sovereign for me—he came back, and could not get it—I said, "I don't care, give it to the land-lady"—he said he would not, but he would go and get the full amount of it—he went out and never returned—I never saw him again till I was at the station—he gave me the watch when he went out, and said if I was afraid to trust him with the sovereign, to take his watch, it was his sister's, that she gave it him when she died—the prosecutor was in company with us—he was present at the time, but I do not know whether he saw the prisoner give me the watch—I did not know it was Perrow's watch—I would not go out without giving some pledge to the landlady—I took out the watch and the prosecutor owned it.





MARY M'FARLANE
. Thomas had a dinner at my house—he gave me a sovereign—I said I had no scales to weigh it, and would not take it—it was taken out, and after that I had the watch left.





THOMAS SQUIRE
 (police-constable K 14.) I received the prisoner at the station—he said the watch belonged to Perrow—he did not produce the sovereign.

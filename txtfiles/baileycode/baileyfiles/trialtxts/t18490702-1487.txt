JOSEPH HARE
. On 23d June, I was in Lower Marsh—Ball spoke to me, and I missed this handkerchief (produced), which was in my pocket about three minutes before—I saw a person running, who I believe was the prisoner—I followed him—I lost sight of him for about three seconds, behind some boarding—I came up to him again, and told him to hand over my handkerchief, which he did, and ran away—he was stopped in the York-road.





GEORGK VAUGHAN
. I am a shoemaker. I saw the prisoner take the handkerchief from Hare's pocket, and called his attention to it.

Prisoner. Q. Where were you? A. In the shop—I was looking out of the door—I am not aware that anybody was standing between you and I—there was another one with you, a party walking behind you.





ALFRED ANSELL
 (policeman, L 86). I took the prisoner—Hare gave me this handkerchief.





HENRY LOCKYRR
 (policeman, A 90). I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction—(read Convicted 10th Nov. 1837, confined nine mmths)—he is the person—he has been tried since and acquitted, and he has had three months since then.

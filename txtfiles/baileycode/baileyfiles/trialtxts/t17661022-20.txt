            . I keep an eating-house
. On the 2d of this instant I missed a silver table spoon; I advertised it, and Mr. Carey, a pawnbroker, brought it to me.
Mr. Carey. I am a pawnbroker in Fox's-court, Gray's-inn lane; the prisoner offered this silver spoon to pledge; she said she brought it for a neighbour; on referring to the papers I found it advertised; I got a peace officer and took her into custody; she said she would shew us the party she had it of, but could or would not; she charged a boy; he was examined, but nothing appeared against him, he was cleared.
Prisoner's defence.
A lad gave it me to pawn.

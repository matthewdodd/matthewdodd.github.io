            . The prisoner lodged at my house about five nights, and she stole a pair of sheets out of her lodgings.
Q. How do you know that?
Mitchel. I took her up, and she owned she stole them in my hearing at justice Fielding's.
Honory Mitchel. I am wife to the prosecutor. I missed a pair of sheets out of the prisoner's lodging, I took her up, and she owned she stole them at the justice's, before me and my husband.

            . The prisoner pledged a sheet with me on Oct. 15, for 18 d. (He produced a sheet.)
Q. Did you know her before?
Stockdale. I had seen her before.
Q. to Mitchel. Do you know this sheet?
H. Mitchel. This is my sheet before God and the world, I know it by its being hem'd wrong at one end.
Q. from prisoner to pawnbroker. Did I ever bring any thing to you that was not my own?
Pawnbroker. She has brought two-penny handkerchiefs, and such as that.

            . On the 11th of October, the prisoner pawned a sheet with me for 18 d. (Producing it.)
C. to H. Mitchel. Look at this sheet.
H. Mitchel. This is my sheet.
Q. to Merrit. Did you know the prisoner before?
Merrit. No, I did not, but I am sure she is the person.
Prisoner's defence.
I had been ill, and had got no money, and I asked Mrs. Mitchel, she gave me liberty to take and pawn the goods, so that I did but bring them again.
H. Mitchel. This is all false, I did not know of her taking them, neither did I give her leave to take them; when I took her up, she owned she had pawned the sheets. I offered to lend her money to fetch the sheets out of pawn, but she would not tell me then where they were pawned, till I took her before the justice, then she told me where they were.

1933. 




WILLIAM HANDS



, feloniously uttering a forged request for the delivery of 1 portmanteau, with intent to defraud 



Thomas Choat.






THOMAS CHOAT
. I sell portmanteaus. On 25th May the prisoner brought this order for a portmanteau—(read—" May 21st, 1849. Please let the bearer have a portmanteau, about 16s., and you will oblige yours truly, ELLINGTON & Co.")—I knew Ellington & Co., and believing that he came from them I gave him the portmanteau.





EBENEZER ELLINGTON
. I did not send this order—I know nothing of it—the prisoner was in my service for eighteen months.




GUILTY
. Aged 26.—


Transported for Seven Years.

(There were four other indictments against the prisoner, to one of which, for obtaining goods by false pretences, he pleaded guilty.)

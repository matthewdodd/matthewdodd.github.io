SETH JOHNSON. I live at No. 145, Shoreditch


 - I was sitting in a room behind my shop getting my dinner, on the 29th of January, and looking towards the door - I saw the prisoner in the act of taking three pieces of silk handkerchief - I ran to the door, and a neighbour pursued the prisoner with me - I turned back, and my neighbour and the policeman brought the prisoner in - the handkerchiefs were found on him; four in his hat, and two in his breast - I described them to the officer before they were found - these are the handkerchiefs - I am sure they are mine.

            . On the 29th of January, about five minutes past two o'clock, I was at my door, and saw the prisoner run from the prosecutor's - I ran after him, and did not lose sight of him till he ran into the policeman's arms - I saw the handkerchiefs found on him.

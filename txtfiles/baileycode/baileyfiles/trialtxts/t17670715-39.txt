 I felt a jerk at my pocket, I turned round, and saw the prisoner going down Fetter-lane with something red in his hand; I found my handkerchief was gone; I pursued him, he took into a house about three or four doors down the lane, I followed him, and upon charging him, he either gave me the handkerchief out of his pocket, or I took it out, I do not know which (produced in court, marked L. and a figure of 7;) the house he ran into happened to be the constable's house; he begged and prayed for forgiveness, and went on his knees.

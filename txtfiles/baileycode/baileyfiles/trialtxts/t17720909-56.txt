            . I keep a lodging house in Tothill-street




. The two prisoners came to lodge at my house; I agreed to take Conolly as a servant
; she continued about a fortnight. On the 1st of July I went out and left her at work in her shift sleeves; when I returned home she and Hammond were gone, and I missed the things mentioned in the indictment; I went after them and found them in a cellar among some soldiers; Conolly had my cotton gown and hat on; Hammond sat by her with my cloth cloak on.

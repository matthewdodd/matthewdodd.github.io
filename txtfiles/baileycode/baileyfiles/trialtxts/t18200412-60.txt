             gave me information, I ran out, and saw the prisoner come from a dark corner by Tothil-fields prison, with a bag under his arm, he was whistling. I asked him what he had got there? he said he found it, but did not know what it was. I took him back, and found the butter in the bag - he resisted going along. A cheese-knife was found on him, which I knew to be mine.

            . I am a hay jobber
, and live at Croydon. On the 4th of March, I was in Whitechapel-market


, with a load of straw, and left my coat on my horse about half-past eleven o'clock, and in half an hour I missed it. I have not found it.

            . I am eleven years old. I was in Whitechapel-market, and saw the prisoner take the coat off the horse's back. I told Baker, who was loading straw. He could not overtake him; he came up George-yard. I am sure he is the person. I saw him next day in Smithfield, and knew him by a scar on his face.

            . I am a Bow-street patrol. Baker informed me of his loss. Taylor described the person, as having knee breeches, a blue coat, and a cap. I knew him by the description, he mentioned his having a scar. This was Thursday, and on Tuesday morning I saw the prisoner turning down George-yard, and took him; he denied it. I sent for the boy, who said he was the man.
Prisoner's Defence. I never wore a cap. I made no resistance when he took me. There are plenty of people dressed alike.

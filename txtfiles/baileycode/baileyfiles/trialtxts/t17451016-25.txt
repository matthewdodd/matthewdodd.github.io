             . The Prisoner was a chairwoman
 at our house; she had been at Lambeth Marsh, and had bought several things, upon that my wife suspected her; my wife told me she had been robbed; she told the money at noon, and there were fifty four guineas then, and she told it again at night, and there were but fifty two guineas. I took the Prisoner before a Justice , and she owned she took two guineas out of a chest of drawers in my room, which she had broke open.

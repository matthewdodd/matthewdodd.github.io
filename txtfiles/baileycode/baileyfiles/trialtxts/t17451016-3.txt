            . The Prisoner had been chareing at my house for a lodger, and the key of my room was left in the other lodger's room, and I suppose she opened the door and took these things out. She confessed she pawned the gown for six shillings to Mr. Hutchins.
Hutchins. I had known the Prisoner's father and mother a great while, for they often brought things, and took them out very honestly; when the Prisoner brought this gown, I did not care to take it from her, but bid her bring her mother. I asked her whether the gown was hers, and she said, yes, and I lent her six shillings upon it. When she was taken up, I asked her how she came by it, and she said she had it of a person in the street.

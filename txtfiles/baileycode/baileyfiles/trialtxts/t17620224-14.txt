            . I live in Turnmill-street, Clerkenwell


, and the latter-end of January I let the prisoner a lodging at 2 s. 4 d. per week ready furnished; there was a bed, blankets, sheets drawers, saucepan, &c. and in the night between the 12th and 13th most of the goods were carried off.
Q. What did you do when you missed your goods?
Dean. I heard she was in Chick-lane; upon that I went to find her; at last, while I was at the Jolly Sailor, she came in, and there I secured her.
Q. Did you charge her with robbing her lodgings?
Dean. Yes, and sometimes she denied, and then owned it.
Q. Did she give you any directions where to find the things you had lost?
Dean. Not directly. I heard her mention the name of Nichols once or twice, and I went there and found them.

            . The prisoner at the bar had a lodging at my house; and one night the prisoner came in after my husband and I were gone to bed, and out before we were up in the morning. I went up stairs, and found only the steddle and drawers, the bed and sheets, and other things, were gone.
Prisoner's Defence.
I have nothing particular to say, only that Eliz. Cox, taken up with me, was no-way concerned with me, any farther than she pawned the sheets at my desire.

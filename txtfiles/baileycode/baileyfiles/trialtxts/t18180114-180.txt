            , who is a butcher
, and lives in White Horse-street, Stepney


. On the 5th of January, about half-past eight o'clock, I came home, and missed a quarter of mutton and ribs of beef - I saw it safe when I went out at half-past seven. I left the shop-door bolted-it was a latch door, the upper part was open. On the Wednesday evening following I saw them at Shadwell office - I am sure it was the same meat by the skewers I put in it. I found a stick by the door, with a hook in it.

            . I am a patrol of St. George's in the East. On the 5th of January, about nine o'clock in the evening, I saw a black man in Church-lane, with a bundle under his arm - I crossed over to him, he turned into a public-house - I followed him into the passage, and took the prisoner; the meat was on the stairs in a bag. Iasked him where he got it from? he said his captain gave it to him. He would not tell me his name-it was beef and mutton.
Prisoner's Defence. I beg for mercy. A man gave it to me to carry.

            .
WILLIAM STOKES sworn.
I know the buildings belonging to George Russel and George Russel the younger, in the parish of St. Ann


, in order to describe it, it consists of a large set of ware-houses and a dwelling-house adjoining, unoccupied, held on lease by Mr. George Russel the father and son; at the east end of these premises, is a garden enclosed with a high paling, and at the west end, is a stable-yard, inclosed with a wall, and in that stable-yard is a small dwelling-house, in which lives a person, whose name is Palmer, and his family; I live in a house adjoining to them. On the 16th of November last, between the hours of seven and eight in the evening, Palmer sent word to me, that he heard the noise of people on the premises; I immediately went to the publick-house to collect some working people; and in the room, I saw three men in sailor's jackets; I went backwards to the publican and enquired about them; and we went with a gun and some people, and the watchman; and me and another took one man in the garden, that was Conner, and another let himself down from a roof into the garden, that was Smith: we took them to the publick-house; and I took Conner into a room, and he cried very much, and said it was the first time; I did not promise him any thing; he said there were six in the gang, but three worked at a time, and the other three were at the publick-house; (them were the men I saw in sailor's habits) then I called in Smith, he would not tell me any thing; then we took them to the watch-house; and on Monday I went with Mr. Palmer, and saw the first gutter was stripped of every bit of lead, which was half a ton, and part of the next gutter was stripped, and another part loosened ready to cut off; and we found another man in the chimney, and sent for the officer of the parish to take him up, and the man was dead: Conner and Smith had no lead about them when we took them; I had not been to the top of the house lately.

             sworn.
I heard the cry of thieves; I went out, and saw Conner slip off the lentvo; I took him, and assisted taking another, who was without stockings.
Court to Stokes. Did you observe any lead cut off? - I did; it was as fresh cut as possible.

             sworn.
I was in the publick-house when the alarm was given; I ran down and assisted taking the prisoners, and on Smith I found this knife; he had trowsers on, but no stockings.

            , the watchman, confirmed the other witnesses as to the story, but could not be certain of the prisoners; he assisted in taking the dead man out of the chimney.
PRISONER CONNER's DEFENCE.
I was coming from Blackwall between eight and nine o'clock, and passing by this place I heard a cry of thieves; I went to look about, and they sung out, there is one of them; I jumped into the garden, and they came and laid hold of me.
PRISONER SMITH's DEFENCE.
I had been down to Blackwall to a ship, and was coming up again; I laid there the night before, and I came there to lay again, and the people cried thieves; and I went to get up, and they said there is one, shoot him; I went to get over the palesand he cut at my fingers, and I went back again.

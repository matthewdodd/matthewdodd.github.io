            . I live in Albemarle-street, Clerkenwell parish


, I am a taylor
; I was in my shop above, and heard my wife cry, stop thief: I went down stairs, there I found the prisoner was brought in by a neighbour; the things mentioned in the indictment were found soon after, and brought in.

            . I heard the cry, stop thief, at half an hour past six that morning; I saw the prisoner in custody; he said they might search him, he had nothing about him; I had seen him running with a bundle at my first looking out; I imagined he had thrown it over the pales in St. John's-Square; I went there, and found the bundle; (produced and deposed to.)
Prisoner's defence.
I was coming along, I saw these things lying at a door, and took them; they took me, and carried me to Bridewell; I am a stone-sawyer
, and was going to my work at Blackfriars-bridge.

WILLIAM PITT. I am a shoemaker
, and live in Little Coram-street


. On Monday the 17th of January, I saw the prisoner Munt at my door, looking at a pair of boots which hung on a nail; he handled them in his hands - I did not see any one with him. I saw him again in a minute or two pass the shop window, with the boots under his coat. I followed him to Tavistock-place, where the prisoner Edmunds took the boots from him. I saw Edmunds with the boots about three minutes after Munt had taken them.

                  RICKARDS
               



            . I live in Tavistock-square. I was going to the prosecutor's house, on the 17th of January, between one and two o'clock, and I saw Munt take a pair of boots off the nail at the door - he put them under his coat, and walked away with them - he gave them to Edmunds when he got round the corner. Edmunds wrapped them up in a handkerchief, and I suppose was going to take them away. I took hold of Munt, and stopped Edmunds.

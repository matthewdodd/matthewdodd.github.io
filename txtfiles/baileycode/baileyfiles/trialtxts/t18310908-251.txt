JOHN OWEN. I am a butcher
 - the prisoners were in my service; I had taken Wildey in out of charity, as a jobbing-man. On the 18th of August I shut up my shop, and they were going home to their supper; they live opposite; I stopped Wildey, and asked what he had got in that cloth - he said a piece of beef, which Butler gave him to take - Butler ran across, I followed and brought him back, and the Policeman took a breast of lamb from him: both joints were in my shop two minutes before, when I left the prisoners there; Wildey said,"Master I had nothing to do with it, Butler gave it me to hold, till he came from supper:" Wildey had told me a fortnight before to look out - the cloth this meat was in is mine.
Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q.Wildey was only an occasional man? A. Yes - when I took Wildey, Butler was crossing the street, and turned to go into the privy; he had been a long time with me, and I suspected he had been robbing me all the while: I stopped Wildey as soon as he got out of the shop.
Butler's Defence. I never saw the beef - I picked the lamb up going through the market.
Wildey received a good character.

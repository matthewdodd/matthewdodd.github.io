            . I am employed by Mrs. John and Caple Hambury, to see that nobody pilfers on the keys, &c. On the 1st of January we were weighing near 100 hogsheads of tobacco for exportation. We had some that were weighed and made fast by the Cooper, and were roll'd a distance from the scale, where we were weighing. I saw the prisoner at the bar pull several times out of a hogshead, after it was weigh'd; I seiz'd him and found some in his bosom, some in his breeches and some in his pockets; in all about a pound and half; he has been a common pilferer, and very troublesom by the waterside.

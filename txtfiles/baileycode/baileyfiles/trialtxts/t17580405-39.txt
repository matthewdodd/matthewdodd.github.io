            . I am a watchman. On the 26th of February, a little after 2 in the morning, I was doing my duty, the beadle and I were going by the lower end of York-street, St. James's Square, we saw Parsly with a basket on his shoulder; it appeared to me to be full. Dannald had three legs of mutton, two of them were in an apron over his shoulder, the other on his right arm; they went up the street by us, I saw the legs of mutton had not been chopped; I began to feel on them, he let them fall on the ground; the other watchman laid hold of Parsly, we took them both to the watchouse, and wanted them to give an account to the constable how they came by this meat. When the constable examined the basket which Parsly had, there was a breast of veal, a shoulder of mutton, and part of another shoulder.

            . I stopped Parsly, and the other watchman stopped Dannald; they were together; we took them to the watchouse, and left them there; then I went on my duty again.
Q. What had Dannald about him?
Nicholson. I cannot tell; I know there was something in the basket.

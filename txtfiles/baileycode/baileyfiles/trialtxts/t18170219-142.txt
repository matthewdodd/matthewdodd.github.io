. On the 30th of January, I let the prisoner a lodging - She then informed me that she was married. I have learned that she is not married. The articles stated in the indictment were let to her with the lodging. The stove was fixed. She remained in the lodging a week-she gave me no notice; she left me between two and three o'clock in the day, and never returned again till the Monday following. I had her door opened, and missed the things. She was taken in the evening.

            . I am the wife of

            , who lives in Brown's-lane, Spitalfields


. I saw my shawl in my drawer, in my bed-room, at about five o'clock in the afternoon, on the 14th of July, and it was taken to be pawned at my nephew's. I know nothing about the robbery; I did not see the prisoner about the house at all.

            . This shawl was brought to be pawned with me on the evening of the 14th of July; I thought it was like one which I knew my aunt had; part of my mother's house had been burnt down in the great fire, and the shawl was taken from it.

            . I am an officer. I produce the shawl. The prisoner told me, that on the night of the fire a gentleman and lady whose house had been burned down, came to his house, and asked for a night's lodging, which they had, and not being able to get change for a ten-pound note in the morning, they left this shawl.

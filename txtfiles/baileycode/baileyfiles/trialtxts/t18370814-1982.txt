JOHN DAVIS
. I am a butcher, and live opposite Mr. Kelday's shop, at Hackney-road. On the 12th of August, I saw the prisoner unpin the three gown-pieces, and take them away, with a pair of stockings—he wrapped them up and was going away—a woman stopped him—he dropped the things, and was running away, I ran and caught him.

Prisoner. I was walking along, and you walked afterwards. Witness. He ran and I caught him by the collar.





THOMAS MUNTON
. I am in the employ of Mr. John Kelday, a pawnbroker, in Durham-place, Hackney-road. I was in the shop on the morn ing in question—a young woman gave me information, and I missed these from the inside of the door in the shop.

Prisoner. They were just inside the shop, lying down at the door—I stopped a minute and looked at them, and then this gentleman collared me. Witness. They were pinned up.
(Robert Higgins, of Hart-lane, Bethnal-green; Thomas Lloyd, a weaver, in Hare-marsh, and Thomas Nyal, of No. 62, St. John-street, Bethnal-green, gave the prisoner a good character.)

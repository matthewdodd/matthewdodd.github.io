I am a linen draper


, in Union-street, Old Artillery Ground


, in partnership with Richard Birchall and Joseph Toomes. On the 15th of October, I saw these two prisoners were in the shop with other customers; the shop is part of the dwelling house. I told our young man to be cautious.

             sworn.
I am the shopman to the prosecutors. I saw the prisoners in our shop, the 15th of October; the prisoner Leeson came in first, and asked to see some muslins; while I was shewing them, Harris entered; I asked him his business? he said, nothing, only with that lady; I shewed him some muslins; they were not fine enough; she bought half a yard of callico for six-pence, and some brown Holland, half a yard for six-pence; I then shewed her another piece of muslin; she bought half a yard for four and six-pence, and paid for all those articles; I was folding up the muslin separate; and I saw her take a piece from the counter; she went out with it; I got over the counter, and pursued both the prisoners; they went out together; I desired them to stop; she consented; Harris refused; I brought them in, and called assistance, and sent for a constable; on turning about, I saw the muslin lay at her feet, which I took up.

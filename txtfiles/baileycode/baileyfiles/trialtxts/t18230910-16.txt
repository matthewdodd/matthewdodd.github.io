. I had frequently missed goods, and on the 12th of July, about six o'clock in the evening, I met the prisoner in the yard with a bundle on his back; he had no business there. I followed, and stopped him at the end of Maiden-lane,and asked what he had got; he said two pieces of linen, and some damask table cloths, which belonged to one Murphy, which I knew to be false - he then said they belonged to one John M'Anotty, who I knew had nothing there, and took him back to the warehouse, and found they had been taken out of a box, which had been well corded up.
Prisoner. Q. When I brought them back, did you take me directly - A. No; I let him go till I spoke to Mr. Holt.
Prisoner's Defence. I have known the owner of the goods for years, and he has said that when I wanted cloth, if he was not at the place I might take it. I went to this box and took it.

            . Hugh M'Anotty is the owner of the goods - he packed them to be sent to Brighton; his name was on the box.

            . I have known the prisoner about ten months, she was Mrs. Cibber's maid, and had lived there about that time; several things were missing, and she was suspected.
Q. What are you?
Hassler. I am servant to Mr. Sloper; she was accused with taking the things, and owned it, and by her directions many were found again: she had sold the gold clasps to a silversmith, and the other things were pawned to Mr. Gunson.
Q. Where does your master live?
Hassler. He lives in Scotland-yard.

            . I belong to Mr. Gunson, a pawnbroker, the prisoner told us she kept a house in St. James's-street.
Q. How long had you known her?
Westery. I had known her about twelve months (he produced four shirts, and three pair of ruffles) on these she had thirty-four shillings, and six-pence; I lent her fourteen shillings upon two of them, and my master's brother, who is sick in the country, lent her the money on the other two.
Hassler. These are my master's property; here is the letter S. on some of them, and W. S. on others.
Prisoner's Defence.
I have some relations here to my character. They were called, but none appeared.

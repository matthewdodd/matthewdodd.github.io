            . I live in Great Marlborough-street, Carnaby-market


; I am a cheesemonger
. The prisoner came into my shop on the 29th of September, about eight at night.
Q. Did you see him?
Blest. I did, and saw him take one cheese, and walk out.

Q. Did you know him before?
Blest. I never saw him before that, to my knowledge.
Q. Was you in the shop at the time?
Blest. I was sitting in my back room. I went to look, being well assured he had taken one, but I found two gone. I pursued directly, and took him with the cheeses upon him.
Q. How far had he gone?
Blest. He had gone about 40 yards from my door.
Prisoner's defence.
I was coming from my mother's to go to my lodgings in Swallow-street, at the same time this gentleman lost two cheeses; he came and took hold of me, and said, I had taken two cheeses, but I had no cheeses upon me.

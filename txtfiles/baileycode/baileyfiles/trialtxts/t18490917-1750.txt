On Monday night, 28th Aug., I was at the White Lion, at Paddington—I was intoxicated—I saw the prisoner outside—I asked him to take me home—I had my watch with me—he took me home—I cannot say whether he took me up-stairs or not—I lost my watch and chain—these are them (produced).

Cross-examined by
MR. O'BRIEN. Q. Were there many persons in the White Lion? A. I was with some friends—I had my watch while I was there—I cannot say whether I went into any other public-house after the White Lion—I expended all the money I had at the White Lion—I would not undertake to say that if I wanted more drink, and had not money to pay for it, I did not give the wa ch to the prisoner to get more drink—I have no recollection of having gone into some other public-house.

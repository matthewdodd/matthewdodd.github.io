WILLIAM BLAGG
, joiner, Dover-road, On Wednesday night, the 27th of March, I came by the railway from Nottingham—my brother met me at Euston-square—he put my things into a cart, and drove to Smithfield—we left the cart about half-past ten o'clock, and went into a public-house for about a quarter of an hour—when I came back my box, which contained the articles stated, was gone—I went to the police office and saw the prisoner and the box there.





JOSEPH CALDWELL
 (City police-constable, No. 211.) At half-past eleven o'clock on the night of the 27th of March, I saw the prisoner carrying this box along Smithfield—I sent Humphries to meet him, and he took him in my presence, and took him to the station—this is the box—I saw him about ten yards from the cart, about three minutes before he was taken—he said a stout man employed him to carry it to the corner of Old-street, but he did not know the man, nor where he was to take it.

; the prisoner worked for me; the things mentioned in the indictment were taken out of my parlour; the prisoner was stopped with them; I asked him how he came to take them; he said he came over the ditch, and in at the kitchen door, and found the key over the parlour door, and he went in, and took the things out of the beauset; (produced and deposed to.)
The prisoner said nothing in his defence, but called Mr. Dilley,

I am servant to Messrs. Newby and Co. I was in the warehouse on the 12th of June, telling off some lamb skins; the prisoner was my fellow servant
, he had occasion to go down stairs; he came up, and as we went to dinner, I observed, you are bigger about the waist than when you came into the warehouse; come, let me seewhat it is, you have something more than you should have; therefore out with it; and it proved to be a beaver skin; he said he wanted it to shew somebody as a pattern. (Produced by Newby.) I let him go, because my master was not within, he was taken within the hour, he had been in the warehouse at seasons for three years.
Mr. Peatt, Prisoner's Counsel. Is he a porter in the house? - Yes, I was telling off some lamb skins that were sold, it was concealed in his trowsers, it was not visible.

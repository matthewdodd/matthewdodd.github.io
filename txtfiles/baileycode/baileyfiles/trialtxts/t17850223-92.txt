             sworn.
I live in Aldersgate-street


, my shop window was broke between four and five in the afternoon, on the 14th of January last, and the things in the indictment taken; the handkerchiefs were found upon the prisoner immediately after.

             sworn.
I live directly opposite to the prosecutor; on the 14th of February I heard the cry of stop thief, one of the other witnesses had hold of him; I took a piece of handkerchiefs from him.
Prosecutor. I cannot swear to them, I lost such sort, and they are the same number.
Prisoner. That witness was not there at the time it was done.

                   SERLE
               



             sworn.
I live in the neighbourhood of the prosecutor; I had been down in my cellar for some coals, and my boy says to me, take care daddy, there is a bull coming; there were a number of people, and I saw the prisoner pass this window, and turn back again; I stepped towards that side of the way, I staid there till the glass broke; I was determined to take the first man that came away; the prisoner was not dressed as he is now; he came a yard off the pavement; and I said, you shall not have that property; I immediately took him to my own side of the way, and this man took something out of his breast, which were handkerchiefs; these are the handkerchiefs.

             sworn.
There was a body of people coming along, I saw them stop, and heard the prosecutor's window smash in; I saw Serle take hold of the prisoner, and I saw the prisoner drop these three handkerchiefs from him, and I saw Serle take the other two handkerchiefs from the prisoner's coat.
PRISONER's DEFENCE.
He said, when his wife lay-in, he lost a quantity of wet linen; and he said, if my life would pay for it, he would swear it away; I was coming along, there were forty or fifty people, I thought there was a house on fire; I kicked these handkerchiefs before me, and a gentleman knocked me down; I did not think that any pane of glass was broke. I have no witnesses.

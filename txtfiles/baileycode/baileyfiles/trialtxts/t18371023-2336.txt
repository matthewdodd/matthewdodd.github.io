ELIZABETH RILEY
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
19th of October, 150 yards of flannel, value 14l., the goods of 



Thomas Venables and another; and that she had been before convicted of felony.






ERNEST GEORGE LADENSACK
. I am in the employ of Thomas Venables and another, linen-drapers, in Whitechapel. On the 19th of October we missed a piece of flannel, about twenty minutes before six o'clock, and I another in about five minutes—Mr. Charles Venables told me he thought one piece was stolen—I was called in to give change, when Mr. Venable sturned, I and missed another—I went into the street for three hundred yards—I did not see any one, but coming back I met the prisoner with one piece under her cloak—when she saw I was watching her, she dropped one piece from under her cloak—I gave an alarm—she ran up to a house, ran up stairs, and was then taken—both pieces were found in the street—she had a cloak a big enough to cover four such pieces—they are my master's.

Prisoner. Q. Did you see me drop the flannel? A. You did, at my feet—you got into the house, and ran up stairs.





TIMOTHY TOOMEY
. I am a policeman. About a quarter past six o'clock I heard the cry of "Stop thief" in Essex-street—I ran into the court and found the prisoner in the upper room, and a woman in the act of turning her out—Ladensack said, "That is the woman"—I found nobody in the house at all like her—she had a large cloak on.


Prisoner. He did not see me with the flannel at all, nor did he see me drop it—he saw me turn up a court, and then he followed me—I have a little baby two years old, that will greatly miss my protection.





JOHN MACDONALD
. I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the woman.




GUILTY

Transported for Fourteen Years.

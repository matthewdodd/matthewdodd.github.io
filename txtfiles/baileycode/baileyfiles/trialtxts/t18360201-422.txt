RICHARD CHALMERS KNIGHT
. I live in the East India-road, and am a surgeon. On the 9th of January, I was going along Leadenhall-street, I felt a shake at my coat—I turned rapidly round, and discovered Donohue with his hand close to my pocket, and my handkerchief not exactly

in his hand, but in its transit from his hand to Day it fell to the ground—Day was close at his heels, he passed on—I did not see him take me handkerchief—I stooped down and picked it up.

Day. I was going along Leadenhall-street, a gentleman took me and accused me of going to take this gentleman's handkerchief of the ground, but this gentleman said I did not touch it—I had nothing to do with it.





CHARLES PRICE
. I am a porter. I was in Leadenhall-street—I saw both the prisoners for about two minutes—I saw the prosecutor passing, and Donohue took the white handkerchief from his pocket, and was handing it to Day—I ran across and laid hold of them—the gentleman took up the handkerchief—Day was holding out his hand to receive it, when the other took it—they were both connected—they appeared to have one common purpose.

Day. Q. Did you see me have the handkerchief? A. No—but you were putting out your hand to receive it—I cannot say which hand.

Day's Defence, He said at the watchhouse, that I said I was going to stoop to pick it up—he is a man that gets his living by swearing people's lives away.

COURT
to
CHARLES PRICE. Q. How long is it since you were here? A. Seven or eight months—I was formerly in the police—I have not been here since I was in the police, but that once—Day was holding his coat up to cover Donohue, and what he was doing—I know them both.

DONOHUE—


GUILTY
. Aged 15.

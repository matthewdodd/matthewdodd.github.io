            . I am a butcher. I bought eight pigs late in the afternoon of the 27th of November of the prisoner, at Smithfield. I gave him 2 l., and said I would fetch them on Monday, and pay the rest, which was 25 l. 7 s. 6 d. On Monday I met him at the Bell, and paid him 25 l. 5 s. for the pigs, and 2 s. 6 d. for their keep. I gave him a 20 l. note, and I believe two 2 l. and a 1 l. note, and 7 s. 6 d. in silver.
Prisoner's Defence. I never was his servant.

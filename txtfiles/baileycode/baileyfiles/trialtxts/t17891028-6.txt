 at Chamberlain's wharf


; there were ninety bales of flannels from Mr. Wingate, for Mr. Perrins, to whom they were consigned; we received them on his account; it was the 3d of October; they were landed in the course of the day; I saw them about five; there appeared no deficiency then; I am sure this bale that was afterwards broke open, was then safe.

             sworn.
I am watchman at Chamberlain's wharf; about ten minutes after seven, I was going my rounds, and found a bale of white flannel cut open, and some taken out; I went to the compting-house, and acquainted the clerks; I saw that five pieces were left behind; such bales always contain ten pieces.

                   Inkins
               



             first; he came to my door, and asked me to buy some flannel; it was between seven and eight in the evening; I told him I would have no concern with him; I went out to the door, and saw How and Giles come into the house with the flannel; they laid it on a chair; immediately the officers, Mr. Whiteway and Mr. Beyer, came in and took Giles and How, who were in the room; Inkins went away directly; I never saw the prisoners before.
Prisoner Inkins. Did not you swear before the Justice, that I brought nothing into the house? - I did not.

             sworn.
I am wife of the last witness; Giles and How brought these pieces of flannel, and offered them for sale; I said I would have nothing to do with them; which brought it in, I cannot say; I did not see Inkins.



                  WILLIAM
                   WHITEWAY
               



             sworn.
I attend the publick office in East Smithfield; on Saturday evening, the 3d of this month, I went, on information, with Beyer to Stubbs's house; I saw How and Giles with Mrs. Stubbs; these two pieces of flannel laid on a chair; Mrs. Stubbs said the flannels did not belong to her; the prisoners said they did not belong to them; I took the two prisoners to the office, and the flannel; I went out again; going up East Smithfield, I saw the other two prisoners on the opposite side of the way, going with the bundles; that is Inkins and Wells; I ran and laid hold of the prisoner Wells, and took a piece of flannel from under his arm; one of these pieces of flannel; Beyer ran and laid hold of Inkins, and took a piece from him; I secured the men and the flannel.

             sworn.
I was in company with Whiteway; I secured How and Giles in the shop, first; then we went out a second time; and I took the prisoner

                   Inkins
               



            , with a piece of flannel upon him; it has been in our possession ever since.

                   Windage
               



             of Devonshire, consigned to my care; they appear the same as those that were in the bale; I have brought one of the other pieces; they correspond as much as possible.
PRISONER HOW's DEFENCE.
I went into this shop to buy a lock and key to my chest; the man and woman both swore different before the Justice; they swore that a short man came in, in a brown jacket, and a pair of trowsers, and a cast in his eye.
PRISONER GILES's DEFENCE.
I was coming under the gateway; I saw something lay, and I picked it up; and as I was going past this man's shop, he asked me if I had anything to sell; I offered him this flannel; I asked him a shilling a yard; he bid me eight-pence; he went to get a measure to measure it, and the officer came in.
PRISONER WELLS's DEFENCE.
I saw a coach come by East Smithfield; and two pieces fell out of the coach, and we picked them up.
Prisoner Inkins. I can say no more than this man.

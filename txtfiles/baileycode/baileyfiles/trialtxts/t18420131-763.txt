ROBERT SELKIRK
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
19th of January, 4 pairs of trowsers, value 8s., the goods of 




John Lane; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






THOMAS CAREY
 I live at Bogner, Sussex. On the 19th of January I was in York-street, Westminster, and saw the prisoner pull some things from Mr. Lane's door, at the corner of Bell-yard, and run down the court with them—I ran after him, calling, "Stop thief"—he dropped them, slipped down, and I laid hold of him—he said, "I have done nothing"—I said, "You have taken something from the door"—he began struggling with me—a man came up—I got him to hold him, while I took up the trowsers—he got hold of a water-spout, and would not go back, but I got a policeman to secure him.





JOHN LANE
. I live in York-street, Westminster. These are my trowsers, they were taken from my door, where they hung—I am a clothes salesman.





JOHN NELSON PIPER
 I am a policeman. I apprehended the prisoner—he had a set of false curls fastened to his hat.

Prisoner's Defence. I was going through Bell's-yard, to seek for work; a man ran by me, with the trowsers, and shoved them into my hand; I did not know what to make of it; a person called, "Stop thief," and put them down, and I fell down.





JAMES GOODSELL
. I am a policeman. I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—I was a witness on his trial, and know him to be the man.




GUILTY
. Aged 20.—


Transported for Ten Years.
(The prisoner had been convicted of felony twice before.)

 for stealing, on the 
7th of August, 6 knives, value 1s., and 6 forks, value 1s., the goods of 



Jacob Russell; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






JAMES LOW
. I live in Fore-street. Between five and six o'clock in the evening of the 7th of August I saw the prisoner and two more standing near Mr. Russell's shop—the prisoner whipped something off the board and put it under his waistcoat—I secured him, and found this parcel under his waistcoat.





SAMUEL SLOPER
. I am assistant to Mr. Jacob Russell. The prisoner was brought in, and this property was under his waistcoat—he had no business with them—I had not sold them to him or his comrades.





JOHN TRACEY
.(police constable N 28.) I produce this certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY

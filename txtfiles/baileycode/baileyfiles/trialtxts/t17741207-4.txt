Gabrial Sprouls. I live in King-street, Seven Dials, I lost a dozen razors, at the corner of the Fleet-Market


, they were taken out of my pocket, I felt them going out of my pocket, I turned round and took hold of the prisoner, and I saw him conveying the razors to another person, who I could not lay hold of, they were tied up in a whity brown paper.
Q. Did you see the paper of razors in his hand?
A. Yes. I took the prisoner to the Compter.

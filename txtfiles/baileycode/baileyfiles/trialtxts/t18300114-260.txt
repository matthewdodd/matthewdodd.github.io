            .
MR. PHILLIPS conducted the prosecution.
THOMAS BROWN. I am a green-grocer, and live in Horse Shoe-alley. On the evening of the 31st of December I was going out, and saw 
               
                  Richard 
                  Tomes
               



             sitting on five bundles of paper; he got up, and tried to lift them all under his arm, but could not, and put them down again - he then gave two bundles into the hands of Coleman, who passed them into the hands of 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Price
               



            , who was in the passage of the house where the paper was found, which is No. 4, Sander's-buildings, Horse Shoe-alley; it stood against the window of a chandler's-shop, which I thought was a dirty place - I watched, and saw it passed into the house; I gave information to Vann.
Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. When did you give information? A. About a quarter of an hour afterwards; I had never seen Coleman before, to my knowledge - this was about a quarter or half-past five o'clock: it was dusk - all I saw was Coleman receive some paper from one man and hand it to another; I had seen him come down the alley before he received the paper; I let out trucks. In June or July last I was taken up about some peas, but was acquitted; I had been tried two or three years before, for having been standing by some property which had been stolen - I was in prison here before the trial, but was not imprisoned six months afterwards here - I was tried over the water at the Town-hall, on suspicion of robbing my master, and committed to prison; I had not been on shore long before that - I was discharged in 1815; I have not been on shore ever since - I have made voyages to the East Indies; I never was transported - I have lived eighteen months or two years in Horse Shoe-alley; only one misfortune has happened to me since I have been there.
THOMAS VANN. I am an officer of Worship-street. On the evening of Thursday, the 31st of December, the witness gave me information - I went with Armstrong and Attfield to No. 4, Sander's-buildings, which the witness pointed out - I went to the first floor, where I saw the four male prisoners; the other two officers got in before me - I saw five reams of paper on the table, and a great quantity in a box; I saw Coleman throw something over a bedstead- I went there, and found this wrapper and this string, which he was pushing under the bedstead with his foot; Cook said we are all marplotted; Armstrong asked all the prisoners, one by one, about this paper, and they all answered that they knew nothing about it - Coleman said he had just come from the Salmon and Ball, in Bunhill-row, and had seen my son go in there; I said it was all right then: part of the paper was muddy - these covers were found there; this one is marked - some of the other reams had covers on them, but a great deal had been stripped off - we took the paper and the prisoners. I afterwards saw Mr. Alderman Key, who showed me some other wrappers, with marks on them.
Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did not Coleman say he had come there to a tailor to repair some of his clothes? A. No, he did not; my son is not here, but I have no doubt but he did go to the Salmon and Ball.
Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Did not you say before the Magistrate that you believed Cook said they were all marplotted? A. I swore it there positively, as I do now, but the Magistrate said he thought it fairest that it should be inserted "I believe so;" I think 
               
                  Jane 
                  Tomes
               



             was there, but I will not be positive - there was not a great deal of talking; they were all very quiet: I swear, to my belief, that Cook did use the expression - I never heard him say he had come home with the female prisoner half an hour before, and was regularly taken in; I do not think it is a house to which men and women resort.
THOMAS BROWN re-examined. Q. How soon after you saw them go into the house did you give the information? A.About a quarter of an hour.
Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. You state you saw Coleman, 
               
                  Richard 
                  Tomes
               



            , and Price? A. Yes, and I saw Cook come up the alley about a quarter of an hour after the paper was delivered in the house, and 
               
                  Jane 
                  Tomes
               



             with him - he went between my truck and the wall, and said, "I am so fat I can hardly get by;" I said, "You have not seen many banyan days."
JOSHUA ARMSTRONG. I went with Vann to the house, and found all the prisoners there, and there was a quantity of paper on the table and a light - the prisoners were standing round the table; I asked them separately how the paper came there; they all said, they did not know- I heard the word marplol, made use of, but I cannot say by whom; I found this wrapper on the table, and we took the prisoners and the paper - some of it was muddy.

                  ATTFIELD
               



            . I went to the house with the other officers; what they have said is correct - Coleman took this cover and threw it sharply on the bed behind them; the paper is more than one man could carry.
Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q.Are you sure Coleman did that? A. Yes; I should think the house is three quarters of a mile from Alderman Key's.
JOHN COLES. I live with my father, who is a paper-manufacturer, at Wells, in Somersetshire. I have looked at this paper; it is our manufacture - we supply a person in Fleet-market, of the name of Morgan, with paper; we sent a lot of paper to him in a regular way, on the 14th of December - the first ream was No. 522, and the last was No. 612 - we put the letter 
               M. 
            outside it - it is made with a stamp, which I cut out myself; it is but a common 
               M. 
            - this M. on the wrapper, looks very much like it, and I believe it is the same - here is one ream of this; these reams are Nos. 536, 529, 562, 558, and 527.
Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How do you number your lots of paper? A. Every quarter of the year we begin with No. 1. - we have another customer, whose name begins with M. and mark his paper with the same stamp; I have our book here, and it appears that we sent these numbers to Morgan, in the second quarter of 1830 - our first quarter of 1830 began in July last, and ended in October, and our second quarter is from October to January - next July will be 1831 with us.
MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Can you have any mistake about these numbers going to Morgan? A. No.


                  WILLIAM 
                  WAREHAM
               



            . I am warehouseman to Mr. Morgan, of Fleet-market. We received ninety-one reams ofpaper from the manufactory, on the 14th of December, and on the 22nd of December they were all sold to Mr. Alderman Key.


                  JOHN 
                  KEY
               



            , ESQ. My partner's name is Jonathan Muckelstone Key - he is the only partner I have; we examined our stock of paper made by Coles, and missed ten reams; we received the paper from Mr. Morgan, of Fleet-market - the lots were from No. 522, to 612; I have examined the paper that was found - five of the wrappers have been destroyed, but I have examined the wrappers which were found, and in every instance we have the preceding number, and the succeeding one; we lost ten reams - they are worth about 9l. 10s. - I have no doubt these are ours.
Cross-examined by MR ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you see the numbers on those papers yourself? A. Yes; we wanted them for a particular purpose, and I waited till they came in - fifty-six reams were sent out the next day; when I heard of these being found, I went to the place they were sent to, and found fifty-two of them remaining at His Majesty's stationery office - I found the preceding, and the succeeding numbers to these, on those which remained at home; I am sure these had not been sent out.
Coleman's Defence. I left work at half-past four o'clock, and went to Tomes' house to have a coat repaired; I had not been there five minutes, when the officer came and took me - the paper, and the covers laid on the table - I took up one cover to look at, and threw it down.

                  Tomes
               



            ' Defence. I was coming down London-wall; I cast my eye up a gateway, where I stopped, and saw this paper lying in the wet - I brought it down as far as the gateway, and a boy was coming by - I asked him to lend me a hand to carry it, which he did; when we got to the place, it was heavy, and he let it fall off his shoulder - there was a young woman coming by, and I asked if we might leave it at a chandler's shop; the woman said No - I said we would take it up stairs; I did take it up, and tore off part of the dirty paper, and was going to put it into the box, to be out of the way; Cook and my sister did not come in for half an hour.

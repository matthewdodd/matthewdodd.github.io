THOMAS BURTHOM
. I am a shoemaker, and live in Devonshire-street, Lisson-grove. On Saturday evening, the 29th of January, about six o'clock, I looked into my shop, and found every thing in confusion—I missed from the window two pairs of Blucher boots and one pair of shoes—I have seen them since—the two pairs of Blucher boots I applied to the prisoner about, being informed he had left my place—I asked him about them—he said he knew nothing about them—I said, "If you don't give them up I will get a policeman"—his sister went to the foot of the bed, and gave me one pair—the prisoner went to a cupboard, and gave me up these other pair—he told me that another boy told him to take them, and he would make away with them.

Prisoner's Defence. My sister gave him them all.

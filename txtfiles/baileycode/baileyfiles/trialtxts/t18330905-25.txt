            . I know the house of Mr. Samuel Phillips, at the corner of Newcastle-street, Strand


 - at a quarter before eight o'clock, in the evening of the 22nd of July, I saw the prisoner, and knowing him, I watched him; I saw him come up the street, go down again, and then come up behind two ladies - he then tore this coat down from the prosecutor's window, and went off with it; I called "Stop thief" - he dropped it - I took it and pursued him till he was taken.

            . I am a widow, and live in Charles-street, Hatton-garden


. On the 9th of March, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, these things hung in my parlour to dry; the door was a little ajar - I was backward. The prisoner pushed the screen aside, and my daughter said there was a woman; I saw the prisoner going out; she said she wanted Mrs. Gregory - I said she did not live there. My daughter said she had got all the things under her arm - she said they were Mrs. Gregory's things. I pulled her into the room, and took them from under her arm - she had got to the door.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I asked for Mrs. Cotterill.

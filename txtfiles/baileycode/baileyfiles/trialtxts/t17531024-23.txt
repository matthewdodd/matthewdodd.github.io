Coultis. No, he did not; he ran away, and I after him to a packthread ground, where he stopp'd and swore he'd not give it me, and that he'd knock me down if I offered to touch it, he had it on his head, and his own in his hand at the time, I saw him put it on his head. Then I went to my friend's house again, and told them I had lost my hat. The prisoner was taken up, and he own'd before the justice where he had sold it for 1 s. 6 d.

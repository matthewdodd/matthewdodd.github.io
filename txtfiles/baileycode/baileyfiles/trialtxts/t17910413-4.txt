I know Mr. Tanner's house, I know he has nine houses at Pimlico on last Sunday evening Mr. Hatchett who lives opposite, came and rang my bell, and said there were thieves on the houses; I went with a candle and lanthorn in one hand, and a pistol in the other, I searched the house, and found one of the prisoners in the chimney, and called to him, and told him he was a dead man if he did not come down; he came down and I took him: after that I went and searched the nine houses, and found the sheet of copper rolled up ready to take away: Holt was taken to the watch house.

On Sunday evening last I heard there was an alarm of thieves on the houses; about nine o'clock I was set to watch, to see they did not escape; we heard a noise of somebody coming down, I saw Wright comeout of the kitchen, I pursued him as far Lady Dacres's Alms-houses, I took him.

I took the copper from the building, it was in the gutter, it was ripped off the biggest part of the gutter, it was moved from the place where it was ripped to the other gutter; I took it and fitted it, and it matched exactly.

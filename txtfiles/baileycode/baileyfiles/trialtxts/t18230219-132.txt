            . I am captain of the watch of St. James's. On the 20th of February, about two o'clock in the morning. I heard a noise in this house like glass breaking - the watchman came to me; we got assistance, went in, and found the two prisoners there, and secured them.

            . I am a watchman. I went into the house about half-past two o'clock in the morning, and when we got to the foot of the stairs, we heard people running up stairs - we went to the first floor back room, and found the sashes with all the glass taken out. We found the prisoners in the atris - they said they came to sleep there. We searched them at the watch-house, and found a knife on Mitchell covered with putty, and both of them had putty stickings on their hands.

            . I was at work at the house, and left about six o'clock; all was then safe - the sashes were not fastened, they stood in the room. The door was nailed up, but not locked.
MITCHELL's Defence. I never saw the sashes. I was passing, and saw two people come out - I asked if they would let us lay there out of the night air; they said, Yes, if we would make no noise. I found the knife on the stairs.

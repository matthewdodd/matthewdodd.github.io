COLONEL
 JOHN ROSS. I am in the Army
. I was in Regent-street


 about eleven o'clock on Sunday evening, the 10th of June - I felt a motion at my coat pocket; I put my hand down, and missed my handkerchief; I turned, and caught hold of the prisoner close at my elbow, with it in his hand - I gave him in charge.
Cross-examined by MR. J. ALLEY. Q. Were there not many persons passing? A. Yes. I am sure he was close to my back; I did not see him stoop - he made no resistance.
JURY. Q. Was the prisoner nearest to you? A. Yes, so close that I immediately took hold of him; he begged to be allowed to go. I am convinced almost that it was his first offence, and I beg to recommend him to mercy.

            . I am an officer. I took the prisoner, and produce the handkerchief.(Property produced and sworn to.)
The prisoner received a good character.

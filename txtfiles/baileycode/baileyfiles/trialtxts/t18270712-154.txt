            . I live with my brother, a pawnbroker, in Three Colt-court; the prisoner brought me this spoon to sell, it was broken in three pieces - I detained him; he said he found it - I asked if he would go with me to his master - he said Yes; we set off, and he took me about two miles out of the way. I told him to be a good boy, and I would do all I could for him - he then said he had stolen it.
Prisoner's Defence. I picked it up; and only went to ask him if it was silver.

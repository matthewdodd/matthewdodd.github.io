for stealing, on the 
4th of June, 1 purse, value 5s.; 2 sovereigns, 1 half-sovereign, 1 half-crown, and 4 sixpences; the property of 



George Orred, from his person.






GEORGE ORRED.
I live at Ruberry Park, Hampshire. About halfpast three o'clock, on the 4th of June, 1 was walking up Ludgate-hill—I had seen my purse safe about ten o'clock—I did not miss it till I received information—it contained two sovereigns, a half-sovereign, a half-crown, and four shillings—this is it—(looking at it.)





CHARLES MURRAY.
I live in Portland-street. On the 4th of June, about half-past three o'clock, I was in an omnibus, going up Ludgate-hill—I saw a man, not the prisoner, take a purse out of he prosecutor's pocket—he crossed the street, and ran away, with it—I got out of the omnibus, followed, and caught him, the prisoner came up, and said, "Jack, hand us the purse, " or, "Give me up the purse"—he gave it to him, and I took it from him—that was about two minutes after I saw the other man take it—I took hold of him immediately after.

Cross-examined by
M. BALLANTINE.
Q. You ran after the man that took it? A. Yes—I had watched them about five minutes before the purse was taken, and bad seen the prisoner in company with the man who took it—I had seen them together for four or five minutes watching the gentleman, which aroused my suspicion.

JURY.
Q. When the prisoner got the purse, did he endeavour to escape? A. No, because I had hold of him—I laid hold of him directly he spoke.
(John Payne, boot-maker, of Whitecross-street, gave the prisoner a good character.)

            . On the 12th of August, I was at St. James's



, with a country friend that wanted to see his Majesty: I lost my watch in the crowd; I don't know who took it; it was taken out of my pocket. I went to Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            , and got it advertised. About a fortnight after, Sir John's clerk wrote to me, to let me know they had found my watch. I went there; they sent me to a pawnbroker, who is here; there I found it to be my watch.

            . I live at Lower Featherstone-buildings; I am a pawnbroker. A day or two after this watch was advertised, the prisoner brought it to me to pledge; I seeing such a watch advertised, stopped it. (Produced in court, and deposed to by prosecutor). The prisoner was taken up for an offence of the like nature: Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



             sent for me, and I knew him to be the man that brought it.
Prisoner's Defence.
I had been up the Strand, and returning back, I met a young woman that I keep company with, she is a woman of the town. I came down as far as Butcher row with her, and went in at the Thatch'd-house: I gave her part of a pint of beer: she told me, a young man that she used to live with, was gone to sea, and she had a watch of his in pawn, that I might have, if I would fetch it out: she asked me for the money to fetch it out, and I gave it her. I was for going with her to the pawnbroker, being afraid to trust her with the money, but she would not let me go with her. I gave her a guinea and a half, and 5 s. she gave the guinea and half, and put the rest in her pocket. In a day or two after, I had occasion for money, so I went to pawn it, and the man stopt it. I went in search of her and the young fellow, but could not hear any thing of them. The pawnbroker knows I offered it in my own name, that shows I did not steal it.
Ashbener. He said his name was Smith, and it was his own; that he had had it some time. I asked him how many months he had had it? he said, he had had it some months. After that, he said, he had it of a young woman, whom he kept company with a few days ago.

            . I was going through the Blue-coat-school, near Christ-church



, on the 21st of September. There were a parcel of people assembled together to see my Lord Mayor; I had not stood there above five minutes, before I found somebody taking my watch out of my pocket; I put my hand down, and it was very near out; the prisoner was standing with his face towards me. I looked round, left I should accuse him wrongfully, and saw no other person could possibly take it out but him, their backs were towards me: he seeing me put my hand down, turned away from me, and was gone for five or six minutes: then he came again and stood as before, just before me. I had a notion he would attempt it a second time, and was desirous of detecting him. I took notice of all the people, and saw it was impossible, as they stood, for any to take it but the prisoner; he had his hand down just by my fob: I found my watch move again in my pocket, he gave me a shove with his arm: I put my hand down immediately, and said my watch was gone; he had it in his right hand; I catched hold of his left hand; there was a man stood behind him; I was a little fearful he should deliver it to him. I took hold of that man, and immediately my watch fell to the ground, just by the prisoner's foot; the prisoner desired me to say no more about it, but to go into a house, and he would speak to me about it: I gave the constable charge of him immediately, and he was taken to Guildhall; there he was examined.
Q. Did you get your watch again?
Proudfoot. I did.
Prisoner's Defence.
He had hold of another person, and a little boy came and said, Sir, here is your watch.
Proudfoot. I saw the watch moving just at his toe, and heard it fall; but did not see it drop out of his hand; it was impossible it should fall from any body else.

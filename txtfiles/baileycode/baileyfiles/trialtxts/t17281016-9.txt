            . It appear'd, That the Prisoner was so lewd, as to ask the Prosecutor to go with her to a Brandy-Shop, and he was so silly, as to comply; tho' he said upon Oath, He had no more Familiarity with her, than to drink a Dram with her when she pick'd his Pocket, and made what haste she could out of the Room; at which the People of the House asked if he had lost nothing, when he feeling for his Watch, found it gone, and he was positive he had it when he came first into her Company, the Jury found her 


               Guilty to the Value of 10 d.

, was again indicted for stealing on the 
16th of April, 17 knives, value 17s.; 11 forks, value 8s.; 4 napkins, value 2s.; and 8 wine-glasses, value 8s.; the goods of

WILLIAM NICHOLAS COLE
. I live in Great Ormond-street. The prisoner was my footman—in consequence of my house being robbed, the police-officers went with the prisoner to search his lodging in Ormond-Yard—they returned about two hours afterwards, and produced the property stated in the indictment—some of the knives and forks I know—I can speak to one knife in particular, which has a nasty mark on it; and I told him never to lay it before me—I have no doubt the articles are mine—the napkins have my name on them in ink.

Cross-examined by
MR. DOANE. Q. The prisoner has a wife? A. I believe so—I never knew of his taking broken victuals to her, or I would not have allowed it—the policeman told me he found some mutton in one of the towels at the lodging—there are seventeen knives and eleven forks.





ROBERT JENKINS
. I went to the prisoner's lodging, and saw Collier find the property.





GEORGE COLLIER
. I went to the prisoner's lodging on the Sunday morning, and found the property I now produce—the knives were tided up in a napkins, with Mr. Cole's name on it; and the other napkins were in a box.

Prisoner's Defence. My wife says the glasses were in her possessions before I was married.




GUILTY
. Aged 25.—


Transported for Fourteen Years.

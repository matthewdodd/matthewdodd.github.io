1497. 




THOMAS SHEFFIELD
 and 




BENJAMIN BENNETT
 were indicted for

 stealing 1 handkerchief, value 2s., the goods of a certain man unknown, from his person; and that they had been before convicted of felony.






JOHN PASSMORE MUMFORD
 (police-constable A 21.) I was in St. James's park on the 25th of April—I saw the two prisoners, and watched them together

for ten minutes or a quarter of an hour—I saw Sheffield take a handkerchief from a gentleman's pocket, and put it behind him—Bennett took it out of his hand—I took Sheffield, and spoke to the gentleman—he would not go to the station, as he should lose so much time—he would not give hit name or address—I am sure I saw Sheffield take it, and Bennett take it from him.





JAMES JACKSON
 (police-constable A 126.) I saw the prisoners together, and saw them try several gentlemen's pockets—I saw Sheffield take a handkerchief from a gentleman's pocket, and pass it to Bennett—I took it from his hand—this is it—the gentleman would not come to the station.

Sheffield. I was a good way from this lad when the officer came and took me, and said I stole the handkerchief; I had never seen Bennett before.

Bennett. I was in the Park; the officer took me; he had the handkerchief in his hand.





WILLIAM GUEST
 (police-constable L 62.) I produce a certificate of Bennett's former conviction, which I got from the Clerk of the Peace of Westminster—(read)—the prisoner is the person.





JOHN HALL
 (police-constable D 64.) I produce a certificate of Sheffield's former conviction, which I got from the Clerk of the Peace of Westminster—(read)—the prisoner is the person.

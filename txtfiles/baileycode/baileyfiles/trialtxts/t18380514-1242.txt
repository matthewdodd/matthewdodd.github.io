JAMES TYROR
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
29th of March, 1 pair of boots, value 1l. 6s., the goods of 



William Abraham Cogar, and another; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






VANNAM POCOCK
. I am assistant to Mr. Hedges, a pawnbroker, in Drury-lane. On the evening of the 29th of March, the prisoner came and pledged a pair of boots, between eight and nine o'clock, for 6s.—I head the next morning that something had happened at Cogar's—on the 11th of April, he came, with another man, to our shop, for the purpose of looking at the boots, I believe, and I had him taken into custody.





WILLIAM ABRAHAM COGAR
. I am a bootmaker, and live in New-street, Covent-garden. On the 29th of March, I left my shop, between six and seven o'clock in the evening—on my return, I missed these boots, which are the property of myself and my father—I had seen them safe when I went out.

Prisoner's Defence. One evening I met a man I knew in Drury-lane—he said, "I have bought a pair of Wellington boots, and I don't like them; I wish you would go and pledge them for me," which I did—he said, "You can ask the pawnbroker if he will buy them," which I did, and the man said, if I would look in, in the course of a few days, he would give me an answer—I went, but he would not—I then bought the ticket myself, and gave 4s. for it—I sold it to Mr. Bailey—he said he would meet me at the corner of Brownlow-street, the next morning, and he went with me to get them out, not having the least idea that they were stolen.





WILLIAM RANDALL
 (police-sergeant F 8.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction from the office of Mr. Clark—(read)—I was at the trial, and the prisoner is the person who was then tried, by the name of James Newett.




GUILTY
. Aged 20.—


Transported for Fourteen Years.

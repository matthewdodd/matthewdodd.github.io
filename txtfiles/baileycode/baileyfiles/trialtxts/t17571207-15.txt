            , who is on board the Essex man of war. I lost the goods mention'd in the indictment. I keep a chandler's shop, and being in trouble I left these goods in the care of

                  Wilkerson 
               



            , and gave her the key of the street door; I gave More the key of my chest, where my husband's cloaths were, to keep for me. When I went to go home I had no home to go to; the goods were all moved away.
Q. Why do you charge 
               
                  Mary

             own'd before the justice, in my hearing, that they went with her to the pawnbroker's house, and staid at the door while the pawn'd some of the things; they both own'd that they sold some, and Mary Purcer own'd she pawned some of them while the other two stood at the door.
Wilkerson. She was in New-Prison, and sent word to me to sell or pawn the things, for money to supply her there.
Q Is this truth ?
S. Couch. I gave no such orders, neither did they give me any money.

             came for me to go and look at a few goods, in King-Street; there were two old flock beds, a bedstead, three old chairs, a bit of a table, and a pair of old bellows; I bought them there of 
               
                  Ann 
                  More 
               



             for 12 s.
Prosecutrix. I live in Mercer's Street, Long-Acre. I saw in Mrs. Anderson's custody the bedstead, but she told me she had sold the other things.
Q. to M. Anderson. What is that bedstead worth?
M. Anderson. It is worth about 6 s.
Ann More's Defence.
She sent for me to New Prison, and order'd me to pawn these things for her, to supply her in the prison.
Prosecutrix. I did send her to pawn some things for me about two years ago, but not since.

             said she could not pawn these goods, so she desired me to go to my mistress's pawnbroker to pawn them, which I did, and I delivered the money to her, who stood at the door till I came out.

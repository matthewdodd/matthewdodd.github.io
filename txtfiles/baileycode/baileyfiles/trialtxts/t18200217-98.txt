            . On the 25th of January I was watching the premises belonging to St. James's workhouse


 - I am employed to watch by the Commissioners of the New-street. About seven o'clock in the evening I saw Shafe getting into the gutter of the school-room, and told Irwing. We got on the premises, and found Long was getting through the hole in the palings, where they had broken through; Shafe came off the roof, and I collared him. Gould tried to escape through the hole, but was secured. I found 3/4 cwt. of lead on the ground under the wall.

                  IRWING
               



            . Connelly called me, and I saw Shafe and Long on the roof of the school, in King-street, Golden-square; I secured them as they came through the hole. I saw them throw the lead on the ground; I compared it with the roof, and it matched exactly. A knife was found in the yard where the prisoners were taken to.

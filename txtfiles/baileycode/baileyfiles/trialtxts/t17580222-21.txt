            . I am servant to Mr. Ward. As I was standing in the shop on the 30th of January I saw the prisoner take a hamper from the door; it was what is call'd a two dozen one. I went after him, and brought that and him back again.
Q. What did he say for himself?
A. Jones. He said he was going to carry it to Fenchurch-street.
Q. How far had he carried it?
A. Jones. He had carried it about four or five yards.
Q. to M. Ward. Do you sell hampers ?
M. Ward. I do. When the prisoner was in the compter he confessed, in my hearing, that he had stolen six more of my hampers besides that one.
Prisoner. Yes, my Lord, I did. I told the truth, and can't tell no more.

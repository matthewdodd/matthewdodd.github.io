            ; we missed one mahogany plank last Tuesday morning, and the other about three or four months ago from out of out yard; my men had opened a block as they call it; that is, they had cut it into planks, and set them up one against the other, and on Tuesday morning one plank was gone; I having had the prisoner in New Prison on such an occasion once before, I shewed my servant his house; he went in, and got it out of the prisoner's son where the plank was, which was near Cripplegate; I went there and found the two planks: I sent for a plank from home that was fellow to the first plank and they fitted exact both in length and breadth; the ends were not square but much sloping; I am able to swear the two planks are mine, the other belongs to the same that were cut but last week; the prisoner makes chairs; and sells them for half the value.

            . I am a sawyer, and live at London-wall; the prisoner delivered one of the planks to me on Tuesday morning, and the other he had pitched at my gate; he desired me to cut them by 10 o'clock; Mr. Bramble and two of his men came, and said they were Mr. Bramble's property; the prisoner brought them about half an hour after six in the morning, he gave me different directions how to cut them both.
Prisoner's defence.
I delivered but one plank; I bought it of Mr. Robinson in Houndsditch last summer; the quantity I bought came to almost 10 l.

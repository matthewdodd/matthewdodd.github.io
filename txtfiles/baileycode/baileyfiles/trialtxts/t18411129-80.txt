MARY ANN M'HUGH
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
5th of November, 1 cloak, value 3l., the goods of 



Hannah Pearson; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






HANNAH PEARSON
. I am a widow, and live in Star-street, Paddington, the prisoner is my granddaughter, and lived with me—I let lodgings. On Saturday, the 5th of November, I missed a cloth cloak, which had been left to me by a gentleman who died three years ago—I had seen it safe about three days before—when the prisoner came home that evening I spoke to her about it—she said she knew, nothing about it—I asked her for the key of my drawer, and she threw it on the dresser at me.





THOMAS HARRIS
 (police-constable D 14.) I was called in to the prosecutrix's house, and said to the prisoner, "You hear what your grandmother charges you with "—she said, "May I be struck dead if I know any thing about it"—I took her to the station, and afterwards found the cloak in pledge.





GEORGE CLARIDOE
. I am shopman to Mr. Fairlam, a pawnbroker in Lisson-grove. I produce the cloak, which was pledged on the 5th of November for 8s. by the prisoner, in the name of Ann Blake—she had been in the habit of using the house once or twice before—I knew her face, but not her right name—I swear positively she is the person.





HANNAH PEARSON

re-examined. This is the cloak I lost from the drawer, I know it by the clasp—I can swear to it—the prisoner had no right to take it—we lived on good terms, but I could not keep her from bad company—I brought her up from a child—her mother is living.





GEORGE THORNTON
 (police-constable D 109.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—I know the prisoner to be the person referred to in it—I was present at her trial—(read)—she robbed a girl she was living with, but her grandmother begged her off.

            . I live in Trinity-court. On the 2d of October, about five o'clock in the afternoon, I was going down Princes-street, Piccadilly


, and saw the prisoner go behind Mr. Warner, and take a handkerchief out of his pocket; (he was smartly dressed.) He ran off; I pursued calling Stop thief, and as he turned out of the street he dropped the handkerchief - I picked it up, and secured him.

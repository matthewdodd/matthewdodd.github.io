            . I live four doors from the prosecutor's. On the 9th of June, I saw the prisoner in front of my window for two hours, stareing me full in the face - I watched him - he took the fender and walked away with it. I alarmed the prosecutor, ran after the prisoner, and he threw it down. I secured him. He must have known I was watching him.

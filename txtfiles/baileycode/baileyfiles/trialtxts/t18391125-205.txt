JOHN EDWARDS
. I am a cheesemonger, and live in High-street, Camden-town. On the 14th of November, near one o'clock in the day, the prisoner came to my shop—he asked for nothing—I had reason to suspect him, and ran after him—I caught him eight doors off with the bacon in his hand, and gave him in charge of the policeman.





ALLEN HORATIO GARMAN
. I am a policeman. I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—"I was a witness at the trial—he is the person who was then convicted—I took him and his brother. "




GUILTY
. Aged 18.—


Transported for Fourteen Years.

REBECCA KENYON
. I am a widow, and live in South Moulton-street. I have known the prisoner eight or nine months—I was to have been married to him—I was going out to buy furniture on the 5th of June—he came to my lodgings by appointment to do so—he asked me to get my money out of the Bank for that purpose—I had 50l. in sovereigns and notes together—he wished to get the notes changed into sovereigns, which we went to the Bank to do—he then wished me to let him have the money to count, to see if it was right—we were then going down Paternoster-row—I gave him one purse containing thirty sovereigns, and he had a purse containing twenty sovereigns before—he said that was too public a place to count it, and we went on to Great Russell-street—he made an excuse at a corner and left me—I saw him no more till I had him taken.

Prisoner. She gave me the money, but not in the way that she has stated—I have spent the greatest part of it—I was out of employment—I wanted some money for rent and clothes-when I met her she abused me about the money, I said I would re-pay it in the best manner I could.

Witness. He did not—there is another person he has robbed of 170l.

Prisoner. I certainly was acquainted with her, but I never went to the Bank with her, nor wished her to change any notes—she wished to get married—I said it was not convenient to me for three months more—she said that need not be an object—she gave me 30l. in her own room—she lent it to me.

Witness. No, I did not—I have been a servant, and have gone back to my situation that I left to marry him.

Transported for Seven Years.

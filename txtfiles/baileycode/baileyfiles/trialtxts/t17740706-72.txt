Ann, the wife of Thomas Green. I keep a shop
 in Shoreditch


; the shutters of my shop window were up, but the door was open; I saw a man loll over the counter, take out the till, and run away; I pursued him with the cry of stop thief! and the watchman stopt the prisoner.

            . I saw a man, who I think was the prisoner, throw down the till upon the cry of stop thief; we took him to the watch-house, and searched him; we found seventeen shillings and eight pence halfpenny upon him; he said, don't take it all, some of it was mine before.

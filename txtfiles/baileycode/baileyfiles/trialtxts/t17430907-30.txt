            . I was coming down Fenchurch-street the 11th of July
, between eight and nine in the Evening, and had a Suspicion of the Prisoner; he followed me down Grace-church street, and just under Bishopsgate


 he picked my Pocket of a Handkerchief - I did not see him take it out of my Pocket, but he run down Old Bethlehem, was taken there, and brought to the Watch-house; he said, he would ask Pardon if I would forgive him; I never had the Handkerchief.

            . I saw the Prisoner take a Handkerchief out of the last Witness's right Hand Coat Pocket by the Light of a Lamp - I am sure he was the Person, for he was never out of my Sight till he was taken.

MR. CLARKSON
conducted the Prosecution.






SARAH WHITE
. I am single, and live at Pensbury, Wandsworth-road, Clapham—I am a connexion of ope of the learned Judges. The prisoner came into my service eighteen months ago as needle-woman, and afterwards to take charge of the empty hoube which I had taken it Pensbury—I had taken the house, but it was not ready for my reception—I removed my things there last March'twelve months—they consisted of clothes, plate, books, and various other things—I was in the habit of using part of them, the others were kept locked up in different rooms in the house—the prisoner knew where—the keys were placed in a bag—I kept my plate in a tin case under my bed for some time, and after that in a room where my niece was—I have frequently inquired of the prisoner for the keys of different places in the house, and they were lost in basket when I went to Brighton—I had seen it a very few weeks before I found it at the pawnbroker's—I asked her about this tea caddy when I returned home, on the 17th, or a few days afterwards, and she said, "Is it not there, Maam?" meaning on the drawers, where it was usually kept—I said, "It is not"—she said, "Then it is in the closet"—I looked in, and put the closet to rights entirely, and it was not there—she then said, "It must be in the glass case"—I said, "That is impossible, it is not its place"—she then said, "It roust be in the tin case"—when she went to the empty house she said her husband must go with her, and a man, whom she represented as her husband, came to live afterwards in the house where I was residing—there is no pretence for saying that any impropriety ever passed between me and him—he was a most horrid fellow, swearing and drinking continually—the prisoner left the house on Easter Monday, without giving me any notice—I did not know where she was gone to—I expected her to return that night—I never saw her till she was in custody—after I found she had left in this manner, I sent on the Wednesday for the police and the locksmith—when the policeman came, I asked him to go up stairs and look into her room—the door was fast, and as I did not wish to break the lock, the locksmith got in at the window—he found the door was not locked, but fastened by a night bolt and the tape—he unfastened it, and let the policeman in—when the policeman got in, I found a small box belonging to the prisoner—several of these duplicates Were found in it, five or six between the bed and mattress, some in a bottom drawer, one or two in the finger of her

glove, there are sixty-three altogether—the pap-boat and decanter labels were safe in the house before she went away—I had seen them six or seves weeks before—upon my oath I never authorised her to pawn any of these articles.

Cross-examined by
MR. BALLANTINE. Q. Where was it you first became acquainted with the prisoner? A. At Lark hall-rise, at her mother's house—I called to get a person to do needle-work—some time after I was going to give a fete, and the prisoner's mother offered me her table, but I did not give the fete—I was living at Larkhall-rise at that time, and was walking out looking for a sempstress—I saw the prisoner and asked her if she could tell me of one—she said yes, she did it—the prisoner then came backwards and forwards to my house, to do needlework, but not to sleep October, 1839, the prisoner and her husband went to my house—I —in gave her money to purchase a ton of coals, which I believe she did—that was at the time she went into the house, and I gave—her money from time to time, to the amount of 9l. or 10l.—there was no agreement that I should pay her 7s. a week—I wished her to name her terms, but she would not—I had no goods in the house at the time, only what were taken from the landlord—I do not know whether she bad any—I did not go there till March—I supplied her with money from time to time—I gave her 30s., for the coals, and other money—I gave her 5l. one day—when I went to the house I did not examine what goods she had there—I did not go in till March, because the repairs were not finished and they are not now—I went in in March, 1840, because I was tired of waiting—I remained there till July, when I went to Brighton—I might have gone to town for two or three days between March and July—I now recollect I did go to town for three weeks in April or May—I brought the whole of my goods from Lark-hall-rise, and at that time the prisoner and her husband were there, and assisted in moving—I remained there till I went to Brighton—I went to town before I went to Pensbury—when I came back from town the prisoner did not tell me the landlord wanted his rent—I paid 60l., when it was applied for, part my own rent, and part back rent—there may be six months rent due now—Mr. Ker has applied to me—the last time the rent was paid, Mr. Hopkins and Mr. Ker levied for half a year's rent—it was paid, besides the levy, which was 4l.—I went to town for a few days, and on my return, which was on a Sunday, I understood from the prisoner that there had been a levy in the house from the Friday—I went to Mr. Ker, the superior landlord, about it, and went to town on the Monday and settled it—I think I had to pay six months' rent, 40l., when the distress was put in—I have not got back any part of it—I have not endesvoured to get it—I never heard of the distress till Sunday—I do not recollect what month it was in—they did distrain in Larkhall-rise, but not for my own rent—I paid it, to save my furniture—I gave the upholsterer who was moving my things, 12l., but I did not get the man out so easily—they still seized upon the furniture, and sold 50l. worth of it for the levy—it was 10l. rent and 2l. expenses—ray landlord's name was Rivet—he is since dead—there is not an execution in my house now for rent—I have not been threatened with another distress—the last rent was due in June last.

Q. Have you not, from time to time, knowing that executions were out against you, kept out of the way, to avoid your person being seized? A. Certainly not—my books will show 1000l. spent in that house in

one year, and my cheques will show how I settled the bills—I have kept out of the way to avoid being taken, through the malice of tradesmen in the last two years, two or three times—I have been put in a situation to keep out of the way till I could settle it—I never took any house in the neighbourhood of St. Giles—I went to Ridley's hotel, where I slept, when business called me—that is in Holborn—it was not to avoid being taken—that was in the winter, when the days were too short and bad for me to return—I know the Court of Requests, I have been summoned there two or three times, for small sums—I have been made to pay them, sometimes unjustly—I have sent the prisoner to appear, and she has not—I have never sent her to raise the money to pay it—I have sent her to answer the summons, which she has failed in doing, which has brought on me double the expense—I have a butcher named Brook, he summoned me for another person's debt—he came into my room, where my niece was dying, and to settle the affair I paid him 4l. to get rid of the officer—it was a Mrs. Lainson's debt.

Q. Do you know Jones, a baker? A. Yes; he sued me for the same person's debt—my solicitor settled it with him—I never borrowed money of a loan-society, but I was security for Jones—I was not summoned to Union-hall to pay it—I paid the whole—it was 15l.—I have never been to Union-hall-court.

Q. Did yon send some pictures to be re-gilt? A. Yes, to several places—I do not recollect being threatened with their being sold unless I paid for them—I have been asked for 2l. 16s. for them—I have not paid it yet.

Q. Do you know a person of the name of Clark? A. I know several persons named Clark—I did not, in the presence of an officer, order the prisoner to go out and raise money for me—I took the money out of my pocket, and paid it—I had two witnesses with me when I paid it.

Q. Were you ever taken in execution? A. No—my person was seized at my own house by an officer named Fletcher—it was an unjust debt—a man took me, and behaved very ill—I did not order the prisoner on that occasion to take out some of my property to pledge—I myself pawned on that occasion—I sent the prisoner to three neighbours, but she never went—I walked up the Wandsworth-road with the officer, to call on another friend—I took out my watch—the officer said, "Why don't you pawn your watch?"—I said, "I don't know how to go about it"—he said, "I will take it to a respectable man"—he took it, and brought me out the moriey—he said, "How much do you want?"—I said, "How much will satisfy you?"

Q. Did you not give the prisoner leave to go to the fair? A. No—I did not know there was a fair—she went out when she pleased—she did not come back the same evening, and was locked out—I know she did not come back—she went and slept at Mrs. Belger's, near the Temple—she was absent on Monday and Tuesday, and on Wednesday her sister came to know if she had returned—I said, "She will not come here again; I have no notion of a servant going out of my house and stopping two nights."

MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did you owe a farthing of that 12l. for which you were sued? A. I did not consider I did, having advanced large sums to the parties—I paid the back rent at Pensbury which had been accruing for six months before I went there—I gave Mr. Houghton a check for 60l.

—I was summoned to the Court of Requests—I do not know who it was got me summoned there—the man whom the prisoner says is her husband brought me a bill of 47l.—I went to Brighton for my niece's health—she is dead—I purchased some articles of mourning at her death, and paid 4l. 4s.—when I came to town it was applied for again—I sent the bills down to Miss Armstrong, to show they were paid—I was sued for two debts of Lawson's by a butcher and baker—the room in which the duplicates were found was one into which no one but the prisoner and her husband went—I did not know there was a duplicate in the house.

MR. BALLANTINE. Q. Do you know Clark, the officer? A. No—I never went any where for debt—I always settled it.

Q. Did you not, in his presence, direct the prisoner to go and get the money? A. Yes, I sent her to my linen-draper's, where I frequently cashed cheques—I told her to go to Mr. Swan and ask him if he had got such a sum in his house, but he was not at home—if'I had got it I should not have had to pawn my watch—I did not pay the officer by means of money the prisoner brought.





JOHN NEW
 (police-constable V 136.) On Wednesday, the 14th of April, I was sent for to the prosecutrix's house—I went to Pensbury—I saw the room opened and the box searched—the room was unlocked—I found sixty-three duplicates in the room, in different places—I mixed them together, on Miss White saying the room was solely used by the prisoner and her husband—I searched between the bed and mattress, and found some duplicates—I found twelve in the box—I went with Miss White to the various pawnbrokers whose duplicates we found—I did not find any duplicates in any other part of the house—I found all the property, and Miss White identified the tea-caddy, pap-boat, and labels—the duplicate was found with some others in a drawer at the bottom of the bedstead—I saw the drawer opened in the room—I found a duplicate in the finger of one of the gloves.

Cross-examined. Q. Was the door open when you went? A. It was unlocked, but not open—many of these duplicates are of wearing-apparel.

MR. CLARKSON. Q. Were you there when the locksmith was there? A. No.





JOSEPH JONES
. I am a pawnbroker. On the 11th of January I received a silver tea-caddy, six lables and a pap-boat—the prisoner brought them, I do not exactly remember the time—I advanced 3l.—she told me she brought them for Miss White—the prisoner pawned with me on another occasion.





ALFRED SPICE
 (police-constable V 41.) I was employed by Miss White to endeavour to trace what had become of the prisoner—I know all her family. On Friday, the 16th of April, I saw them pass me—I followed them and changed my clothes—I saw them go down by the steam-boat pier at Wands worth—I went on board the same boat to Waterloo-bridge—I got out before them, and watched them to No. 8, Crown-court—I saw them go in, and staid an hour before I went in—I went in at last, found the prisoner, and took her into custody.

JOHN CLARK

can recollect—one of the executions I served on her was on one of those suramonses—she paid two of them into Court, and one went on to execution, on the 20th of January last year—when I went there I saw the prisoner—I applied for my money, and told the prosecutrix the amount of my levy—she said she had not got the money in the house—she called the prisoner, and desired her to go out and get the money—she sent her to some person at South Lambeth—the prisoner went—I waited an hour and a half—the prisoner came back with some gentleman, who brought the money—on the other two occasions the money was paid into Court—I was present once when the money was paid in by a man who used to be at work there.

MR. CLARKSON. Q. What is the name of the man? A. I cannot tell—I have known the man Edney about a year and a half—no one has been out and talked to me while this case has been going on—Mr. Crisp did not—I was not acquainted with the man Edney when I left the summons on the prosecutrix—they made a demand on her—they told me of it after the execution—I think the amount was 16l.—Miss White told the prisoner to go to South Lambeth, and get the money—I do not recollect whether she mentioned the name of Swan, the linen-draper—I think it was last Tuesday week Mr. Crisp told me I was wanted here as a witness—I do not know where Edney is living now—I saw him at Miss White's in March last—I have not seen him these last three months—I should know him if I was to see him—the last time I saw him was on Clapham-common—I do not recollect that I had any thing to do with Miss White in January last—the date of the execution was on the 12th of June—that was the execution of a person named Baker, who lived at a stationer's shop in Wandsworth.

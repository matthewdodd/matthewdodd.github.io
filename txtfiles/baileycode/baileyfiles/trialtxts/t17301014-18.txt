                  Davis 
               



             depos'd, That he having received his Wages at the Pay-Table, it being Saturday Night, and he being in Drink, was going along Holbourn, the Prisoner ask'd him to give her a Dram, and that he did go with her to Mr. Billing's Cellar, and there drank two Quarterns of Gin, and that he missing his Watch, charg'd her with it, but she deny'd it, and that sending for the Watchmen, she did not deny her having the Watch, but would deliver it to no Body but the Constable; that being carried to the Constable, she pulled the Watch out of her Bosom, and delivered it to him.
There were other Evidences of their drinking two Quarterns of Gin in a Room together, and of the Prosecutor's charging her with taking his Watch.
The Prisoner did not deny her having the Watch, but pleaded, That he gave it her to hold in pledge for half a Crown that he was to give her for having carnal Conversation with her, he refusing to give her the Money first, and telling her, that he never us'd to give a Woman any thing before hand, and that afterwards he would not give her the Half Crown, and therefore she would not give him the Watch.
The Prosecutor deny'd his giving the Watch on any such Account; the Jury found her 


               Guilty to the value of 10d.

            . I live in Pitman's-buildings, St. Luke's. On the 8th of December, I was working at Mr. Davis's, Bishopsgate-street


, and about two o'clock put my coat on a frail of bottles, on the ground floor, and about half-past four it was gone. I found it at the Mansion House. I do not know the prisoners.

                  FORRESTER
               



            . I am a constable. On the 8th of December, about half-past five o'clock, I and Hesketh were in Bishopsgate-street, and saw the prisoners and another together at Mr. Davis's shop


 - a cart came up, and interrupted our view of them, and all of a sudden they ran off, and I after them. I seized Anthony with this coat - he said it was his own, and was putting it on. I said it was a funny fit.

            . I secured Burgess. Anthony had the coat, and claimed it.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
ANTHONY'S Defence. I saw something on the ground, and being in distress, I picked it up, held it in my hand, and Forrester caught hold of me. I did not claim it.
BURGESS'S Defence. I had just left work when the officer laid hold of me.

Brodgen Poplet . The prisoner was a chairwoman
 to me, and there were two salts and four spoons left upon the table, and the two salts and two of the spoons were gone; the next morning the keeper of the Round-house told me he had got my two salts; and before the Justice she confessed the taking the two spoons and the two salts; there were four spoons, a large soup-spoon and a pepper-box. I said to the good woman, why did not you take them all? and she said she thought she had got enough. I was told she offer'd to sell one of the spoons for a groat, and the other spoon she did sell.
Mr. Finlinson Constable. The prisoner was hurried into my house by a number of people, and a woman had a spoon in her hand which she said she took from the prisoner, and she told the prisoner she believed she stole it: the prisoner said she found it in Fleet-street; and after asking her some other questions, she said she found it in a cherrybasket in the Fleet-market; and afterwards upon a dunghill. I said, if you will not confess where you had it I will send you to prison; then she said she took it from the Rising-sun ale-house in Clare-market: I went and enquired there, and they said they had lost no such thing: I heard the prisoner declare before the Justice that she stole the two salts and the two spoons.
Q. to Poplet. Is that your spoon ?
Poplet. Yes, I believe it is; but 'tis not marked with my name.

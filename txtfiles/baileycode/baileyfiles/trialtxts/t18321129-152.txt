            . I am carman
 to Mr. Edwards. This coat was taken off the shaft of my cart, in Samuel-street, Brick-lane


, about half-past twelve o'clock in the day; while I was in a house, two draymen told me a young chap had run away with it through High-street - I ran and saw the prisoner running in Great Garden-street, with it under his arm - I saw him put it on, and when I got up to him he took it off, and gave it me.

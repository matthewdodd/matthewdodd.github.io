                  JOHN
                   NEWLIN
               



             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am a carpenter, pump, and engine-maker: The prisoner Pittman lives at the corner of Dyot-street, St. Giles's



; on the 5th of March, about seven o'clock in the evening, I was standing at the pump opposite Mr. Pittman's door, I observed another man along with the prisoner Horribin go into the house of Mr. Pittman; I immediately crossed over the way, and leaned upon the post just against the door to see what passed; the door was about three parts open; then I saw the other man take this cann off Horribin's man's head, (producing it); at going in, he made a stop, and some oil poured out at the nozle; they both appeared to be lamplighters; then Horribin poured it out, and Mr. Pittman put it into his cistern; then I saw Mr. Pittman give him half-a-guinea and some other money, I could not discover what; I followed him to his master's house, and gave him information of it; the master told me to see if I could see any body go into this shop again. On the 7th -
Mr. Knapp. We must not hear that.
Newlin. Horribin was taken up, I believe, on the 10th of April; I took him myself in Dyot-street.
Q. The moment you saw this, you went and informed the master? - A. Yes; I followed him home, and he set the cann at his master's door.
Q. Are you sure that is the kettle? - A. I think it is, but I cannot say; I picked it out from the ranks, where there were a great number of them, and the master said that was the kettle.
Cross-examined by Mr. Const. Q. You describe yourself to be a carpenter-are you a carpenter? - A. Yes; I follow the trade.
Q. Are you any other business? - A. No.
Q. Have you never been employed by Police-officers? - A. No.
Q. What day was this? - A. Monday morning the 5th of March.
Q. And when was he taken up? - A. I think the 10th of April.
Q. Five weeks afterwards? - A. Yes; the master wished me to watch to see if he could not catch him with more.
Q. You saw the half-guinea that Pittman gave him? - A. Yes.
Q.And you saw some oil pour out of the nozle of the kettle? - A. Yes.
Q. Did you say that in your first information? - A. I cannot say.
Q. Do not you know that you never thought of it till you found it necessary to prove it was oil? - A. I think I mentioned it to the Magistrate at Bow-street, I know it to be true that it did run out of the nozle of the kettle.

Q. You had seen nothing but the kettle before till that circumstance? - A. I saw it poured twice into the measure, and after that is the cisten.
Q.And you swear that that is the kettle? - A. I went down to the door of the office, and looked at the kettle, it was marked No. 10.
Q. Will you swear that you saw it marked No. 10 before? - A. No, I will not; I know it by the nose being bruised; the nose being so short that there is no other kettle like it in the whole boiling.
Mr. knapp. Q. What induced you to watch? - A. The inducement I had to watch was, I had seen several people many times going into this shop with oil in canns, and I have seen the prisoner Horribin go into the shop repeatedly with a cann full of oil.
Mr. Const. Q. Did your conscience suffer you to see that repeatedly? - A. I stopped till I could not bear it any longer; I was determined to know whether they had any perquisites.
Q. Do you mean to swear they were full? - A.Apparently, from the weight of their carrying it; I waited till I saw the money was paid.
Q. Now I want to know why it was worse that time than any time before? - A. I had seen them several times, and that made me watch.


                  THOMAS
                   TUCKEY
               



             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am a contractor for lighting lamps, in partnership with Joseph Lucas and Christopher Spencer; the prisoner was our cellar-man, at the lamp-office, in Phoenix-street, St. Giles's.
Q. Do you know Mr. Pittman's shop? - A. Yes; about 4 or 500 yards from our cellar.
Q. Did you receive any information from the last witness, respecting your servant Horribin? - A. Yes, on the 5th of March, a little after eight.
Q. Did you see any kettle? - A. Yes; Newlin pointed it out.
Q. you did not apprehend the prisoner till some time after? - A. No.
Q. What was the prisoner's duty? - A. To measure the oil; he was among tons and tons where he was at work.
Q.Is it possible to miss by your eys two or three gallons? - A. No.
Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. In point of fact, you did miss it? - A. No.
Q. Upon this charge being made, some weeks afterwards, Mr. Pittman surrendered himself, did not he? - A. No; Mr. Bond sent for him.
Q. But he went without being taken up by a warrant? - A. Yes.
Q. What might be the value of as much oil as that? - A. About five gallons are worth 13s. 6d. the cann holds about five gallons and a half.
Q. Therefore, if he gave more than half-a-guinea, it was not much under the value? - A. No; it is worth 2s. 8d. a gallon, that is what it cost us; the common price is 3s. 6d. a gallon.
Q. An oilman would not give 3s. 6d. for it? -No.
Court. Q. How much oil may you have at a time? - A.Sometimes we have 200 tons in the warehouse at a time.
Horribin's defence. I am innocent of any thing of the kind.
Pittman's defence. I am quite innocent of the charge.
The prisoner, Pittman, called six witnesses, who gave him an excellent character.
Mr. Tuckey. I never had reason to suppose that Horribin had been guilty of any thing of this sort before.
Horribin,

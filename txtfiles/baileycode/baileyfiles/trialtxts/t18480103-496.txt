EDWARD GRIFFITHS



. burglariously breaking and entering the dwelling-house of 



James Richardson Ebthorpe, with intent to steal.






JAMES RICHARDSON EBTHORPE
. I live at 5, Globe-terrace, Poplar—it is my dwelling-house. On the night of 3rd Jan, I was the last person up—I saw the doors all fastened—the area-door was fastened with shutters and bolts—it is partly glazed—I went to bed about half-past ten—about three o'clock I heard a window break—I got out of bed, opened my window, and called out; there was no answer—I listened two or three minutes, and heard footsteps in my kitchen, apparently on the broken glass—I then heard foot—steps on the other side of the road, and called, "Police!"—I afterwards saw the prisoner coming up my area-steps—the policeman took him—I found the area-door open, and the glass broken—I saw an iron rail on the carpet, in the kitchen—I did not miss anything.

Prisoner. Q. Was I sober? A. You appeared so; if you bed not been you could not have got over the gates, or made the resistance you did.





ROBERT FENN
 (policeman, K 363.) Oh 4th Jan., about three o'clock in the morning, I was in the East India-road, heard a cry of "Police!" went over, and saw the prisoner coming up the area-steps—he jumped over the railing, and ran away—I stopped him a few yards from the gate—he resisted very much, and tried to get away—he threw me down twice, by putting his legs between mine—I kept him down some time, and called a carman, who assisted me—I took him to the station—I was so smothered with mud the inspector sent me home—he did not speak—if he had been drunk he could not have scuffled as he did—I produce part of the area-railing, which he broke the door open with—the glass was broken.

Prisoner's Defence. I had been drinking very hard; I never intended to steal; I was stupidly drunk; there is no doubt I had been lying there asleep some time.




GUILTY
. Aged 24.—


Transported for Seven Years.

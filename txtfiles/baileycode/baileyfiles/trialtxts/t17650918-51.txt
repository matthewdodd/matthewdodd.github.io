            . I keep a broker's shop
 in Bunhill-Row


. When I got up on the 26th of January last, my servants, Sutton and Holmes, told me they found my shop broke open: we miss'd the goods mentioned in the indictment (mentioning them), and many other things: I went to Justice Fielding, and got them advertised, but heard nothing of them till about four months after; then one Mrs. Paddock sent for me, and said she belived she could inform me where my goods were. This was the last day of last sessions. It being pretty late that Saturday night, we went on the Monday Morning; she had told me, a poor woman that lived in the house where Munden lives, could inform me where they were gone to pawn. About six o'clock on the Monday morning, the constable, one of my servants, and I, went to Munden's house in Crow-alley, Whitecross-street; we took him and his wife to Bridewell; he sent for his sister, 
               
                  Elizabeth 
                  Landen 
               



            ; we took her in custody likewise: we got a search-warrant, and at Mr. Warner's, a pawnbroker in Red-Lion Market-place, we found a horse pistol and looking-glass, my property; at Mr. Allen's in White-cross-street we found a copper tea-kettle, my property; and at Mr. West's, in Goswell-street, we found a feather bed: the man at the bar told me that was pledg'd there in an old dirty sheet; we found it so; then we went to Landen's house, in a court in Golden-lane; there we found a pottage-pot and cover, my property (that is not in the indictment). I saw a tea-chest and other things, that I believe to be mine, there: we took the prisoner up to Hicks's-Hall; they were committed for farther examination, the man to Bridewell, the others to New Prison. When Munden was got to Bridewell, he turned back to give evidence against his accomplice: he told the Justice, if he might be admitted evidence, he would divulge his accomplices; he was told, very likely he might be admitted, but did not promise him. He wanted to impeach 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Gosling

                  Landen 
               



            ; he said they were concerned with him in breaking open my house, and taking the things away; that they opened the door with a pick-axe. My door was wrenched open by the means of some iron instrument; two bolts were wrenched off; and another door between the kitchen and shop was broke open.

I know of nothing but one tea-kettle that Gosling brought to my house, and desired my wife to pledge for him.

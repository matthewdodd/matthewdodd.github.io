            . On the 20th of December I lost a child's bed-gown and eight pair of worsted stockings. The prisoner lived in the neighbourhood, we suspected her. I got a search-warrant, and found four pair of my stockings in her apartment, between the bed and the sacking. She begged I would be favourable to her. (The stockings produced and deposed to.)
Prisoner's Defence.
It was late and they were hanging out, and I went and took them in, but with no view of keeping them.




               Guilty. 10 d.

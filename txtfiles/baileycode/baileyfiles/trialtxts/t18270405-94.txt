            . I am the daughter of William Buist; he lives in George-street, Grosvenor-square


, and is a cabinet-maker
. At half-past two o'clock in the afternoon of the 23d of February, I heard some person coming in, and going up-stairs - the child had just gone out to school, and left the door open - I waited till the prisoner came down; he was quite a stranger; I asked him what business he had up-stairs - he said he had been to see for his brother - he had a basket with him; he took this glass out of it, and laid it on the stairs - I knew it to be my father's; it had been in the first floor front room - there was nothing else in the basket.

            . I am the officer, and took the prisoner in charge.(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence (written). I knocked at this door, a man came out, and told me to go into the passage - I knocked at the prosecutrix's door, and asked if one Williams lived there - she said No, and called her mother, saying there was a thief; nothing was found on me - I know nothing of the glass.
A. BUIST. He asked no questions.

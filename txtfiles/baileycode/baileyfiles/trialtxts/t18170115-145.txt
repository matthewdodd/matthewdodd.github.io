             sent me some beef to sell-there were two lots of beef; I sold one lot, and had another left, which I put out for sale on Saturday morning, the pigs laid over it. A person came to me, and asked if I had sold the beef; he had made me an offer for it the day before. When I went to look for it I found it was gone, there was only one piece left; the rump, loin, veiny-piece and flank were gone; between one and two o'clock the officer came, and told me he had taken the five prisoners, with the beef, I went to the office to see it-it was mine, and would complete the lot.
JOHN PELIS. I am a butcher, and live at East Smithfield; I sent Messrs. Terry two lots of beef to sell for me; the next morning I heard that three pieces out of the lot were stolen; I went before the magistrate, and saw the three pieces of beef; I am sure they were mine, I cut them myself.
JOHN GRIFFITH. I am an officer. On Saturday morning, the 4th of January, about ten o'clock, I received information that there was a quantity of beef taken into a chandler's-shop, No. 91, Wentworth-street, Whitechapel; I went there, with Freeman, we went up to the two pair of stairs front room, and found the five prisoners in the room, before the fire; Freeman kept the door while I searched. I found the beef covered over, between the prisoners, James and Edwards's bedsteads - They said they were their beds, there were a great many beds in the room; it was a dirty wet morning; the two prisoners, James and Edwards, were very dirty, the other prisoners did not appear to have been out; we took them to the office, and when we got there, James said, that he and Edwards had stolen it.
FRANCIS FREEMAN, I confirm the statement of the last witness, the beef weighed seventy-eight pounds.

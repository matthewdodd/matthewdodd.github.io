ZACHARIAH RICHARD CATCHPOLE
. I keep a cheesemonger's shop in Cable-street On the 29th of December, about twelve o'clock at night, a person asked if I had lost any thing—I turned, and missed this piece of pork—I ran about twenty yards, and found the prisoner with it under his apron—the moment I laid hold of him he said, "Here is your pork, take it—tike it"—I said I should take him—I took him back, and gate charge of him—this is my pork.




GUILTY
.* Aged 52.—


Transported for Seven Years.

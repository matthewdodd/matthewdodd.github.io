            . I am a stationer
, and live in Southampton-row. On the 23d of December, between three and four o'clock, I was in Holborn


, and had a handkerchief in my coat-pocket - I did not feel it taken, but was told it was gone; I found the prisoner and the handkerchief in about five minutes; I cannot swear to the handkerchief: I had only bought it a quarter of an hour before.
THOMAS GROVE. I am a watch-case maker. I was coming down Holborn-bill, and at the corner of Shoe-lane (there was a crowd), I saw the prisoner and two others in the act of picking pockets - I saw the prosecutor come up, with a bag in his hand, and the prisoner took the handkerchief from his right-hand pocket; I secured him, and took him to the watch-house - I saw him take it out of the prosecutor's pocket; he threw it down - a woman picked it up. and gave it to me.
Prisoner's Defence. I was standing at the corner of Shoe-lane: there was a crowd round a man who was selling pamphlets - a gentleman lost his handkerchief, and a man charged me with it; I denied it, and he gave me in charge; he went after the gentleman, who said be could not swear to the handkerchief, as a woman had stopped him, and told him if he did not mind his handkerchief would fall out: at Guildhall he said most likely it had fallen out of his pocket.

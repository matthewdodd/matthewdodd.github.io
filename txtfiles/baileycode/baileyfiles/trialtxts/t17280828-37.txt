                  Cole 
               



             depos'd, That 
               
                  Elizabeth

             being her Servant
, she miss'd several Things, but could not prove any of them to be taken by her; at length, she being in Bed, bade the Prisoner lock the Chamber-door, which she pulling too and not locking, she ask'd why she did not lock it; to which the Prisoner said, the Lock was broke, and upon this Deponent's getting out of Bed in surprize, and finding it really broke, she charg'd the Prisoner with doing it, till at length she confess'd she had done it to take Tea and Sugar; but upon her saying that was false for she loved neither, she said she broke open the Chamber Door to get the Key of the Shop to cut herself off an Apron, (her Master keeping a Linnen-Draper's Shop) her Examination and Confession being read in Court, the Pupose of it was, That with the Advice of 
               
                  Dorothy 
                  Nyhouse 
               



            , she had robb'd her Master of Goods and Money to a considerable Value, and that she had given those Things to Dorothy Nyhouse after she had stole them; but this Confession not being sufficient to convict 
               
                  Dorothy 
                  Nyhouse 
               



            , and there being no other Evidence against her, the Jury 

               acquitted
             her; but 
               
                  Elizabeth 
                  Appleyard 
               



             by her own Confession and plain Evidence, was found 


               guilty of Felony to the Value of 39 s
            .

            . On Saturday, about a Quarter after 3 in the Afternoon, I was going to Hatton-Garden, and when I had got about 12 Yards through Newgate


 I missed my Handkerchief, I had it in my Hand about 2 or 3 Minutes before; I saw the Prisoner just at my Elbow; he had a coarse Cloth Apron on, rolled up over the Handkerchief; I seized him, and said Friend, I believe you have made hold to take a Handkerchief of mine; he had the Handkerchief under his Apron, and took it from him directly: I took him into a Shop just by, and asted if the Gentleman knew of any Magistrate: he said no. but he could recommend me to a Constable; and one Owen, who I believe is one of the City beadles, brought him to the Compter; I gave the Constable the Handkerchief last Monday at Guildhall before the Alderman: The Constable told me he would be attending here, but he is not here now. The Prisoner said he was in Necessity, and wanted Bread, and begged hard to be excuted; I told him it was a very bad Way of getting his Bread; I resolved to prosecute him, for it is but common Justice; he said before the Alderman, that it was the first Fact that he ever committed.
Prisoner. Are you sure I took it from you?
Hayfield. I had it but just before, and found it upon you. 


               Guilty 10 d.

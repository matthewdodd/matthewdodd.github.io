EDWARD DOUGHTY
. I live in Brunswick-crescent, Cold Harbour-lane, Camberwell. On the 18th of August I was at Camberwell fair, and used my handkerchief—I put it into my pocket—I soon after found the prisoners

hand in my pocket—I caught hold of it—the handkerchief was in his hand, inside the pocket—he tugged his hand out, and ran away—I did not pull his hand out, I put my hand outside my pocket, and felt his hand—he pulled it out, and the handkerchief with it, and ran away with it—I followed, and missed him two or three minutes, and caught him down by Richardson's show—I said, "You have stolen my handkerchief"—he said, "I have not," and I found it in his pocket—this is it—(examining one.)

Prisoner. Q. You did not see my hand in your pocket? A. Yes, I did.

Prisoner's Defence. I picked the handkerchief up, and had it in my hand; he came and pursued me—I said, "If that is your handkerchief, here it is"—he let me go, and the policeman came and took me.
(The prisoner received a good character.)

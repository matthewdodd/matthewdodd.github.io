ALEXANDER CHARLES KELTY
. I am a fancy cabinet maker, living in Lamb's Conduit-street. On the afternoon of the 11th of November, I was in Great Sloane-street, and felt a tug at my pocket—I put my hand behind me and caught hold of the prisoner's hand—his fingers were at that time in my pocket—my handkerchief was gone, which I had used a very few moments before—I turned and accused him of stealing it—he said I was a false man—the policeman came and took him, and I saw it at the station.





JAMES WINSTON
. (police-constable, F 152.) I came up when the prosecutor was holding the prisoner—I saw the handkerchief lying in the gutter behind where the prisoner stood—I took it up.

Prisoner's Defence. I was walking along, the gentleman turned and accused me of taking the handkerchief—I never had it in my possession nor saw it till it was produced.

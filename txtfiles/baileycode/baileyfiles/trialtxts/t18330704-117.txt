. This property is my father's and mine; the prisoner has been a porter
, but since he has been out of employ, he has been backward and forward to our house; my father gave him his lodging; he was there on the 4th of June, and did not go away till the night of the 5th, or early on the morning of the 6th - the property stated was then missed, part from a room down stairs, and part from a top room - the prisoner had been in those rooms - some of the property has been found; the watch-movements were taken from a tea caddy, and the case from the same room.

             (police-constable E 112). I took the prisoner on the 6th of June, from information, in Long-alley - I did not charge him with any robbery, but I found on him eight silver spoons, the movement of a watch, and the copper case of a watch, a half-sovereign, and a sixpence.

            . I am a pawnbroker. I have a gown and a half-handkerchief, pawned, I believe, by the prisoner, but I am not certain.(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence (written). On Wednesday evening, July 5th, I returned to my lodgings, which were situated at No. 3, Ball-court, Giltspur-street, about half-past nine o'clock, and being rather in liquor I refused to have any supper, and shortly after feeling very unwell I went to the door, where I remained till such time as the family were going to bed, and then went in to make my bed; having made it, and being thirsty, and the street-door being open, I put on my hat and coat and I went out of my lodging in Ball-court, Giltspur-street, for the purpose of having a pint of beer; I had a pint of beer at the King of Denmark, in the Old Bailey. When I returned I tried the latch of the door, but found that the door was fastened; not wishing to disturb the family, I determined to remain out that night. As I was walking about, I met two young lads that I knew, by having been in their company twice or three times before; they asked me to have something to drink I consented, and drank with them several times. When about half-past six o'clock, being in Shoreditch, we went into a coffee-shop, we had some, and shortly after they entered into conversation between themselves which induced me to listen; it was about a robbery they had committed the night before, which I shortly ascertained was the person that is now my prosecutor. I then asked the manner in which they got in, when they replied, that by chance, they happened to go up this court, and seeing my prosecutor's door open they entered into the passage, they found the parlour door which was locked with the key outside, they entered and took the property. After having heard thus far, and being convinced that it belonged to my prosecutor, I told them then, that it was entirely through my carelessness that they had got possession of this property - and that, if they did not give up the property, I would give them into custody; they hesitated for some time, and at last agreed to give it me, which was as follows: 8 silver tea-spoons, a movement of a watch, a half-sovereign, and 4s. 6d. in silver, which they declared was all they had taken, with the exception of four or five shillings. Shortly after we parted, which was, as near as I can possibly say, about half-past nine o'clock in the morning. I then considered that it would be best for me, as it was then so late, to leave it till between five or six in the afternoon; and in the meantime to write a few lines, stating that the property would be returned in the evening with a satisfactory explanation; I did so, and was going in the afternoon to my prosecutor, when I was taken into custody. The policeman - during the time we were in the coach, (which he made me pay for before I got into it) tried to get me to tell him the whole particulars of the robbery, and likewise to give him the property, and that he would make it all right with the prosecutor, and because I refused, he took a most solemn oath that he would do his utmost endeavours to get me transported.

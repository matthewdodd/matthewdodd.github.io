THOMAS WILLIAMS
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
12th of May, 10 yards of woollen cloth, value 6l.; and 1 wooden stand, value 6d.; the goods of 



Frederick William Lee.






JAMES SQUIRE
. I am an apprentice to Mr. Frederick William Lee, of Holborn, a tailor and draper. On the 12th of May, I tied this woollen cloth to the stand—I put it at the door—about a quarter after eight o'clock in the morning I was in the shop—a man came in and asked for some patterns for trowsers—he bought nothing—a person directly came in and said we had lost a piece of cloth from the door, and the man had run away—I went to the door, and saw the prisoner walking across the road with it under his arm—I called, "Stop thief"—he threw it down, and ran off—I pursued him down Southampton-buildings till he was caught—I gave charge of him—I only lost sight of him just at the turn of the corner, and then I was close behind him—this is my master's property.

Prisoner. He said before he did not see me throw it down.





MARY LANGMAN
. I saw the prisoner standing at Mr. Lee's door, looking into the shop—I was within two yards of the door when the prisoner tool this cloth and stand, and went off with it—Mr. Lee's man came out, and he threw it down into the gutter—I caught it, and kept it till Mr. Lee's man came back—I had seen the prisoner fire minutes before he took it.

Prisoner. You said you only saw me throw it down, and now you say you saw me take it. Witness. I did see you take it.





WILLIAM LAPWORTH
. I took the prisoner into custody.

Prisoner. I saw a man going across the road—he had this under his arm—he threw it down, and this woman caught it—it was a man with a blue coat on.

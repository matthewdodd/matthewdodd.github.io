CHARLES HENRY WATSON
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
17th of July, 4 sovereigns, and 4 half-sovereigns, the monies of 



Thomas Wilcox, his master, and that he had been before convicted of felony.






THOMAS WILCOX
. I am a publican, and live in Bear-street, Leicester-square. The prisoner was five weeks in my service—I delivered him four sovereigns and four half-sovereigns, to get exchanged for silver, on Saturday evening, the 17th of July—he absconded—I saw him again on the 2nd of August, in custody—he never brought me the silver.





GEORGE PECK
. I am a constable. I apprehended the prisoner in High-street, St. Giles's—he said he had lost 17s., and that as his master would accuse him of having stolen it, he thought he might as well take the whole.





ISAAC SLADE
. I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clarke's office—I know the prisoner to be the person it applies to—I was present at the trial—(read.)




GUILTY
. Aged 21.—


Transported for Ten Years.

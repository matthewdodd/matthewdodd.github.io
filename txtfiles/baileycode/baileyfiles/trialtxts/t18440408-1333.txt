GEORGE KEMP
 (police-constable N 82.) On Tuesday afternoon, the 9th of April, about three o'clock, I was on duty at Greenwich fair, standing at the top of a show—I saw the three male prisoners in a crowd standing behind a gentleman—I saw Truby take a handkerchief from the gentleman's pocket, and pass it to Wright, and they all three went out of the crowd to Willy, who was a distance off—I saw them look at the handkerchief and give it to her—I got down from the show to go after them, and in doing so saw another man pick a pocket—I took that man to the station, and while there the three male prisoners were brought in for picking another man's pocket—when Willy took the handkerchief she put it under her clothes and into her pocket, where I found it when I took her—she said she had been out from her husband all night, sleeping with the men, and said, "See what it is to get into bad company, they brought the handkerchief to me "—I asked if she had any more about her—she said yes, put her hand in her bosom and pulled out two more—I cannot swear this is the handkerchief Truby took, but I believe it is—I found it where I saw her put it.

Smith. The property is mine; I bought them at 2s. each, not knowing it was stolen; I have known Willy about five weeks by living in the same house; I met her about one o'clock, and asked her to take these handkerchiefs home for me; I was selling fruit.

Willy. When he took me he said, "You have got a handkerchief "I said, "Yes;" he said, "Who gave it you?" I said, "Those three young men;" I am innocent; I did not know it was stolen; I had been out with my husband at nine o'clock; I went into the fair about eleven; Smith said, "Will you take these handkerchiefs for me?" I said, "Yes."






GEORGE KEMP

re-examined. Smith was with the other two, covering them—they all three went to Willy and delivered the handkerchief to her.

Smith. It was only I went to her; we were there three hours after we handed her the handkerchiefs; I was selling fruit. Witness. It might he an hour—he was not selling fruit—the person robbed was a respectable looking man—I did not ask him any questions—I could not get near him—there it no initial on the handkerchief.

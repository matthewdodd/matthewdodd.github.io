                  Catharine 
                  Burage 
               



            . I live at Cow-cross; my husband is named Abraham. I gave a shirt to 
               
                  Elizabeth 
                  Burage 
               



             to wash on Twelfth-day; it was lost; I saw it since in the pawnbroker's hands.


                  Frank 
                  Rochford 
               



            . I am a pawnbroker; I took this shirt in of a woman named 
               
                  Sarah 
                  Silk 
               



            ; she said it was her husband's: I lent her half a crown upon it; (produced in court.)
C. Burage. This is the shirt that was lost.


                  George 
                  Fisher 
               



            . I am constable; I took the prisoner up, and the things were delivered to me at Justice Girdler's; that is all I know of it.


                  Elizabeth 
                  Burage 
               



            . 
               
                  Catharine 
                  Burage 
               



             delivered me this shirt to wash; it was washed, and taken away before it was ironed.
Q. Why do you charge the prisoner?
E. Burage. The prisoner is my sister-in-law; I took her in, she having no place to go to; she absconded; I suspected her, and found her three nights after, in Catharine-street in the Strand, in the night time. I took her before Justice Girdler; there she confessed she took it; I found the shift at Mr. Rochfort's.
Rochfort. I took the shift in of, I believe, the prisoner at the bar, but she came in the name of 
               
                  Mary 
                  Jones 
               



            ; (produced by the constable.)


                  Sarah 
                  Mercer 
               



            . I gave 
               
                  Elizabeth 
                  Burage 
               



             my gown and shift to wash.
Q. What is your husband's name?
S. Mercer. His name is 
               
                  Stephen 
                  Mercer 
               



            ; this is the shift here produced.
The prisoner said nothing in her defence.

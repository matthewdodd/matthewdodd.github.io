The Prosecutor depos'd, That he being an Upholster
, the Piece of Damask was stolen out of his Shop, and he found 10 Yards of it at Mary Holmes's, a Mantua-Maker, whither the Prisoner had carried it to be made into a Mantua-Gown, and seven Yards and a half more of the said Damask at the Pawn Brokers, where it had been pawn'd by the order of the Prisoner.

                  Holmes
               



             gave Evidence, That the Prisoner brought 10 Yards of the Damask before mentioned, That she came the Eighth of September (the same Day it was stolen) after she had cut out the Gown, and would have had the Damask again; but she suspecting it to have been stolen, refus'd to let her have it again. The Fact being plainly prov'd, the Jury found her 


               Guilty to the Value of 39 s

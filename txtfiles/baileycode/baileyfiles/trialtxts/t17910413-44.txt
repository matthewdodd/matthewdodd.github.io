How old are you? - Fourteen, the next June.
Do you know the nature of an oath? - Yes.
What is it? - To speak the truth.

             sworn.
I was going with some hats home; the prisoner met me just beyond Shoreditch church, in the highway, between six and seven at night; I was resting myself on the steps, and the prisoner asked me where I was going; I told him I was going rather higher up: he asked me whether he should carry one of the hats for me; they belonged to

            ; I was carrying them to deliver them to the customers; I told him I could carry them myself; he said he could carry one for me, as he was going up to Hackney, and I gave him one: we went on till I came to a gentleman's house, where I was to deliver a hat; I took the hat of him, and delivered one, and camedown; and he asked me again to carry one, and I let him carry one; we went on till we almost came to Hackney turnpike


, and then I asked him for the hat again; he opened the box, and I laid hold of the brim of the hat, and he laid hold of it too, and he pulled it away, and ran away, and I called out, stop thief! then four men came up to me, and asked me what was the matter, and I told them; about a week afterward, he was taken: I am sure it is the boy; I have seen him before, but never was acquainted with him.

             sworn.
The last witness was my servant: on the 26th of February I sent him to Hackney with some hats, and he returned very soon after, and informed me he had one stolen from him.

             sworn.
My master, Mr. Ivory, sent me to the White Bear, Barbican, to carry a hat, and I saw the prisoner behind a coach, about a fortnight after the hat was lost; he asked me if we had not a little boy lived at our house, named Jack; I told him yes; he asked me if he had not lost a hat, and I told him yes; he said he met him one night in Hackney-road, crying, because he had lost a hat; and then he said he had took it, as he had a warrant served on him, and wanted 7 s. to make it up, and asked me, if I saw him come into my master's shop, whether I would stop him; I had known him before about Shoreditch, and he had been at my master's shop for a hat he had dressed there; as soon as I went home, I told my master, and he was taken up in consequence.
PRISONER's DEFENCE.
I have witnesses who will prove I was at work on the same day.

Court. Now, before you begin, take care what you say; for if you say any thing that these gentlemen do not believe, you will render this boy's case worse than it is. - I know the prisoner at the bar to be an hardworking boy; he was bound 'prentice to a weaver; his master was pressed; and lately he hath sold brocoli, and such things, about the streets; but I know nothing of this business.

I never heard or knew any harm of this boy in my life; he came of honest parents.

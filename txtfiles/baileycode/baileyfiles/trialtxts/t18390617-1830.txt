WILLIAM NICOL
. I live at Liverpool. I was in town on the 6th of June, and had been to the Opera—I had a pocket-book and a card-case in my coat pocket—I am sure I had them when I went to the Opera, and I missed them at night in taking off my clothes—I lived then in Stafford-street, Bond-street—when I came out of the Opera I had to cross Charles-street to reach the carriage—this is my property—(looking at it.)

Cross-examined by
MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. You do not know the prisoner? A. No—I cannot say How these things got out of my pocket.





CHARLES WALKER
 (police-constable A 78.) I was on duty that night, and saw the prisoner making his way along Charles-street to the Colonnade—I knew him, and stood behind a pillar and watched him—I saw him turn round and lift up the tail of a gentleman's coat—I went and took him—I found on him 2 pocket-books and a card-case—he threw them down and resisted violently—I saw the prosecutor's address on the cards, and went to him.

Cross-examined. Q. Do you not know that the person you saw the prisoner near was not the prosecutor? A. I cannot say, as there were so many people, but as soon as he took his hand away I took him—I think it was the prosecutor whose pocket I saw him touch, but I cannot say—I took him on Thursday—the prosecutor saw the card-case on the Monday following, and he came to Queen-square on the Tuesday.

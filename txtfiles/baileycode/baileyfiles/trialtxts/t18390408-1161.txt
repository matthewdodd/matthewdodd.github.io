JOHN COPPING
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
9th of March, 1 handkerchief, value 2s. 6d., the goods of 



George Morrison, from his person; and that he had been previously convicted of felony.






GEORGE MORRISON
. I am a merchant, and live in Great Hermitage-street, Wapping. On the afternoon of the 9th of March, about three o'clock, I was near the Bull, in Aldgate—I put my hand into my pocket, and missed my handkerchief—I turned round, and saw the prisoner running off with it, endeavouring to put it into his trowsers' pocket—he dropped it when he found I was pursuing him—I took it up—a policeman was coming in another direction—I called out, and he stopped him.





THOMAS FISHER
 (City police-Constable, No. 464.) I stopped the prisoner, and received the handkerchief from Mr. Morrison.

Property produced and sworn to.


Prisoner's Defence. I had been with my mother, selling blacking, till ten o'clock—there was a mad bull running—I ran after it—two boys dropped the handkerchief, and the gentleman said it was me.





GEORGE MORRISON

re-examined. I saw nothing of a mad bull—the pavement was crowded with people—I am not mistaken in the prisoner—he was only two yards behind me, when I turned, and saw him stuffing the handkerchief into his trowsers' pocket—I am certain of him.





WILLIAM BOSTON
 (City police-constable, No. 344.) I produce a certificate

of the prisoner's former conviction from Mr. Clark's office—I was present in November last, when he pleaded to felony—he is the person described in the certificate—(read).

            . On the 25th of January
, about three in the afternoon, I felt a pressure at my pocket, I put my hand in, and found my handkerchief gone. The prisoner was close to me, I applied to him for it, knowing I had it two or three minutes before. He denied having it; I put him into Mr. House's shop, a shoemaker near, and found it under his loose coat, (produced in court, and deposed to). He said then that he found it in the street; but it was a rainy dirty day, and it did not appear to have been on the ground.
Prisoner's defence.
I was going along Cheapside, and picked up this handkerchief, the gentleman put his hand to his pocket, and I suppose missed his handkerchief; he asked me if I had it? I said, not as I know of. He took me into a shop, and I produced the handkerchief I found.
He called

                   Day
               



            . I have been robbed at sundry times; my son can give a better account of it than I can.


                  Christopher
                   Day
               



            . I know the prisoners.
Q. When was your mother robbed?
Day. The last time was the 8th of June. Here are some of the pawnbrokers who have brought some of the things that were pawned. The prisoners used to stand under the window and I used to throw the things out of them. I have done so a great many times.
Q. How came you to be so wicked to do this?
Day. The prisoner 
               
                  John
                   Jolland
               



             asked me to do it.
Q. Was the father there when you did it?
Day. Yes, several times.

            . I was never there in the days of my breath; he used to bring the things before his mother was up.
Day. The father was there; he used to come of a night; I used to throw the things out of the window, and he catched them, and then they used to carry them to pawn, and I had part of the money.
Q. How came you to be acquainted with 
               
                  John
                   Jolland
               



            ?
Day. I was an errand boy to one Mr. Farrell of Moorfields, and 
               
                  John
                   Jolland
               



             worked there; the father Robert asked if I could get any more; I said, yes, and at last my mother found me out.
Q. from 
               
                  Robert
                   Jolland
               



            . Did not I give you the best of advice, and bid you leave off your ways?
Day. No.

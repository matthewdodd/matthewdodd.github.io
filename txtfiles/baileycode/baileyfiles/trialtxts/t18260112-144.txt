            . I am the wife of Moses Solomons - we live on Great Saffron-hill


. The prisoner came to lodge with us about seven weeks ago, and hired a furnished room, for 4s. per week. I agreed to give her a clean pair of sheets every month; I went into the room, and missed the sheet - she said it was out to wash; I sent for an officer - she then owed me three weeks rent. I believed she was in great distress, and that this was her first offence.

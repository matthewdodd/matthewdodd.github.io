            . I am a shoe-maker
. I live in Red Lion-street, Holborn. I lost my counterpane on the 18th of 
               August.
             The prisoner came up and asked for a name I did not know. I told her there was no such person there. She went back. I thought I heard her on the stairs, and I heard a room door shut to. I jumped down stairs. I saw a counterpane on her arm. I looked in the room. I saw the counterpane was gone. I took the counterpane from her. This is the counterpane. It is mine.
Prisoner's Defence. I was in liquor. I did not know how I came by that counterpane.

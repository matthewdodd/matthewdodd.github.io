GEORGE WATTS
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
18th of January, 40 yards of carpet, value 5l. 18s., the goods of 



William Smith.






WILLIAM SMITH
. I live with my father, William Smith, a draper in Shaftesbury-terrace, Pimlico. This carpet is my father's—(looking at it.)





THOMAS PIGGOT
. I am shopman to Mr. Smith. On the afternoon of the 18th of January, I saw the prisoner about a furlong from the shop, coming from the shop carrying this carpet on his shoulder—I followed him, and noticed the cost price on it—I got assistance, and followed him to Vincent-square—he was stopped there by my companion, and taken to the station-house—I asked who he brought it from—he said a man had given it to him on the road.

Prisoner. Q. I dare say you saw a respectable gentleman with me who gave me the carpet? A. No, I saw no man near you—when I stopped you I asked where you were taking it to, and you said a gentleman gave it you to carry—I said, "Is that gentleman here?"—you said, "No, I should know him, if I were to see him."





GEORGE SIMMONS
. I am shopman to Mr. Smith. I placed the carpet outside the door on the morning of the 18th, on the grating in front of the shop.





JAMES SKELTON
 (police-constable B 94.) I took the prisoner into custody—he told me a man gave it to him in Vauxhall-bridge-road to carry to Westminster Abbey, and was to give him 1s. for his trouble—he was searched, but nothing was found on him—Shaftsbury-terrace is in Vauxhall-road.




GUILTY
.* Aged 48.—


Transported for Seven Years.
(The prisoner had been previously transported.)

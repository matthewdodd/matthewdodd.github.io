            . I live in Dean-street, Soho




. I commonly go to bed about eleven o'clock. Between the 10th and 11th of this month my house was broke open; we were alarmed on the 11th in the morning, and came down; we found the kitchen window broke open, the bar wrenched away, and the doors unlocked and unbolted. I lost about 900 ounces of plate, a very large quantity from a cabinet in a dressing-room on the ground floor; they took some napkins of a particular sort, with a coat of arms, and a motto round it, on them. We have found some of them.

            . I am servant to Sir 
               
                  Thomas
                   Willson
               



            . I was not the last of the family that was up that night. Three of us maids went to bed together, and left three men below. When I came down in the morning, I found the kitchen window broke open, the bar was wrenched and broke. I know the plate used to be kept in the cabinet; a very great quantity of plate was lost, more than is laid in the indictment.

                  Thomas
                   Willson
               



            . The kitchen window was made secure that night when the family went to bed; my fellow-servant, the footman, was up ten minutes or a quarter of an hour after me; he lay with me. It might be full eleven when I went to bed. Master's plate was kept in a cabinet in the back parlour; there were thirteen large table spoons, nine silver candlesticks in all; there was a small sized spoon, and a large soup spoon, and a quantity of damask napkins, I cannot tell how many; there were coats of arms upon them, and a motto in French. I came down twenty minutes after eight in the morning, and found the kitchen window broke, the bar was bent and wrenched open, and the cabinet was also broke open.

            . There was an information brought to Sir 
               
                  John
                   Fielding
               



            's, that Lister and Pemberton used to go out on nights a housebreaking. We went to Lister's house about three in the morning, last Monday, being the 15th; he lodged in Black-boy alley; we had not been in the house above five minutes, before he and Pemberton and the evidence, 
               
                  William
                   Fountain
               



            , came in. I took Lister and Pemberton each by the arm, and John Heley tied their hands. After that I searched them, and took this chisel out of Pemberton' pocket, and a pistol loaded with shot; then I searched Lister, and took a pistol loaded with  ball out of his pocket. (The two pistols and chisel produced in court). There were other tools found upon the evidence, but I did not find them. There was Sarah Hill there; I locked the door, and took them and Sarah Hill, and another woman. (there were five of them ) to Sir 
               
                  John
                   Fielding
               



            's. Upon a little table in the room, I had seen a napkin lying; I looked at it, but it being candle-light, I did not see any thing remarkable on it, so I left it there. In the morning, Sir John ordered me to go and search the room; then I saw the arms on the napkins; I found it where I left it. There was another woman that 
               
                  Sarah
                   Hill
               



             sent with me, to see what were taken away. Hill desired me to bring the cloth that lay on the table to her: by her being particular in desiring that, I thought there must be something more than ordinary about it; and in searching about the bed in the same room, I found another napkin of the same mark. (Both produced in court, deposed to by 
               
                  Frances
                   Granton
               



            , as her master's property.)

                  Thomas
                   Willson
               



            . I bought these napkins when I was at Brussels; I can swear to them very safely: here is one of the same, which I brought from home. [Produced and compared; they correspond, &c.]


                  John
                   Heley
               



            . I was along with Mr. Taylor when the two men at the bar came in. This iron crow was taken out of the third person's pocket. [Producing an iron crow about sixteen inches long, with claws at one end, and the other a sharp point ]. Here is a box with tinder, flint, steel, and matches, which were taken out of his pocket. [Also produced in court.]
Taylor. I tried this chisel at Sir Thomas's house, at the cabinet in the back parlour; it exactly fitted the impressions made on the cabinet, where it had been wrenched open. There was a bureau also that had been broke open; but this chisel did not fit the marks on that.
Q. What is the name of the third person?
Heley. His name is Fountain.
Fountain was not examined.
Lister's Defence.
There are many different people lie in that house in Black-boy-alley in a week; it is a common lodging-house. I know nothing of the matter.
Pemberton's Defence.
Lister asked me to go and drink with him; he took me to his room. He had this chisel, I said it would serve me for a turn-screw; he said I might take it, it did not belong to him; we went out to drink together, and staid out pretty late. When we came home, these men were in the house, Taylor and Heley, and four or five more; they took us to Sir 
               
                  John
                   Fielding
               



            's, who sent me to the Gatehouse.
Hill's Defence.
I was very ill in bed; sometimes I lay in that room, and sometimes in another; two of these gentlemen came to the door and knocked; a woman got up and let them in; they asked if I could let them a lodging? I said I could not. Then they asked for a glass of gin? I said they must get in themselves, I had none. They then said, if I offered to stir they would cut me down the skull with a thing they had; they tied me to another woman, and took us away to Sir 
               
                  John
                   Fielding
               



            's, and the next day to Clerkenwell; then they searched the house, and pretended to find these things; there are different people lodge in that house.

               T. 14
            .
(M.) Lister and Pemberton were a second time indicted, for 


               breaking and entering the dwelling house of

            +.
The prosecutor is a wire sieve maker
, and lives in Turnmill-street




. He deposed, his house was broke open, and the things mentioned in the indictment, and other things, taken away, on the 30th of December at night; but had not found any of them again; that he knew not who did it, any farther than what 
               
                  William
                   Fountain
               



             had told him. There being no evidence of cried to confirm or corroborate the account Fountain could give, he was not examined.
Both 

               acquitted
            .

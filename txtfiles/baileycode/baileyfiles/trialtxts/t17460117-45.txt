                  Marriot 
               



            . Please you, my Lord, I was at Newgate-Market buying some Fowls, on the 7th of December last, of a Saturday Morning, before it was well light. There were two Dozen and eight Fowls, and six Ducks. Whilst I was bargaining I felt something justle against me, and immediately I miss'd this Box, where there was a Guinea and a Half in Gold, and a Nine-shilling Piece in Gold. Turning short round about me, when I miss'd them, I saw a young Lad stand, and the Prisoner at the Bar; I clapp'd hold of the young Lad, and said, I had my Pocket pick'd, and cry'd out, Give me my Money, give me my Box: And the Lad said, he had none of my Money, nor my Box. I cry'd out again, Give me my Money, &c. With that, the Lad, in a little Time, gave me my empty Box; and this young Man, the Prisoner, stood by him. I did not see him take the Money out, or know how he came by it.
Q. What became of the Boy?
Marriot. He run away.
Q. What have you else to say?
Marriot. Nothing else, but I saw this young Lad, the Prisoner, stand by him at the same Time.


                  Q. 
               


            (to Peter M' Adam ) What have you to say?
M' Adam. While this Woman was buying the Fowls I perceiv'd the Prisoner and another standing by me, near a Quarter of an Hour. When we had bargain'd, the Woman went to pay me; but she was in a very great Fright, and said, I am robb'd, I have lost my Money. I think they were then both standing by me; but when I look'd again they were both gone. Upon this I run five or six Yards through another Stall in Newgate-Market: I took the Prisoner in a Turning on the Right-Hand, while the other was running on the Left. I took him, and sat him down by me. I ask'd him several Questions; Who he was? and, Whence he came from? but he could give but a very indifferent Account. And in a Day or two he was had before an Alderman in Guildball; there he was question'd if he knew any thing of it? He denied it; he said he knew nothing of it. Afterwards, when we were coming out he said very wicked Words; that he would have an Eye upon our Blood, or Words to that Purpose.

            . Please you, my Lord , I saw the Prisoner at the Bar, and another Lad, in the Market for near an Hour, walking about, the same Morning the Money was lost; they did not seem to have any Business. I said to the next Neighbour, Take Care of your Pocket. I fear'd these Fellows were upon an ill Design: Accordingly some Time after this Woman, the Prosecutrix, cries out, Pick-Pocket. I saw the other run away, and this one, the Prisoner, following of him.
The Prisoner said of this Evidence, he would hang any Body for the Sake of a Reward.


                  Q. 
               


            (to 
               
                  Martha 
                  Knight 
               



            ) What have you to say against the Prisoner?
Knight. I saw the Prosecutrix have hold of a little Boy by the Shoulder. This Prisoner at the Bar gave him a Shove, and shov'd him from the Woman, through 
               
                  Harry 
                  Woolet 
               



            's Stall; and I saw this Chap, the Prisoner, stand at the Door to keep the Mob from coming through. He stood to hinder the People from pursuing the Boy.


                  Q. 
               


            (to 
               
                  Mary 
                  Legg 
               



            ) What have you to say of this Matter?
Legg. I was in the Market, standing by Mr. M' Adams's Stall: As I stood, the Prisoner at the Bar, and the little Lad, came by me; the little one was next to me, and the Prisoner was on the other Side; and they whisper'd to one another, and went up immediately to the Woman, the Prosecutrix.


                  Q. 
               


            (to the Prisoner) What have you to say for yourself? Have you any Witnesses?
The Prisoner said he was not guilty. 

               Guilty
            .

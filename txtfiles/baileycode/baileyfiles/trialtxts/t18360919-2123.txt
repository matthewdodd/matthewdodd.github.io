ANN FINCH. I am in the employ of Mr. Thomas Jackson. He keeps an hotel and coffee-house in Bow-street, Covent-garden, On the 26th of August, the prisoner came and asked for a fruit-pie—I gave it him—he paid me—he asked for a spoon, and I gave it him—he said, "Thank you, that is just what I want"—I then went down stairs for about three minutes—when I came up he was gone—I went to take the plate away, and found a metal spoon instead of the silver one I gave him—I looked on the table and missed four salt-spoons, and one mustard spoon—I found three metal ones left on the table for them, of the same sort as the others were.

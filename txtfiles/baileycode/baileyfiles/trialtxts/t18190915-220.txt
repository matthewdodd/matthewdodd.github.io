On Tuesday, the 31st of August, about eight o'clock in the evening, I locked up the vestry, the articles stated in the indictment were then safe; I went again at ten o'clock next morning, and found they were gone. The prisoners had entered by a window about a yard from the ground.

            . I am an officer of Whitechapel. On Wednesday morning, the 1st of September, about one o'clock, I saw three boys running down Red Lion-street very quick, they were the prisoners - I stopped Brackenborough and Greenwood, Clark ran away. I took a corkscrew out of Brackenborough's pocket, and took him to the watch-house, and on Greenwood I found a silver-mounted cork. Brackenborough said he had had the corkscrew some months. I asked them where they had been at that time of the morning? they said,
"Like other lads, spending their time in Swan-alley" - there are a number of houses of ill-fame there. I took them before a Magistrate. Greenwood would give no account how he came by the cork - they were remanded for me to discover the owner. I received information, and found Clark at his mother's house, next door to the meeting, and asked him if he knew the other two prisoners? he said he did very well. I pulled out the corkscrew, and asked him if he knew that? he was very much frightened, and said,
"Yes, it came from next door" (meaning the chapel). I asked him what they had done with the other property? he said Greenwood had taken it to his (Clark's) mother's. I secured him, and went to his mother in Booth-street, Spitalfields. I asked her for the things which Charles had left there - she said she hoped it was all right, but she was afraid something was wrong, and therefore she took them to Mrs. Markham's, a neighbour - she accompanied me there. Markham said she brought them about seven o'clock in the morning of the robbery. I found a bundle containing two table-cloths, an inkstand, and five napkins. I took her into custody.
HANNAH MARKHAM. Mrs. Clark, left the bundle at my house. I did not know a thing it contained. She asked me to let her leave them till she called.
Cross-examined. Q. You knew her - A. Yes, for ten years. She bore an excellent character.

CLARK'S Defence. My mother is innocent.

            . My husband's name is John: we keep a public house
 in Shoreditch



: the two prisoners came to my house about the beginning of November, and asked for work: they said they were hungry: I bought a spade of them for 18 d. they pulled out a crust, and I gave them some cheese. Barnfield went down into the yard, where I had hung out a piece of blue baize. When they were gone, Mr. Simonds and Mr. Lyon came, and asked me if I had not lost my ironing cloth. I looked, and missed the baize. I went with him to Mr. Simonds's house; there were the two prisoners. Barnfield owned he took it, and said he did it to make him an apron. Mr. Lyon searched his pocket, and my brush was found in it (produced and deposed to.) I had not missed the brush.

            . The two prisoners were coming by my house; I live about 5 or 600 yards from Mr. Jukes's house. They stood still a little while. I saw Barnfield have a piece of blue cloth under his arm. Mrs. Oakley came, and said she had lost a shirt; then I with assistance went and took them, and they owned to the taking the things; the cloth and brush were found in Barnfield's pocket.

            . I am headborough. I had the prisoners in charge; they had been at my house three hours or better. When they saw me, Barnfield fell on his knees, and begged I would let him go; he owned he stole the cloth.

            . I am constable of Clerkenwell. On the 21st of November I was passing along Goswell-street-road


, and saw the prisoner and another person looking about Crump's window. I watched them and saw the prisoner go into the shop and come out in about three minutes, with a basket in his hand. When he got a little way off he began to run. I went into the shop, found they had missed a basket, pursued, and took him down a gateway with it. He threw the basket down, and tried to get away.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

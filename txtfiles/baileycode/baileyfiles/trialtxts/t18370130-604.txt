HENRY SKINNER
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
17th of January, 1 ream of paper, value 17s.; 500 sheets of printed paper, value 20s.; and 88 stereotype plates, value 12l.; the goods of 



John Duncombe.—2nd COUNT, calling it 50lbs. of paper.






JOHN DUNCOMBE
. I am a bookseller and printer. My office is in Queen-street, Lincoln's-inn-fields—the prisoner had been in my employ, but I discharged him just before this happened—I know this paper is mine—no one else could have paper of this sort, because it is a copyright work, and of considerable value.





WALTER PAGE JENKINS
. I am in the service of the prosecutor—this paper is his property—I know it was safe on Monday night, the 10th of January, at nine o'clock, in the warehouse in the shop—the prisoner was not at work there then, but he knew the ways of the shop and warehouse.





GEORGE HOLBOROW
. I am a cheesemonger, and live in Clare-street, Clare-market. I bought this as waste paper—I really believe of the prisoner—he represented that it was spoiled sheets, being over wetted, and could not be used—I gave him 3d. a pound—that is the full price—I think I paid him 12s. or 18s. altogether—I bought it on a Tuesday or Wednesday morning about a fortnight ago.





MARY SMITH
. The prisoner knocked at Mr. Duncombe's door, on the 17th of January, at half-past seven o'clock—I came down stairs and let him in—I said, "What do you want?"—he said, "I am come to work"—I said, "You cannot go to work, there is no one here"—he said, "Yes, if you give me a light; I saw Mr. Duncombe last night, and he told me what to go on with"—I gave him a light, and he went away within ten minutes, and left the shop door open.

Prisoner. I was in the prosecutor's place at eight o'clock, and never went out before dinner time.




GUILTY
. Aged 19.—


Transported for Seven Years.

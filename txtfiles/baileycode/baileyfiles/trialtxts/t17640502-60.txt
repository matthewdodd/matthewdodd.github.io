            . On Wednesday morning last, a little before 9 o'clock, I saw the prisoner come down stairs with a box; I did not know whose it was; I ran up, and missed mine, and the things mentioned. When I returned, she was out of sight.
Q. Where do you live?

            . I lodge in Charles-street, Covent-garden


. I looked about, and found a gown in Long acre; she had pawned that: then I took her up, and searched her lodgings, and found the rest of the things, all but a coloured apron and a pair of stockings, which the prisoner has on.

            . I am a pawnbroker, and live in Long-acre: the prisoner at the bar pledged this gown with me. (Produced and deposed to by the prosecutrix.)
The prisoner said nothing in her defence.

Mrs. Daffey. About Christmas last 
               
                  Mary 
                  Hughes 
               



             came to me to be hired as a Servant
; she said, she had not been above a Fortnight in Town, but Mr. Williams the Prisoner, was a Relation of her's; and as he had liv'd in the Neighbourhood 14 Years, I thought I might depend upon him for her Character. I sent for him, and he told me, she had not liv'd any where in Town, but if he was worth a thousand Pounds he would give that Security for her honesty; I told him, our Service required a trusty Servant; but as you are an honest Neighbour, I believe I may depend upon you; so upon his Character I took her. She had not lived with me above a Week, but I miss'd a pair of double Ruffles, which cost me 7 l. I desir'd Mr. Daffey to part with her, for I was sure she was a Pilferer; he said, we could not do without a Servant, and we must therefore watch her. I believe she had convey'd away most of the Goods mention'd in the Indictment before; she took away (for ought I know) Things to the value of 200 l.
Mr. Bird. I saw her Confession sign'd; she own'd the taking of 2 Table-cloths, 2 Sheets, 6 Pewter Plates, 6 Glasses, 2 Chocolate-cups, 2 Tea-cups, 2 Saucers, 3 Pound of Candles, an Earthern Flower-pot, a pair of double Ruffles, and some other things, which she could not recollect.
The Confession of 
               
                  Mary 
                  Hughes 
               



             taken this 13th of February, before Sir 
               
                  William 
                  Billers 
               



            , Knight.


                  Mary 
                  Hughes 
               



            , single Woman, confesseth and saith, that she lived in her Service the space of 5 Weeks, during which time, she at several times stole from the House of 
               
                  Anthony 
                  Daffey 
               



            , 2 Table-cloaths, 2 Sheets, 6 Pewter Plates, 2 Chints Curtains, 2 Chocolate-cups, 2 Tea-cups, 2 Saucers, some Candles, and some other things: and that Mrs. Daffey took on the 12th of February, one Chints Curtain, one Pillow, a Flower-pot, and a double Ruffle, which this Examinant stole, in order to carry away, for her own use, in her Box and Trunk at 
               
                  Edward 
                  Williams 
               



            's.
Mrs. Daffey. When I found I was robb'd, I sent to Williams directly: he came to our House, and saw the Goods I had taken from her; he said he knew nothing of the Matter; but the next Morning he came and said her Sister Grace had convey'd all the things, which were at his House away to Aldgate.
Mrs. Acton I was at Mr. Daffey's the Night that Williams was sent for, and I told him, he had not done well to recommend a Thief: he said he thought she had been honest, and blam'd Mary Hughes for behaving so wrong: They whisper'd together, but he said not a Word then, of the Boxes which were at his House, nor did we know there were any things at his House, 'till the next Day. The next Morning he came and told us there were Boxes at his House, but Mary's Sister had gutted them by 3 o'Clock in the Morning; when Grace was taken up, she own'd she had taken the Goods out of the Boxes; and that a young Man in the Neighbourhood assisted her to carry them to Duke's-Place: They were brought back by 
               
                  Grace 
                  Hughes 
               



            , Williams and his Wife, and were found to be Mr. Daffey's Goods.
Mrs. Rutter. I was with Mr. Daffey at Sir William Billers's, and while we were there, Mrs. Williams told us, Mary had brought all the things back; she owned that Grace had taken them away at 3 o'Clock in the Morning. Mr. Bird and I were present, when they were open'd in Mr. Daffey's Warehouse; we advis'd her to fetch Grace; she did so, and brought the Boxes and Goods with her to Daffey's Warehouse.
- Thomas. Mary Hughes lived with me as a Servant in April last; she went from me the 24th of June. The Prisoner Williams recommended her to me, as an honest Body, a Country Woman of his, and newly come to Town from Chester. I believed Williams to be an honest Man, and took her on his Character. I presently found she knew the Town as well as I, and that she was a saucy impudent Woman. I lost some things while she lived with me, but as I could not swear any Fact upon her, and she threatned me with the Law if I charged her; I was cautious, and only turn'd her away; she liv'd with me about 5 Weeks.

                  Rutter 
               



            . I was at Mr. Daffey's that Evening the Constable was carrying Mary Hughes away; Williams was sent for, and he said he would meet them at Sir William's, but said not a word of any Goods at his House. The next Morning he said, he was sorry for what had happen'd, and told us there were 2 Boxes and a Trunk at his House, which were sent for to Mr. Daffey's, but they were stripp'd; Grace, he said, had carry'd off the things in the Night; but he would go to Rosemary-Lane where she had lodged some other Boxes and enquire after them.

            . The Prisoner Mary owned the taking the Goods with a design to carry them off, and if I would go to Williams's House I should find them there; but Williams and his Wife told us, 
               
                  Grace 
                  Hughes 
               



             had carry'd them all away in the Night. Mary said, she believ'd we might find her in Barnaby-Street; Williams and his Wife went to see for her, and about 10 o'Clock at night, they came to Mr. Daffey's House with Grace Hughes, and the Goods which Mrs. Daffey claim'd.
Mrs. Daffey. Mary Hughes had left some Boxes, full of other things at Williams's House, but upon Mary's being taken up, Grace had pick'd out all that were mine, and carry'd them away in the Night.
Mary Hughes had nothing material to say in her Defence: and Grace said, she expected Mr. Rawlinson of Hackney to appear to her Character; but no one appearing for either of them; the Jury found both the Hughe's 

               Guilty
            . Several Persons giving Williams a fair Character, he and his Wife were 

               Acquitted
            .

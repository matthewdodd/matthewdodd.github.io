            . As I was going along Fleet-Street, near Serjeants-Inn


, the prisoner and another man followed me, and the prisoner push'd between me and the wall. He took my handkerchief out of my pocket, and I saw him deliver it to his companion.
Q. Are you sure you had it in your pocket just before that?
Backhouse. I had, and I felt it go from my pocket; I seiz'd the prisoner, and the other man got off with my handkerchief; the prisoner was searched, and several handkerchiefs were found upon him, which he said he had found in the street.
Prisoner's Defence.
I know nothing at all of it.

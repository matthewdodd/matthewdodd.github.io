JOHN JONES
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
9th of February, 1 umbrella, value 7s., the goods of 



Edward Prior.






WILLIAM BROWN
. I am assistant to Mr. Edward Prior, of Finsbury-place, a hosier. On the 9th of February we had a number of umbrellas near the door, inside—I saw the prisoner and two other lads, and watched them—the prisoner went to the umbrellas, and took one—I ran out, and he let it fall, and ran away—a young man stopped him, and he was brought back—this is the umbrella—it is the property of Mr. Edward Prior.

Prisoner. That is not the umbrella. Witness. I can swear it was the only one of this description we had.





WILLIAM NEEDHAM
. I heard the cry of "Stop thief"—I saw the prisoner running—I pursued, and collared him—he dodged me a little, but when I took him he never spoke nor attempted to get away.





HENRY PEARSON
. I am a porter. I saw the prisoner and two others near the prosecutor's door—I saw the prisoner take the umbrella and drop it down.




GUILTY
.* Aged 18.—


Transported for Seven Years.

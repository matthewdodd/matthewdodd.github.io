On the 20th of April, I lost a pocketbook, at the Running Horse, in Little Queen-street


, I called for a pint of porter, and three half-penny worth of bread and cheese, it was in the common room, then I called for another pint of porter, and asked the prisoner to drink, I never saw him before; while I was drinking the second pint, I laid my head down on the table; when I went in there, I had a leather pocketbook in my pocket, with a steel spring-look, with the notes in it.
Court. What notes were contained in that pocket-book when you came in? - I have no regular copy of them, there are four that are lost, there was one for 200 l. 10 s. another for 30 l. another for 9 l. 12 s. another for 12 l; these notes which I can swear to were four five-guinea notes, 156 l. 12 s. the other one of the five-guinea notes was turned into money, they were payable at Biddulph and Cocks's, they were Berwick's notes.
Court. Mention particularly the several notes? - There were four for five-guineas each, they were on demand at Biddulph and Cocks's, two of them, I think, was signed Berwick, Wall and Isaac, and the other two was signed

What way of life are you in? - In the Mercery business
.
In town? - In Birmingham-row, in Worcester; when this man was going away, I told him he had taken my pocketbook, and I wished him to return it; it was in my left hand pocket.
Court. Was you intoxicated? - I was middling, I remember losing it, and calling in the landlord.
Court. Is it usual to carry such a property as you have described, to the amount of some hundred pounds, about you? - That was the twentieth year I had had that book, and I always carried it; I had a great many more notes with me then, in my waistcoat pocket.
Court. Had you occasion to pay these notes? - I came to lay them out; I lived 14 years at Worcester; I came to town for the purpose of buying goods, I paid some money in Spitalfields about 350 l.

Had the prisoner left the place then? - Yes.

Court. What did you do afterwards in consequence of that? - I went to my inn at the Bull and Mouth.
Court. Did not you pursue him? - No.
Did you take no steps to pursue him? - No, I did not, I stopped and told the landlord what had happened, and it would be an injury to me, the loss of my pocketbook, as well as my memorandums.
Did you enquire of the landlord of the house who the prisoner was? - I believe I might.
Did he give you any account of him? - He did not say much about him then, I gave a man half a guinea to search the bog for my pocket-book, and it was found there in the bog at Mr. Golding's house.
(The pocket-book produced.)
Court. Are there any marks now remaining in that pocket-book that you can swear to? - Yes and every paper in it.
Was any body in the room with him and you? - Another young man, I did not perceive him touch me, I missed my pocketbook directly as he was going away, I told him he had got it, but he put it up; there was the remains of one note or two, there was the small part of a note that was drawn by an attorney, one Bradstock, upon Mr. Sheppard, in Carey-street, he refused the payment of it, there was the stamp and part of his name, and a little bit of the thirty pound note.
Court. Was the pocket-book, when it was found, delivered to you? - It was delivered to me and the company, I examined it, and found many of the things there.
Court. Was the Running Horse a house you frequented? - No, my Lord, I never heard of it before, but I went in because I thought I could eat some bread and cheese.
Court. Have you got the notes again? - They are in the possession of Mrs. Orde.
Have you seen any of the notes in the indictment since you lost them? - Many times, they were lodged in the possession of Mr. Davison, of Temple Bar, and upon his going into the country, he left them with Mrs. Ord, I was not well the next day, I sent my brother-in-law about them, who went to some of the people; on the Monday night by some means or other it got wind, and they found me in bed at the Bull and Mouth, they came up stairs, there were Mr. Griffin, to whom one of the notes was payable, a clerk belonging to Mr. Thrale, one Humpage, and another man, they came and asked me if I had been robbed, and they produced me seven notes, I looked at them, and saw the pinholes in them, and others without any indorsement, they left me a direction to go to Bow-street the next morning, which I did.
Prisoner. Was I beside you? - I don't say you was, you was very near me.

Jury. Did the prosecutor seem to be in liquor? - Yes, he rather looked as if he had been drinking a good deal.
Court. Did he charge the prisoner with taking his pocket-book? - He came into the bar, and said, he had lost his pocketbook, I said, I don't think you could lose it here, it must be lost somewhere else.
Court. Then there was no charge made on any particular person, nor any pursuit after the prisoner at the bar? - No, the necessary was searched on the Tuesday after; the prisoner came back, and lodged in the house; the same night there was a sailor that slept with him, but he knew nothing of what had happened.
Court. Had the prisoner at the bar left the room, before the prosecutor left your house? - I think he had, he came to his lodging on Sunday night, he met with some of his acquaintance of the glass grinders, he is a glass grinder, and they went away, and about eleven he went to bed, and on Monday about eleven he went out, and did not come home on Monday night; I did not see him till he stopt in a coach on Tuesday morning, with some of the Bow-street people.
PRISONER's DEFENCE.
I dined at this house on Sunday, off some potatoes and mutton, and this gentleman came in whilst we were at dinner, he began clauming the meat about with his fingers, and he had some potatoes with us, and he had some beer, and afterwards, when we were paying for some beer, I saw the pocket-book laying underneath the table; I have no witnesses.
Jury. Is it not probable that it might slip out of your pocket? - No.
Jury. Why did you not alarm the house? - I called the landlord.
Jury. And went about very unconcerned? - I wished my brother to seek after him.
You could not know what you was about? - Yes, I am very clear as to that part of the business, as to not going after him, I was not very well the next morning, I did not seek after him, but I wished my brother in-law to seek after him, as some of them were his drawing.
Mrs. Ord. I never heard any thing against the prisoner before, I have known him two years.
Mr. Golding. He behaved very well in our neighbourhood.
Jury to Lowe. Had you a handkerchief or any thing in your pocket, that you could pull the book out with? - I had lost both my handkerchiefs before.

ANN CREMER
. I am the wife of Daniel Cremer. I was in Covent-garden on the morning of the 18th of September, about seven o'clock—I had 5s. 6d. in my pocket, and a number of duplicates—a gentleman touched me, and asked if I had lost any thing—I felt, and I had not thing left in my pocket—this is my property-(looking at it)—my husband has been ill two months—I have four children to keep—when I turned, the prisoner Jones kicked me in the eye, and gave me a black eye—he was getting from the gentleman, and I laid hold of him.





THOMAS BLOSSETT
. I am a constable of Covent-garden market. On the morning of the 18th of September I saw the three prisoners in the market—I saw Wood attempt several women's pockets, while the others were covering him—they then went to the prosecutrix-Wood got his hand into her pocket, and took out something—I could not tell what—the other two were standing by the side of the woman, covering wood—I went after the policeman, and took Jones—he threw himself down, and kicked me several times in the breast—he had the property, and he threw it away—I saw Wood pass it over to him—this is the bag and money.


Jones's Defence. I was going home, a gentleman came and laid hold of me; he nearly strangled me, and the woman came and took hold of the tail of my coat—I cannot tell whether I kicked her or not.

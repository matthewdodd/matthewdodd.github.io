I live at Mrs. Smith's house; I saw the prisoner Wilson going out of the street door, and I a shirt sleeve hang from under her cloak; I told Mrs. Smith, and she pursued her.

             sworn.
I saw the prisoner Newlan at the corner of Queen-street talking to a man; she went and met the other prisoner, and whipped something under her cloak, then they parted.

             sworn.
I saw the two prisoners together, and the prisoner Wilson went into Mrs. Smith's house; she came out in about ten minutes; she met the landlady, who said she had been up stairs to ask a question; then she called the other woman, and gave her the bundle; I am sure they are the same women.

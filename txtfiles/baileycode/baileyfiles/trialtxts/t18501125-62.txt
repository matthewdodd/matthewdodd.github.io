FRANCES BOSWORTH
. I am the wife of John Bosworth, a butcher, of 6, Cambridge-place, Paddington. Hallett has been his servant two years—he slept at home—on the Tuesday before he was before the Magistrate he did not come as usual, and I missed a frock coat which had not been worn since May, a satin waistcoat and scarf, a pillow, a pair of trowsers, and a bag—they were wrapped up in an apron, which was taken as well—I saw them all safe a week before—these are them (produced)—they are mine.





HENRY SMITH
. I am shopman to Mr. Gideon, a pawnbroker—I produce a coat and waistcoat, pledged by Baker, on 23rd Oct.—he said they were his own, and he had been in the habit of having eight shillings on them.





GEORGE FERRIS
 (policeman, D 28). I took Baker, and told him he was charged with receiving some things from Hallett, knowing them to be stolen—he said he did not tell him to take them.

Baker's Defence. A boy named Barnes offered me a shilling to pawn them; I said, "Are you sure you did not steal them?" he said, "Yes; they were given me by a young gentleman who is gone to sea."





ALFRED PAYNE
 (policeman, D 235). I produce a certificate from Clerkenwell—(read—Henry Baker, convicted, on his own confession, of stealing a handkerchief, and confined three months)—I was present—he is the person.




GUILTY
.** Aged 17.—


Transported for Seven Years.

: On Monday, the 20th of September, about seven o'clock in the evening, I had seen the portmanteau in the window; I heard a noise, turned round and missed it; I then went to the door, and saw the prisoner with the trunk in his hand, going towards the Poultry Compter; I followed him into Grocer's-hall-passage, where I stopped him with the trunk in his hand; I brought him back, and had him secured; he said he wanted it to put a bundle in, which he had in his other hand.

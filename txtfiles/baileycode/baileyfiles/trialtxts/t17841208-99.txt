My husband lives in Drury-lane


, he keeps the Mogul's head
; my house was broke open on the 10th of November, we had washed and hung some linen in the club room, every thing was safe over night, and I saw the windows both shut, there was no fastening to the shutters, we went out of the room and locked the door about one o'clock in the morning; about eight the girl went in to open the windows, and shut the door again; at half after eleven I went to see if the things were dry, and I missed the things mentioned in the indictment, they were all there the night before; I immediately enquired about them, and could not find them, I did not observe any part of the house to be broke open; it being talked about the neighbourhood I got again one old apron, and one night cap; the things were found on the Monday, one Mrs. Dobson had bought them as she said, because she thought they were mine, and a woman had been offering some shirts and shifts, I know nothing of the prisoners.

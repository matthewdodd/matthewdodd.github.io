ELEANOR SELINA BAKER
. I am single, and I keep a house at Ealing for Mr. Currier. The prisoner came to me on the 20th of November—I had known him before—I had seen him about—he said one of us was to go up directly, as Mr. Daniels wished to speak to us—Mr. Daniels lived in the village—I left two children at home—the eldest was eight years old—I was absent about a quarter of an hour—I found I was not wanted—I came back, and the house had been robbed of all these things stated—I

gave information, and the same day I saw some of my property again, but a good deal of property I have quite lost—this is my box—it was locked, and I found it broken open-a necklace, clasp, and ear-ring were in it, and a sixpence, and other little things.





JANE FRANCES JONES
. I live at Mr. William Currier's. Part of this property is mine—the prisoner is the person that came to the house.





ISAAC BALLARD
 (police-constable F 58.) On the 20th of November, information was given of this, and about twelve o'clock I took the prisoner at Great Ealing—I found this box on him with the necklace, clasp, and small ear-ring—this is the prosecutor's property.





JOHN BURFORD
. I am a pawnbroker at Old Brentford. I took in this gown, on the 20th of November, of the prisoner, he said he brought it for his sister—it is the property of Jones.

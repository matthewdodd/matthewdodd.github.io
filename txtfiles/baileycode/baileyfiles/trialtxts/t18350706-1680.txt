1680. 




WILLIAM JONES
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
20th of June, 1 hat, value 3s.; and 1 handkerchief, value 2s.; the goods of 



James Batch.






JAMES BATCH
. I live at Mr. Broomfield's, a timber-dealer, at Deptford. On the 20th of June, I left my hat in my workshop—the prisoner worked for me about a year and a half ago—I had not seen him for some time—the shop-door was not shut—I missed the hat next morning, and suspecting him, I had him apprehended—I have since seen the hat and handkerchief—these are them.





EDWARD CARTER
. I am a pawnbroker, at Greenwich. I produce the hat, which was pawned by the prisoner last month.





BENJAMIN LOVELL
 (police-constable R 15.) I apprehended the prisoner, on the 23rd of June. I found the handkerchief at another pawnbroker's, and have it here, as the pawnbroker could not identify the prisoner—I found the duplicates on the prisoner.




GUILTY
. Aged 20.—


Transported Seven Years.

Sixth Jury, before Mr. Sergeant Arabin.

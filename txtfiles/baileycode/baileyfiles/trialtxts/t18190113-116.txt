            . My father keeps a haberdasher's shop, ten doors from Knight's. I was out on an errand, and saw the prisoner, Simpson, walking backwards and forwards by Knight's door; I crossed over to watch, and saw him put his foot in the shop, and take the pork out of the window; he went about two doors further, then Bailey crossed the road, as if he had something under his coat. I knew them before.

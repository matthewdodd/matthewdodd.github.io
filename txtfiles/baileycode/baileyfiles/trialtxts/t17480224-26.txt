            . On the third of February these goods were stole, I was not at home.
Q. What trade are you?
Taylor. I am a distiller
, but I had these from a friend of mine: I carried the Prisoner before a Justice, and he owned they stole them out of my shop, and these boys told me I might have them in the afternoon if I would not search any more after them; the Prisoners told me they were at Mrs. Coyle's . These goods were exposed to sale by Coyle's mother, and I found the goods in Mrs. Coyle's house. Mr. Kitchin went along with me, and took my goods from Coyle's house: the Prisoner confessed he took 3 s 4 d. out of the till .

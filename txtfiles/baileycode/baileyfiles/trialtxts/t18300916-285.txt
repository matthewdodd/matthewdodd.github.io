WALTER BERDOE. I was on Clerkenwell-green


, between four and five o'clock, on the 14th of September - I was standing opposite the booth at the election, and felt a hand gently withdrawing itself from my pocket; I turned, and saw the prisoner - he said, "It was not me that did it;" the handkerchiefs was on the ground - there was a mob there: I took him, and gave charge of him - two other silk handkerchiefs were found next his skin, and the duplicate of another.
Prisoner. Q. Can you swear I took it? A. To the best of my belief you did, because no other person, I think, could have taken it, and dropped it there.
Prisoner's Defence. It is a matter of impossibility for him to swear I did it; I was unfortunately next to him - he turned, and asked a gentleman if he saw me do it; the gentleman said No; he said, I did, and took me.

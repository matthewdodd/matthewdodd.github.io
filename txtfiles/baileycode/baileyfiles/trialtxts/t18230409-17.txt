            . I am a smith
, and live in William-street, New Bridge-street. My manufactory is in Harp-alley


, the prisoner was in my employment. On the 25th of March, about ten minutes past six o'clock in the morning, I went to the manufactory, and found him coming down stairs, and asked where he was going; he said, he should not be gone five minutes; I said he should not go, as he had done that so often; he insisted upon going, and after he was gone, it occured to me that he had something about him. I followed him into Cow-cross, and saw him go into an iron shop, and just as he entered the door, I sprung upon him, and took a piece of iron from him. The officer found two other pieces in his pocket, he begged for mercy; he earned 4 l. a week, and therefore I refused to pardon him. I have advanced him 45 l. to get his family out of distress.

            . I am in the prosecutor's employ, I saw the prisoner leave the premises. I know the iron to be Mr. Walker's property.

WILLIAM SMITH
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
24th of August, 1 time-piece and stand, value 14s., the goods of 



Edward Pearson.






JULIA PEARSON
. I am the wife of Edward Pearson, a broker, in Harrow-road, Paddington. On the 24th of August the prisoner asked the price of a hearth-rug, and desired me to take it home to No. 15, Maida Vale, and said they would pay for it—I went, and found there was no such number—when I returned, a time-piece which I had left safe was gone—I had left my two little girls there—I did not send him for it.





LOUSIA PEARSON
. I was left at home, and the time-piece was there—the prisoner came back, and asked me if my mother had taken the time-piece—I said she had not—he asked if I could take it—I sent my little sister with it.





MARY ANN PEARSON
. My sister sent me with the time-piece—the prisoner took me as far as the haircutter's, and told me to go back and fetch a wrapper—he had the time-piece—I went back, and saw no more of it—I am sure the prisoner is the man.

Prisoner's Defence. I know nothing about it.




GUILTY
. Aged 33.—


Transported for Seven Years.

            . I live with my brother - this necklace is mine. On the 8th of June I was going along Wilmington-place


, and it was snatched from my neck by the prisoner - I was close by my brother's window; I called to him - he ran, and took the prisoner; the necklace was picked up in the kennel.

            . I heard the alarm between ten and eleven o'clock that night - I saw the prosecutrix's brother running after the prisoner, and while he was taking the prisoner to the station I got a candle, and found these beads in the kennel.

            . I am the prosecutrix's brother. I was sitting in the parlour, and heard her call out that the boy had stolen her beads - I ran, and took the prisoner to the station; he said he had not the beads, but they were found on the spot where he was taken; he had ran a short distance, but when we called he walked.
The prisoner put in a written Defence, merely protesting his innocence.

            . I am a fruiterer
, and live in Pear-tree street, Goswell-street


. On Sunday the 30th of March, a little before nine o'clock. I was laying on the bed; a knock came at the shop door; my wife opened it. I heard a man's voice; and got off the bed; I sat on the chair, and heard a man buying some fruit, and saw the prisoner take the watch off a nail over the mantle piece; I went and tried to take him, and in the scuffle, the watch was dropped. He got away and was apprehended on the Thursday. I am certain of him, he left his hat behind.

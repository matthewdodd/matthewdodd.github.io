JOHN AUGUSTUS HOLLAND. I was in Compton-street, Soho


, on the 10th of March, about half past seven o'clock in the evening, and felt something pull at my left side coat pocket twice. I was with a female whom I knew very well - I turned round, and saw my handkerchief in the prisoner's hand; I let go of the person's arm, and followed the prisoner, who was close behind me - he threw it down, and ran into Moor-street, and again into Compton-street - I never lost sight of him, but caught him opposite the Globe, and said, "I have got you;" he said, "You shall not hold me;" two other persons were behind me. I inquired for a watchman - he said it was too soon for one - I dragged him over to a public-house, where he was detained. I lost two handkerchiefs from my pocket.

            . I am a watchman, and received him in charge - this handkerchief was brought to the watch-house the same night by a man (I believe a Bow-street officer) - Mr. Holland identified it.(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I heard a cry and ran, but am innocent. I saw the person run down Stacey-street.

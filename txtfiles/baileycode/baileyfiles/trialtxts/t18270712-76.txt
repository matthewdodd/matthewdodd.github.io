JAMES PURCELL, SEN. The prisoner, I am sorry to say, is my son. I live at No. 10, North-wharf-row, Paddington


, and work on the road
 - he was at home with me on the 17th of June, and had been so for about a fortnight. I had a coat there, and my wife missed it, and gave information - I was then under the necessity of going to appear against him. I have never seen the coat since.

            . The prisoner's mother came to me, told me the case, and told me to take him if I could. I found him in Covent-garden and took him; he said "What have you to do with me?" I said, "What did you do with the coat?" he said, "That is nothing to you, it was my mother's coat, and I was not going to starve." I have known him all his life.

            . I am a Bow-street officer. I received the prisoner; he said, at his first examination, that he had sold the coat in Monmouth-street - and then said, he sold it to a Jew for 6d.
Prisoner's Defence. I had been out of work, and had but 2d. on the Saturday, which I bought a loaf with; and then I took the old coat and sold it for 6d. - as I did not know what use it was to my father.

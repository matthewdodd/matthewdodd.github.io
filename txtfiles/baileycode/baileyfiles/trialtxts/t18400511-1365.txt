WILLIAM HARRISON
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
20th of April, 1 copper, value 15s., the goods of 



William Bould and another; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






WILLIAM BOULD
. I am a tallow-chandler, and have one partner—we

live in East-street. I had a copper fixed at No. 2, next door to me—I had seen it safe some time back—on the 20th of April I received information, went after the prisoner, and found this copper on him—I brought him back with it—he made no hesitation at coming—it is mine.





ANN SHORT
. I live in East-street. On the 20th of April I heard a noise, and went down stairs—I saw the prisoner at the copper, and supposed he was taking it out—I went and told Mr. Bould, my landlord, of it—this is the copper.

Prisoner's Defence. I was passing the house; a man stood in the passage, and asked me if I wanted a job; he told me to take this copper, and go on.





PAUL JONES
 (police-constable D 37.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the man.




GUILTY
. Aged 18.—


Transported for Seven Years.

             sworn.
I am servant to Messrs. Knowlys; they live at No. 9, in Hart-lane; they are wine merchants


; their vaults are in Cross-lane, St. Dunstan's hill


, which comes into Hart-lane; about twenty minutes after five, going into Hart-lane, to deliver two dozen of wine to the porter; as I was going to open the vault door, I saw it open from the inside, and out came a man which was the prisoner, with two bottles under one arm, one at top of the other, and one bottle under the other arm; I first thought it was one of our own people; that was all I then saw about him; the prisoner was not a servant to the prosecutors, nor employed by him; when he had got as far as the kennel, I said, where are you going? what have you there? he said, only a bottle; I said, you are the very man I have been looking for these ten days; I took him to Mr. Knowlys's compting house; I found that he had three bottles withinside his waistcoat; we sent for a constable; and one of the Mr. Knowlys' sealed them; I left the vault door shut, but not locked; I returned in five minutes; I went down into the cellar, and I looked about the binns to see where he had taken them from, and they appeared to be taken promiscuously out from the top, being in the dark, but if he had only taken a single one I could have known, it being so full; there are six vacant places now where they were taken from; the binns were compleat; it was red port wine; they were quart bottles; they are here.

                   Knowlys
               



            .
When did you see the prisoner before? - I have seen him before, but I did not see him that day till he was brought into the compting house; he had the wine upon him that is brought into Court, and part was taken from him by another person and delivered to me; I sealed them in his presence.
(Deposed to.)

What was the seal? - W. K. and S.
What does it import? -

            , and Son.
They are the same bottles? - We have no other sealed bottles; they are red port.
Court to Catlin. Are these the bottles you took from the prisoner? - I verily believe they are the same.
Were they marked in your presence? - No, they were not.

These bottles were given to me by a man; my friends are all gone.

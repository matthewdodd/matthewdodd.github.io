CORNELIUS STRONG
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
13th of August, 1 jacket, value 2s.; and 2 handkerchiefs, value 3d.; the goods of 



Charles M'Carthy.






CHARLES M'CARTHY
. I work in the London Docks. Last Tuesday I hung my jacket up in the Dock, about one o'clock, and there were two handkerchiefs in it—I missed the jacket in about an hour—I saw it is about three hours after, at the watch-house—this is it.





GEORGE BARNES
. I work in the Docks. I saw the prosecutor's jacket hanging on a nail—the prisoner took it, put it under his arm, and walked through the shed with it—I went after him, and told the watchman, who took him.





JAMES SWINGLAND
. I am the watchman. Barnes pointed out the prisoner to me—I took him, and found the jacket on him, and the handkerchief were between a pile of wood which was in a direct line from the shed to where I took the prisoner—he worked at the Dock occasionally.

Prisoner's Defence. I had a job to move some things for a sailor—I got them to the gate, and the sailor asked me to go back and get the jacket, if I had intended to steal it, I could have gone another way.





CHARLES M'CARTHY
. I did not give him my jacket.

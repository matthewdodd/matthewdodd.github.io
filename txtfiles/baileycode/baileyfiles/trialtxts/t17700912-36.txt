. On the 30th of March
, between the hours of nine and ten, when the family were all out, my house was robbed. I came home about eleven, when I missed the things mentioned in the indictment. There was a small pane of glass broke in the casement, through which the windows had been opened.

             the evidence, and said it was his property, and that he wanted more money upon it. Simpson wanted me to buy it. (The hat produced, and deposed to by the prosecutor.)

            . ( the accomplice.) The prisoner and I were at the prosecutor's house. The prisoner staid at the door whilst I got in at the window, and took the things mentioned in the indictment. I heard the prisoner at the door whilst I was in the house, but he was gone when I came out. I met him next day. The prisoner told me that a man came whilst he was at the door and frighted him away.
The prisoner in his defence said, that he was out that evening with the evidence; but that he left him before the robbery.
Acquitted of the burglary.

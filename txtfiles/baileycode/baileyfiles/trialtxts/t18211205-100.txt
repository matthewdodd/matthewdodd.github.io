            . I am a labourer. I was looking out of window, on the 28th of October, between ten and eleven o'clock, in the morning, and saw the prisoner, looking out at the garden door of Mr. Bound's house. I thought he had no business there. I saw another standing behind the water-closet, he came to him, and both went into the house, In two minutes, they both came to the door, the other man got on the area wall, and the prisoner handed the lead up to him, (it was an unfinished house,) he was going into the next house with it, but on seeing me, he threw it into the area of the next house; I took him.

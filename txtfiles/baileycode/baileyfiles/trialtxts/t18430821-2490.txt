SARAH HANNAH
. I am the wife of Robert Hannah; we live in Wellington-place, Back-road. On the 5th of August I went into the front parlour to open my shutters—there was a new blue cloth cap on the table, and soon after it was gone.





GEORGE GALLIERS
. I live in Wellington-street. I saw two boys standing by the prosecutor's window—one was lae, and had a crutch—that was John Donovan the elder—he went inside the door, and appeared to be listening—he then came out and spoke to his companion, who was a smaller boy—the smaller one then went in, and came out with a blue cap in his hand—Donovan, junior, is about the size of the smaller boy, but I cannot swear to him.

Donovan, sen. He only saw me looking in at the window.





ROBERT BOARD

GEORGE FREDERICK BENNETT
. I am in the service of John Clark and another, at Bankside. This rope (looking at it) is theirs—I saw the prisoner nnwreatbing it from the rings of two barges which laid at Victoria-wharf, adjoining Southwark-bridge, on the Thames—he coiled it round the barge Robert and walked up the plank with it to the Rose and Bell public-house—I said, "That is our rope"—he said, "It is my own," and walked off with it.





AMELIA COPE
. I am the wife of-Charles Cope, of Gravel-lane. On Saturday evening the 27th Jan. the prisoner brought this rope to me for sale, and I bought it of him.





WILLIAM WEED
. I am in the service of Messrs. Clark and Wells—I know the prisoner by working on the river—I know this rope is my masters' property—I

missed it from the craft at a quarter before six o'clock on Saturday evening, the 27th Jan.

Prisoner. Q. Can you swear to it? A. Yes, from the whipping of it in two places, where it had been worn.





JAMES WILLIAM GRIFFIN
 (Thames police-inspector.) I took the prisoner—I told him what for—he said he had not been there at all that evening—I found the rope at Cope's.





AUSTIN EDWARD GANN
 (Thames police-constable.)—I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I—(read)—the prisoner is the person.

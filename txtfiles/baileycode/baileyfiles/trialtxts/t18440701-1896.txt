JANE MARIA LUKER
. I am the wife of Richard Luker, and live in Acre-lane, Clapham—I am employed by Mary Ann Thomlinson, a laundress, to wash. On the morning of the 26th of June, between eleven and twelve o'clock, I hung a linen shirt in the drying-ground, and saw some handkerchiefs hanging

out—these are them—I afterwards saw the prisoner passing the cottage, where these things were.

Prisoner. Q. Had I the same clothes on that I have now? A. Yes, I believe you had.





MARY ANN THOMLINSON
. I am a widow, and am a laundress—I live in Crescent-lane, Clapham. This shirt is Mr. John Alwood's, and these handkerchiefs are Mr. James Lee's—they were all sent to me to wash.





SAMUEL EASTMOND
 (police-constable V 182.) About a quarter before two o'clock, on Wednesday, the 26th of June, I saw the prisoner in Clapham-road—in consequence of something, I went towards him—he ran away—I saw his left hand pocket looked bulky—I pursued him, and several gentlemen assisted me in taking him—he struggled very violently—these handkerchiefs were in his coat pocket, and the shirt in his hat—he was asked how he accounted for the shirt—he said it was his own.

Prisoner's Defence. 1 was in a public-house just before the policeman took me; a man offered me the shirt and handkerchiefs for sale, I gave him 4s. for them.




GUILTY
** Aged 24.—


Transported for Seven Years.

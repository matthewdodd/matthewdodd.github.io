            . I am book-keeper at the Castle and Falcon, Aldersgate-street. On the 31st of January, Mr.

            's waggon came to the inn; the prisoner came as a passenger in it; the next morning I saw her in the tap room with the waggoner, and observed she had got a very handsome large pair of ruffles on; the rest of her dress was just as it is now *; the waggoner and she drank together in the tap house, and she went away the same day about two o'clock; she came back again dressed like a lady, in a very fine negligee, and several other things very unaccountable for a woman that made the appearance she did when she went out; upon her return she enquired for the waggoner where he was; she was informed he was gone to lie down; she ran up stairs into his room; in about two or three minutes they both came down and had some liquor. A box of Mrs. Adderley's had been broke open; there were three boxes in the whole; I am certain those boxes that came by the waggon were put into the warehouse.
* Very shabby.

            . I am a servant to Mrs. Adderley: I packed up the things in a box in Warwickshire; my mistress informed me the boxes should go by the next day to the waggon; I set out the day before in a coach to London; I brought the key of these boxes in my pocket. I had received information that a box was broke open, and was advised to go to Sir 
               
                  John

            's; I went there; the box and things were there, and also the other things which have been produced, which I know to be the property of Mrs. Glascott, as well as I know the rest of the things to be the property of her mistress Mrs. Adderley.

            . I live at Islington; the prisoner lived with me about five weeks as a servant; she left me a year and a half ago; upon the first of January she came dressed very fine to my house, the said an aunt had left her the things produced. The things were taken from her at my house by the waggoner, on the 4th of February, and sent to Sir 
               
                  John
                   Fielding
               



            ; the waggoner all along insisted upon it she was the person that stole these things, she denied it.

            . I am a pawnbroker; the prisoner came to my house on the first of February, and brought a silk and stuff gown; I lent her 6 s. upon it; she said it was her own property.

            . I keep the Bunn-house at Islington: upon the first of February the prisoner came dressed very fine with the silk sack on; she had likewise a black silk bonnet and laced ruffles; she said they were left her by an aunt; that she came honestly by them. The waggoner was ordered by her to call at the house; she said Mr. Goddard was to pay for her passage up; he did call and met her there, and accused her of stealing these things; she denied it, and said they were her own property, and that she had had them some time, and always said she had never taken any thing that belonged to him or was in his waggon: the waggoner insisted upon it these things should be further enquired about; they were all taken together and carried to Sir

Prisoner's Defence.
The waggoner gave them to me; the waggoner and I were school-fellows, and intimate from our childhood; he prevailed upon me to come up to London with him; he said he would take me up and down again; he gave me the things out of the waggon.

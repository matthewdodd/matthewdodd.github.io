            . I am a Police-officer. I was on duty at half-past one o'clock in the morning, on the 19th of June, in Cavendish-square


, two doors off Sir George Tuthill's house, and I saw the prisoner jump over his area rails, out of the area - he ran across the square; I followed and stopped him; I saw something under his coat, and asked what it was - he made no answer; I found a piece of cheese there - I brought him back, and my serjeant got over the area rails and took up a bundle - I heard a rattling in his hat; I took it off, and found six eggs in it - the bundle contained the leg of mutton, the bacon, and the plate.

             Tuthill's, Knt. We missed all the articles of provision out of the larder, and this plate from the safe in the area.
Prisoner's Defence. I did not jump over the rails; there is a house next to it goes up two or three steps - I stood there for shelter from the rain.

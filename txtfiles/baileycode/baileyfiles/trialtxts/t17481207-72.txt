            . I lost those things mentioned in the indictment. I do not know the day of the month I lost them, it was about a month ago. I lost them out of my chamber. I keep a house, and I took the prisoner in as a lodger.
Q. Have you found any of your goods again?
Mackdogal. I have found nothing but my hat upon her head. I met her two or three days after I mist them, at Story's gate, and took her up, and had her before Justice Manley; and she confessed there before him, that she took my things and sold them in Monmouth street and Rag fair.

LEWIS SOLOMONS
. I am in the service of Abraham Davies, who keeps a glass and china shop in High-street, Bloomsbury. On Sunday morning, the 27th of December, between nine and ten o'clock, I saw a man at the bottom of the shop, walking out at the private entrance—I went and stopped him before he got into the street—it was the prisoner, and he had these three cruet-stands on him which are my master's.

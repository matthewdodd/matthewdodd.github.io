            . I am a gentleman's servant. On the 23d of February, I was walking along Bridge-street


, at twenty minutes past nine o'clock in the evening; and going towards Fleet-market, I saw the prisoner walking behind Mr. Good, who was in company with another gentleman and a lady. The prisoner put his right hand into Mr. Good's coat pocket, drew the handkerchief out, and ran off. I told Mr. Good; we pursued him; he ran into the watchman's arms. I am certain he is the man; he threw it down as he ran - I never lost sight of him; a boy picked it up.

            . I was walking in Bridge-street. Fox said I was robbed, and I felt, and missed my handkerchief. I pursued the prisoner; I lost sight of him on turning the corner, but nobody else was in the street. The handkerchief was picked up and given to me.

SAIK ALLI
 (through an interpreter.) I was in a public-house, and two or three men were ill-using me, and going to beat me—I came out to call the watchman—I and my shipmate stood together talking—the prisoner came by and took my handkerchief out of my pocket—I directly took hold of his hand, and gave him in charge, and found the handkerchief in his hand.





JOHN FLENHAM
 (police-constable K 18.) On the 29th of August, between eleven and twelve o'clock at night, the prosecutor came to me and made signs that somebody had ill-used and struck him—I went with him to the public-house; and I was called over the way by a man who bad been ill-using a female; and while I was there the prosecutor came over with the prisoner in one hand and his handkerchief in the other—I said to the prisoner, "How came you to do this, my man?"—he said, "Oh, he did not see me do it"—I took him to the station-house.
(Property produced and sworn to.)





JOHN WAKEFIELD
 (police-constable N 4.) I have a certificate of the prisoner's conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—I was present on the 6th of April, when the prisoner was tried (read.)—I am sure he is the boy.

Prisoner's Defence. I was on the other side of the way—he came and caught hold of me, and said he took it out of my hand"—It is all false.

JAMES FAULCHAM
 was indicted

 for stealing 6 half-crowns, and 1 shilling, the monies of 



John Collins, from the person of 



Ann Collins.







ANN COLLINS
. I am the wife of John Collins—he is a drum-major in to Royal Artillery. About five or six o'clock in the evening of the 17th of April I was on Blackfriars-bridge, looking at some tumbling—I had six half-crowns and a shilling in my pocket, which was in front of me—I saw a boy near me, in a fustian dress, and I felt his hand in my pocket—I missed my money—he then went to the prisoner, who was about two yards off, and gave something into his hand, which he put into his right-hand pocket—the boy ran away, and I called out that he had picked my pocket—I charged the prisoner with being one of them, and I took hold of his coat—he got off, and was taken by the officer—I saw him throw some, money away.

Cross-examined by
MR. HORRY. Q. Was there a crowd about, looking at this tumbling? A. Yes—I had my little niece with me—the boy had not to make his way through the crowd—he ran away as soon as I called out—there were no persons between him and me—there was no policeman at hand—I held the prisoner some time, but he offered to break away.





JOHN RALEY
. I heard Mrs. Collins cry out, and I saw the prisoner take some half-crowns from his pocket and throw them away.

Cross-examined. Q. Where was he? A. In Chatham-place—I was close by the side of Mrs. Collins—I did not take hold of the prisoner, because I had a child in my arms—one of the half-crowns fell on my arm.





DANIEL COCKRILL
 (City police-constable, No. 314.) I took the prisoner—I have three half-crowns, which were picked up by the people about.

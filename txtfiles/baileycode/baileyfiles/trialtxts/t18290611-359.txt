             the elder.
ROBERT PICKRELL. I am a bricklayer. The prisoner was employed by me at Mr. Sex's; I sent 60 or 70 lbs. of copper to his hay-loft, and saw it there; I was sent to look for it, and missed it - I believe this to be part of it.
Cross-examined by MR. DOWLING. Q. At the examination you said you could not swear to the copper? A. No; there is no mark on it.

             LAWRENCE. I live with Mr. Stanley, a metal dealer. I bought about 11lbs. of this copper of the prisoner, on the 6th of June; he came alone, and said he came from No. 9, Field-lane, and his name was Curton.
Cross-examined. Q. Did you not say at Guildhall that Crawley sold all but one piece? A. No; Nowland sold more than he did: I know nothing of the prisoner but by his selling copper at our shop.

             depos'd, that being a Stranger in London, he met three Men, and enquired the Way to Lothberry: They told him they were going thither, and would shew him. They went into a bye Alley, where they stopt to play at a Game that they call'd Prick at the Garter, and asked him (the Prosecutor) to play with them. He told them he did not understand it. Phoo! says one of them, that signifies nothing, I understand it better than either of them. - I'll go your Halves for Half a Crown, and I'll engage you shan't lose. He (the Prosecutor) then took out a Guinea, which one of them snatch'd from him, and gave to one of the other, and bid him hold Stakes. The Prisoner then collar'd the Prosecutor, and swore that he ow'd him a Shilling; and while they two were quarrelling, the two others ran away. The Prisoner in his Defence said, that coming by where the Prosecutor and two more were at play, they invited him to make 24th Man; that he knew nothing of the Guinea; but having won a Shilling of the Prosecutor, he desired him to pay him; which the Prosecutor not only refused, but raised a Mob, and charged him with the Robbery.

            . I am a dry salter
. On the 21st of December, between one and two o'clock, I was in Aldersgate-street


. I felt in my pocket, and missed my handkerchief; I turned round, and saw the prisoner pushing something up his back under his coat. I went aside, let him pass, and seeing a lump between his shoulders, I took hold of him, and found my handkerchief up his back, which was safe just before.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I was running to get to work, four or five boys were before me; one of them turned back, and threw the handkerchief on my shoulder. I was putting it into my pocket when the gentleman laid hold of me.

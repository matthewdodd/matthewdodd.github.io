 last Thursday about three o'clock, I felt something at my pocket; I put my hand in my pocket, and missed my handkerchief; I looked round and saw the prisoner drop it; I immediately secured him.

I was looking at the kings and queens on the 'Change, and the gentleman laid hold of me, and said I picked his pocket; just as I came to the gentleman two boys ran away.

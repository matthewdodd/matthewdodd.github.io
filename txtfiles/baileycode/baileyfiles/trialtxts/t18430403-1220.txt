JOHN PAINE
, was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
10th of March, 1 handkerchief, value 4s., the goods of 



James Croft; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






JAMES CROFT
. I live in Ranelagh-place, Pimlico. My handkerchief hung out on a line to dry on the 10th of March, about half-past ten o'clock in the morning—it was missed about twelve in the day—this is it.





JAMES INMAN
. I am a watchman. On the 10th of March there was a cry of "Stop thief," and the prisoner was running—he got through the bar I keep, and I followed him—as he ran down Eaton-square this handkerchief dropped from his person—I picked it up—he still ran till he crossed the Queen's-road again, and I got him there—I am sure he is the boy that dropped it.

Prisoner's Defence. I was standing just by the Queen's mews, somebody ran and dropped a handkerchief; I picked it up, and put it into my pocket; they still ran after this man, and as I came back a greengrocer's boy said, This one picked it up."





JAMES LIGHT

GUILTY

Transported for Seven Years.

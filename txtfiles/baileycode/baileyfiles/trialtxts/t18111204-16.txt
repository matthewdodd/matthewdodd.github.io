                  PETER 
                  STEWARD
               



            . Q. Had you the care and superintendance of a house in St. Giles's


, in November last. - A. I had. It was an empty house. I received the rent of the house while it was tenanted and paid the rent to 
               
                  Mary 
                  Scotland
               



            . I received it as executor for the family, and 
               
                  Mary 
                  Scotland
               



             as an executrix with me of her deceased husband, he received the rent in his life time, it is a leasehold house. I had suspicion of the house being robbed on the 17th of November, between eight and nine at night. I, Mr. Salmon, and other officers went to this house, we went up stairs, at the second pair of stairs Mr. Salmon called to the people to come along, they came up stairs, and immediately after I presume the prisoners came down stairs, they are differently dressed now to what they were then.
Q. You cannot swear to either of the prisoners. - A. No. They were immediately handcuffed. Mr. Salmon asked them what they had been doing there, one of them said they have been throwing my hat into the room, and I was obliged to come in after it; they were handcuffed and left with the people below. I went up to the third pair of stairs, the back gutter of the house was entirely taken out, it laid in the room at full length, it was not cut at all. The front gutter had been carried away the night before.
- SALMON. I am an officer of Bow Street, on Sunday the 17th of November I went on this search, I took Mentz and Godfrey in the house and three other Patrols of Bow Street. I went up stairs with Mr. Steward, Mentz and Godfrey, it was about a quarter past eight, it was quite dark, we took a candle, the street door was locked, and opened by the prosecutor to let us in. I entered the lower part of the house, I found the cellar flap tore up in the back yard, it appeared that they got into the house that way, we went up two pair of stairs before we discovered any body, while I was standing upon the second floor landing, I thought I heard a footstep above me. I said to Mentz here is somebody in the house, look out, go up stairs, I was going up with the candle in my hand, I met Rees coming down, I immediately laid hold of him and gave him into the custody of Mentz. I was going up stairs, I met Turner coming down, I laid hold of him and gave him into the custody of Mentz and Godfrey, they were handcuffed immediately, I found no other persons there. In the back garret I found a large piece of gutter lead, it appeared whole, that lead was stripped from one end of the gutter to the other, it was completely taken up, and by the damp and wet on the gutter it appeared to me that the lead been recently taken up. This chissell I found upon the parapet wall opposite the window.

                  MENTZ
               



            . I was with Salmon, I saw this gutter and saw the lead.
Q. Could you form any observation you made, to say where the leaden gutter was taken from. - A. I should suppose it was taken from the back garret window. I found two holdfasts that night, which had held the lead to the wall, and four the next morning on the parapet wall. I searched the prisoners, on 
               Rees
             I found two knives.
Mr. Arabin. Q. Did you compare the lead you found in the room to the place from where you say the lead was taken. - A. No. I supposed that was the lead by being there.
The prisoners left their defence to their counsel, and called no witnesses to character.

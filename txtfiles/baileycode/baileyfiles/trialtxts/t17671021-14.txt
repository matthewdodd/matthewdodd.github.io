            , in Newgate-street. On the 19th of September, we had loaded our cart with cheese, and what we had to go out, and behind were three tubs of Irish butter as a fence; as I was standing at our door, when the cart was near the end of Ivy-lane


, I saw the prisoner jump up into the cart, and lean over the tubs, and take up a cheese and rest it on the butter, then put it behind and jump down and take it away; then I thought it time to set out; I overtook him near Gray-friars-gateway; he followed the cart, but went on the other side of the way; I asked him what he was going to do with it; he said he was going to carry it to the cart; he had taken it from his head, and going to put it into his apron; I secured him; when before my Lord-Mayor, he said the carman bid him get up into the cart; when he was asked if he knew him, he said he never knew him or saw him before.
Prisoner's defence.
It fell out of the cart, and I took it up.

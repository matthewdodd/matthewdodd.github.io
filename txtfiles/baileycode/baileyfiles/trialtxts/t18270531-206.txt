JOHN SWEET. I am a harness-dealer
 and live in Islington. On the 27th of April, at half-past eleven o'clock at night, I was in the City-road


 - the prisoner came and held back my right hand, another held my left hand, while a third took from my inside coat pockets, my snuff-box, pocket-book, and handkerchiefs; as soon as the prisoner let go of my arm I seized him, and held him till the watchman came up. I have not found my property - I was perfectly sober.

            . I am a watchman of Islington. I saw the prisoner and prosecutor tussling - the prosecutor gave him in charge. I saw nobody else near - the prisoner said, as we went to the watch-house."It was not me who robbed him; but I know who it was."

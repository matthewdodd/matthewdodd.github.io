Q. You do not know that they all went at one time, you have no circumstance to prove that-what are they worth? - A. Ten pounds.
- MATTHEWS sworn. - I am a pawnbroker, I live in the Minories; I produce eight decanters pledged by the prisoner, I am sure he is the person. (The decanters identified by the prosecutor.)
Prisoner's defence. These decanters I bought of a young man; I finished cutting them, and when I had finished them all, I pledged them to get some money, not being able to get a person to buy them.
The prisoner called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.

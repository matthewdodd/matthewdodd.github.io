GAYNAM RACKSTRAW. On the 14th of November, about half-past six o'clock in the evening. I was in Fleet-street


, and felt a hand in my pocket, I turned round, saw my handkerchief in the prisoner's hand, and collared him. Perry came and took him.

            . I am an officer. I was on Ludgate-hill on the 14th of November, and followed a party of men whom I knew - I followed two of them up to Bouverie-street after a gentleman. I went on till I came opposite Fetter-lane, where there was a bustle with the coachmen; I crossed over, and saw the prosecutor inquiring for an officer. He gave the prisoner in charge.

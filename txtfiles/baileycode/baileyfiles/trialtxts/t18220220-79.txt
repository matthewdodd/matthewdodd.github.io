            , of Newgate-market


, a poultry salesman
. On the 24th of January, between 6 and 7 o'clock in the morning, I was set to watch, in consequence of suspicion, and saw the prisoners pass the shop together; they came by again, and Marrs took two ducks, and put them under his coat - they were both close together, and walked off. I collared them both at once and saw Marr drop them.

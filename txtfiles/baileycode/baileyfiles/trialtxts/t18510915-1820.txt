WILLIAM BROOKS



, stealing 1 bridle, 1 wanty, and other harness, value 10s.; the goods of 



William Gidney.






WILLIAM GIDNEY
. I live at New Wanstead. On 1st Sept., about 5 o'clock in the afternoon, I missed a bridle, reins, and a belly-wanty—I applied to sergeant Stacey, and afterwards missed a back leather, another pair of reins, and another bridle—next morning a constable showed me my harness—this is it (produced).





EDWARD ARMITAGE
. On 1st Sept., about 2 o'clock, I was on duty at Layton, about a mile and a half from New Wanstead, and saw the prisoners coming towards London—Brooks was carrying a sack—I stopped him, and asked him what it contained—he said it was leather—I looked into the sack, and found this belly-wanty, bridle, reins, and crouper—Harwood went away—a man held Brooks, while I pursued Harwood, and brought him back—Brooks then said they were going to take it to Shoreditch, to a harnessmaker, to get mended, for a man at Woodford—I took them to the station—on the way they said they found it.





JOHN WOOD
. On Saturday evening, 30th Aug., the prisoners came to me, and asked if I would purchase an old ragged coat and a broken bridle, for 2s.—I told them I could only give 1s., and they took it—I gave the articles to Armitage on the Monday week following.





WILLIAM GIDNEY

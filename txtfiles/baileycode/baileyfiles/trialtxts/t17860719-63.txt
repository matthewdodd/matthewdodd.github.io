             sworn.
I am a labouring man
; I live in West's-gardens, in St. Paul Shadwell


, near the Highway; on Thursday the 13th of July, in the morning I lost the things mentioned in the indictment, and I found the clasp knife on the prisoner White who cut us with it in his defence. (Produces the things.) Between four and five in the morning the child cried and disturbed my wife, who was also in bed on the ground room, fronting the street; the shutters were open; my wife called me; I got up and seized a man in the room; he made towards the window; that was the prisoner 
               
                  John
                   Lloyde
               



            ; he had a black coat on; I never saw him before; there was light enough to see any body; I am sure Lloyde was the man; when he went out at the window, and he went directly to the wall, he crawled to the wall; I looked out of the window and asked him what business he had there, he turned about and said, Sir, I have done you no harm, and he returned for his shoes that laid under my window, then I got hold of him by the collar, and tore off the collar of his coat; here it is; he made his escape by the collar coming off; then I followed, knowing, that there were a set of people of that sort, that use Cable-street; there was no other person there but the prisoner; the things were all gone, when I got up in the morning, I had not a stitch to put on, not my wife neither; I did not see that Lloyde had any thing about him; he had a great brown surtout coat on.
If he had had any thing under his coat they would have dropped under the window? - I should think so; I did not observe he had any thing about him; I went to the Sun and Sword about half after five, and saw the prisoner Lloyde again with the other prisoner White, and the two women; that is about three quarters of a mile from my house; I knew Lloyde when he passed by, by his dress and face, he had the same great coat on that he had at the house; I got assistance; and Levi and me took him to the watch house, he had nothing of my property about him; then I charged White upon suspicion to Levi, he took him into custody, about two hours after Lloyde was committed, I was present; then White pulled out a pen-knife out of his pocket, he began cutting Levi across the arm with it; he gave me two cuts across the arm with it, then I said several times directly, that is my knife; the knife was not taken from him; then Aaron Levi, the nephew of the other Levi came up to his assistance, and he stabbed him in the back; I saw him, he resisted a great while; I came up myself and he cut me five or six times across my hand; my hand is not well yet; some of the mob cried, cut away, cut away, knock him down; I let him go, he pursued 
               
                  Aaron
                   Levi
               



             with a naked knife; he attempted to stab me several times in the body; I caught the knife out of his hand as he was attempting to throw it down a cellar; I said, it was my knife. (Produced, and deposed to by the prosecutor.) It is worn hollow in the middle of the blade, and the horn of the handle is parted with two strips of iron; it was a seaman's knife when I bought it; I am sure it is mine. (Shewn to the Jury, being bloody.) I saw it between ten and eleven at supper, I wiped it and put it into my pocket; that is the waistcoat I lost; I put it in the box by my bed side; I never saw the waistcoat since.
Have you any reason to suppose from the observation you made, that there was more than one man in your room that night? - No.
Had you slept from half past three, to half past four? - Yes, I was not awake till my child cried; at the time I looked out, I saw no person but the prisoner Lloyde.

            ; a little before the watch went half past three I got up and unfastened the shutters, and put out the rush-light as it was day-light; I was more than once or twice up with the child to give her drink and other things; the child cried for its chair; I was between sleep and awake, and I heard a great noise in the room, and I awaked my husband, and I saw Lloyde in the room; I saw no other person; I never saw him before.
Could you see his face? - I saw his head, his short hair, and his brown coat; the things in the indictment were missing, they were my husband's property; the green tea was in the middle pocket of the frock, and the handkerchief was in one of the pockets, the muslin handkerchief and cap was laying on the same box, the clasp knife was in the right hand waistcoat pocket, and the halfpence were in the pocket, and the two shillings.

I am a patrol on Epping-forest; we have been up at London this fortnight; on the 13th I was at the Horse and Leaping-bar door in Whitechapel, I was sent for and went to the Sun and Sword, near Saltpetre-bank, and I took this prisoner White; it was just before six; the prosecutor had hold of the prisoner Lloyde; Lloyde had on a brown coat and white cape; he desired me to take him to the watch house; he said, Lloyde had stolen into his house, and he caught him and tore off the cape of his coat and brought it up with the prisoner to the watch house, and he began to cry very much, and said, I never robbed any body before, but I have been forced to this.
You had some conversation with him? - Yes.
Have not you told him, that it would be better for him to confess? - Not a word of that kind, I am very sure of it; I was not in the watch-house; I went down again, and took 
               
                  Ann
                   Powell
               



            ; it was near nine, I did not know her; I took hold of White; I was knocked down, says White, you bloody thief, I will not go with you; I had hold of Powell then; I took hold of White, he put his hand into his right hand waistcoat pocket and took out a knife which was shut, he half opened it, and put it against his knee and opened it quite, says he, I will cut your liver out; and these two cuts he gave me over the arm; I laid on the ground, and the prisoner White, cried out cut away; says the prosecutor that is my knife which he is cutting with; I had much ado to keep Powell with me; he cut me twice; afterwards we went to apprehend Thompson, and there was a padlock on the out-side, as if nobody was at home, but she was in bed with her clothes on; we took them before a magistrate, and White said, on the first examination, he found the knife at the top of New Gravel-lane; I saw White make several cuts at Mr. Ives, after he cut me; he stabbed my nephew first; I saw him cut him in the back; the knife was not sharp pointed; at the magistrate's he said, he was very sorry he had not killed every one of us; I found no property on the prisoner.

            ; we told her she must go with us; we asked her for the key of her lodging; she said she had the key with her; we went there, but there was nothing found there, or upon her; going along the prosecutor gave charge of White; we went to catch hold of him; we said he must go with us; and while we were talking he out with a knife; as I caught hold of him I saw him begin to cut; he cut

               NOT GUILTY
            .
Court. Prisoners, you have both been charged with a very bad offence, namely that of stealing, and that in the night-time, the property of 
               
                  Joseph
                   Ives
               



            ; and under circumstances of particular aggravation. The case of 
               
                  John
                   White
               



             is of such sort, that it is necessary to distinguish it by the punishment; and therefore it is that I think it necessary to pass immediate sentence upon both of you; as for 
               
                  John
                   Lloyde
               



             it is necessary, and the Court think proper, that he should be transported for seven years to such part as his Majesty, by the advice of his privy counsel, shall think fit to appoint; and as for you 
               
                  John
                   White
               



            , you have been guilty of an offence of this sort; aggravated as it was, you have added greatly to that aggravation by attempting to keep yourself from the hands of Justice in the manner you have done; the offence was certainly a very bad one, and when persons attempt to support such conduct by attacking those whose duty it is to bring them to justice, and by attempting the life of those people that come to apprehend them, it is peculiarly necessary they should be made examples of; in this case it is not owing to you, but rather to the hand of Providence, that the lives of these persons were saved; the sentence therefore is, that you be transported for seven years to Africa

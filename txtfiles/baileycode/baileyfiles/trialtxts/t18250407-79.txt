WILLIAM BARTHOLOMEW. I am a rug manufacturer
 - and live in Brown's-lane, Spitalfields - the prisoner was in my employ between two and three years. On Saturday last I sent him out with some goods, about six o'clock in the evening. This hearth-rug is mine, but I cannot tell when it was on my premises, as I have many there.

            . I am a pawnbroker. This rug was offered in pawn on Saturday evening last by the prisoner, about half-past eight o'clock; he said it was his father's.
One witness gave the prisoner an excellent character.

                  Q. 
               


            ( to Mr. Mills ) What is your Business ?
Mills. I keep a Linnen-draper's and Slop-Shop .
Q. Do you sell Stockings ?
Mills. Yes.
Q. Where is your House, Sir ?
Mills. On Tower-hill, my Lord .
Q. Did you, at any Time, lose any Stockings out of your Shop?
Mills. Yes, my Lord.
Q. Are they here in Court?
Mills. Yes; the Evidence has had them ever since the Prisoner was taken up.
Q. Have you any Thing to say of the Prisoner's taking them, of your own Knowledge?
Mills. The Week before he was taken, I saw a Lad take a Bundle of Stockings: He had got a loose Great-Coat on; when we catch'd hold of him, he flipt his Coat. I had a Suspicion after that.

Paris. I was sitting, looking out of my Window ; I saw this Boy, the Prisoner at the Bar, reaching over the Hatch of the Gentleman's Shop, between Three and Four o'Clock in the Afternoon, on the 14th of February; I saw the Boy come away with the Bundle of Stockings; I stept to the Door, as fast as I could (for I was lame;) by that Time he was got even with me; you Rascal, says I, you have robb'd the Gentleman's Shop. I cry'd, Stop Thief! and he was immediately taken and carried before the Justice.

The Prisoner had little to say in his own Defence.

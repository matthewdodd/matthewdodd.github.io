GEORGE CARTE WILLIAMSON
. I am a gentleman. Last Friday evening I was walking in Tottenham-court-road—I perceived a person behind me—I turned and saw the prisoner, he had his hand in my pocket, and took out my handkerchief—he ran—I called the officer, who took hold of his coat, but he fell down—I still continued to follow, and another officer came, and took him—he had continued to hold my handkerchief till he saw the second policeman—he then threw it down—when I went to look for it, it was gone.





JAMES HALL
 (police-constable F 101.) I took the prisoner.

Prisoner's Defence. I was walking by this gentleman, and a boy stole his handkerchief—I was running after the boy, and he said it was me.

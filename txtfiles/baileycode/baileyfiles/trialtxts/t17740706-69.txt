            . I hired the prisoner as a servant
 on the 2d of June; she was missing on the 11th, and then we found the things mentioned in the indictment wanting. On the Monday following I met with her in Holborn; I insisted upon her going home with me; she had on one of the aprons; the table spoon she had in her pocket; the rest of the things she said she had pawned.
The prisoner, in her defence, said her master lent her the things.

I am a waterman
 at Wapping Old Stairs


, I have sculls; the number of my boat is 6694: I went over the water with a message on the 14th of August, and when I returned it was gone; I found it in the middle of the Thames, and the prisoner rowing away with her: the prisoner is no waterman; my name was in her.

             sworn.
I am a waterman and lighterman, I stopped the prisoner in the boat the 14th of August; I passed him, and I thought I knew the boat; seeing him handling the sculls not like a waterman, I rowed after him; he said, damn you, what have you to do with it, the man lent her to me; I took hold and made the boat fast to mine, and I pulled, and he tried to get on the cables of the ships, and I pulled him on shoe at Wapping Old Stairs. The prosecutor came and claimed the boat.
Prisoner. My witness is at sea.

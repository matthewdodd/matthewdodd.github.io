            . The prisoner own'd to me before she was brought to Guild-hall, and there too, that she took my pair of stays out of my drawer, and pawn'd them for 3 s. at the three blue-balls in Golden-lane, the man's name is Pain, I had the house search'd; but could not find them, and the man would not own they were there.
Q. Have you ever had them again?
E. Ball. No, my lord.

            . I am Mrs. Ball's landlord, I heard the prisoner own she had stole the stays, and had pawn'd them with Pain in Golden lane; I went there first by the prisoner's directions, and she denied them and desired us to bring the prisoner, but she was taken to the Compter; we got a search warrant, and searched the house, but could not find them.
The prisoner had nothing to say for herself.

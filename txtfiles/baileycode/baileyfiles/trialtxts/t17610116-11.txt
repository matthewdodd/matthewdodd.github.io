            . On the 24th of December, I went out about seven in the morning, and left my servant 
               
                  Joshua 
                  Bowden 
               



            , putting the meat out. (I am a butcher
.) I returned home at nine o'clock at night; then he told me he had stopped a thief.

            . About seven in the morning I laid the beef out on the stall at the door. The prisoner came and took away 23 pounds of beef. I saw him drop it, when he got about 2 yards with it: he took it up again, and was going off with it; and I pursued, and took him by the collar, and brought him to the shop, and charged a constable with him.
Q. What did he say for himself?
Bowden. He acknowledged he took it, and offered to pay me for it, when I took him.
Prisoner's Defence.
I know nothing at all of it.

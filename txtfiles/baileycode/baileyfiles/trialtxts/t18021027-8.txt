Q. Did you see him take them? - A. No.
Q. Did you see him do any thing near the window? - A. He stood with his back towards the window; I saw the costable take the shoes fromhis pocket; they have my mark upon them, besides my own workmanship; I know them to be my shoes.
Q. Would you give 5s. for them? - A. Yes.(

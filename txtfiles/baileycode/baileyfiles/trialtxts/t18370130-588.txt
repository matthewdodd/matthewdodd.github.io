JOHN COVENTRY
 was indicted

 for embezzlement.






WILLIAM HOUSE
. I am servant to Mr. William Phillips. The prisoner was his carter—I sent him with a ££5 note to change to pay the labourers—he never brought it to me—he went away, and I heard him say, after he was taken, that he changed it, and wrapped four sovereigns in a bit of paper, and put it into his pocket, as he thought, but he was not certain whether he put it in, or on one side; that he then went to a shoemaker's shop for a pair of shoes, and on returning home he felt, and the four sovereigns were gone, that he was then ashamed to return home, and went off with the rest.

Prisoner. It was so, and I was ashamed to go back.





JAMES CLARK
. The prisoner came to my house, between nine and ten o'clock, and asked me to give him change, which I did for a£5 note, No. 3901.—I gave him four sovereigns and one pound in silver.




GUILTY
. Aged 26.—


Transported for Seven Years.

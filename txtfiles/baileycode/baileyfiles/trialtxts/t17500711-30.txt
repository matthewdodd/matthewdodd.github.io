            . I had been to see an acquaintance on the 11th of June, on my return in Stepney fields


 I was attacked by four persons about eleven o'clock at night, one of them came up with a great stick and demanded my money. I said I had not much, he said he must have it; he searched my pocket and took out one shilling and four-pence; then they took my tobacco box, and a pair of gloves out of my pocket: Bailey took my hat from off my head, and handkerchief from out of my coat pocket; it was a fine moon-light night.
Q. Who took your money, box and gloves?
Smith. Frazier took them, my Lord. I saw them all four again about three hours after, I met them accidentally in East-Smithfield near the Maypole, I live there. After I was robb'd I went to the watch-house and inquired for the officer of the night, he was not there; these four watchmen went with me into the fields, we could not meet with them. When I was got near home I heard a talking, I thought it proper to meet them, this was about half an hour after two o'clock; I call'd out watch and thieves, they ran, Bailey ran to Cock-alley, he was taken with my hat on his head, and handkerchief about his neck; Frazier was taken two days after, I was sent for to see if I knew him, I knew him at first sight; he confessed the fact.

             I live pretty near the officer that took 
               
                  John 
                  Frazier 
               



            , I went along with him, he confessed the fact, owning he was in company with them in Stepney fields concerned in this robbery, but denied he took any thing from the prosecutor. And after that he owned, to the best of my knowledge, he took either a pair of gloves or a tobacco box.

            . The prisoner Bailey, when taken about three o'clock that morning, had the hat on his head, and handkerchief about his neck, which the prosecutor owned. They were produced in court, and the prosecutor deposed, that they were his property.

WILLIAM BROWN
 were indicted for

stealing, on the 
4th of December, 6 feet of lead pipe, value 3s.; 2 ball cocks, value 6s.; the goods of 



George Farmiloe, and fixed to certain buildings: and two knives, value 6s.; 2 forks, value 4s.; and 1 metal cock, value 1s.; the goods of 



Amelia Lovell. 2nd COUNT, stating them to be the goods of George Farmiloe, and not stating them to have been fixed.






GEORGE RICHARDSON
. I live in Lansdown-place, London-field, Hackney. On the 4th of December I was called to examine the premises, and I found the lead pipe had been cut from the water-butt—about four feet of pipe and the ball cock were taken away—they were the property of George Farmiloe, my landlord, and were fixed—I saw the pipe which the officer brought fitted to what was left, and I think there is not a doubt that it came from there.





SARAH HARRISON
. I am servant to Mrs. Amelia Lovell, of Lansdownplace. At half-past seven o'clock in the morning of the 4th of December I came down stairs—the water was running away, and the brass tap had been cut off—we missed two knives and forks and a beer-tap—the police-man brought the articles—they are Mrs. Lovell's.





ROBERT PAINE
 (police-constable N 247.) I was on duty on the 4th of December at half-past three o'clock in the morning, and met the prisoners about one hundred and fifty yards from the prosecutor's house—as soon as they saw me they turned and went back—I overtook them and asked what business they had there—they said they had been out drinking—I found this pipe on Williams, and these other things on Brown.

William's Defence. I kicked against a bundle—these things were in it—I gave my fellow-prisoner part of them.

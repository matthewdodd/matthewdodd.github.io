WILLIAM BRADSHAW
 was again indicted

for stealing 1 gelding, price 4l., the property of 



Edward Wood.


MR. DOANE
conducted the Prosecution.






EDWARD FRANCIS WOOD.
 My father's name is Edward—I am his foreman, and live with him, in Goswell-street. On the 24th of Dec. my father's horses were safe—next morning, Christmas-day, I missed a bay gelding—in consequence of information, I went to Mr. Geddings's slaughter-house, in Queen-street, and found the horse there alive—the prisoner had worked for my father a short time—he knew the premises.





WILLIAM NEWMAN.
 I am foreman to Mr. Gedding, a horse-slaughterer. On Christmas-day, a little after seven o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came to my master's—he brought a horse, and said he had brought his horse for sale—I did not know him before—he said he came from Lant-street, Borough, at the back of Brooks's—he told me the horse was worn out, and that it had fallen down the day before with a load of bricks, and could not do his work, and that it was a bad job he was obliged to sell it—I asked what he thought it was worth—he said 35s.—I gave him 27s. 6d., and half-a-crown for himself—it was a bay gelding, and is the one which has been identified by Wood.




GUILTY.† Aged 22.—


Transported for Seven Years.


Before Mr. Justice Erle.

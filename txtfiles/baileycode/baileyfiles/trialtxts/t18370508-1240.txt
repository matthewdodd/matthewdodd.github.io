NATHANIEL TARR
. I keep the Regent's Arms public-house, at York-terrace, Marylebone. At a quarter-past three o'clock in the afternoon of Sunday, the 23rd of April, a rap came to the door—I went—Martin had got the prisoner and these pewter pots—I sent for an officer, and another pint pot was found on him; and at the station-house another quart pot was found on him, beat up and flattened—the three are mine, but not the pint.





THOMAS MARTIN
. About a quarter-past three o'clock I was looking out of my window, and saw the prisoner take a pint and quart pot out of a staircase which goes up to the Mews—I ran out after him, and took him back with the two pots, which I had seen him take, and then two others were found on him.





FRANCIS THORNTON
. I am a policeman. I took the prisoner—this pint pot was found in his pocket, and this quart pot in his side-pocket, bent up.




GUILTY
.* Aged 19.—


Transported for Seven Years.

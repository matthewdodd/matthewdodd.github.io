JOHN HOLLAND
. I am a tailor, and lodge in Bruce-place, York-square. The prisoner lodged there about eight weeks, and slept in the same room—on the 7th of September I went out about six o'clock in the morning, leaving him in bed—I left some of these articles in a trunk, and some in the room—I returned at half-past nine o'clock at night—all my property was gone, and the prisoner was gone without notice—I was going along Oxford-street, on the 20th of September, and met him—I said, "You old robber, I have got you "—he said, "I don't know you"—I held him till the officer came up—my handkerchief was in his pocket, and my coat and trowsers were at the pawnbroker's.





WILLIAM CARTER
. I am a police-constable. I was called, and took the prisoner on this charge—I found this handkerchief on him.





THOMAS HUGHES
. I am a pawnbroker, and "live in Hampstead-road, I produce a coat and pair of trowsers which were pawned by the prisoner between twelve and two o'clock on the 7th of September.





SARAH DEARY
. The prisoner lodged with me, in the same room with Holland—he left on the 7th of September, and told me he had got an invitation to go to Enfield, and would return in a fortnight—he brought down his things in ten minutes after, and went out.

Prisoner. I throw myself entirely on the mercy of the Court.

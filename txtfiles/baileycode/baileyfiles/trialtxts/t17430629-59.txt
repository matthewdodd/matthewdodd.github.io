            . My Husband keeps a Publick-House in Beech-Lane


; last Tuesday the Prisoner was in the Drinking-Room where this Pot stood; I went up Stairs and left her there, and when I came down she was gone; the Gentleman to whom it was offered to sell brought it to me.


                  Mary 
                  Wilson 
               



            . Last Tuesday, between one and two in the Afternoon, the Prisoner brought this Pot to sell; my Husband stopped the Pot, and came in, and told me, he had got a Pot of Mr Crisp's; I said to the Prisoner I will go along with you to Mr Crisp's: No, says she, by G - you shall not; and gave me several Blows, and said, no, I will not go; I do not care a Pin for you; I would have detained her if I could, but she went out of the Shop.
Mr Wilson. The Prisoner brought this Pot to me to sell, whether she put it into the Scale, or whether I did, I cannot tell; I asked her whose it was, she said, she would go and fetch the Person that owned it; I told her, I must stop her, she gave me two or three Slaps, and tore my Shirt out of the Gathers; we followed her, and took her; when she got into London, she said, she did not value us; she abused us very much.
Prisoner. I had the Pot from a Person who came from Mr Crisp's House, and was so much in Liquor, that I could not tell what I did. 


               Guilty 10 d.

GEORGE NIGHTINGALE. I live in Leadenhall-street


. and rent the house - I am a carver and gilder
. On the 30th of April, about three o'clock in the afternoon, I was at home, and saw the prisoner very close at my window, drawing these eye-glasses out; my lad secured them on thespot - they had broken the window to get them out - it was secure before - they are worth 15s.; they threw them down on the pavement.
Prisoner GREEN. Q. Did you see me take them? A. I saw the fingers of somebody.

            . I am in Mr. Nightingale's employ. I saw the prisoners at the window, alone; the glass was whole just before. I went out, and secured them both together. I did not see any thing taken - the window appeared to be cut; as soon as I took hold of them Green threw down two eye-glasses off the curb, and Smith threw one down an area; two knives, ground down for the purpose, were found on them at the watch-house.

GREEN'S Defence. I happened to look into the window - this man came out, and took us.

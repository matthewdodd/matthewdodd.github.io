HENRY TIMKIN
. I am shopman to James Oliver, of Bishopsgate-street. About four o'clock in the evening of the 28th of June, I was in the shop, and saw the prisoner approach the door post, snatch down two boots, and go away with them—I followed him—he turned the first turning, and I lost sight of him for about two minutes—when I turned the corner he still had them in his hand, and seeing me he threw them on the other side of the street—I took them up, stopped him, and asked why he took them—he said he had not taken them, nor seen them before—I am certain he is the man.

Prisoner. He asked what I had been doing—I said "Nothing"—he said, "Why did you pull them down?"—I said, "I never pulled them down."




GUILTY
.* Aged 22.—


Transported for Seven Years.

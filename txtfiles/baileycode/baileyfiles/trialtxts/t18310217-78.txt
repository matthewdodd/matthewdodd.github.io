            . I am a Police-constable. On the 28th of January, I was near the house of Mr. Hopley, in Church-street, Bethnal-green


 - I saw the two prisoners near his window, and was going to drive them away; I then saw King go into the shop, and soon afterwards come out with this calico in his possession - Bailey was close to the door; King put the calico into his apron, and they both joined and ran away - I pursued, and took them both back; King still had the calico.

DANIEL BROWN
. I am master of the vessel, called the Lion, which was, on the 2nd of September, in the West India Export Dock, where I arrived on the 11th of August. About the 23rd of August I engaged the prisoner in the Dock as chief mate of my vessel, which was about to go to the West Indies—he came on board on the 24th, as near as I can tell—he went on with his duty until the 7th of September—he came to me that morning, and said, a person I had been in treaty with, Would take a passage, and he wished me to go to his office, which I did—when I returned to the vessel in the evening, the prisoner was gone—I missed a set of sails and other things—I think the prisoner was brought back on the following morning—I saw this quadrant, coat, and jacket, at the office—they are mine, and had been in the state-room, on board the vessel.





RICHARD SMITH
. I am an apprentice on board the vessel—I saw the prisoner take the quadrant, and leave the vesiel in the afternoon—I did not see him take the coat or jacket.





SERLE WHITLOW
. I am assistant to Mr. Latter, a pawnbroker in the Commercial-road—this coat, jacket, and quadrant, were pawned by a female named Foyle, who is not here.





HENRY WOOD
 ( police-constable K 149.) I took the prisoner on the 8th of September—he said the quadrant had been pledged by Foyle, at Mr. Latter's.

Prisoner. I was very much in liquor, or I should not have taken the things.




GUILTY

Transported for Ten Years.

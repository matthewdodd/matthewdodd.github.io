THOMAS WILLIAMS
 was indicted

 for stealing 1 purse, 1 shilling, and 1 sixpence; the property of 



Elizabeth Adams, from her person; having been before convicted of felony.






ELIZABETH ADAMS.
 I am single, and live at Chishampton, Oxfordshire. On Monday evening, the 10th of Sept., I was at the fair at Islington—a constable spoke to me, in consequence of which I missed my purse, which was in a pocket in the right side of my dress—this is the purse, if had a shilling and a sixpence in it.





CHARLES RANDALL.
 On Saturday evening, the 5th, I was at the fair at Islington, and saw the prisoner go to the prosecutrix, and put his hand into her pocket three times—I caught hold of him, and saw him drop the purse—I asked her if it was hers—she said, "Yes, and there was 1s. 6d. in it"—I had watched for him half an hour previous.





JOHN LOWE.
 I live at Moorfields—I was at the fair—I saw the prisoner put his right hand into the prosecutrix's pocket, and take out a purse—Randall seized him—I took hold of his right arm, and held him for Randall.

Prisoner's Defence. I am innocent; there were two boys by me who did it, and the policeman thought it was me.





JOHN WILKINS
 (policeman.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction—(read—Convicted Aug., 1846, and confined one week, and whipped)—I was present at the trial—he is the person.




GUILTY.** Aged 17.—


Transported for Seven Years.

1368. 




ELIZABETH BLACKENBURY
 was indicted

for stealing 1 saucepan, value 1s.; and 1 kettle, 1s. 6d. the goods of 



Thomas James Hill; and that she had been before convicted of felony.






ESTHER HILL
. I am the wife of Thomas James Hill—we live at Deptford. I had a saucepan and a kettle, which I saw safe on Thursday, the 14th of May, and missed them on Sunday, the 17th—these are them—I know the saucepan by its having been new-bottomed, and the kettle I know.





BENJAMIN LOVELL
 (policeman.) I received this kettle from Reed, and this saucepan from Winney.





FRANCES WINNEY
. On the 16th of May I saw the prisoner offering this saucepan for sale at a shop—I bought it of her for 8d.





ELIZA REED
. I bought this kettle of the prisoner for 6d., on Sunday, the 17th of May—she came to our place, said there were no shops open, and she would take it a great favour if I would buy it, as she wanted bread.





JOHN CARRINGTON
 (police-constable R 112.) I produce the certificate of the prisoner's former conviction—(read—Convicted 24th Nov., 1845, and confined four months)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 27.—


Transported for Seven Years
,
(There were three other charges against the prisoner; she was tried also last Session.)

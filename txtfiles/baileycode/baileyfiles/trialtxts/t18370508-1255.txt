1255. 




WILLIAM SHAW
 was indicted

for embezzlement.






JOHN HALL WHEELER
. I am a baker, and live at Hoxton. The prisoner was in my service about four months—he was intrusted to receive monies for me, and ought to account for it to me immediately on my return—I charge him with embezzling 7l. 10s.—he had received 9l. of Mr. Jeffry's, and had left 30s., in halfpence at home—I went the next morning and found it had been paid—he left my service immediately on taking this money—he had accounted for money received from Mr. Jeffry many times before, and he accounted for the 30s. that day—the 7l. 10s. he never accounted for—I paid him 6s. a week and his board—he slept in the stable.





JOHN ISAAC JEFFRY
. I deal with the prosecutor—on the 31st of January I paid the prisoner 9l., and took this receipt for it—he could not write, but made his mark.





MATILDA WHEELER
. I am the prosecutor's wife. The prisoner gave me 80s., and said Mr. Jeffry would call at night to settle the account.





JAMES SIMMONS
 (police-constable G 159.) I took the prisoner into custody just by the Tabernacle—he has been long looked for, but we could not find him.




GUILTY
. Aged 16.—


Transported for Seven Years.

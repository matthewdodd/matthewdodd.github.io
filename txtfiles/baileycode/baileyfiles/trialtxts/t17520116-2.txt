            . All I can say is, I measured the place on this house of Mr. Rayner's, and know there were betwixt 5 or 600 pounds of lead missing.


                  Benjamin 
                  Bristow 
               



            . The prisoner ask'd me if I would go to Chelsea with him and help to sell some lead.
Q. What time was it?
Bristow. It was about three months ago.
Q. Where was this lead ?
Bristow. It lay in the yard belonging to an empty house of Mr. Rayner's, we went together and sold it to one Kenew at Chelsea.
Q. Did the prisoner say how he came by the lead?
Bristow. No, he did not; neither did I know, but I believed he had it from off that house, because it lay in the yard. I and 
               
                  David 
                  Wright 
               



            , and one Dandford, had part of the money.
Q. Where is Dandford?
Bristow. He is dead.
Q. What sort of lead was it?
Bristow. It was sheet lead, all in one piece.
Q. to Jupp. What sort of lead did you miss from that house?
Jupp. Sheet lead, a large piece about 22 inches wide.

            . I bought the lead of the prisoner and three other men, on the 6th of November ; I know the prisoner was one of them.
Prisoner's defence.
I know Bristow to be a very bad fellow, he'll say anything in the world. or swear any man's life away for a shilling.



               Guilty
            .
79. (M.) He was a second time indicted, for that he, in company with 
               
                  David 
                  Wright 
               



             , did 


               steal 57 pounds weight of lead, val. 6 s.

            . I missed the lead about the 5th or 6th of November last; it was all of it gutter lead, except one piece, and that was upon the flat, and there were four gutters taken away.

            . Tamplin was concerned every time in taking the lead, and I saw him take it ; Wright assisted in taking this, and we went together, and they sold it at Chelsea.

80. (M.) He was a third time indicted, with 
               
                  
                     Henry

            . Toney Tamplin was up in the gutter, Brown was below and took the lead down, and they carried it to Chelsea; it was better than three months ago; when they went again the next time, the woman said, they had over-reckoned her by six-pence, on which I saw Brown return her the six-pence back.
Tamplin's defence.
That evidence has been tried here before, and he is a bad wicked man.
Both 

               Acquitted

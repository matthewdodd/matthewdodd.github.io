SARAH EDWARDS.
We lost this watch-chain with the seal and keys from a little case at the head of my bed on the 20th of December—it was safe on the 19th when I went to bed, and the door was locked in the night—the prisoner was still remaining in the house at that time—I consider it was safe on the morning of the 20th—I missed it about eleven o'clock in the morning—the prisoner was in the house at that time—it has not been found—I missed an accordion from the front room adjoining my bedroom.





ALFRED HULME.
I am in the service of Mr. Kennedy, a pawnbroker, in Rochester-terrace, Stoke Newington. On the 19th of December, between, three and five o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner pledged on accordion, with me-this is it.

Prisoner. Q. Did you take it in? A. No—I wrote the ticket, and gave you 4s. for it—you asked 5s.





JAMES EDWARDS.
This is my accordion.





MICHAEL JAMES FARRELL.
I am a policeman. I took the prisoner in a beer-shop, stooping down.

Prisoner. Q. I stooped for my hat. A. You were tying on your side as far under the seat as you could.

JURY.
Q. Why did he lay down? A. The prosecutor went in before me, and then he laid down.
(Richard Dyer, a marine-store dealer, gave the prisoner a good character.)

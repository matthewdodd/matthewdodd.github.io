JOHN WOOD
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
26th of February, 1 wooden image, value 30s., the goods of 



Ann Stevens; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






ANN STEVENS
. I am a widow, and keep a tobacconist's shop, in Princes-street, Soho. I lost this wooden image from the door of my shop, on the 26th of February—I saw it safe at five o'clock in the evening, and missed it between six and seven o'clock, when the officer came—it had been fastened by a hook and a padlock.





JOHN BEECKE
 (police-constable C 167.) I took the prisoner, on the night in question, in King-street, Soho, between six and seven o'clock—he was running, and had this image concealed under his coat—there were

some other persons with him—when I got within eight or ten yards of him, he dropped the image—I took it up and followed him, till he was stopped in Frith-street—I am sure he is the man.





HENRY GODDARD
. I am an officer of Bow-street. I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got at Mr. Clark's office (read)—I know he is the same man—he was tried in the name of Jeremiah Kearsley.




GUILTY
. Aged 22.—


Transported for Seven Years.

JAMES COFFEE
was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
3rd of January, 1 dead goose, value 6s., the goods of 



Ann Cook; and that he had been before convicted of felony.


ARTHUR COOK.I am the son of Ann Cook, a widow, who carries on the poultry business, in Princes-street, Westminster. I superintend the business—I know the goose and could swear to it—it was safe when I went out in the morning, on the 3rd of January.





RICHARD EDWARDS.
I saw a boy take a goose from Mrs. Cook's shop, and give it to the prisoner, who put it under his apron, and ran away—I pursued and took him—I showed the same goose to Arthur Cook, and he owned it—I had seen the prisoner about, a little while before the goose was taken.





JAMES CLOUGH.
I am a policeman. I received the prisoner into custody.





JOHN BROWN.
(police-constable F142.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got at Mr. Clark's office—(read)—he is the same person.




GUILTY.Aged 14.—


Transported for Seven Years

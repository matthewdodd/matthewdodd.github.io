            . I am servant to 
               
                  Sarah 
                  Bull
               



            , widow, of No. 10, Holles-street, Cavendish-square


. On the 10th of August, between eight and nine o'clock in the morning, I had just left these things on a sideboard, the street-door was open; I went down to the kitchen to fetch some water, returned in two minutes, and saw the prisoner run out of the passage. I gave an alarm, and he was stopped before I lost sight of him, and saw him put the spoons and ladle on a step in the square, as he ran.
Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Are you sure you did not lose sight of him - A. I did not; there was no crowd to hinder my view of him.

            . I am a livery-stable-keeper. I was in Holles-street, and saw the prisoner come out of the house, and Clift following; she said,
"Stop that man, he has robbed the parlour;" he was stopped in my sight, in Cavendish-square, and given in charge. I found the property on Lord Brownlow's steps; he said I was no man for detaining him.

             . The Prisoner lodged two nights in my house, and in that time I lost money, and dispatched him out of the house, and some time afterwards I missed linen and this coat: I saw him in the street with this coat on, I followed him into a publick-house, charged a constable with him, and carried him before a Justice. He said he would give me any thing that would content me, if I would not carry him before a Justice; he said at first he bought it in Monmouth-street , and afterwards he said he bought it of a man in the street, who had it upon his arm.
Prisoner. Mrs. Hendey happened to see me in the street, and she said that was her husband's coat that I had got on; but I bought it of a man in the street who said he had a coat to sell; he asked 18 s. for it, and at last the bargain was made for 11 s. there is a man at the French Horn in Holborn who sitted the coat on. I told Mrs. Hendey I would make her any satisfaction if I did not find the man out in ten days time , but if I was committed to prison my name might be put into the newspapers, and then I thought I should never be able to find the man.
Mrs. Hendey said her husband was ill of the rheumatism , which was the occasion of his not being there.

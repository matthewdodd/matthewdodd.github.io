            . I watch at Ralph's key


. On the 24th of May about a quarter after twelve, I was walking about the kay, and I heard a great rumaging among the casks; I went and found the prisoner, I asked him what he had got; he said he was getting some currants; I found these on him. I got a light, and found the head of one of casks out entirely; I got a constable; he had some in his right hand, and some in his left hand pocket, and some in a pocket tight before him; they belong to Messrs. 
               
                  George
                   Womwell
               



             and 
               
                  John
                   Scurry
               



            . There was about eight pounds.
The prisoner in his defence said, he had been working on board a boy; that about eleven o'clock at night, as he was coming ashore, he saw a great many currants scattered about, as he was picking some of them up, when Elliot charged him with stealing them; and that he was not among the casks.




               Guilty. 10 d.

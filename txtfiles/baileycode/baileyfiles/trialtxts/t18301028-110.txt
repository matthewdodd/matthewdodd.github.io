             - he is now in Dublin. I live on Lambeth-hill


; I stand in the street with oysters, and take in a little washing. The prisoner lodged with me four days - I had not known her before; on the 23rd of September I went out with my oysters, from five o'clock till half-past seven - I left this property on the line: I had had it to wash - I left the prisoner and my two children at home; when I came home the prisoner was gone - I saw her three weeks afterwards, at the bottom of Field-lane; I asked her what became of the property - she said she had never robbed me nor any other person in her life, and she would scorn such an action.

            . My husband keeps a clothes-shop in Field-lane. The prisoner brought these things to my house, and asked me to buy them; I opened the bundle-there were three shirts, a shift, a petticoat, and a pillow-case in it; she said she wanted sixpence a piece for the shirts, and the others she would give me in, being very old - I asked if they were her own; she said the old things were, but the shirts were her brother's - she left them with me, and said she would fetch her brother: my husband was out, but when he came home, he called an officer, and gave them to him.
Prisoner. She said I was not the person - I know the man who went into the house and stole the things, and the woman he lives with went to sell them at this house; I met the man, and told him there had been 2l. reward for him.

            . She looks like the woman, but I would not swear to her - I think she is the woman.

            . On the 22nd of September, Davis called me in, and said his wife had some linen offered her for sale, and the woman who offered it was gone to fetch her brother - I took it, and had it three weeks; on the 8th of October, I was officer of the night, and the prosecutrix brought in the prisoner, and described the property - I told her I had it at my house, and she identified it.

            . These are the articles - the prisoner had been with me four days, and ought to have returned that night; she had not paid me.
Prisoner. The man who stole these things told my sister. that if I would not say any thing against him, he would not come near me - I had lodged one week with the prosecutrix, and left her what money I had, and some of my clothes.

            . She left nothing but a pair of pattens to my knowledge; my son was in the room when she went.

            . I am the son of the prosecutrix, and was at home from five o'clock till half-past seven - the prisoner lodged there; I saw her take these things off the line, but I had no idea what she was going to do with them - she went out several times before she took them, and then she sent me to my mother, with a dish for some oysters.

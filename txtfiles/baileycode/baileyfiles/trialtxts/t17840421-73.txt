             sworn.
On Saturday noon, as I was walking along I saw Wilkins walking in the street, he came out of the prosecutor's shop; he walked a little way before me, it was about eleven, or between eleven and twelve; he walked about two doors from the gentleman's house, and two men joined him, the other prisoner, and one that is not here; when I came even with them, they were conversing together, and when I came close to them, I heard the short one, Wilkins, say, he is coming out presently; the next witness, who was just behind me, heard them say, he is coming out presently; we went back and watched them, and I saw Wilkins come out of the door, and in a little time Goodwin went into the shop, with this parcel of cloth under his arm, I followed and held him, and called the next witness to secure the others; he was detained in the shop.

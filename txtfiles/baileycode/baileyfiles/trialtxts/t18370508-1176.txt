ROBERT SMITH
. I am in the employ of Mr. Thomas Davidge, a cheesemonger in the Minories. Between seven and eight o'clock on the evening of the 20th of April, a cart with tubs of butter came—they were unloaded and put under the window, while we made room for them in the shop—I had seen the prisoner about five minutes before, reading a play bill—an alarm was given—I ran out, and saw him about twenty yards off, carrying a tub of butter—I ran after him—he put it down and walked off—I pur-sued and took him—I never lost sight of him—this is the tub.




GUILTY
. Aged 19.—


Transported for Seven Years.

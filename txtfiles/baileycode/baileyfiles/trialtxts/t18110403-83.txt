                  , on the 22nd of March
, a pocket book, value 6 d. two bank notes, value 10 l. each, and three one pound bank notes, his property
            .


                  FRANCIS 
                  TAITE
               



            . I am a seaman
 belonging to his Majesty, late on board the Royal William. I lost this property on the 22nd of March, at a house in Shadwell


; I went down to where I lodged eighteen or nineteen years ago, the door was shut, so I did not rap at the door. One of these women came along, she said, you cannot get in there. She called herself 
               
                  Betty 
                  Maken
               



            , said she could shew me a good lodging. I went with her, I saw nothing in the house but an old chair; she wanted something to drink, I gave her a shilling, there were four of them there; I gave her half a crown more, that would not satisfy them. I had not got any silver, I gave them a one pound note to get some bread and cheese for them, and to give me the change. As soon as she came back I asked for it; she would not give it me; she brought the victuals and some liquor in a pint pot, and some beer in another. I told her I would not stop there, I would go and get a lodging; I catched 
               
                  Elizabeth 
                  Smith
               



            , as she called herself then, she was taking three one pound notes out of my pocket, and when she took them out of my pocket she gave them to the other woman. I put my hand in my pocket, I missed my pocket book. The short one took the money out of her hand, she said I will take care of it till the morning; I said you had better give it me, I can take care of it myself. As soon as I put my feet out of the door they fastened it. I lost my money and pocket book; in the pocket book there were two ten pound notes, and three one pound notes loose in my pocket. I catched the tall one's hand in my pocket, her name is 
               
                  Elizabeth 
                  Smith
               



            .
Q. Are you sure these are the women - A. Yes, and I am sure the tall one put her hand in my pocket. I walked about an hour, I could not get any assistance. I went to the watchman, and in the morning I went to the runner. The tall one was seen to go out of the house with a bundle, and when we came back she was denied being in the house, till the gentleman went in to take them. Here is one of the women that was in the room that saw her take the money out.


                  ESTHER 
                  PURCELL
               



            . Last Friday was a fortnight 
               
                  Bridget 
                  Maken
               



             brought this man in with her; whether he had any bundle, or pocket-book I did not see. He gave her a shilling to fetch something to drink; he gave her two shillings and sixpence, and the third time he gave her a one pound note. 
               
                  Elizabeth 
                  Smith
               



             is the name she went by, but now she has changed her name. She put her hand into his left hand pocket and took out three one pound notes.
Q. Did she take the pocket book - A. That I did not see. She took the notes, 
               
                  Bridget 
                  Maken
               



             said she would keep them till the morning.
Q. Who keeps the house - A. 
               
                  Bridget 
                  Maken
               



            . I slept there two nights, and because I went in search of the man they tore the hair off my head, and my handkerchief off my neck.


                  JOHN 
                  POPE
               



            . I am an officer of Shadwell. On Saturday the 23d of March I was applied to by the prosecutor. I went to a house in New Gravel-lane, I found them both in two separate rooms, they were both very much intoxicated. Smith admitted that she had taken the three one pound notes, but that she had given them to 
               
                  Bridget 
                  Maken
               



            . No property was found on them whatever.
Hennessey's Defence. On the night this man came into the house I was there, he was very much in liquor; there was another woman came in with him; she went out and came in again; the man gave her three-pence; he stopped there a while, he sent a shilling out to get something to drink; he gave her half a crown and a one pound note; I went with her for some beer and liquor, and that good woman was left in the house with him; he took out three one pound notes, gave it me, and I gave it to the woman that owned the house to keep in her hands till the morning. In a short time the woman and the man went out, he delivered the notes in my hand, and that woman was left in the house with him when she and I went out.
Maken's Defence. This man gave me a one pound note, and after that a one pound note. As soon as I came in with the change he told me to keep it till the morning.
Prosecutor. I am sure it is the tall one that took the notes out of my pocket.
Q. You did not see your pocket book in her hand, did you - A. No, only the three one pound notes in her hand. I saw her give it to the short one, Maken.

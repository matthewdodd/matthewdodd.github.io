. I lost a pair of silver shoe buckles out of my bureau on the 6th of October: I found my bureau unlocked: I had seen them there two or three days before. The prisoner was painting one of my rooms: I charged a constable with him, and my buckles were found upon him.
- Blaney. I am a constable: Mr. Phillips gave me charge of the prisoner; I searched him, and found the buckles upon him.

I fell down upon the bureau and broke the lock: some things fell out, and I put them into the bureau. I don't know that I put any of them into my pocket.

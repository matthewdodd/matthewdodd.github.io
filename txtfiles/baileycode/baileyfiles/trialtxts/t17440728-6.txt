            . The 15th of this month I lost two silver spoons out of a back room joining to a yard; the Prisoner carried one to Mr. Howston a silversmith in Fleet-Street, and the other to Mr. Mordaunt, a pawnbroker. The Prisoner was an errand boy 
to a young man who lodges in our own house, and took this opportunity (as he confessed at Guild-Hall) to go in at a sash window, and took them out of a corner cupboard.
Mr. Howston. The Prisoner brought this piece of a spoon to me to sell, I asked him how he came by it, he said his master sent him to sell it. I told him I would send for his master to know the truth of it, and when I told him that he ran away, and had the impudence to send another boy with the other part of the spoon.

             . The Prisoner brought this spoon to me, and said, he wanted 2 s. upon it. I asked him who sent him with it; he said he brought it from one Green a cobler in the Old Bailey: said I, it is not usual for a cobler to have such a spoon as this, I will go to the person who owns it; he said there was no occasion for that, he would go and fetch him; he w ent away, but did not return to me: he has a mother who I believe is a chairwoman.
Q. What age are you?
Billingsly. I am eight years old - My father is in the hospital.

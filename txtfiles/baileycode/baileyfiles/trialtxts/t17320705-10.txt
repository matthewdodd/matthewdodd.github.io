                              James 
                              Emerton 
                           







                  , and Frances
                   his 
                  Wife





             of St. Sepulchers




 were indicted for 


               assaulting (with 
                     
                        Mary 
                        Sadler 
                     



                   not yet taken) 
                     
                        
                           Robert 
                           Dawcett 
                        




                      
                   in the said James Emerton's House, putting him in Fear, and taking from him a Silver Watch, a pair of Silver Buckles, a Hat, and other Goods, and 20 s. in Money
            , May 30
.


                  Robert 
                  Dawcett 
               



            . I met the Prisoner and another Woman in Long Lane and asked them for a Lodging.


                  Frances 
                  Emerton 
               



            . Don't you damn your Soul too much you Dog! is it fit that any Rogue should knock my Teeth out? and now you want to swear my Life away and my Husband's too.
Dowatt. And so they picked me up, and carry'd me to the Prisoner's Lodging. I must needs say I was a little in for't F. E. I won't be tried, I won't speak one Word till my Husband is clear'd, I won't, I won't, [she stamps about till her Cap falls off] No, I won't put my Cap on. He's a Rogue. D. and so I say they took me to the White Horse in Chick Lane


. and there, as soon as I laid my self upon the Bed, they stript me by main Force, and took away my Money and my Watch. F. E. Ah you Dog! I wish I was a Man for your Sake. D. And then one said to t'other. Let's murder him. F. E. You lie, Sirrah, you lie, you Hang-in-Chains Rogue. D. So I got up to run away, but the other Prisoner (her Husband) stopt me at the Door, and took hold of my Collar. I heard the Watch go by past 12 a Clock, and I cry'd out Murder, for God's sake help. And so with much a do I forc'd my Way out, and run naked into the Street. F. E. O you damnation Rogue. D. Next Morning he offer'd to make it up with me, and said, I should have my Watch and every thing again, if I would but be easy.


                  Robert 
                  Price 
               



             Watchman. As I was beating the Hour of 12, I saw the Prosecutor as naked as ever he was born, except his Shirt, and he told me he was Robb'd.


                  Frances 
                  Emerton 
               



            . Here's another Hang-in-Chains Son of a B - ; arn't you asham'd of yourself you Rogue?
Price. And he run up the Alley as far as Church-lane. F. Emerton. You lie you Dog.
Price. I went into the Room that the Prosecutor came out of, and the Prisoner 
               
                  James 
                  Emerton 
               



             was standing leaning upon a Table, and the Prosecutor's Clothes lay in the Room by him, and we found every thing but his Watch and his Buckles.


                  James 
                  Emerton 
               



            . I never saw the Prosecutor in my Life before.


                  Frances 
                  Emerton 
               



            . I and another Woman met this Man in g lane and I saw his Eye was cut and I asked him how it came, and he said by quarrelling with a Man in Morefields. So we went into a Shop for a Quartern of Gin to wash his Eye ; and when I had wash'd it with the Gin, I made Water and wash'd it with that too. And so says he to th'other Woman, shall I go home with you? and she said yes; and so I went with 'em. They 2 went to bed together; and by and by my Husband comes home dead drunk, at which this Fellow was frighted, and so got out of Bed, and call'd the Watch, because I wou'd not lie with him as well as t'other Woman. And he has sent a Man to New Prison for cutting his Eye, and now he swears it to my Husband, and he's a vile Rogue for his Pains; and Will. Balt a Runner of Newgate knock'd this Tooth out of my Head, for which I have got Alderman Brocas's Warrant against him. Dear Gentlemen, take it into Consideration; do what you will with me, let all Punishment be due to me, but clear my Husband; don't hang him whatever you do. The Jury 

               acquitted
             the Husband, and found the Wife 


               Guilty of Felony only, to the Value of 10 d.

                  GEORGE 
                  WATTS
               



            . I live at No. 6, Dock-street, Rosemary-lane, Whitechapel - I keep a lodging-house. On the 11th of July I saw 
               
                  George 
                  Horne
               



             and the prisoner; I had arranged with Fogg before - I asked the prisoner if he had got any shan to sell; he said No, but he had got some out and out couters, meaning counterfeit sovereigns, to sell,which were to be 5s. a-piece; I agreed to take three, which were to be brought to me on Saturday night, the 12th of July - he came that night, but said they were not ready, but he brought them on Sunday morning, the 13th; he brought three counterfeit sovereigns; I gave him two halfcrowns and 7s., and promised to give him 3s. on the Monday - they had paper round them, and he told me to keep them separate; in five or ten minutes after we had left the house, I saw Fogg - I shewed him what I had got - he marked them and returned them to me; the prisoner came about three o'clock in the afternoon, on Monday, the 13th, and I paid him the 3s - I know Alexander Mitchell.
Cross-examined by Mr. CLARKSON. Q. What sort of a lodging-house is your's? A. A sailor's lodging and navigator's; there are married men and women there. I believe - I do not keep a house for the reception of men and women, but if a sailor and a woman come there I am not to ask if they are married - Horne is an acquaintance of mine; I do not know that he has been in trouble lately - I never was in trouble; I never speculated in shans and couters before the 13th of July - the first information I had of this was from Horne, at Fairlop-fair; I knew what a couter meant, it is a very common word; if a sailor comes to sleep at my house it is usual for me to take care of their money - I have had a great deal of money in my hands, and in the morning I returned it to them; they do not find any couters among it, unless they gave them to me - I never saw a bad sovereign in my life before.


                  JAMES 
                  FOGG
               



            . I am an officer of the Thames-police. Watts gave me information on the 12th of July, and on the 13th he shewed me three counterfeit sovereigns, which I marked and returned to him; on the 19th I was with Mitchell and Carter on Tower-hill, but I did not take the prisoner untill the 22d of August, at Kent-street, in the Borough - he was sitting at breakfast; I said, "White, I want you, I suppose you know what for" - he said, "Yes, I have heard something about it;" I told him it was for selling bad sovereigns to George Watts and George Horne - he then said he thought so of Horne when he saw him at his house the day before, and what could he do this for? - he said, "Well, I understand they can only give me two years for it," and asked if there was anything else against him; I said not that I knew of.
Cross-examined. Q. How many of you went to apprehim? A. Four - we had four brace of pistols, and powder and shot; I was more afraid of his dog than I was of him - he told me if his dog had been at home I should not have had him then; I knew Watts before - he did live over the water, but I never knew of his keeping a house until he kept the one he lives in now; he came to me first on this subject, and asked what they were to do - I said I would mention it to the Mint, and tell him; I do not think Horne was with Watts the first night - if he was, I had no conversation with him; I have known Horne five or six months - I never knew that Watts and him went about to catch people with money; I do not believe Watts keeps a house of reception for sailors and common women; I have been in his house, but I saw no woman but his wife.


                  ALEXANDER 
                  MITCHELL
               



            . I received these three counterfeit sovereigns on the 14th of July from George Watts.
Cross-examined. Q. When did Fogg open this business to you first? A. About the 11th; I was not in company with him when he went to Watts - I think I have seen Watts at the office before, but it is some months ago - I do not know on what charge; I do not think it was for felony - he appeared against two men who were transported, and gave eveidence against them.
JAMES FOGG. These are the sovereigns I marked.


                  JOHN 
                  FIELD
               



            . I am inspector of coin at the Mint; these sovereigns are all counterfeit, and from the same die.
MR. CLARKSON to GEORGE WATTS. Q. Are you married? A. No.
MR. CLARKSON to GEORGE HORNE. Q. Were you examined before the Magistrate? A. Yes, and I gave evidence which was taken down in writing; I was in company with Watts when Fogg went to him - I believe it was on the 10th, but I do not recollect the day; we were not coutering together - you are talking French to me; it is a matter of indifference to me, whether I was ever at the tread-mill; the "lead story and the goose story" have nothing to do with this subject - I believe you are right that I had been about, to endeavour to precure people to sell counterfeit coin; I know Fogg, but he did not know of my being engaged in other things - he never employed me till I met him with Watts, on Tower-hill.
MR. BOLLAND. Q. You have known Fogg some time as an officer? A. Yes, but he never employed me to purchase bad money before; I saw him twice, once when I made my own purchase, and once when Watts made his - when we went to Tower-hill and met Fogg, it was for Watts to tell him what had passed.
COURT. Q. When did you see him on Tower-hill? A. On the 19th of July.
JAMES FOGG re-examined. I saw Horne on Tower-hill on the 19th of July.
MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did you know nothing of Horne before that? A. No, and never knew he had been in custody till to-day - I told him when he came into Court, not to deny it.
Prisoner's Defence. I know nothing of them, and never sold them anything of the kind.

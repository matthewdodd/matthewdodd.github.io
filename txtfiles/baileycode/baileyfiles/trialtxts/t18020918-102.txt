 to a friend of mine; she came to me when I sent for her on Saturday, the 14th of August; she had some tea with me, and then I went to shew her the place she was to go to; she was engaged; she begged to step home, and at that time I lost a pair of stockings off the ironing-board, but did not miss them till the next week, when the prisoner was again in my house about half an hour, and I missed the pair of stockings and waistcoat.

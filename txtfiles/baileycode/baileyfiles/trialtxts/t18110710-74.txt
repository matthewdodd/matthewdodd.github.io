            . I am shopman to Mr. Thwaites. The two prisoners came into the shop to look at some caps. They asked for others, and while I was gone, I saw Cox take this muslin off the counter and put it in her pocket. Cox and Hegan came in together, I did not see Hegan take any thing, she pulled the things about and tried to put me into confusion.

            . I am a linen-draper
, I live in Holborn


. On the 17th of June, in the after part of the afternoon, the prisoners came into my shop, and from information I searched both their pockets. On Cox, I found some worked muslin for caps.
Cox said nothing in her defence, called two witnesses, who gave her a good character.
Hegan was not put on her defence.

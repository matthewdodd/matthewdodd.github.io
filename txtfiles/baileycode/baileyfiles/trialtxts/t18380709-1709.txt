On the 22nd of June; at a quarter-past nine o'clock, the prisoner, and another boy, came and asked for a pennyworth of milk—I served them—the prisoner then asked me to milk—into the yard with another mug, and put some water in it—I went, and when I returned, he and the time-piece were gone—the time-piece had been in the parlour—the prisoner had left his milk behind—the policeman caught him with the time-piece in about three minutes.

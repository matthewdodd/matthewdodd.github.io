            . I met the Prisoners, and they told me they had been to sell some Ribbon they had got in Paul's Church-Yard, and were going to look out for a Gold-watch. We went together, to this Gentleman's Door, and finding the Glass-case unlock'd, Mullying Jack lifted it up, and I took the silver Snuff-mull, and the Smelling-bottle out, and Jack the Hatter stood by to watch. We sold the Mull to Marrian for 9 s.

J. Alcock. These Goods were lost out of my Shew-glass. I was sent for to Justice Deveil's, where I found 
               
                  Ned 
                  Langford 
               



            , alias Nimble Jack, who said, he knew me very well, for that he and the Prisoners had stolen all these Things out of my Shop at Cripple-gate





. By his Information we took the Prisoners out of their Beds, at one Evans's, who keeps the Two-Brewers, in Maynard-Street in St. Giles's.
Court. Langford, here are several Persons Lives at stake, you ought to be very cautious of what you swear. You were ask'd in a former Trial, but as you are now before another Jury, it may be proper to ask you again, if you know the Consequence of swearing falsely?
Langford. Nay, I don't know; but they say it's Damnation in t'other World. The Day after we robb'd Mr. Triquet, I and Jack the Hatter, and Mollying Jack, were going to Moorfields, and passing by this Gentleman's Shop, says Mollying Jack, I'll lay a Shilling, that Shew-glass will lift up. It won't, says Jack the Hatter. You lye but it will, says t'other Jack. Let's go back, and see then, says I; and so I went, and lifted it up, and took out these three pair of Stock-clasps and a half, and they both stood by to tell me if any Body was a coming. Then we went to 
               
                  John 
                  Marrian 
               



            's, and sold them all to him, for 6 s. 6 d. Then Jack the Hatter and I came back to the same Place, he lifted up the Glass, and I took out two pair of Tea-tongs, three Girdle-buckles, and the other half of the Stock-buckle. This was between 3 and 4 o'Clock in the Afternoon, and at the same time, the Gentlewoman was drinking Tea in a Room behind the Shop. We carry'd these Things to Marrian too, and sold them all for 10 s. And the same Afternoon I met Little Daniel. and he and I went to the same Shop; but a Woman looking out at a Draper's Shop over-against us, we waited for her going in; but a Dray stopping just before the Draper's Door, we took the Opportunity, and Daniel lifted up the Shew-glass, and took out these two Bunches of Spoons, fix in one Bunch, and five in the other, and we sold them to Marrian, for 17 s. The Jury 

               acquitted
             Mills, and found the others 


               Guilty to the value of 4 s. 10 d.
             each.

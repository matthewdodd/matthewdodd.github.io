            . Q. In the year 1809, were you present at the ceremony of marriage, between the prisoner and any other person - A. Yes, with Jemime Hart, my sister; he was married to her on the 11th of November 1809 at St. Andrew's Holborn. I took a copy of the register of the marriage. I compared it with the book; it is a correct copy.

Prisoner. I wish to know whether your sister had any property at her marriage - A. She had not.
RICHARD WIATT. I am clerk at St. James's Parish. I produce the register book of marriages:

                  Charles

Q. Do you know the person of the prisoner - A. I have seen him before. I cannot exactly say he was the person that was married.
Q. Have you a paper directing the publication of banns - A. I have this is it. (Read)

               Q. 
            to Mr. Hart. You have been acquaintedwith the prisoner's hand-writing ever since your sister's marriage have you not - A. Yes, and Before. I have been familiar with his hand-writing. I am certain that paper is his hand-writing. I have seen him write fifty times, and

             in the register of marriages, is most assuredly his hand writing In the course of last year I became acquainted with his visiting Miss Timson; he gave me a promise that he would leave off visiting her, and said the acquaintance was all over.


                  JAMES 
                  TIMSON
               



            . Q. I believe you are the father of the second wife - A. I am.
Q. In the course of last year did the prisoner visit your family as a suiter to your daughter - A. I saw him once or twice at our house for the purpose of addressing my daughter; he represented himself as a single man; I afterwards received information that he was a married man. I was with Mr. Hart. I forbid him the house; he came to my house in the name of 
               
                  Charles 
                  Edwards
               



            . My daughter was always called Susanah by me and her family.


                  THOMAS 
                  SMITH
               



            . I live at 48, Greek-street, Soho. On the 30th of October, last year, Miss Timson lodged at my house; the prisoner visited her there. I am sure the prisoner is the person. After a time he said he was married to her; he said he would pay the rent of the room. I understanding there was something wrong in the marriage, I forbid him the house. He said he would not be convenient for Mrs. Edwards to find a lodging; I told him I was quite satisfied with his character; she might stay as long as she liked. I would not suffer him to cohabit with her there.


                  FRANCES 
                  WALLACE
               



            . I am sister to the prisoner's wife, 
               
                  Jemima 
                  Hart
               



            . At the time he was married to her, they lived at our house at Walworth; he lived with his lawful wife; he slept with her the very night before he said he was going to the office; he should return early in the evening; instead of his coming he sent this letter, that he was going into the country; I believe this to be his hand writing. I have seen his writing, and have seen him write frequently. The letter is directed to Mr. Joshua Wallace. Welbeck-row, Walworth Ladies school;
"Mr. Harris pressed me much to go to Windsor with him. I shall be back on Monday; I shall continue 
               Jemima
             the money. Go to bed soon.
Your's, J. H. EDWARDS."
I saw him on the evening following; he then confessed to me that he had married Miss Timson. He has since then lived now and then with his wife; she is now pregnant by him. At that time we did not believe him; we thought he said what was really not true.
Prisoner. Q. Do you mean to say you heard me aay I was married to Miss Timson - A. Certainly I do; my sister was present, and almost in fits; you told me so when you returned on the Monday evening. You told me you had married Miss Timson, and could not live any longer with my sister.
Mr. Guerney to Mr. Timson. Q. Your daughter has the misfortune to be pregnant by the prisoner - A. Yes, she has.
Prisoner's Defence. It is not my intention to deny an intimacy between myself and 
               
                  Susannah 
                  Timson
               



            , which intimacy has been with a perfect knowledge of my wife, nor is it I conceive any consequence to the present charge; it is not in my power to employ counsel, being by this prosecution deprived of assistance. I am sorry to have heard the evidence gone through as it has; I do not say there is a conspiracy among the witnesses, some of them having been mistaken, and the other part have not corrected the mistakes; but my innocence or guilt is to be determined by the evidence. There has been no positive evidence before the court of any marriage between me and Miss Timson; there is evidence of a person calling himself 
               
                  Charles 
                  Edwards
               



             and 
               
                  Anne 
                  Timson
               



            , and there is evidence of my marriage with Jemima Hart. The subscribing witness has been called; he cannot identify my person. I am surprised at that, for I have been at that church several times to search the book of marriages. I would defy any two persons of the name, who were not very dissimilar in the advantages of that part of education, to write their names without being able to trace the resemblance of each to the other; a man's name being usually written with rapidity, and are very negligent of the form of the letters. I entreat the jury to consider the nature of the evidence is by no means positive. Miss Timson, if her attachment to me was so violent would have spurned at my disgrace, when she knew her own character could not have escaped in such a compromise; and one of the papers given in evidence against me was in pencil writing, which I submit is not cognizable in a court of justice, and whatever I have said at best is evidence; I submit whether that might operate against me; it has not been misproved that 
               
                  Susannah 
                  Timson
               



             is not the Anne Timson; all that has been proved is an occasional cohabitation with 
               
                  Anne 
                  Timson
               



            . It is hard for a man to be convicted because the name of Edwards in the book of marriages.
COURT. Q. to Mr. Timson. Look at the signature of 
               
                  Anne 
                  Timson
               



            , and tell me whether you believe that to be your daughter's hand-writing - A. I believe it to be her hand-writing.
Q. Is she sometimes called by the family Susannah - A. That is her name; I believe she altered it to Anne, to suit the prisoner's purpose.

            . I lost a handkerchief while I was standing in Guildhall


 to see the lottery drawn on Monday the 25th of November, about a quarter of an hour before one o'clock. I don't know any thing of the person that took it. Mr. Pain came to me and said, you have lost your handkerchief, follow me and I will help you to it. I went after him and he laid hold of two boys. I don't remember the boys. (The handkerchief produced and deposed to by the prosecutor.) It is mark'd C.
William Pain. I saw the two prisoners come into the hall; I watched them, I saw what they were about; the great boy was pushing the little one on; they were both at this gentleman's pocket; they were so close I could not see whose hand was in the pocket; when they had got the handkerchief out they made off. I tapped the gentleman on the shoulder, and we went after them; the little boy had the handkerchief in his pocket, a corner of it hung out, and he said the great boy put his hand through his coat and picked the gentleman's pocket, and put the handkerchief in his pocket.

            's Defence.
I went of an errand for my master. I went through Guildhall. I stood about five minutes: a man took this boy, and he said here is another Jew; we will take him with us. I know nothing of the boy, he was not with me. I am a butcher
. I am fourteen years old.

            's Defence.
I was going of an errand for my mother, and going through Guildhall I trod on something, I thought it was a piece of brown paper; I took it up, it was this handkerchief; I held it up in the light, and nobody owned it, so I put it in my pocket. This man came up and laid hold of me, and seeing the other boy
 he took him along with him.

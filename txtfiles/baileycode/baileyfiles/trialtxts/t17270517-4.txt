, (a Black) on the 9th of this Instant

The Prosecutor depos'd, That he saw the Prisoner take the Handkerchief out of his Pocket, and gave it to another, upon which he apprehended him; the Prisoner could not positively deny the Fact, but alledged that the Handkerchief was not worth the Money mentioned in the Indictment, and he (being a good Christan) begg'd the Court would consider, the Prosecutor was but an Infidel; but he proving the Form of Baptism had been administred to him, this Artifice was but of little Effect, for the Jury found him 


               guilty to the Value of 10 d.

MARY JONES
. I am a widow, and keep a shoe-shop in Brook-street, Ratcliffe Highway. The prisoner was in my shop about four o'clock in the evening of the 31st of October, offering something for sale—while she was there, I turned to settle a little bill with Mr. Raymond—we could not agree about the price that I had offered her for the articles she brought to sell—immediately on her going out I missed a pair of shoes, which I had just tried on a lady—I sent a little girl after her—she refused to come back with her—she made a stop—I sent a boy, she refused—I then got my cloak and bonnet, locked the door and ran after her—when she saw me she came back, dropped these shoes from her gown—these are them.


Prisoner, I was in the back room, and the shoes I never saw—three parcels of mine laid where the shoes were—I went about twenty yards from the door, the little girls came and said, Mrs. Jones wanted me—I turned back without making the slightest objection—I met Mr. Jones, who took me into the back room, and went into the shop, brought the shoes in her hand, and said I had taken them.





JAMES WHATMORE
. I produce the certificate of the prisoner's former conviction—(read)—she is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 46.—


Transported for seven Years.

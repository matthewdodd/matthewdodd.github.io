On Thursday, the 7th, about ten o'clock, I was informed some things were in Cross-lane, at a house there; I went and forced the door open, and found the prisoner there, walking about the room; and this pan was on the fire; and this metal on the fire; and this pot partly melted in the pan: she endeavoured to conceal it; and throwing some water on it, had like to have scalded us both. I found in the room these six quart pots: I have had them ever since in my possession.

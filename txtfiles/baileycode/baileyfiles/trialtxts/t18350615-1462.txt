ELIZABETH SALKILLD
. I am the wife of Joseph Salkilld, and live in Henry-street, Hampstead-road—the prisoner lodged in my house eight weeks, and had one furnished room, at five shillings a week, but I never received a farthing—I went into her room, and asked if my things were right—I was putting down the bed, and she said she had pawned the sheets—I sent for an officer, and missed all the property stated in the indictment—I never allowed her to pawn it—she is a single woman, and she said she had £150 to receive on the 5th of May.





FREDERICK WOOD
. I am shopman to Mr. Wells, a pawnbroker in the Hampstead-road—I produce a counterpane, towel, two irons, and one sheet—I cannot say who pawned them—I took in some myself—I have seen the prisoner at the house—I am certain a woman pawned them.





ROBERT SAWYER CRANE
 (police-constable). I apprehended the prisoner on the 15th of May, on this charge—she gave me these duplicates as I was going to search her.





FREDERICK WOOD

re-examined. I have all the articles here, corresponding with these duplicates.





HENRY ADAM ARCHBALD
. I am shopman to Mr. Brittle, a pawnbroker, in Tottenham-court-road—I have a sheet, pawned for 3s., by a woman.—I did not take it in—this is the counter-duplicate.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
The prisoner pleaded poverty.

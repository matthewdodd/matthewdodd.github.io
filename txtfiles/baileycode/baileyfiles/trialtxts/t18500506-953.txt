JOHN JONES
 was again indicted

 for stealing 1 watch, value 1l. 5s.; the goods of 



Lewis Barnett.


MR. PLATT
conducted the Prosecution.






JOHN SOARS
. I am one of the turnkeys at Giltspur-street. On the 16th April I found this watch in the prisoner's boot—I asked if this was the watch referred to in the warrant of commitment, he said, "No; they have got that; this is my own property."





LEWIS BARNETT
. This watch is mine—It was safe about three o'clock the same day that I lost the other—I missed it about half-past three, and gave notice at the station—I know the number of it—it is 1570—I have the book where it is entered—this is not my book—it is the person's book where I bought it—I know the watch itself—I do not put a mark on everything I buy—it is a mock jewel one.

Cross-examined by
MR. PAYNE. Q. Where did you buy it? A. At Mr. Wingrove's in Bury-street, a steel pen-manufacturer—I have sometimes thirty, forty, or fifty—I do not know how many I had that day—I buy as well as sell—I buy of anybody I think proper—if a person brings me a watch, and I know he is a hawker, I would buy it—I would not buy one of you—I gave Mr. Wingrove a sovereign for this—I bought two of him, this and another—

the other I have by me now—I cannot tell how many I had on my stall that day; you must go and ask my wife—I think I had about twenty-four—I did not buy any that day—I missed this before the other was taken.

Prisoner's Defence. If I had time I could bring the person here that I had that watch from; he has been here every day this week; he must be ill, or something the matter. I was at home that day till half-past five in the evening, when I went down Petticoat-lane and was taken; this watch was found because I did not give it up at the station.




GUILTY
. Aged 22.—


Transported for Seven Tears.

JOHN SMITH
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
17th of february, 2 tame ducks, price 4s. 8d., and I tame drake, price 2s.; the property of 



John Riley; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






JOHN RILEY
. I live in Caroline-court, Great Saffron-hill—I buy and sell ducks—I keep them below in the kitchen—I lost two ducks and a drake between the 17th and the 18th of February—I had seen them safe on the 17th, and lost them out of my kitchen—I had no lock on the door, only a hasp—I went on the morning of the 18th to Leadenhall-market—I found a young man with my ducks and drake—I said they were mine, and he gave them up—they were mine, but I sold them the same morning in the market—I know the prisoner by sight, he lived near Seven Dials.

Cross-examined by
MR. DOANE. Q. Is not your place at Saffron-hill a considerable distance from Seven Dials? A. Yes—I am quite sure they were my ducks and drake—I have seen the prisoner selling poultry in the market, and have bought of him.





GEORGE WILLIAM SMITH
. I am a poulterer in Leadenhall-market. I bought the two ducks and drake of the prisoner on the 18th—he did not say whose they were—the prosecutor came and claimed them.

Cross-examined. Q. Is it not usual to ask persons in the market whether the things are their own? A. No, I knew the prisoner, and had bought poultry of him before.





EDWARD MABB
 (police-constable F 114.) On the 20th of February, I apprehended the prisoner—I told him it was on suspicion of stealing three ducks—he denied it, and denied knowing the prosecutor's name at first, he then he said he did know him, and he knew who stole the ducks, but he would not split on them, as they had a knife drawn across their throat.





JAMES PIKE
 (police-constable F 105.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's conviction, which I got at Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 23.—


Transported for Seven Years.

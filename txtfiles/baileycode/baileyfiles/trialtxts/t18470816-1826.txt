1826. 




JOHN WILSON
 was indicted

 for stealing 2 coats, value 3l.; the goods of 



Joseph Charles (since deceased.)






GEORGE CHARLES.
 I am a tailor, and live at No. 171, Fleet-street. On the 24th of June, after one o'clock in the day, I missed two coats—they were my father's, Joseph Charles', property—they have not been found.





JOHN SPINKS.
 I live in Fetter-lane. On the 24th of June, about one o'clock, I saw the prisoner go into Mr. Charles' shop, and come out with some coats on his arm—I am sure there was more than one coat.

Prisoner. Q. I was not taken till a month afterwards; what do you swear to me by? A. By your face—I knew you by sight for a couple of months, by passing along Ship-yard.




GUILTY.** † Aged 17.—


Transported for Seven Years.



Before Edward Bullock, Esq.

            , JUN. I am in the employ of my father, John Marchant, a shoemaker
, who lives in John-court, Marylebone-lane


. On the night of the 6th of December I saw the prisoner, with two others, standing next door to our shop - he left the other two, went to our shop window, put his hand through a square of glass, which I had taken out that day, and took out this pair of shoes; he put them under his pinafore, and went to his companions - he had made more attempts than one to take them; he took them off a nail - I went and took him; his two companions ran away - he asked me to forgive him.

             (Police-constable D 4). I took the prisoner; I asked who was with him - he said nobody, but that he was going to put the shoes on and wear them - he had a good pair on at the time.

                  Jones 
               



            . The Prisoner cut two pair of coach-harnesses to pieces, and cut the brasses off them.
Q. What are you?
Jones. I am a hackney-coachman
. I lost all these things on the 27th or 28th of Dec. out of my stable, and hay loft in White-Cross-Street


.
Q. What reason have you to think the Prisoner at the bar took any of these things?
Jones. He confessed that he did, and that he cut them off, and sold them to the old man in the cap for twenty pence.
Q. Is the Prisoner a servant of yours?
Jones. He is no more a servant of mine than he is of yours; he owned he broke part of the sky-light, and dropped down like a cat into the hay loft.
There was another indictment against him, but he was not tried upon it.  

               Guilty
            .

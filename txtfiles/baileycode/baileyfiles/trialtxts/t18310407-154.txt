JOHN HASTINGS. I am a surgeon
, and live in Vauxhall-bridge-road. On the 4th of April I hired the prisoner as an errand-boy
, and had his character from his father, who had been an officer in the Penitentiary - I sent him in about an hour after he came in to my employ to purchase half a pound of butter at a neighbour's, and gave him a sovereign to pay for it; he never returned with the butter or sovereign - he was brought to me next day by a boy, who formerly lived with me, and admitted that he had spent the sovereign with some boys at Greenwich fair.

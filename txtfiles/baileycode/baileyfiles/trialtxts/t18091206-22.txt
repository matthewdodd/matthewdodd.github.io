, 41, Beach-street


. On Saturday, the 18th of November, about half past eleven at night, the prisoner came into my house and took a remnant of flannel, seven yards and three quarters; I pursued him and called out stop thief; about half way down Beech-street he was stopped by the watchman, I saw him drop the flannel; when he was stopped I returned back and picked up the flannel. I never lost sight of him till he was taken. He was taken to the watchhouse.
Prisoner's Defence. I was coming from Finsbury-square, the watchman stopped me at the corner of Barbican, by the White Bear; I heard the cry of stop thief, a good many people run as well as me, and when I had run about an hundred yards, a watchman stopped me; I went with him, I did not resist him. As for knowing any thing of what was stolen I do not.

             deposed he was learning to dress hair at Mr. Garritte's; the prisoner came in to have his hair dressed; no other person was in the way; he undertook to do it as well as he could, and when the prisoner went away, he took his hat, which he missed soon after. By enquiring about, he found him and took him up with his hat on his head. (Produced and deposed to.)
Prisoner's Defence.
I took the hat in a joke.

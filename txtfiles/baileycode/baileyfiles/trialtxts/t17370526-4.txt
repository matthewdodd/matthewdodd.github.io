            . The Prisoner was my Servant
 ten Months. He confess'd in my Kitchen that he took 
               
                  Richard 
                  Tisdale 
               



            's Money; 15 Guineas and 16 s. out of a Box in a Room where they both lay. He said he broke the Box with a Picker, and produced 6 Guineas and 9 s. 6 d. of the Money again, but gave no Account what he had done with the rest. The Money which he returned, he had hid under a Stone on the Outside of my Gate.

            . I lost 15 Guineas, and 16 s. in Silver. I miss'd it the 1st of March; it was put up in a Box in my Bed-Room; the Box was locked, but I found the Lock broke, and as none comes into that Room but the Prisoner, we suspected him and charged him with it. He did not confess it at first, but about 3 Hours after we had taxed him with it he made a Confession that he took about 9 Guineas; that he open'd the Lock with a Picker, such as we pick Horses Feet with, and that he had lost some of the Money at Gaming; he shew'd us where the rest was hid, and we found 6 Guineas, 8 Shillings, and 3 Six-pences.

 at Bishopsgate


; on the 15th of September I saw a person's fingers come through the ironwork at our window, and take a small bottle of mushrooms; I ran out, and took hold of the person, it was the prisoner; I think he took it out of his pocket, and delivered it to me; he was got about ten yards from the door; I brought him back, and sent for my master, and he was committed.
Prisoner's defence.
I was coming home between 8 and 9 o'clock; I stopped to make water, and saw the bottle standing on the ledge of the window; I took it, and he came out and took me.

            .
MARTHA ALLEN. I am the wife of James Allen, who is servant
 to Mr. Pallet, in George-street, Hanover-square. On the 24th of July, the prisoner came to the house, and pretended to want the things for the mangle. I knew she worked for the mangler. She asked if Mrs. Woodward mangled for me, I said she did, and gave her the things; as she went out she asked when they were to be brought back, I told her in the morning - I have never seen them since. She was taken up three weeks afterwards. I am certain she is the person.

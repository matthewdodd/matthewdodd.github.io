            . I live at Birmingham. On the 23d of April, about two o'clock in the afternoon, I was in Christchurch-passage, Newgate-street


; a person asked if I had lost a handkerchief, I felt and missed it, it was safe as I came out of the King Head, public-house, two minutes before; he then pointed out the prisoner, whom I collared and charged with it - he denied it; I pulled open his coat, and found it at the top of the sleeve of the coat - I am positive he is the man.

            . I am in the service of Samuel Hilditch, of Oxford-street


. On the 15th of October, about five o'clock, the prisoner and another person came to the shop, and were there about five minutes - her companion bought two yards of net - they paid for it, and went out - soon afterwards our next door neighbour came and gave us some information - I went out with him, and saw the prisoner and another person in the street - I insisted upon their going back - they hesitated, but I insisted upon it - the prisoner then gave me the piece of silk from under her clothes, and said the other person who had been in the shop took it, and she had gone away.
Prisoner. Q. Did not your master say I had not been into the shop? A. No.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

            . I am an officer, and took her into custody.
Prisoner's Defence. As I was going up Newman-street, two young girls came and asked me to hold that for them till they returned - I said they must not be long, as I was going on an errand - they left it, and I had it open in my hand when the gentleman came, and said I must go back with him to the shop - I said "What shop?" for I did not know where it was, and the gentleman of the shop said I had not been there - I had not been in the shop at all.

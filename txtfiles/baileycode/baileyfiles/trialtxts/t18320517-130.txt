. On the 17th of April I saw my master go out and bring in the prisoner - he asked him what he had, and laid hold of his apron, and my jacket fell out of it; I saw my other things at Bow-street - these are them; I had not seen the prisoner before.

            . I was standing at my bar. and saw the prisoner pass the passage with a bundle; my wife asked me if I knew who had gone out - I said No; I went out, and took the prisoner at the corner - I brought him back; he said he had been to see the pot-boy: I called in my pot-boy - he owned the things. but did not know the prisoner.
Prisoner's Defence. I was returning from Oxfordshire and met a man, who gave me a lift up to Covent-garden -I went and treated him; we got into company, and I sat drinking some time - I found I had had too much; I went to try to get a lodging, and lost a bundle, which I had in my hand - I thought this bundle was mine.

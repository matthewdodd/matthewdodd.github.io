On Wednesday, the 4th of November, I lost six mops; they are valued at half a crown; I missed them from the door, and was informed the prisoner took them; I ran after the prisoner, and took him in Piercy-street, Rathbone-place; he threw the mops down; I took him before he got farther than five or six yards from the place;

             took up the mops; the prisoner got away, but was not out of our sight; we took him again going along; he begged to go; he said it was the first time he ever did any thing of the kind.

On the 4th of November, I was getting in my pots, and I saw the prisoner take the mops from the door of Mrs. Willey; I kept the prisoner in sight till he was taken.

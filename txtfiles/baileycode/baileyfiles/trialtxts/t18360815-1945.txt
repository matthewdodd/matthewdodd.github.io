DENNIS LANE
. I live near the shop of Mr. Ambrose Bradley, a pawnbroker in Castle-street—I saw the prisoner up the court opposite, with a man and woman—I saw the man put a pair of trowsers into a basket which he had himself—they walked away with it to where Mr. Bradley's shop is—the prisoner took down the trowsers from Mr. Bradley's—she put them under her shawl, and ran away—I went and told the apprentice—he went in pursuit of her—she was taken soon after, with the trowsers in her possession—I am sure the prisoner is the person who took them—I had a good opportunity of seeing her when up the court—I noticed them when the first pair were brought there—they must have taken the other pair from some other shop.

Prisoner. He said he thought I was enough to pay for all, or he could have taken the man and the other woman.





GEORGE CARR
. I am a police-constable. The prisoner was given into my custody with the trowsers which I produce.





THOMAS JONES
. I am in the prosecutor's employ. These are his trowsers—I ran and took the prisoner in Pennington-street—as she was taking.

the trowsers from under her shawl to show them to two persons she had with her—I took her with them.

Prisoner. I had not had them five minutes, when he came and took me with them—I said I had just picked them up, which I had—he called me a thieving wretch.

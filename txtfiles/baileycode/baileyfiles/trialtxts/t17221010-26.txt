            , of St. James Westminster


, was indicted for 


               feloniously stealing out of the House of 
                     
                        
                           John Leonard 
                           Buck 
                        




                     
                   a Watch, value 8 l. 
            on the 5th of October
last. It appear'd that the Prosecutor, a Boy and 
               
                  John
                   Rose-Mason
               



            , lodg'd all in one Room; between 6 and 7 the Boy got up, and as he usually did lookt on the Prosecutor's Watch, which was by the bed side to see what was a Clock, and then leaving it there went down Stairs to work; about 7 the prisoner came to teach French to 
               
                  John 
                  Rosemasen 
               



            , and sitting down upon the Bed side, staid till 8 and then went away: about half an hour after the Prosecutor got up, and mist his Watch; next morning the prisoner did not come as usual, nor could they find him at Noon at a Cooks, where till then he constantly din'd, but meeting with him the day following, they askt him for the Watch: he said he knew nothing of it. Then tell me, said the other, where you was yesterday, carry me to all those places, and tell me how long you staid at each, that I may be satisfied you have not dispos'd of it. The prisoner told him he should not satisfy him. Why then, says the other, I shall charge a Constable with you. But I'll be gone first, says the prisoner. You're mistaken, says the other, for the Door's lockt. Well says the prisoner, let me go and I'll give you a Note, to pay you 10 l. if you don't find the Watch in 3 or 4 days. The Jury found him 


               Guilty to the value of 39 s.

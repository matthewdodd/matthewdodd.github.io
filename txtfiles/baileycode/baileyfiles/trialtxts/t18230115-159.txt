            . I am a solicitor
, and live in Essex-street, Strand


. On the 29th of December, I missed a coat and waistcoat, which were safe the night before, from my room on the second floor. I found it in pawn on Monday morning, in Ratcliff-highway. I heard the prisoner was in the house, and went to the East India Company's barracks, and took him. I saw a duplicate of the coat found upon him.

ISRAEL MYERS
 was indicted

 for stealing 1 handkerchief, value 2s; the goods of 



George Osborne, from his person; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






GEOROE OSBORNE.
 I am a wool-stapler, and live at Clapton. On the 15th of Feb., between five and six o'clock, I was going up Leadenhall-street—I felt a pull at my pocket—I turned, and saw the prisoner and another young man behind me—I felt, and my handkerchief was gone—I said, "You have taken my handkerchief"—the prisoner ran away—I followed him till a policeman took him—as we were going to the station we met Mr. Kerr, and he produced the handkerchief to me—it was mine—this is it.





ARCHIBALD KERR.
 I was in Leadenhall-street, near to Billiter-street—I saw the prosecutor turn and pursue the prisoner—I picked up this handkerchief on the where they ran from—there was no other man on that spot.

Prisoner. He said there was another party ran down Billiter-street. Witness. No, I did not.





JOHN M'DOUGALL
 (City police-constable, No. 659.) I saw the prisoner running, and took him—he was very violent, and asked what we wanted to do with him—there was an attempt made to rescue him.





JOHN HARVEY
 (police-constable G 118.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction at Clerkenwell—(read—Convicted Feb., 1846, and confined six months)—the prisoner is the person.

Prisoner. I have proof that that is false. Witness. I know it to be true—I have know him since he came out, and for a long time before—when I have seen him he has always been in company with thieves.




GUILTY. Aged 19.—


Transported for Seven Years.

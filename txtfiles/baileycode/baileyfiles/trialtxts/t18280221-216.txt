LOUIS CAILLIER. On the 29th of January I was near Charing-cross


, looking at two boys fighting; a boy told me my handkerchief was gone, and pointed out the prisoner; I went after him - he was stopped directly, just by Charing-cross; a very few yards off, and I took my handkerchief from inside his clothes, between his legs - my handkerchief was safe ten minutes before.

JOSEPH MELLISH. I met the prisoner at nine o'clock in the morning, on the 28th of February, in Kingsland-road; he was carrying a basket of tools and a saw, whichprojected out; which made me suspect him - I called him back, and asked whose they were; he said his own, that he had brought them from Enfield, and was going to London to look for work.

            . I live at Waltham-abbey. These tools and other articles are my property, and were taken from Enfield-lock


, where I was at work - I had left them in the shop on the Saturday night, and part of them in a chest; I found on the 28th of February, in the morning, that the shop door had been broken; I then found the chest had been broken open, and the tools strewed about; I had known the prisoner last June or July - he had been working there at haymaking, for Mr. Briggs.
Prisoner's Defence. A man gave me the things to carry.

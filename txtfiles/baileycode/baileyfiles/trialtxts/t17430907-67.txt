            . On the 21st of August coming Home pretty late, and finding out Family were in Bed, I sat upon the Monument Steps; the Prisoner said, Come along with me to Darkhouse Lane, and you shall lie with me for a Shilling; I said, Go about your Business, I will have nothing to say to you: She took my Hat and Wig off my Head, and run into Dumpling-Alley, I ran after her, and said, I am after you; I called the Watch, and presently after I saw her come out of the Alley; said I, Madam, where's my Hat and Wig; she said she knew nothing of them. I charged the Watch with her, and she said she saw the Wig lying in the Alley, and the Watchman found it; there I lost my Hat.
This was confirmed by the Watchman. 

               Guilty

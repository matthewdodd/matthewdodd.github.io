WILLIAM WILKINS
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
12th of December, 45 yards of cloth, called drill, value 2l. 5s., the goods of 



Samuel Sadler.






SAMUEL SADLER
. These forty-five yards of them of linen drill are my property—I saw this piece and another safe on my counter last Saturday, about four o'clock—I missed this piece afterwards.





WILLIAM BROWN
. I am porter to the prosecutor—he lived at No. 2, Watling-street. On Saturday last, I saw a person, who I believe was the prisoner, in our passage—he ran up the Old Change—I do not think he saw me—I followed him to Cheapside, and there lost him—I took him afterwards, and found this piece of drill under his arm.

Prisoner. Q. When you came to me in St. Martin's-le-Grand was I not walking? A. As soon as I saw you, I seized you—I took you back with the drill—you said at the warehouse that some person had given it to you.

Prisoner's Defence. A gentleman came to me at the corner of St. Paul's Church-yard, and asked me to take that as far as Jewin-street—I was to wait at the corner till he came, and he would give me one shilling—I told the porter so when he took me.




GUILTY
. Aged 21.—


Transported for Seven Years.

            . I am a paviour
 employed by the commissioners. On the 19th of December, in the evening, I was looking over my men in Newgate-street


; I observed the prisoner and another man loitering about; my people said they had observed them some time; in a few minutes I heard the cry stop thief; my men pursued, and took the prisoner: the other witness will give a farther account.
William Fullham. I was at work; the clothes were laid upon a post: I saw the prisoner take the coat and waistcoat, and run away; I pursued, calling stop thief; he dropped the clothes in Newgate-street; and he was stopped in Newgate-market by the butchers; (the clothes produced in court)

            . This coat is my property; I had left it upon a post, from whence the prisoner took it; the waistcoat is the property of the apprentice.
Prisoner's defence. 
I heard them call stop, thief, and a butcher stopped me; I know nothing about the things.

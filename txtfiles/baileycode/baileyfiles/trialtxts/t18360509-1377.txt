1377. 




JOHN DAVIS
 was indicted

 for a misdemeanor.






ALEXANDER LEE
. I was a practitioner in medicine, and live in Crown-square, Southwark. On the 1st of April the prisoner came to my house, and asked if I was Dr. Lee—he said he was sent by the captain of the Dundee, naming Captain Wishar; that there was a package on board directed to me, and it must be fetched before ten o'clock the next morning, otherwise it would be landed, and incur expense—I asked him if he had seen the package—he said yes, with my full name on it—I said, I supposed he expected something for it, and offered him 2d.; he objected, and said he must have 6d., and it was his privilege, as the pilot-boy, to have that—I have not received any such parcel—it was on the faith of his representing there was such a parcel that I gave it him.





JOHN WISHART
. I am Captain of the Dundee steam-boat. The prisoner had nothing to do with me—I never saw him in my life—I never had such a parcel as he describes for Mr. Lee.





JOHN BRADY
 (police-constable K 68.) I took the prisoner from Dr. Garmutz—he stated he came from Gravesend with a person, to bring up a boat loaded with timber, and he had duped six or seven; and what could they do? they could give him but three months, and he did not care a d—n for that.

Prisoner's Defence. I did it through distress—I had been walking about a long time, and had nothing.




GUILTY
. Aged 28.—


Transported for Seven Years.

            . The prisoner had lately been to sea
, and by his mother's request, I let him come to my room to have his meals, until he could get another ship. Between six and eight on the day in the indictment, he took these things away; he left his hat in the room, and took mine. I went in pursuit of him, but could not find him, and I did not hear of him any more not until the Thursday. On the Sunday before this happened, he had walked with me out to my brother's at Child's Hill, and after he had robbed me, I sent word to my brother, that if such a person should come there, he was to stop him. On the Thursday, I went up to my brother, in consequence of information, and there I found the prisoner, with my hat on his head.
SAMUEL PRICE. The prisoner came to me to sell a clock and a small market basket. I have the clock here.

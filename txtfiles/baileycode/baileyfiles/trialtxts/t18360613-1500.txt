THOMAS ARNOLD
. I am a policeman. On Sunday, the 29th of May, about twelve o'clock at night, I was on duty in Whitechapel-road, and saw the prisoner carrying a bundle—I stopped her and asked her what she had got there—she said "Some washing"—I asked where she was going to take it to—she said, to Lambeth-street—I asked where she brought it from—she gave two or three different accounts—I took her to the station-house, and found she had three gowns, two veils, a bit of quilling, and a bonnet.





ELIZABETH THOMPSON
. I am single, and live in Old Russell-street, Bedford-square East, near Whitechapel. The prisoner was in my service, and left about four months ago—I have seen the articles produced, they are

mine—I had seen them last in my own bed-room, on Sunday, the 29th of May—I took off one of the dresses about six o'clock that day—the prisoner had not been to the house, to my knowledge, that day—I have no ides how the things were taken—the policeman gave me information be fore I got up in the morning—nobody but myself and servant live in the house—my street door was left open in consequence of my servant mis-laying the key.





HANNAH DIXON

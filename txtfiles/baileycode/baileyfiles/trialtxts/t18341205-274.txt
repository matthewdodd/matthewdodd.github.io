THOMAS LANDBECK
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
9th of December, 1 cloak, value 2l. 10s., the goods of 



Charles Mumford.







JOSEPH BENNETT HANSON
. I am shopman to William Rotherham, of Shoreditch. On the 9th of December, about seven o'clock in the evening, the prosecutor came to my shop in his chaise, which remained at the door—I observed the prisoner standing behind the chaise—I saw him take a cloak from it, and run off with it—I immediately pursued, and caught hold of the cloak—he let go of it, and ran off—I pursued, crying "Stop thief," and the policeman stopped him in my presence—I am quite certain he is the man.

Cross-examined by
MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you lose sight of him? A. No; it was after daylight had gone—he was about a dozen yards from me—he did not turn any corner—the prosecutor was in the shop.





GEORGE LAWS
. I am a policeman. I heard an alarm of "Stop thief" given in Shoreditch—the prisoner was running—I stopped him, and took him into custody.





CHARLES MUMFORD
. I went to the shop, and left my cloak in my chaise—this is it.
(Thomas Brice, weaver, Waterloo-street, Haggerston, gave the prisoner a good character.)




GUILTY
. Aged 22.—


Transported for Seven Years.

Before Mr. Justice Littledale.

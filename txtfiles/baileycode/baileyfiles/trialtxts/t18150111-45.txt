             is a carman
 to Mr. Carter, the corner of Bell-alley.
Q. Do you know the prisoner - A. Yes. On the 5th of December, a quarter past six in the evening, I saw the prisoner and 
               
                  Barney
                  Short
               



            . Davy's coat was on the side of the cart. I saw the prisoner and 
               
                  Barney
                  Short
               



             loitering about the cart; I watched them a quarter of an hour; the prisoner at last went up to the cart, and took the coat, he gave the coat to 
               
                  Barney
                  Short
               



             in Bell-alley, they both run into London-wall; I there catched them both, I took them back to Mr. Carter's warehouse, and sent for Cartwright. This is the coat.

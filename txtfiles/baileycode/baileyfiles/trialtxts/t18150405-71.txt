            . I reside at Stratton, in Warwickshire. I packed up all the property mentioned in the indictment, and sent it with other packages by Messrs.



 Pickford's boat: the box was directed to Lady Skipwell, to be left at Paddington wharf. I saw my box again last Tuesday; the box appeared as if it had been opened.
EDWARD NICHOLLS. I am Captain of the Volunteer and Union boats. On Friday, the 31st of March, I saw the trunks and box put on board the Volunteer, which we received at Stratton; they were directed to Lady Skipwell, to be left at Paddington wharf; the packages were all safe and corded when I received them.
Q. Who navigated the Volunteer - 
               A. Joseph Ashford
             and 
               
                  Joseph 
                  Appleton
               



            . When we arrived at Paddington, one or two of them appeared strained, as if they had been plundered; I picked up a pair of gown sleeves at the bottom of the boat, just by where the box stood.

            . I was working the Union. The Union and Volunteer sailed in company together on the 2nd of April, as we were moving along past Uxbridge, I saw the two prisoners on board the Volunteer; the hay lay in the middle of the boat; one of the prisoners was ripping, and the other hammering; about five minutes before that, I saw Appleton with a chissel in his jacket pocket.

            . I saw the packages unloaded directed to Lady Skipwell; two or three of them appeared to have been broken open with a chissel, just by the lock.

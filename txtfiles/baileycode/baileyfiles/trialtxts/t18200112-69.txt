            . I live in Loman's-street, Borough, and am a smith
. On Friday last, about three o'clock in the afternoon, I was coming into the City, and was very near the watch-house on this side of the bridge; the prisoner came up, laid hold of my chain, and tried to get my watch out, but the chain broke; he got that with two seals and a key. I laid hold of the tail of his coat; he stooped to get under a coach. I kept hold of him, and we both fell together; Salmon and others came to my assistance. I dropped a coat from under my arm, and somebody ran off with it. He had a gang with him - I am certain it was him. I never let him go,

The prosecutor left his watch in a necessary house belonging to Mr. Bleward; where Thomas Flinn owned he found it hanging by the chain; and 
               
                  Barnard 
                  Flinn 
               



             carried it to 
               
                  Abraham 
                  Abrahams 
               



            , a watchmaker, and offered it to sale for 20 guineas. He and the watch were stopped. He said he bought it of 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Flinn 
               



             for three guineas, and thought at that time it was bath mettle [it was a gold dumb repeater]. Upon Thomas's examination, he said, that he sold it to him for three guineas; that he knew a gentleman had lost it who visited where he was footman, and that eight guinea were advertised as a reward for it; but that he thought that not enough.

            's Defence.
I saw it hanging in the necessary house. I put it in my pocket, and sold it to 
               
                  Barnard 
                  Flinn 
               



             for three guineas.

            's Defence.
I gave 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Flinn 
               



             Three guineas for it, and thought it was pinchbeck, and would have sold it again for such. I offered it for four. I was at the Spanish ambassador's, and there was a wager laid about it whether it was gold or not. There I was told it was worth ten pounds: I asked Mr. Abrahams twenty guineas for it, and after that sixteen. He called four persons to his character, who gave him a good one.

            , were indicted for 


               stealing, on the 21st of December
, 1 fixture, (i. e.) 1 copper, value 10s., the goods of 
                     
                        John 
                        Short
                     




                  , and fixed to a certain building of his
            .
JOHN SHORT. I am the owner of a building, No. 29, Salisbury-street, Lisson-grove, in the parish of St. Mary-le-bone


; I let it to Harwood; there was a copper set in the wash-house.

            . I lived in the house. On the morning of the 20th of December I saw the copper right in its place; I do not know whether it was taken on the 20th, 21st, or 22d, but on the morning of the 22d my daughter went into the wash-house, and it was gone; I have seen it since, at Mary-le-bone Office: it has not been fitted, but we measured it, and it is exactly the size; I have no doubt it is the same - it had been used a day or two before, and left in a dirty state. The prisoner must have got over the wall - there is no lock to the door.

                  WEBSTER
               



            . On the 21st of December, about half-past seven o'clock in the morning, I was with Gibbs, and saw the three prisoners coming down Lisson-grove; I had seen them at ten the night before, at a public-house - I crossed over to them, and Moss had this copper - I collared him; we took them all to the office. I asked how they got it; Moss said, "I suppose it to have been a plant of some other parties; we found it at the back ofMr. Hinton's:" I said, "Then you were altogether;" he said Yes. The copper was in a black bag.

            . I was with Webster. I took Roberts and Walters; Roberts' hands were a little black, with mortar; Walters' were black, but not so black as Roberts' - some duplicates were found on Roberts.
MOSS' Defence. I was coming by the back of Mr. Hinton's house, and found the bag; I went on, and met the other lads.
ROBERTS' Defence. I was walking with Walters - we met Moss, who said he had picked up an old copper, and was going to sell it.
WALTERS' Defence. We were not at any public-house the night before.


                  JAMES 
                  GIBBS
               



            . They were all at the Champion public-house.

            . I saw Moss and Roberts there.

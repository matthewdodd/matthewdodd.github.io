 was indicted

JAMES MITCHELL
 (police-constable G 145.) At half-past one o'clock, on Good Friday morning, I saw the prisoner in Goswell-street with this tub—he passed me—I said, "What have you got?"—he said, "A tub of mine"—I said, "What had it in it last?"—he said, "Water"—I found it had bad some wash for pigs in it—I took him to the station—I found Mr. Leaver's about 100 yards from there.





BENJAMIN LEAVER
. I am a coach-wheelwright. This is my tub—it was taken from my premises in Glasshouse-yard—I had seen it safe on the 22d—I know nothing of the prisoner—he had no right to have it—it was in an enclosed yard.

Prisoner's Defence, I saw the tub against a dust-heap when I went to the pump to get water—I took it up, as any one might.




GUILTY
*. Aged 19.—


Transported for Seven Years.

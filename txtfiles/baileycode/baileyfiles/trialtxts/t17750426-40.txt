            . I was in an inner room behind the shop. I heard a noise, I came out and saw the prisoner in my shop: at first I took him to be a customer, but observing him move cautiously to the door, I suspected him. I saw he had my till, I followed him, he dropped the till and the money, the money was picked up by the people who were there: I took my till up. I am positive the prisoner is the man, I saw him in the shop with the till.

            . I came to the prosecutor's assistance. I saw the prisoner first drop the till: he took some out in his hand, he dropped the rest.

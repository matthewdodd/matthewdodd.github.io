            , in the New-road. On the 28th of July, about six o'clock, a little girl gave me information, I saw the prisoner go up the area steps, I called out stop him; I pursued him, he was stopped about six yards from my master's house, he had the things with him at the time, and brought them all back to the door; upon examining it, it was all the articles mentioned in the indictment. I went into the kitchen and saw they all had been taken out of the drawer. I had seen them all in the drawer at four o'clock. The prisoner said I had got all the things again, I might as well let him go.
- WHITEHAIR. I am a constable. I took charge of the prisoner; he said two gentlemen coming by, they said, if he would go down into the gentleman's house and bring the things up they would give him half a crown.
Prisoner's Defence. I am not guilty.

ELIZABETH HUGHES
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
28th of April, 1 tobacco-box, value 3d.; 1 sovereign, and 2 shillings; the goods and monies of 



George Barber.






GEORGE BARBER
. I am a brass-founder, and lodge in Bloomsbury. On the 28th of April I fell in with the prisoner in Broad-street, St. Giles's—I was the worse for liquor, but I knew what I was about—I went home to her lodging, in Jones-court, and went up stairs—it was about one o'clock in the morning—we went to bed, and I fell asleep—I awoke about three o'clock, and found she had left the room—I found my clothes in the chair, but my tobacco-box and money was gone—the sovereign had been in my watch pocket, and the 2s. 2 1/2 d. in my trowsers pocket—I had given her 2s. before that—I put on my clothes, and went to the station—the policeman went with me to the room, and she was not there—I went again a little after six o'clock, and found her there—I took a policeman, and took her—when we went to bed I fastened the door with a bolt, and I put a knife in the crack as well.

Prisoner. He gave me the sovereign instead of a shilling, and then he said if I would not give it him back, he would give me in charge—he left the tobacco-box in the room.





HENRY BUTLER
 (police-constable E 117.) I received information that the prosecutor had been robbed of a sovereign and 2s. 2 1/2 d.—I went to Jones-court, and found a police-constable engaged with the prisoner and struggling, and in assisting him the prisoner's clothes flew open, and this tobacco-box fell from her bosom.





MATTHEW WEDGEWOOD
 (police-constable E 93.) I took the prisoner—in going along Bain bridge-street, she gave up this purse with 2s. 2 1/2 d. in it—she said she would give up the money if I would let her go.




GUILTY
. Aged 21.—


Transported for Seven Year.

Prisoner's defence.
The prosecutor brought me from a sick bed in the workhouse; and would have made it up with me for 12 s. last Monday.
Q. to prosecutor. Did you make him any such proposal?
Prosecutor. I was loth to take away his life; and I did say, if I could have that money paid, I would not meddle with him.

Court. You did a very bad thing.

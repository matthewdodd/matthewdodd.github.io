1616. 




CHARLES NEWCOMB
, was indicted

 for feloniously forging, and uttering, on the 
19th of May, at 
St. Saviour, Southwark, a certain bill of exchange for £35 6s. 6d., with intent to defraud 



Charles Barclay and others.


MR. BODKIN
conducted the Prosecution.

(After the case was opened, the prisoner applied to plead guilty to uttering the bill, but the following evidence was called.)





GEORGE CHICKLEY STANLEY
. I am clerk to Charles Barclay and others, brewers, carrying on business in Southwark—we have a customer named Malyon, who keeps the Coopers' Arms—on the 19th of May, I was attending at the counting-house—the prisoner delivered me this bill and letter, and a cheque of £35 was given him, which has since been returned as paid, by our bankers.





JOSEPH MALYON
. This letter is not my writing, nor was it written by my authority—I know nothing of any application of this sort being made to Messrs. Barclay—I never sent them this bill—the endorsement on it is not mine—the prisoner is not my nephew—(letter read.)
"Coopers' Arms, Mitre-lane.
" Gentlemen,—Having been disappointed in the receipt of some money within the last week, and having very heavy expenses just now, in consequence of having my premises enlarged by throwing two houses into one, I should feel exceedingly obliged to you if you would lend me £25 till Monday next, when it shall be punctually paid, against the enclosed bill, which I send you as a collateral security.





JOSEPH MALYON
.

"P. S. Should you be kind enough to grant me this favour, please to give it to my nephew, the bearer hereof."




GUILTY of uttering. Aged 19.—


Transported for Life.

Before Mr. Common Sergeant.

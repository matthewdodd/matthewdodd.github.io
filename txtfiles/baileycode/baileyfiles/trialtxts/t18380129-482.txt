On the 13th of January, between ten and eleven o'clock at night, I was in Cateaton-street, with this lines which was clean, and was in a cart—there was a young man in the cart with me—the clothes were in a bundle—I observed the prisoner just the pavement, near the cart, with a bundle on his arm, walking away with it—the young man stopped the horse, got out, and pursued the proud who was brought back by the watchman, with the bundle, almost immediately.





JOHN CHEEDLEY

(Property produced, and sworn to.)

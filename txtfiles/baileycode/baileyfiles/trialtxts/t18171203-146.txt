            . I am servant to Messrs. James, John, and George Deboos, who are silk-dyers


, and live in Vinecourt, Spitalfields. On the 6th of November I went to Messrs. Fulten and Co's., in Watling-street, and received fifty pieces of silk gauze, and two pieces of silk handkerchiefs, which I put into a white bag, and took them to the Fountain and Star, public-house, Castle-court, Lawrence-lane, Cheapside, which is a house of call for dyers, and there put them into a cart; and when I got to Fort-street, Artillery-ground, I found they were gone; they were placed near the bottom of the cart - They could not have jostled out.
Cross-examined. I got home a little after five o'clock; I did not stop after I left Lawrence-lane-it must have happened between five and half-past five o'clock; it was the evening that the Princess Charlotte died. I rode in the cart-the tail-board was fast.


                  WILLIAM 
                  BROOMHAM
               



            . I am servant to Messrs. Deboos. I was at the house of call in Castle-court, with Jarvis - I put the goods in the cart - They were in a white bag - I walked home. Between five and six o'clock I saw Jarvis, in Fort-street, the bag was then gone; another bag was cut by somebody.
Cross-examined by MR. REYNOLDS. It was ten minutes after five o'clock, on the 6th of November-it must have been lost between five and six o'clock; the cart got to Fort-street before me.
MR. GEORGE DEBOOS. I am in partnership with James and 
               
                  John 
                  Deboos
               



            , as we are silk-dyers. On the 6th of November, fifty pieces of gauze and two pieces of handkerchief were coming to our house. I endeavoured to trace the property. On the 24th of November I received information, and went to Mrs. Phelps, a silk-dresser, in Osborne-street - she finishes silk after it is dyed. I saw four or five pieces of gauze, and two pieces of handkerchief, which I had reason to believe were part of the goods sent to me by Messrs. Fulton - I expected to receive fifty pieces of gauze, and two pieces of handkerchiefs, from Fulton's - I went to Messrs. Fulton on the day of the robbery, and he gave me ten pieces of the same sort - I compared them - I Judge them to be of the same manufacture; I took Mr. Fulton to see them. On the 25th of November I made enquiry, which led me to the prisoner, Sherwin's, house; I saw him, and told him I had come to make inquiry respecting some gauze which he had dyed, and sent to Mrs. Phillips - He is a dyer; I asked him if he knew of whom he had them? he said he had them from a stranger, whom he did not know; he delivered me an invoice which he had received of the man; I asked him what day it was delivered to him? he said he believed about the 12th of November; the invoice corresponds with the number lost-there is only a quarter of a yard difference in measure.
Q. Is the invoice in a business-like form - A. Certainly not; it ought to have the name to it. It only says-(reads)"50 pieces, 534 yards, 2 pieces of handkerchiefs, 24 yards." In the course of the transaction, I observed thirty pieces of gauze and two pieces of handkerchief at Phillips's, being a deficiency of twenty pieces of gauze. Sherwin having given me this account on that night, the 25th of November, his wife observed, in his presence, that she wished we had been there half an hour sooner, for that the person who brought the goods had been there, and that she expected to see him again about eleven o'clock next morning. My brother, and Armstrong, the officer, accompanied me. I desired Sherwin, that if the person came next morning, to detain him, and send for me; I did not say I should be there. I left that night, and next morning Armstrong, and myself, went there, a little after eleven o'clock, and asked Sherwin's permission to wait there; we staid till after four o'clock, and no person came; about four o'clock he received a two-penny post letter. After reading it, he handed it to me-(reads)-"Mr. Sherwin-In consequence of the hurry of business, I am under the necessity of immediately leaving town for Coventry, and will be obliged to you to get the remainder of the gauzes done, and sent to me, directed to X.Y.Z., to be left at the Craven Arms, Coventry." He having shewn me the letter, I consulted Armstrong, and desired Sherwin to write an answer; he declined answering it himself; an answer was wrote by another person, and read to him; he went for a friend of his to write it-the purport of it was, that he would not deliver the goods for any person but the one they had come from, and that, on the delivery, he expected the money to be paid; it was signed with Sherwin's name, and directed to X.Y.Z., Craven Arms, Coventry. I told Sherwin if he heard from him to let me know.
Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. He said he believed he received them on the 12th. He was a silk-dyer.
Q. Is it not common for one dyer to send things to another when there is a particular hurry - A. Yes.
Q. You yourself said you would have taken the goods coming in the same way - A. No - We always have names delivered with the invoices.
Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. I saw them at Mrs. Phillips's, and believe them to be the same.
MR. CURWOOD. Q. Is it in the course of business to take fifty pieces at a time without having the customer's name - A. Certainly not; the bill which should have come to me with the goods was signed Fulton and Co.
Court. Q.Sherwin declined answering the letter - A. Yes; and gave as a reason, that the person whom he sent for was in the habit of doing his writing.


                  HENRY 
                  FULTON
               



            , ESQ. I live in Watling-street, and am a wholesale dealer in gauzes and muslins. On the 6th of November a quantity of articles were sent from my house to Messrs. Deboos; a bill was sent with them, with our names to it, dated November 6th. I went with Mr. Deboos to Phillips's house, on the 24th or 25th of November, and saw thirty pieces of black-striped gauze and two pieces of handkerchiefs - They had been dyed after they left my house. I have not a doubt of their being my property, and part of the goods I sent to Messrs. Deboos.
Cross-examined by MR. REYNOLDS. I had not sent any goods elsewhere-Sherwin was a stranger to me.
JOHN ARMSTRONG. I am an officer. I have the thirty pieces of gauze and two pieces of handkerchiefs, which were delivered to me at the office by Mr. Robinson. I was at Sherwin's with Mr. Deboos, on the 24th or 25th of November.

WILLIAM ROBINSON. I am servant to Harriet Phelps, who is a silk-dyer, and live in Ormond-place, Whitechapel. I gave Armstrong the gauze on the 2d of December - They were brought to me by the prisoner, Sherwin's, wife; sixteen pieces of the gauze were brought on or about the 17th of November. When I fetched them down to dress, I suspected they might be part of the silk Mr. Deboos had lost; I immediately gave him notice of it; he came, and saw them; I had only sixteen pieces of gauze and two pieces of handkerchiefs. We settled that if any more came I should let him know. Next day, about five o'clock, Sherwin's wife brought the remainder, making in all thirty pieces. I informed Mr. Deboos; he, and Mr. Fulton, came and examined them; before that, I had received ten pieces from Mrs. Sherwin, of the same kind exactly, which were returned on the 21st of November, and would make forty pieces of gauze and two pieces of handkerchiefs. I returned them as I dressed them; his wife brought them, and paid for them.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
MR. FULTON re-examined. The dyer does not get the goods dressed - We send them to be dressed ourselves.
MR. DEBOOS re-examined. It is not customary for the dyer to get them dressed; I never knew an instance of the kind, not even in goods that are sent from the country.


                  FRANCES 
                  PAYTON
               



            , JUN. I was in the service of the prisoner Brown, who is a silk-weaver; my mother lives in Wheeler-street, Spitalfields; I live in Brown's house, No. 6, George-street, Bethnal-green. On the 26th of November last he gave me a bag, which he said contained worsted, to take to my mother; I took it, and left it by her bedside; I did not know what was in it. I left it there; my mother was in the room at the time. He told me to leave it there, and call for it by-and-by.
Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. I have lived one year with him. I used frequently to carry things to the dyers. My mother was taken up after I took the bag there; I saw her before she was taken up, at my brother's, in Air-street, but I did not tell her I had put it there. I told her I was going to take some worsted to the dyer's and would leave it there, and call for it by-and-by.
Q. On your oath, did you say one word before the magistrate about the bag containing worsted; did you not say your master told you to take it to the dyer's, without saying what it contained - A. I do not recollect it; I swear that he said it was worsted - He never mentioned any dyer.
Q. Then what did you mean by telling the magistrate that you meant to take it to Walker's, as you knew he was your master's dyer - A. I know I said so, but my master said nothing of the kind.
Q. Did you not tell your mother you would get her out of the mess, and get Brown in - A. No. I am positive he said the bag contained worsted.
Court. Q.You lived with Brown until the 26th of November - A. Yes; he went out of town for a week to see his brother, about three-months before this. If he had gone to Coventry I must have known it.
FRANCES PAYTON, SEN. I am the mother of the last witness - I am a widow; she lived servant with the prisoner Brown. On the Wednesday before the Friday that I was taken up, about twelve o'clock, she came to my room with a bag-about half-past nine o'clock at night, I found it by my bedside; my other daughter came in, I shewed her the bag; she brought Mrs. Gable into the room - We opened it; it contained twenty pieces of black and striped gauze. Next morning the prisoner, Brown, called at my house about nine o'clock, and asked if Fanny had brought any thing to our house. I told him she had not, but I had found a bag behind my bed. Mrs. Gable came out, and said there were gauzes in the bag. Brown said she seemed to know more about it than he did, for he had it as worsted. Nothing more passed. I had orders from a man whom I had seen at Brown's more than once, to take it from my room. I had orders from Brown himself to take the bag from my house to Bishopsgate-street; I did so about half-past twelve o'clock on Thursday, the day after they were left. I met Brown in the street, and gave him the bag. I was apprehended for stealing them and discharged, and told all I knew about it.
Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Did you tell the magistrate one word about meeting Brown in Bishopsgate-street - A. Yes; and that he took the bag from me; my daughter told me she was going to Walker's, the dyer, with the worsted, and that her master ordered her. I did not find the bag until I went to bed at night.
Q. Did you not tell the magistrate another person came for the bag, and not Brown - A. I was so alarmed that I hardly knew what I said; I am sure he took it from me in Bishopsgate-street.


                  ANN 
                  GABLE
               



            . I live in the same house with Payton. I was called into her room on the Wednesday night, by 
               
                  Charlotte 
                  Payton
               



            , between ten and eleven o'clock, and was shown the bag, which contained twenty pieces of striped silk gauze. I was in the room next morning, and saw Brown come in about half-past nine o'clock - I knew him before; he asked for the bag of worsted which Fanny had left. She said, she did not know that Fanny had left any bag, but there was a bag, and she did not know to whom it belonged-Brown had got the bag on a chair when I went in. I told him, if it was worsted there was no such thing there, and he had no right to take it away without an officer. He said, I seemed to know more about what was in the bag than he did, and he would go and fetch the man who gave it to him. He left it there.
Court. Q. Before he left, did you tell him what you thought about it - A. Yes, I told him I thought they were stolen goods. He said, he would find the man who gave it to him. He asked Payton who else had seen the bag? she said the neighbours in the next room had. I said my husband and son had seen it. He asked how old my son was? I told him he was twenty-six years old. The same day I saw Mrs. Payton take the bag away.


                  CHARLOTTE 
                  PAYTON
               



            . I am the daughter of 
               
                  Frances 
                  Payton
               



            . I went home to my mother's about ten o'clock, and saw the bag in the room. I called Mrs. Gable, and we opened it-it contained twenty pieces of striped silk black gauze-it was put by the bedside.
Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. It could not be seen without going round the bed.


                  JOSEPH 
                  PAYTON
               



            . I am the son of Mrs. Payton, am a silk-weaver, and live in Air-street. I heard my mother was taken up, and went to Brown about it. I told him my mother was in custody about the bag; he said he would endeavour to get her out of the embarrassment next morning - He did not ask me what bag it was. I went to him in consequence of what I had heard from my sister. I called on him about nine o'clock next morning, to meet him by appointment, but he was not there. I did not see him again till he was in custody.


                  JOHN 
                  BAGG
               



            . I am a silk-dresser, and live in Flying Horse-yard, Brick-lane. On a Friday in November, the prisoner, Sherwin's, wife brought me a piece of silk striped gauze to dress, of the same pattern as those produced; she then brought me thirteen pieces of gauze and two pieces of handkerchiefs. I was not able to dress them; she had them away undressed. Those produced are the same. I dressed ten pieces for her, and gave her ten back undressed.
Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. I have dressed garments for her before. I tacked them down with whiteybrown thread.
ANN GABLE. One of the pieces in the bag was tacked with whitey-brown thread.


                  REBECCA 
                  DOWNS
               



            . I am a weaver. I rented a first-floor in the prisoner, Brown's, house - He has written me receipts for my rent - I know his hand-writing (looks at the letter sent to Sherwin). I verily believe it to be his handwriting.
Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. I have seen him write twice. I should think it his writing, without comparing it with my papers.
Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. If you had not compared it, could you have sworn it to be his writing - A. No.
CHARLES BUSHER. I am a dyer, and live in Stephen-street, Mile-end. The prisoner, Brown, sends me silks to dye-the goods are accompanied with an invoice signed with his name. I believe the letter to be his hand-writing.
Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. I believe it to be his hand-writing. He has brought invoices to me.
BROWN's Defence. The singularity of the day on which I am charged with this robbery, leaves every circumstance fresh in my recollection. On that day, Mr. 
               T. 
            Picard came to my house, about twelve o'clock, and told me of the death of the Princess, and said it would be prudent in me to go and buy black goods of persons who were not aware of it. I went to Mr. Bunner's for Bombazeen, he referred me to another person - He had sold his. I went home, and told my wife what had happened, collected all my own goods, and sent them to Coster's, in Lad-lane. I then went to Cateaton-street for some silk; from thence to Messrs. Everett's bank to receive a cheque-from thence to Mr. Hall's, in Brown's-lane, and bought some silk. I then went to Mr. 
               T. 
            Picard's, in Wells-street, he had called on me before - He invited me to tea with him at four o'clock (it is stated that the robbery was committed at five, or half-past five). To prove I was not there, I call Mr. 
               T. 
            Picard and others. After remaining there till about seven o'clock I went home.


                  THOMAS 
                  PICARD
               



            . I am a weaver, and live in Wells-street, Spitalfields. The prisoner, Brown, is my brother-in-law. On the 6th of November, when the Princess Charlotte died, at twelve o'clock that day I saw him at his house in George-street, Bethnal-green, which is three or four minutes' walk from my house. George-street is about ten minutes' walk from Fort-street; if a person walks fast they may go there in less than ten minutes. I saw him again about a quarter after four o'clock, he came to my house alone, and waited there till a quarter before six; he was in my house all the while - He was never out of my sight long enough to go to Fort-street and back again.
Cross-examined by MR. CURWOOD. He came about a quarter after four o'clock - I looked at the clock soon after he went away, it was six by my clock. 
               
                  George 
                  Picard
               



            , Mr. Butfoy, and Mrs. Lamthois were there.
Court. Q. How far is Fort-street from your house - A. About five minutes' walk. My clock is in the work-shop. I was not particularly busy that day. I was not examined at the office. I had no particular reason for remembering that I looked at the clock - I never told any person so.


                  GEORGE 
                  PICARD
               



            . I live with Thomas Picard. The prisoner, Brown, came there about four o'clock, or a quarter after, on the day that the Princess died, and staid till about five minutes after six. I do not think he was out of the house between those times. The first time that I knew it would be of consequence to know the time was the Monday after he was taken up.
Cross-examined by MR. MARSHAM. The house is about five minutes' walk from Fort-street. There were only my uncle, the apprentice, and myself at tea-Brown drank tea with us. After tea I went to Mrs. Lamthois's room. Brown gave me some silk to look at. I have never heard the time that the robbery was committed.
Q. Up to this moment, you never heard the time - A. I have heard it was between five and six o'clock; but there were so many stories about it, I paid no attention to them. I heard of it the day he was apprehended.
Court. Q. How long after this day did you hear of his being taken - A. I do not know - I should think it more than a fortnight.
Prisoner BROWN. Q. Do you remember that there was a newspaper on the table at tea, and you read it - A. Yes, I believe it was the Daily Advertiser-it was the morning paper of the day before.
ABIAH BUTFOY. I am a gold and silver lace weaver, and live in Mr. Picard's house. I was at work in my room on the 6th of November, the prisoner, Brown, came there, the first time, about twelve o'clock; he went away, and came again at four o'clock, and staid there about an hour and a half. I saw him talking in Mrs. Lamthois's room - I do not know when he left the house.
Cross-examined. I am sure I saw him there at twelve o'clock that day, at Mr. Picard's house. He could not have been anywhere else at twelve o'clock. I think that he left it about half-past five. When he came at twelve o'clock, he was talking with Thomas Picard about the death of the Princess. Brown was taken up four or five days after.
ELIZA LAMTHOIS. I have an apartment in Thomas Picard's house. The prisoner, Brown, married my sister, and was in the habit of frequently coming to the house. On the 6th of November he was there about four o'clock - He had been there about two o'clock before. Picard went out about twelve o'clock, saying he was going to Brown's. The prisoner, Brown, first came at two o'clock; Butfoy was at home. 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Picard
               



             was out at twelve o'clock-the prisoner, Brown, went away and returned about four. I had heard of the death of the Princess when he came at two o'clock. He drank tea with my brother - He went away a little before six o'clock - He came down, talked to me, and left my room about six. His wife desired me to come to her last Saturday. I perfectly recollect the time of his being at my room.
Cross-examined by MR. MARSHAM. I believe he was in the house at one o'clock, went away, and came again at two o'clock - He went away again, and returned at four.

Elizabeth Goad. I live at the Grange Inn, Carey Street


; my husband's name is Thomas. On the 26th of September, I put six 36 s. pieces, two guineas, and some silver, into a bag, and put it into a drawer in the bar. I missed the two guineas the next day. The prisoner was recommended to us as an object of charity; we took him in about three weeks before, and he had done a little fault or two before. He was out of the way, I sent a man after him. He was brought back the Friday following; we searched him and found no money upon him. He owned he had given the money to a chairman who was with him when he was taken, and said he found one of the guineas in the sand; after that he confessed taking both. Part of the money was gone; I had a guinea, half a crown, a shilling, and four halfpence, from the chairman.
Prisoner. I have neither father nor mother, and am not quite thirteen years old.

            . I am a labourer
, and live in Essex-court, Park-street, Borough


. On the 24th of February, between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning, I missed my musket out of the passage. I went after the prisoner, and took him at Ratcliff-cross, between twelve and one o'clock that day, with the musket on his arm. I was informed he had gone that way, pursued him, and took him. I am certain he is the man.

            . I am an officer. I took the prisoner in charge on the 24th of February, with the musket. He made his escape from the office, and was taken again. I am sure he is the man.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
- I am an officer. I was bringing the prisoner to Newgate; he broke from me and ran down Newgate-market - I lost him, but retook him again about fifteen days after, and am sure he is the man. He had the marks of the handcuffs on his wrist that he ran away with.

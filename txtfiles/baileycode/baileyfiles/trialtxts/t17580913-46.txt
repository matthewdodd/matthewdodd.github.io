            , was indicted for 


               stealing a pair of linnen sheets, one bolster, and one blanket, the property of

                  Elizabeth 
                  Gallt 
               



            . I am wife to 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Gallt 
               



            , we live in Gardners-lane


; I let the prisoner a ready furnished lodging, 6 weeks ago, at 2 s. per week; she was only one month in the room, she went away and took the key with her.
Q. Had she a husband?
Gallt. Yes; she paid for three weeks, and her husband paid for the lodging last week; but he never cohabited an hour with her in my house; I took her up, and she confess'd she took the things, and that she sold the feathers out of the bolster and bed for 7, 9, and 13 d. per pound, and afterwards sold the tick.
Jos. Nollet. I am a pawn-broker; the prisoner pawned a pair of sheets with me, on the 28th of July, for 18 d. (Producing them in court, and deposed to by the prosecutrix.)

            . I heard the prisoner own before the justice, the taking the things mentioned, and what she did with them.
Prisoner. I beg the court will be as favourable to me as possible.



               Guilty

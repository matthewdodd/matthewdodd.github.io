                  , seven one-pound bank notes, his property
            .
ANN COYSGAN. The prisoner was a servant
 in our house. I missed the notes in question while she was in our service, from my drawer, which was locked. Her box was searched, and a one-pound note and twenty one shillings in silver were discovered. At first she said she got this money in her wages from her last place; she said some hand writing on the note was her mistress hand writing. There was also some new linen drapery discovered in her box.
MARGARET DOHAN. The prisoner lived with me. I look at this note, there is no hand-writing of mine on it.



               GUILTY
            , aged 24.




               Transported for Seven Years
            .
Second Middlesex Jury, before Mr. Recorder.

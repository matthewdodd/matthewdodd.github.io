                     Anslow 
                  



                
            , 
               
                  
                     Ann 
                     Thomas 
                  



                
            , and 
               
                  
                     Hannah 
                     Low 
                  



                
            , was indicted for 


               privately stealing a Silver Watch, value 5 l. and 20 s. from the Person of

                  Palmer 
                  Grice 
               



            . About Eleven at Night I met 
               
                  Jenny 
                  Anslow 
               



            ; Sir, says she, It's very cold, will you give me a Dram? Aye, says I, Will you go to a Brandy shop? No, says she, We can't have an Opportunity at a Brandy-shop, but at my Lodging in Old-Bedlam


 we may. So I went with her, and when we came to the Door, 
               
                  Ann 
                  Thomas 
               



            , her Landlady let us in, and we went up Stairs. I gave her Landlady 6 d. to fetch a Dram, and then Jenny and I sat down together, and she making very free with my Breeches, got my Watch away before I was aware: But as soon as I mist it, I charged her with picking my Pocket; upon which, 
               
                  Ann 
                  Thomas 
               



             and 
               
                  Hannah 
                  Low 
               



             came in and rescued her, and so they all ran out of the House. The Watch-man coming his Rounds, I called him in, and told him my case, and he called a Constable; we searched two or three Houses in the Neighbourhood, and at last we met with 'em all three; and the Constable found my Watch under Jenny Anslow's Arm-Pit.
The Constable confirmed the finding the Watch.


                  Jane 
                  Anslow 
               



            . This Man met me, and would needs go home with me, whereof when I came home, he said, he would give me a Crown to oblige him. He pull'd out half a Guinea and bid me give him Change, but I told him I could not; and then he said he'd leave me his Watch in pawn; but when I had obliged him, he wanted his Watch again without any Money; whereof I told him, I could not afford to work for nothing; especially, as I had taken so much Pains, for I wore out a Bunch of Rods before I could make any thing of him.
The Jury found Anslow 


               guilty to the value of 10 d.
             and 

               acquitted
             the other two.

               Q. 
            Where do you live? - A. In East-Smithfield


, I keep a public-house
; the prisoner came to lodge with me, he went to bed about eleven o'clock at night, and instead of going to bed in the same room that he had slept in two nights before, he went to another room.

Q. 
            How do you know that? - 
               A. 
            Because I heard him get up in the morning, I slept under him; my son got up and went out to work, and then the prisoner got up; I heard him walking backwards and forwards from the room where he slept, to the room in which he had slept before,without his shoes, at last he came down stairs; I called, who is there, he said, Martin; my wife went up stairs immediately, but I did not miss any thing; when she got up, between seven and eight, she missed the things from the other room.

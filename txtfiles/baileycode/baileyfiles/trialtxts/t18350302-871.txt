JOHN GOLDSPRING
. I keep a shop in Blackfnars-road, opposite the Surrey Theatre. I had this looking-glass outside my shop window—I lost it on the 4th of February, about eight o'clock in the evening—I can swear it is mine—it was within ten feet of the other goods—the window is railed round.





GEORGE RUTLAND
. I was going by the prosecutor's shop about eight o'clock that evening—I saw the prisoner take this glass and stand—I followed, and took him back to the shop.





RICHARD ARNOLD

JOHN KINSEY
. I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction (read)—I know he is the person.

             sworn.
I live at Hyde-park-lodge, Kensington-gate


; between the hour of eleven, on the 15th of June, and five in the morning, of the 16th, there were three holes hored, two above the staple, which was locked with a padlock, which had been made with a center bit, and one below; at eleven at night the place was safe; the kitchen adjoins to the house, but is separate.
Is it under the same roof as the house? - No, it is adjoining; I got up between five and six the next morning, the 16th of June; the door was broke open, the staple drawn, the lock laying down, and the things in the indictment were missing; there were the hatchet and center bit hid in some nettles, which were found by the Lieutenant of the barracks, and he concluded to put the things there again, after they were taken away; he lent me two of his men, and I watched with them; in the evening the two prisoners came, a few minutes after the Lieutenant left me, to a part of the wall where people get over; they were withinside the park, they looked in the nettles, and then sat themselves down; I went immediately over, and gave information to the quarter-master; he sent me to the Lieutenant; when we came back, the prisoners were got up, and leaning over the rails; they were taken into custody, and in Bishop's pocket I found a small bag, a garden knife, and two or three sheets of paper; he said that was all he had about him; a soldier took notice of something in his coat sleeve that looked bright, and we found the scissars upon him, and a wire that was to them, lay close to the door; the things were not taken away from the nettles.
Prisoner. I never saw the wire, I found the scissars in Hyde-park.

             sworn.
I was walking in the park for the air, and I saw these things lay among the nettles, under the wall, and I took them up in my hand; there were two or three iron bars in one place, and a hatchet, and a curtain rod in another place; I took them to Mr. Wadham, hearing he had been robbed; he said they were his; I left them with him.

             sworn.
The prisoner Bishop, after he was taken up, was left in our care, while the prosecutor went for a constable, and I saw him conceal something under his left arm; I did not take any notice of it at that time, till the constable came and searched him; he missed that place; then I asked him what was the matter with his arm that he carried it so stiff; he said nothing was the matter with it; I told him then he had got something underneath it; then he said he had nothing; I told him he had, and it was something that was bright; the constable searched, and found these scissars; he said he picked them up in the park.

             sworn.
I produce the scissars, which I found on Bishop; (deposed to by the two points being broke off) I have had them about two years and a half; I gave ten pence for them.

             sworn.
After this man was taken, I was standing by, and I saw the center bit fall from Bishop; the constable was standing by at the time.
PRISONER BISHOP'S DEFENCE.
I found the scissars in Hyde-park; when I was taken up, I had this pair of scissars in my hand; one of the soldiers asked me what it was; I said it was a pair of scissars; the man brought the center bit to me, and asked me what it was; the night they charged me with this, I was in my lodging from ten to six.
PRISONER MANNING'S DEFENCE.
When I was taken up and examined before Sir Sampson, I desired him to send to the woman where I lodged; I was at home all night, and got up in the morning, and went to Covent-Garden, to see for something to do, and Bishop came up. and said what are you out of employ? I said yes; says he, I am not in any employment, if you will go with me towards Kensington, I can get you some employment; I went with him, and going through Hyde-park, he had some grave; in his shoes; he sat down to take the gravel out, and I sat down by him, and we were going away, and the soldier came and took us up; we were in the barracks near an hour before we knew what we were taken up for; I never saw Bishop before that morning.

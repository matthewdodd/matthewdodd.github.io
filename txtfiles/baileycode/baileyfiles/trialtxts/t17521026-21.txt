            . I am servant to Drury Otley. Esq; On the 23d of september I was up ironing in the laundry over the kitchen, adjoining to the dwelling-house. I went to bed about twelve, and left the goods, mentioned in the indictment, in the laundry; some hanging up to dry on the horse. The sashes were down, but the shutters not done up. The door opens into a passage. The window that the thief got in at is in the servants hall, then through the kitchen, and through the scullery; then up stairs, and through the passage into the laundry. I came down stairs about eight o' clock, then Margaret Wade went up into the laundry, and missed the things.

                  Wade 
               



            . I am servant to Mr. Otley. I was in the laundry between ten and eleven o'clock that night, and saw the things mentioned there; about eight the next morning I went there again, and they were all taken away.

            . I am constable. On a Sunday morning, the latter end of September, about ten in the morning, I was sent for to 'Squire Otley's, and told of this robbery: in the evening I heard there were two people at Hounslow had some of these aprons and handkerchiefs on; I went there, and found the two prisoners in Hesson cage, with another woman and a man, as also the best part of the things about them. I found one of the handkerchiefs about Little's neck, and one or two in her pocket, and an apron on: Richens had one handkerchief about her neck, and a pair of shoes and stockings. There were two aprons, and a red cloak in the man's pocket. I found also a shift pawned at Hounslow for a shilling. This man swore before Justice Burkhead, he took the things he had in his pocket from Little.
[Produced in court, all but the shoes and stockings, which they did not take from Richens, and deposed to by 
               
                  Anne 
                  Osbourne 
               



            , as part of the goods lost, and mentioned in the indictment, mentioning whose property. &c.]

                  Harwood 
               



            . I am servant to Mr. Otley; all the windows and doors were fastened that night by me about twelve o'clock. The window that the thieves got in at is in the servants hall; I am sure no pane was then broke in it, but in the morning I found a pane broke.
Q. Did you see it first in the morning?
S. Harwood. No, our coachman did, but he is not here.
Richens's Defence.
That girl [meaning Little] came down to me on that Sunday morning, and bid me put on one of these handkerchiefs, an apron, and a cap.
Little's Defence.
As I came from work on Saturday night, a black man, servant to the gentleman, gave me these things.
Both 


               guilty of felony only
            .
For Richens, see her trial, Numb. 119, in Alderman Winterbottom's Mayoralty.

            . On the 14th of May I lost a silk capuchin, a white linen gown, a ruffled shirt, a cambrick handkerchief, and a pair of leather pumps; the Prisoner was taken that night, as I understood, and he did acknowledge the taking these things.
Maltus Paine. I am a pawnbroker in Bow-street, Bloomsbury. On Monday, the 9th of May, the Prisoner brought me a silver hilted sword, and, on the 14th of May, he brought these things, and I stopped him and the things too. The sword was advertised on the 10th of May.
Q. What did the Prisoner say when he brought these things to you?
Champion. He wanted a guinea and an half upon them. I examined him about them, he seemed to be in a confusion, and said they were his little girls.
Prisoner. I rely upon the mercy of the Court.

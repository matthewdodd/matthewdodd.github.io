             is my master; he lives in the Inner Temple


. This day fortnight I being in the back chamber, the looking glass was in the first room upon the stairs, where I heard a person come in and go out again, but did not see him: my master came in, and looked out at a window, and saw the prisoner go down the lane with a looking-glass. I ran down, and took the glass from him in Garden-court; I never saw the prisoner before, to my knowledge: the glass is my master's property, and used to hang over a desk in the first room.

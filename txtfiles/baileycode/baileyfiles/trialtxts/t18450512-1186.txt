SUSANNAH NUGENT
. I am the wife of Francis Armstrong Nugent. The prisoner was in my service about two months—she left about the 4th of Jan.—these towels, pillow-case, night-gowns, and other things are ours, I had them in use when the prisoner was in my service—I missed them, but I did not know who had got them.





JOHN CARPENTER
 (police-constable R 84.) I searched tne prisoner's box in her presence at Mr. Tuck's—I found in it one towel, the pillow-case, night-gown, and some other things which Mrs. Nugent identifies—at the place where the prisoner's child was, I found this other towel and a wine-glass of Mrs. Nugent's—I asked the prisoner whose the things were, she made no answer—I asked if she had lived with a person at Greenwich, she said, "Yes, with Mr. Nugent."

Prisoner. They were all put into my box; I never put them there.

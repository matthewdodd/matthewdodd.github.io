ROBERT DURHAM
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
23rd of January, 4lbs. weight of pork, value 1s. 6d., the goods of 



John Barnes; and that he had been before convicted of felony.







JOHN BARNES
. I live in Goldsmith's-row, Hackney-road, and am a pork-butcher. My shop is opposite Mr. Beale's—I had a piece of pork on the window-board—it was inside, but the window was open—on the 23rd of January I was backwards, and was called and told that three boys had stolen two pieces of pork—the prisoner was in my shop, and this piece of pork—the other piece was gone—this piece of pork was in a bag of the prisoner's.





THOMAS BEALE
. I live opposite the prosecutor. I was at home on the 23rd of January, and saw the prisoner go backwards and forwards by the prosecutor's window several times, and each time he pulled this piece of pork nearer and nearer to him—he then took it and was wrapping it up in this bag—I took him back to the shop with it.





JOHN BRAND
 (police-constable G 170.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction (read)—I know he is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 10.—


Transported for Seven Years.

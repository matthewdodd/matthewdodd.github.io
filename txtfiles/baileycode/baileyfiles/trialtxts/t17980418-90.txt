             sworn. - I am a tea-dealer
: I was coming out of the Chamberlain's Office, Guildhall


, I do not recollect the day, when I put my hand in my pocket and missed my handkerchief; I saw the prisoner near me, I followed him round Guildhall yard, I stopped him, and charged him with it; he denied it at first, but afterwards produced my handkerchief; there was no mark upon it, but from the general appearance of it, I believe it to be my handkerchief.

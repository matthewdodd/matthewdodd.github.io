 , the 21st of August
 last .
It appear'd by the Evidence, that the Canister was taken out of the Prosecutor's Shop, and the Prisoner being pursu'd was taken with it under his Arm. The Prisoner pretended, that a Man that ran along threw it down, and he had but just taken it up when he was apprehended; but this did not avail, and the Jury found him 


               guilty to the Value of 10 d.

SAMUEL STARKEY. I live in Queen-square, Aldersgate-street


. On the 24th of March, between three and four o'clock, a person whom I employ out of doors, sent his son with some work; he rang the bell - the boy answered it; he said he would wait five minutes for an answer - during that time somebody entered the parlour, and took this case and flute; my boy went down, found the parlour door open, and gave an alarm - I went out, and caught the prisoner within five minutes, in Peter's-lane, St. John-street, with the jewel-case under his arm, covered with a handkerchief; I found my flute in his trousers pocket - he was quite a stranger.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

            . I am the prosecutor's errand boy - the bell rang; I came down to a boy, and left the door open, but I did not see the prisoner - I knew the flute was in the parlour.
Prisoner's Defence. I was coming across Smithfield - a gentleman came up, and asked me to carry these things to the Angel, at Islington - I thought he was behind me at the time.

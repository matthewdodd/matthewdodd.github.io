            . I am an officer. I took the shovel from the prisoner on the 27th of July, between nine and ten o'clock in the morning; I took him to the watch-house; I had been watching him in several areas - I saw him bring something out of the prosecutrix's area, and then go down Davies-street, where he offered the shovel to a man who was making a sewer.
Prisoner's Defence. I went down to take the dust, and left my shovel in the area - I went back for it and
found this; my own was gone; I put it into my sack, and thought at first it was my own.

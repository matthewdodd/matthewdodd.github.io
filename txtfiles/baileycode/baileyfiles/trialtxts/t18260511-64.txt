THOMAS HEAPHY. I live at No. 7, St. John's-wood


. On the 3d of March I was told there were two boys in a piece of ground behind my house, which belongs to me; I went and gave them in charge, and they were taken to the watch-house - the prisoner escaped, but the other was tried last Session - they had collected a number of things from my kitchen, which were safe on the premises the night before - there is a wall and a fence which they must have got over.

            . About half-past eight o'clock in the morning of the 3d of March I saw this boy breaking a piece of an iron gutter - another boy was with him; I told my father, and then jumped over the wall, and found the articles named in the indictment - the prisoner had a garden fork in his hands.

            . I am a constable. On the 3d of March I was passing down the road, and I saw this boy on the wall attempting to make his escape; I took him and another into custody, but owing to the watch-house door being left on the latch this boy escaped.

            . I was cleaning my kitchen between twelve and one at noon, and my uncle called to me to air his shirt, and I put it upon the back of a chair, and went for a half penny worth of sand; and when I went into the house, I saw the prisoner coming out of the kitchen, with the shirt under his coat.
Q. Did you stop him then?
Softly. I did not miss it till I went into the kitchen, and found the shirt was gone, and then I went and cried out, stop thief!
Q. Did you know the prisoner before?
Softly. I never saw him before.
Q. Did you see the shirt taken from him?
Softly. Yes; and it was delivered into my hand.

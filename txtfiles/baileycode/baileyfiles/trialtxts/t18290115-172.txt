            . I am an officer of Worship-street.
I went with Buckeridge, and searched a house in Sydney-street, Commercial-road; I found these four handkerchiefs, and a great variety of articles.

            . I never gave the prisoner these articles, nor suffered him to use them in any way as his own - they are my best cravats, which I kept for my own particular use; they were at the Ambassador's, house and must have been taken from there, either while I was in the country, or after my return, without my knowledge.
Prisoner's Defence. These handkerchiefs he had in the country, and I had them to wear while I was in the country; I took them home dirty to have them cleaned.

            . I am alinen draper
. On the 16th of June Seward came into my shop and bought half a yard of Irish (I was not at home). As soon as I came home a lady wanted some muslin, then I missed a piece, and mentioned it to my man. On Saturday the 19th she came again, she bought a yard of muslin, and away she went. I followed her, and got an acquaintance, Mr. Lewis, to go with me to dodge her. She went into Mr. Webster's shop in Bond-street. I sent Mr. Lewis into the shop to tell him we suspected her to be a shop-lifter; they searched her, and found a piece of muslin upon her. The next morning she confessed she had taken mine, and had sold it to Mrs. Freeman the other prisoner, who lives in Germyn-street, for 13 s.
Q. How much was there of your muslin?
Vere. There were upward of 14 yards of it, it cost me 4 s. 2 d. a yard. Justice Wright granted a warrant to search Mrs. Freeman's house, where we found about 7 yards and a quarter. I was certain it was part of the same I lost. Freeman said she bought it of Seward.

            . On the 4th of January, about two in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner with this tobacco in his hand and he put it under his coat; I suspected he had stole it; I had before seen him lurking about picking at the hogsheads: when I laid hold of him, he said, he saw other people take it, and he might as well take it as other people.

            . I was charged with the prisoner, he owned the fact to me; that he took the tobacco out of a hogshead, the head of which was off.
Prisoner. I have nothing to say.

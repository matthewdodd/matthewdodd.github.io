 and 




FREDERICK COOPER



 were indicted for stealing on the 
19th of November, 1 coat, value 10s.; the goods of 



John Fletcher.







JOHN FLETCHER
. I am a butcher, and live at Old Brentford. I serve Lady Carr, at Ealing—on the 19th of November, I stopped there with my cart, in which was my great coat—I have never seen the coat since—the prisoners were known to each other, and lived at Brentford.





SAMUEL ROOK
. I am eleven years old—I live with my father, who is a farmer, at Ealing. I saw the cart against Lady Carr's lodge, and the great coat in it—Cooper got on the step, and took the coat out—Harvey was with him at the time—about thirty yards off—they both ran off together—the prisoners were taken the same day—I saw them again the next day—they were dressed differently then, but I am sure they are the persons.

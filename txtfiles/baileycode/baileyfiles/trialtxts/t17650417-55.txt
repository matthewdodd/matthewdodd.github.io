            , and I, are partners: we are oil merchants



. About the 24th or 25th of February last we had information that our warehouses were robbed of a considerable quantity of oil. And on the 26th at night. I had information brought me that the prisoner was taken in getting a barrel of oil out of the cellar: upon which I went and saw the barrel out of the cellar by the door, near the water-side at St. Paul's warf, the prisoner was then in custody; he has worked for us a year or two.

            . I was called out for a fare between 6 and 7 at night. I do not know the exact time. I saw a man come on shore at them stairs with a long sack or bag: it appeared to me to have an empty cask in it: he passed me. Presently another man came down to the stairs head. I and 
               
                  Tom 
                  Scraggs 
               



             were looking out for a fare; by and by I saw the man that came first by me with a small cask on his shoulder: he got it away in an instant. And on the Saturday following, I saw that same fellow came peeping about there again; but I having a fare to carry a person to Westminister, did not see the last of him then. After that Mr. Enderby hired me as a watchman. I saw the prisoner and another man come on shore in a waterman's boat; I got behind a nook, behind the corner of the necessary. A boy said to me, What are you doing here? I said, I am waiting for a fare: it rained that night. Presently this man and another asked the boy to drink; the boy said, Thank you; and went with the prisoner. After he came back again, the boy said, Mr. Ellen, I am afraid I am upon no good design: these men have agreed with me, I am to carry them up, with a vessel of small beer, for a shilling. I went up to the Fortune of War, and told my two assistants (they are servants to the prosecutors) I desired them to be in the way, for there were two strapping fellows, I could not take them myself: then I went down to my boat, and broke my mop-stick in two: said the boy, What did you do that for? I said, to shy at the rats; don't you see how they run about? by and by came the two thieves out of that public house; they and my two assistants had been all fitting together. I saw the prisoner fumbling at the cellar door of the warehouse; he clapped his shoulder to it, and shoved it open: by and by I saw him roll a cask of oil out of the warehouse. I jumpt to him, and said, You villain, what do you do that for? he said, What, What, What, What! and made a blow at me, and miss'd me. I took this stick and knocked him down with it. (Producing a large piece of a mop-stick.) The other fellow was come out of the cellar; I made a blow at him; he bobb'd his head and I miss'd him. I jumpt to the prisoner, and swore I would blow his brains out if he did not go with me; but I had nothing but this mop-stick about me. I took and led him almost forty yards, calling Thieves, Fire, and the like, but nobody came to help me. When I came to the public house door, there came out one of my assistants, with a pipe in his mouth; the prisoner had insisted upon going into that public house, and I gave him another knock on the head, because he should not get away from me. When I got him into the public house, there sat my other assistant, with a pipe in his mouth: then they went away, and left me to take care of the prisoner. I asked for a pennyworth of gin. I then asked for a knife to cut the waist-band of his breeches, that he should not run away. He said don't cut my flesh. Every one in the house called me thief-catcher except the landlord.
Q. What became of the other man?

Ellen. God knows; for I had enough to do take care of the prisoner. The servants said, after they had hunted about they bolted the warehouse-door; but in the morning the door was open: I imagine he ran into the warehouse. The prisoner said he was to carry that cask to the Britannia, by London bridge, where a Jew was to have met him for it. We took and marched him to look for Mr. Jew, but I kept him so long that the Jew was gone. He owned he had taken a cask the day before.
Prisoner's Defence.
I was coming out of the public house, going to the necessary house by the water side; I tumbled over this barrel.
Prosecutor. The barrel of oil lay by the warehouse door. The prisoner acknowledged to me that he took it out, and that he had taken some before.
Ellen. The other man with him was a very stout fellow; we imagine he has entered himself for a soldier, to go to the East Indies.

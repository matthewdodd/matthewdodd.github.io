THOMAS GEORGE GISBY
 (City policeman, 245). On 2nd July, at a quarter to 3 o'clock, I was on duty in West-street, and heard a cry of "Stop thief!"—I turned, and saw the prisoner running down West-street—he had passed

me—I followed him into Sharp's-alley, and caught him there—I did not lose sight of him except when be turned, and I was then quite close to him and there were no other persons there—I told him a lad had told me he had picked a gentleman's pocket—he denied it—I told him he must come with me—he hesitated and scuffled a bit, and going up West-street Mr. Usher came up—I asked what sort of a handkerchief it was he had lost—he said red and white—I saw the prisoner put his hand down his trowser leg, and I then took this handkerchief (produced) from the bottom of his trowser leg, and Mr. Usher identified it.





THOMAS JAMES USHER
. I am a coach manufacturer, of Long-lane, Smith-field. On the afternoon of 2nd of July, I felt a slight touch at my pocket, and missed my handkerchief—I saw it again in about five minutes produced in the way spoken of by the last witness—this is it.

             sworn.
I am a salesman
 at Leadenhall. OnSaturday, the 8th of May, between eleven and twelve, I was going along Leaden-hall-street


: I felt a person, and put my hand to my pocket: a gentleman said, that is him, in the blue jacket; I pursued him, and saw him put the handkerchief under his waistcoat; I catched him, and he put it down into his breeches: the man who is here came to my assistance: he stripped himself. Dormer took the handkerchief from him.

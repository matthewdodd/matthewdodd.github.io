            . I live in Cotterell-court, Wild-street, Liquorpond-street - I keep a house there. On the night of the 8th of April I met the prisoner, between eleven and twelve o'clock; I went with her to a house in Field-lane


 - my watch was safe when I got there, and I missed it in the room; I accused her of taking it - she denied it - I called out to the landlady, who sent for an officer, and he found it in her bosom - there was a chain, a seal, a key, and a piece of Spanish money attached to it - this is it.

            . I am a parish-constable. I was sent for, and found the prisoner in the room - I asked her if she had the watch; she said she had not - I searched, and found it in her bosom; as we were going to the watch-house, she said she did it to be sent out of the country, as she had no one to assist her.
Prisoner's Defence. I found the watch on the bed.

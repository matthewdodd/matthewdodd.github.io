, one watch, value 30 s. one chain, value 30 s. three seals, value 2 l. one key, value 2 s. and nine 1 l. bank notes, the property of 
                     
                        
                           Joseph

                  , from his person
            .
JOSEPH TAYLOR. I met a girl named Mary; she is not here; she took me to her own home, which is in Shakespeare Walk


; I was intoxicated, but not insensible. I gave her two or three shillings to go and get liquor. This woman, Mary, returned, and brought 
               
                  Esther 
                  Horton
               



            . Mary said, she was ill at that time, and she left me. I had a silver capped watch with chain and seals, and either eight or ten one-pound bank notes. 
               
                  Francisco 
                  Rodriguez
               



             came in, and he had not been in half an hour, when the other prisoner, 
               
                  Jerome 
                  Santus
               



            , came in for a little time, and then went up stairs. I then went out, and Esther followed me, and we went and had some shrub and water. She told me I had left my watch behind me; I found I had. I returned to the same room again, but could not see my watch then, nor ever afterwards. I then sat down, and went to sleep. When I awoke, the prisoner Esther, was with me, and nobody else. The notes were found upon Rodriquez at the office; they were taken from me while I was at the house the second time. 
               
                  Esther 
                  Horton
               



            , Santus, and two others, were in custody; and after that, Rodriguez was apprehended; I asked Rodriguez when I apprehended him, if he had any money? and he denied that he had. I then took him into the office, and searched him, and found on him eight one-pound notes, and fourteen shillings in silver. The numbers of the notes were in rotation, from 306 to 313, inclusive. I asked him where he got these notes? and he said, he had been paid them by his captain six weeks back. This was on the 28th of August, 1815; and the notes had not been issued six weeks. When I told him that, he said, he would tell me where he really got them. I made him neither promise nor threat. He told me 
               
                  Esther 
                  Horton
               



             gave them to him to take care for her. At this time, 
               
                  Esther 
                  Horton
               



            , and the other prisoner, were in custody. They then went back, and were all examined together.

                  SCOTT
               



            . I used to wash and clean for Esther; she has only a room in that house; that room belonged to 
               
                  Mary 
                  Davis
               



            . 
               
                  Mary 
                  Davis
               



             said to me on the night of the robbery, Mrs. Scott, I have brought home a nice gentleman; you know the situation I am in; I think it is a pity to go with him. She then went and fetched 
               
                  Esther 
                  Horton
               



            , who cohabited with the prisoner Rodriguez; she came; and bye and bye, she told Rodriguez that the captain's watch was laying on the bed, and told him to fetch it; he went, but I believe he did not return.
(The bank notes produced by the constable, and sworn to by the prosecutor.)

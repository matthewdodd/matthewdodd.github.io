John Fear. I live in St. Clement's-Lane


. Hearing a noise in the street I went out on the 19th of February, about ten at night, and saw the prisoner about fifteen yards from my door. My wife had her by the arm, and said, she had rob'd her. She is here, and can give a better account.

            . I am wife to the prosecutor. I was going up, on that Saturday night, to make my beds, and the prisoner was coming down stairs with a bundle of cloaths under her arm. This was a little after ten at night.
Q. Did she lodge with you?
E. Fear. No. I had seen her come in and out to one of my lodgers, named Renton. I lighted her down, and let her go out. Then I went upstairs and push'd my room door open, and saw my bed strip'd. I ran down, and took her in the street, and brought her back. She then laid the goods down upon the stairs, the same as mentioned in the indictment. (Produced in court, and deposed to.) I sent for a constable, and she was committed.
Prisoner's Defence.
I never laid my eyes upon these goods, till I saw them in the Round-house on the Monday morning.

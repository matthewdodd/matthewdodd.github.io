            . I am a blind-maker
, and live in Bedford-place, Commercial-road; the prisoner was my man, employed and entrusted to receive money
 for me - he took the work home. Last Friday week he took some work to Mr. Pledger's and was to receive 2 l. 11 s. - he never brought the money to me. I sent a bill and receipt with it, but he made out another, and returned me mine.

            . I deal with Moore. On the 27th of November the prisoner brought the goods to me; I paid him two 1 l. notes and 5 s., and took his receipt for the bill. He signed the receipt,
"Moore."
Prisoner's Defence. I have been ill a long time, but against the doctor's advice I continued in the business to the prosecutor's advantage. I was led through the insinuations of his son, to commit the error. He said he was in, distress, upon which I let him have 7 s. 6 d., and could not make it up.

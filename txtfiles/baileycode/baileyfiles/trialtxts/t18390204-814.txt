JAMES GILLINGS
 (police-constable E 159.) I was in North-crescent, Tottenham Court-road, at one o'clock in the night, on the 28th of January, and saw the prisoner come up the prosecutrix's area, with a bag containing the articles named—I asked what he had been doing—he never spoke—I saw him get over the railing with this property—I found no money upon him, but a knife and a rope.





SARAH BUTCHER
. I am servant to Mrs. Elizabeth Morton, of Northcrescent. The prisoner had nothing to do with the house—these are my mistress's property, and it had been in the safe in the area.

Prisoner's Defence. I was in great distress, and had no home.

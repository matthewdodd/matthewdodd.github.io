            . I was coming down High-street, Bloomsbury



, on the 25th of August - there was a mob occasioned by two men fighting; I saw Woodward come up close behind me - he then went to the other side of the mob, came to me again, and took my handkerchief; I saw it in his hand - he went round the mob, and put my handkerchief into his inside pocket, he then went a considerable distance and took a snuff-box from another person; I told the person - he was then taken; there were two others with him; my handkerchief was found in his hat.

             (through an Interpreter). I was walking on the 25th of August with my lady - I felt I had lost something - I felt in my pocket, my handkerchief was gone - I saw it afterwards in Woodward's hat - this is it; I had it a few minutes before - I saw the three prisoners together at the time I lost it.

            . I followed the three prisoners from the crowd in St. Giles'



 to the other side of Rathbone-place; I saw Woodward take the handkerchief; the other two were close to him; I went and spoke to the prosecutor, but he did not understand me, the lady did - the prisoners then went to the corner of Hanway-street, and looked at a person selling stuff for corns; I laid hold of the three, and said, "Give up the handkerchief you took from that gentleman, and the one you took from me;" Woodward said he had no handkerchief - but a young man took off his hat and there it was.

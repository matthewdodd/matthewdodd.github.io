            . I am a Police-constable. On the 18th of October I saw the two prisoner together in Tottenham-court-road - Wilkinson was carrying a leg of pork and a roll of Dutch cheese; I asked, in the other prisoner's hearing, where he got them - he said he had bought the pork in Oxford-market of a butcher named Davies; I took them there, and in going along Connell ran off - I followed, and brought him back; I went up to the butchers and asked if they knew any thing of the prisoners - they said No; I went round the market, and could find no person of that name - I took the prisoners to the watch-house; the prosecutrix swore to the property.
Prisoner Wilkinson. Murphy and his serjeant agreed to discharge us, and keep the property between themselves.

            . We did not; they were discharged from the watch-house because they gave an account of the weight of the pork, and they took the articles with them - another officer brought them back with it.

            . I am a Police-constable. I was in the watch-house when the prisoners were brought in; they gave the true weight of the pork, and were discharged; but in consequence of further information I went and took them at No. 2, Pearl-court, St. Giles' - my brother officer found the property in the room; I never heard of what the prisoner has now said.

            . I am a serjeant of the Police. I went to the house, and found the pork and the Dutch cheese; I never heard that the prisoners were to go, and we were to keep the articles.

, in New Cavendish-street


. This pork and cheese were in my care; I had put the pork in a dish to salt, and on Sunday morning, the 18th of October, I missed it - it had been safe in the area at eleven o'clock the night before; I am certain this is the pork by a place which I have cut in it, and this cheese has a particular mark on it - about two ounces has been cut off the cheese.
Connell's Defence. I had not been with Wilkinson three minutes when I was taken.

. On the morning of the 26th of April, at a quarter before six o'clock, the prisoner came and asked for an empty pipe - I said he might take one off the mantel-piece- I had occasion to go from the tap-room to the kitchen, and when I returned he was gone; I had left a red cotton handkerchief on my hat in the tap-room - the handkerchief was then gone; I had given 2s. for the handkerchief the week before.
THOMAS HIGGS. I lodge at the Delaware Arms. In consequence of what I heard I went after the prisoner - I met with him in George-street, a quarter of a mile from the house, and asked him for the handkerchief which he took from the public-house; he said he had not got it, but he afterwards produced it from under his jacket.

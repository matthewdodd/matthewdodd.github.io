MARTHA MEEK
. I am the wife of Charles Meek, a tobacconist, in Long-acre. On the 21st of March, about eight o'clock in the morning, I was in the parlour behind the shop—I heard a noise—I came out, and saw the prisoner in the shop with the cigars in his handkerchief—he went out, and I followed—he had got about six yards when I took hold of him, and he dropped the cigars—he then got out of my sight, but I am sure he is the same person—the window was not broken—he opened the door, and came in, and took them out of the window—these are my husband's cigars, they are worth 16s.





DANIEL RICHARD COPE
. On the 21st of March I was sweeping the front of our house, and saw the prisoner come out of the prosecutor's with a bundle—Mrs. Meek came and said, "You have stolen my cigars"—he dropped them, and ran off—I pursued—he was stopped down a court, and given in charge.

Prisoner. Q. Did you take me? A. No, a postman stopped you—I never lost sight of you at all—I live right opposite the prosecutor—you were taken back to the shop, and I followed you.




GUILTY
.* Aged 18.—


Transported for Seven Years.

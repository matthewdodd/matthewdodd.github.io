EUPHEMIA WINDSOR
. I live in Edward-street, Hampstead-road. On the 2nd of October I had a bag containing a frock belonging to Peter Galvin, a handkerchief and an apron of my own—as I was going down Charlotte-street, Bloomsbury, the two prisoners ran by me, and Maxwell pulled the bag out of my hand—they both ran away—I am sure they are the persons—I knew them the moment I saw them—when they were brought back the officer said to Maxwell, "You are charged with stealing a reticule"—he said, "Yes, and there was another boy with me."

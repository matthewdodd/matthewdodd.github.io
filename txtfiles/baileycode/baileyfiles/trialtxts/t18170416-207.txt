            . I am a labourer

            . I am a gardener, and live in Gray's-inn-lane, and saw the prisoner very busy among the crowd, looking at the Welch children-he looked at the prosecutor, and followed him to Red-lion-street. I saw him get between the prosecutor and his friend, and push round. I did not see him take the watch. Rowland missed his watch immediately, and secured the prisoner. I found the watch in his small-clothes, by his thigh.

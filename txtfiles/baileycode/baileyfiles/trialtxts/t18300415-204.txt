CHRISTIAN BERGSTROM. On the 15th of March the prisoner came to my shop in Tottenham-court-road


, under pretence of buying an umbrella; he went out of the shop- I followed him, and found this umbrella and stick on him; he would not give them up - a gentleman went for an officer; he was but a few yards from the shop when I took him.

            . I am an officer, and took him; he made a great resistance - I was obliged to throw him on the ground, and take him by force; I found some copper money on him.
The prisoner put in a written Defence, stating that the prosecutor had given the things into his hand, and that the officer had ill-treated him.

Prisoner. I asked the price, and he said 5s.; I disputed it, and he said I might have it for 4s. - I said if he would come himself, or send his shopman, to King's Headcourt, I would give him an answer - I have been cupped and blistered at the hospital for a brain fever.

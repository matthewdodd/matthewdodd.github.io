ROBERT BANFIELD
. I am a servant, living at Norwood, in Surrey. On the 7th of October I was in Holborn looking at some birds—I felt something at my pocket and missed my handkerchief—I turned and saw the prisoner close to my side, with it in his pocket—I asked him for it—he denied having it—I said I could see it in his pocket—he then ran away—I pursued, and caught him—he gave it to me—this is it.

Prisoner's Defence. I saw the handkerchief down by my feet; I picked it up, and put it into my pocket; when the prosecutor asked me if I had got it, I said yes, and asked if it was his.

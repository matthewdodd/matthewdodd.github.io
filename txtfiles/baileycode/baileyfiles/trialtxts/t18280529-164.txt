            . My mother gave me the trousers to carry home: I was going along, and met the prisoner, who said he would give me 3d. to go on an errand - he took me to Charing-cross


, shewed me a gentleman's house, and told me to go there for two bags, one with pencils in it, and to come to him at the Ship public-house; he gave me 1d., and was to give me 2d. when I returned; I left the trousers with him, and when I came back he was gone.

            . On the 3d of May, about half-past six o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner at the Ship, Charing-cross, with this lad, who had a bundle in a blue handkerchief.
WILLIAM DELABERTAUCHE. I went with my son, on Thursday, the 8th, and found the prisoner in a public-house- my son said that was the man; I took hold of him, and brought him out - he was nearly rescued from me, but I took him to the watch-house: a lady came up, and said he had stolen them, but she did not know whether they were pawned or sold.

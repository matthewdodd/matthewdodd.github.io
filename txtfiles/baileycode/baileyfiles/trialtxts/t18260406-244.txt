CHARLES WIGHTON. I live in North-street, Poplar


. - I missed four pigeons about four o'clock on the morning of the 5th of April - I had seen them safe about seven o'clock the evening before; the pigeon' house is about thirty feet from my house, in my garden. I found it broken open, and four gone out of the seven, which I found at the watch-house.

            . I am a watchman. About half-past two o'clock in the morning of the 5th of April, the three prisoners passed me in East India-road, and a little before three I heard a woman crying for the watchman - I ran to North-street, from whence the sound proceeded, and she told me there were three men getting on the leads at the top of the door; I ran after them, but did not see them. About half-past three o'clock I took (with some assistance) the three prisoners, whom I knew to be the persons I had seen at first; I found four pigeous on Jasper Hitchcock.

            . I am superintendant of the watch. - Cruce brought the prisoners to the watch-house; I found four pigeons on Jasper Hitchcock: I made inquiries, and found where they belonged to. I had seen the prisoners pass the watch-house just before three o'clock.
JOHN HITCHCOCK's Defence. I was going home to the Barking-road, over the iron bridge, where I work.
JASPER HITCHCOCK's Defence. I bought the pigeons on the Tuesday evening.
DUNNING's Defence. I was going to Blackwall-dock, to look for work. I never saw these young men before.

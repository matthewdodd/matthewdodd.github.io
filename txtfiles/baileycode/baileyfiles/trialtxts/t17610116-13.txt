                  Robert 
                  Green 
               



            . I live in Basinghall street Postern


, just on London-wall, in the house of Mr. 
               
                  Robert 
                  Dalton 
               



            .
Q. What are you?
Green. I am a whip-maker.
Q. Do you know 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Simkins 
               



            ?
Green. I do, he keeps an alehouse on London-wall, near a quarter of a mile from where I live.
Q. Who do you pay your rent to?
Green. To 
               
                  Robert 
                  Dalton 
               



            , he rents the house of Mr. Simkins; there are two or three lodgers there besides me, Dalton lives in the upper part of the house. I went to bed at ten o'clock on Wednesday night last as usual, and slept very soundly till after twelve, then I was awaked by a knocking at my door. I heard Mrs. Dalton's voice, I asked what she wanted; she said she desired to speak with me: I got out of bed, and opened the door, and saw all the marks of surprize and fear about her. I asked what was the matter; she told me there was somebody about the house. I heard no noise myself, I went down stairs, and looked about, and began to think it was only her fear.
Q. Where was her husband?
Green. He was constable of the night (and that for the first time of his watch.) She said her window was broke; I unbarr'd the door, and went out, and looked up the yard. but saw nobody. I climbed up the leads. There are five or six sheds which belong to several houses. I then found her window broke: then I mounted on a higher lead. and presently I espied a man laying in a gutter between two sheds; he was creeping from me, I did not think proper to attack him myself, lest he should have some accomplice. I retreated; as soon as I came from the leads, I called out thieves, and an alarm was immediately given: it was some time before anybody came to my assistance. I saw a watchman in the street, and desired him to stand at a door, where I feared they might make their escape, and I watch'd the yard. I got a person to go to the watch-house for Mr. Dalton; he came, and brought several watchmen with him, then they began to search: the person that I saw on the sheds was found in a shed; he made his way out, and went to go upon the shed again, but was seized and secured.
Q. Which of the prisoners was that?
Green. That was Wiseman. I asked him if he had any accomplices: he said, Only let me have time, and I will tell you all. He then said he came along with 
               
                  James 
                  Skelton 
               



            , that they had been together, and wanted money, and Skelton said to him, he knew where to get some; that was, he knew how to get into his mistress's house and how to get some money; and that the leaden pipe was in his way, and he thought proper to take that ( it was the bottom part of a pipe.) Skelton was not taken till the next day, then they were carried before the sitting alderman, there they both confessed it. Wiseman said he was drawn into it by Skelton, and Skelton said he pulled down the pipe in order to take it away.
Bates. I live opposite to where the affair w I was in bed, a woman called watch, th ard a man that watches at the corn what do you want? I got up; Mr. Dalton brought several watchmen: I, being a carpenter go upon a shed. When I was there, Wiseman came up where I was, in order to make his escape I laid hold of him: He said, Don't use me ill. I'll tell you how the thing was. I handed him down, and the watchman laid hold of him: then we asked him how the affair was: said he, I did not do it Mrs. Drummond's, the sn's apprentice (meaning the other prisoner) drawed me here; he called him Jemmy. He said they had been drinking together, and had neither of them any money, and he said to him. Come along with me, and I'll get some money.
Q. Whereabouts is Mrs. Drommond's house?
Bates. The back part of her house looks into that place. Wiseman said Skelton lifted him up by the leg, then he got up, and pulled down the lead; that Wiseman accidentally threw down some bricks, which broke the window, and alarmed the neighbours. Before the alderman he said he never was engaged in such an affair before, and begged mercy. Skelton said he had nothing to say in his defence, but that he did not intend to take the lead away. I found the pipe on the flat of the shed.


                  Robert 
                  Dalton 
               



            . I was upon the watch that night, being constable, my wife sent one of my lodger for me. I took some watchmen with me. There are a great many passages there. I thought it necessary to fix two watchmen at the entry going to our yard, and went into the yard with other people; but Mr. Bates got upon the shed, and Wiseman was soon secured. He said James Skelton brought him there, to get money to buy beer; that Skelton told him he would take him to a place where they could get some; and that Skelton twisted the pipe; and pull'd it down. The next morning I took Skelton by London-wall, to his mistress's house, and charged him with having taken the leaden pipe. He was quite sulky, and made me no answer. I took him before the sitting alderman, there he confessed that he came there on purpose to take this lead, and begged of the alderman to be made a soldier.
Wiseman's Defence.
He and I were together all the afternoon. I being locked out of my lodgings, he told me where I could lie, and said, Come along with me, we can get into the shed where I served my time: we went in at a cooper's entry, and went there; he got upon the wall, and then on the shed: going over he saw a leaden pipe, he struck it with his foot, and slung it down; we had no intent to take it away, we went only to lay in the shed: there were a great many bricks fell, and made a noise, and alarmed the folks, that they called out thieves: as soon as the lead came down he ran away, and I was so affrighted that I did not know which way to go, and they came and took me.
Skelton's Defence.
I have laid in my mistress's shed, and I asked him to go and lay there. I never had the lead in my hand, or touched it.
For Wiseman.
Mr. Fare. I have known Wiseman between eleven and twelve years.
Q. How old is he?
Fare. He is about 16 years old; he lodged at the Magpye by Cripplegate. He was put apprentice to a fork-blade maker in Shoreditch parish.
Q. How has he behav'd?
Fare. He has behaved very well to my knowledge: I never heard the least blemish of him in my life: his master is gone for a marine, and the boy has worked with me about a year, and has behaved as well as a lad of his age could be expected to do.

Q. How did he behave?
Ripkey. Always very well: he never lay out all the time till that night this thing happened.

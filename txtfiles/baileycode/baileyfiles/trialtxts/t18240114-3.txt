            , ESQ. In September last, I resided in Wimpole-street


, and left town in that month with my family, leaving the prisoner Strikes in care of the house - she was hired for that express purpose. I returned about the middle of December, and missed property.

            . I am a constable. On the 13th of December, I went to Mr. Sansom's, and searched Strikes; I found a key upon her, which opened a box in a room over the stable, in which I found a prayer-book - I told her what I had found; she said nothing.

Vandiest. On Saturday the 22d of August, at the Proclamation of the Fair, I was standing looking at one of the Fellows upon the Stage; I had not stood two Minutes but I wanted my Handkerchief to wipe my Face, and I felt the Prisoner's Hand drawing of it out, and I took hold of him, and charged the Constable with him; he said he was an Apprentice to one Mr Rogers on Snowhill; we went to him, and he said, he had not seen him for some Days, he had run away; when I caught him, he was search'd, and we found several Handkerchiefs upon him.
The Prisoner's Master appeared, and could give him but a very bad Character.




               Guilty of stealing, but not privately stealing
            .

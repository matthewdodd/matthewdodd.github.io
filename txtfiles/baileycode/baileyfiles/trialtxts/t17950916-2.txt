Q. What time of the day was it? -About five in the afternoon; I told her. she must go before the Mayor of Canterbury, I did not tell her for what then; I asked her whether she had any boxes, or any thing in the room that belonged to her, she pointed then to a trunk, which trunk I took with me to the Mayor with her, the Mayor asked her some few questions, and he desired to have the key of the trunk; the first thing that presented was a pair of shoes; the Mayor would not look any further into the box, but gave me the key of the trunk, and desired me to comeup to town with it, and take the prisoner to Bow-Street, which I did.
Q. Were you present when the box was opened at Bow-Street? - Yes.
Q. What was found? - These articles.(Produced) they were taken out of the box and tied up in this cloth before justice Bond; it was delivered to me, and Lady Bridges had it from me, as justice Bond thought it would be troublesome for me to take it with me to Canterbury.

Prisoner. I have nothing to say.
Court to Mrs. Bridges. How did she come into your service? - I bought her when she was a girl; I brought her with me from the East Indies; she is extremely young, not now fifteen; I am afraid she has been ill advised, or she never would have committed such a crime.
Q. Then you had a good opinion of her till this time? - A very good opinion of her.

 HENRY GREEN
, and 




JOSIAH GLADHALL
 were indicted for

 stealing, on the 
30th of August, 4 bags, value 3s. 6d., the goods of 



Thomas Clarke.







HENRY ABRAHAMS
. I am shopman to Thomas Clarke, a grocer, in Lisson-erove. On the evening of the 30th of August, I was in the shop, and heard a noise outside—I ran out, and saw the three prisoners—they drew some bags off a soda-water cask outside the door—they ran, and I followed and overtook them—they ran to a beer-shop, where they all went with the bags—I then went back to my master—he came and apprehended them—I took this sack from Giange—it is the one I lost—I am sure these are the three boys.





ALFRED HUGHES
 (police-constable D 134.) I took the prisoners. I know them all to be associates.

Grange's Defence. I was at the bottom of William-street, and met these two boys; Green asked me to go and sell the sacks.

Gladhall's Defence. I left my work, and was playing with some boys; I saw these four old bags lying by the tub; I saw Green, and asked him to go and sell one to get 1d. worth of pudding; he would not, and then I asked Grange if he would go and sell one, and then he was taken.

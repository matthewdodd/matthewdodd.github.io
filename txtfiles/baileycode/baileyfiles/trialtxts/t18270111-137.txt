            . The prisoner was in my employ. On Saturday, the 6th of December, about half-past six o'clock in the morning, I sent him with eighteen shillings and four sixpences to pay to Mr. Hudson, who goes to market for me; I then went to market myself, and returned about eight o'clock; the prisoner had not then come to open the shop, which he ought to have done; I did not see him again till the next Saturday; I asked what he had done with the money - he said he had spent it.

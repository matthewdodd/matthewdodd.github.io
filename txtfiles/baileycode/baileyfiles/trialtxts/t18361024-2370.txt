. I live with my father-in-law, Elijah Butler—his dwelling-house is in Nottingham-street, Marylebone. On the 20th of October, at a quarter before eight o'clock, I caught the prisoner on the floor, behind the counter, with the till open—he had got the bag of silver and saw me, he dropped the bag on the ground—he begged forgiveness—I sent for an officer, and had him taken—I never saw him before.





DANIEL NORGIN
. I am a policeman. I was called, and took the prisoner into custody, and have the bag—it contained one crown-piece, seventeen half-crowns, forty-six shilling, thirty-seven sixpences, and a fourpenny-piece.

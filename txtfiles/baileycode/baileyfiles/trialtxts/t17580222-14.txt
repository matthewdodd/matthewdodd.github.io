            . The prisoner was my servant
. On Sunday was a fortnight I left her in the house.
Q. Where do you live?
M. Steward. I live in Eagle Court, in the Strand


. I was not out above half an hour, and when I return'd she was gone. I missed a green silk gown, and a pair of stays, which I had seen but a few minutes before I went out, hanging upon a chair in my bed room. She was taken up on the Wednesday following, and charged with taking the things; she own'd she took them, and that a woman had taken them from off her bed, and pawn'd them, but she did not know where.


                  Mary 
                  Best 
               



            . I was with the prisoner before the justice, and heard her say she took them, and was very sorry for it, and beg'd forgiveness; she sent me down to the Savoy to see for the girl that pawned the gown, but I could not find her.
The prisoner had nothing to say in her defence, but beg'd forgiveness of the court.




               Guilty, 10 d.

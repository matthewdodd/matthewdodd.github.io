            . I am a broker, and keep fowls
; I live in Union-yard, Shoreditch


. On the Tuesday before the robbery I lost one, and on the Saturday I lost six. On the 3d of October, my boy said that a strange man had gone into the privy. I went into the yard, and saw some crumbs of bread thrown from the privy to entice them in; at last one fowl went into the privy, and the prisoner shut the door. Soon after, he came out of the privy, and I went after him, brought him back, and Francis took the fowl out of his breeches.

            . I saw the prosecutor lay hold of the prisoner round the waist, and I laid hold of the flap of his coat. He got his hand down, unbuttoned his breeches, and out sprung a fowl.

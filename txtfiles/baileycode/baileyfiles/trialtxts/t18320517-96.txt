            . I am a carpenter
, and live at Highgate. I was in Old-street


 on the night of the 14th of April; I met the prisoner, who asked me to go home with her, which I refused; I had my two hands in my pockets, and there were two half-crowns in my right-hand trousers pocket; she still asked me to go with her - I said I was married, and wanted to go home; she then thrust the front of her person against me, and put her hand into my trousers - I took my hands out of my pocket to push her away; I then missed my money; I took hold of her, and said, "You have robbed me;" she said, "I have not robbed you, there is your money" - I saw my money on the ground - the officer came and took her.

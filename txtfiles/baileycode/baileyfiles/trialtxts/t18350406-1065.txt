FRANCISCO DUGE
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
28th of February, 1 box, value 5s.; 2 half-crowns; 30 shillings; 10 sixpence; and 7d. in copper; the goods and monies of 



Dorothy Ireland.






MARIA IRELAND
. My mother, Dorothy Ireland, keeps the Dolphin public-house, Cannon-street. She had the care of this box, which was generally kept in the bar—it is a mahogany subscription box—I saw it safe on the 28th of February, and did not miss it for eight or ten days—it was left in my mother's charge—the prisoner was servant to a Spanish officer, who lodged at the house.





CAROLINE BLESSINGTON
. I live in King-street. I have known the prisoner some time—on Sunday, the 1st of March, he brought me a mahogany box, and asked me for a knife to open it—I had not one—he took a poker, and broke it open—it had silver and copper in it—I do not know how much—there seemed a good deal—it was all mixed together—there was a little veneer, which had split off the box in opening it—he burnt it, I gave the lock of the box to Hale.





WILLIAM HALE
. I received the lock of a box from Blessington, and gave it to the street-keeper.





GEORGE METCALF
. I am a street-keeper. I have had the lock ever since.





EDWARD KINGETT
. I live on my property. This was a poor subscription-box, kept at the public-house, and was brought into the room every Saturday, to receive subscriptions—I was treasurer—it was safe on the 28th of February, and seemed to have between 2l. and 3l. in it—it was locked up about half-past eleven o'clock, and left on the table in the room—the prisoner occasionally waited on the people in the room—I have the key of it—it opens the lock produced—it was a small Benevolent Society.

Prisoner. I never took the box.




GUILTY
. Aged 25.—


Transported for Seven Years.

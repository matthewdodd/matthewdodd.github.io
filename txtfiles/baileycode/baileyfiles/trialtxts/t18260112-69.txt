            . I am a Thames Police surveyor. - I met the prisoner and another man in Stacey-street, St. Giles's, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening of the 21st of December, about half a mile from Meux's brewhouse; the prisoner had this cock underneath his jacket; I followed him to the shop of a plumber, named Conniss, in Long-acre - while he was at the door I took him by the collar, and knocked at the door; Conniss came down - I asked if he knew the prisoner - he said he had seen him. but he was not in his employ. I then asked if he knew this cock - he said No. The prisoner then said he got it from a house at the west end of the town. I took him into custody.

            . I am clerk to Henry Meux and Co. The prisoner was a labourer
, sent from Messrs. Young's and Co., to take down some vats at our store-house; I saw him at work on the evening of the 21st of December, about six o'clock, and on the following morning I received information, and went into the store-house - I missed two of the cocks which had been fixed in vats - I believe this to be one of them. I have the screw, which fits it exactly.
Prisoner's Defence. I was returning home and the cock was given to me to sell; I took it to the plumber's-shop.

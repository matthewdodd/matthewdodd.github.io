             sworn.
On Monday, the 13th of November, I thought I perceived the warehouse door to move; I saw it, but it was very slightly; in consequence of which, I stepped into the warehouse, and saw the prisoner going off the stone-step; I opened the door, he was without side the dour; I went after him, and took him about twenty yards off; he had the paper; the handkerchiefs were in both his hands; but being before him, they were concealed from me.
The CONSTABLE sworn.
I had this delivered to me the day the prisoner was fully committed, by the prosecutor and his man.
Court to Stephens. Was that the same parcel you took from the prisoner? - Yes.
(Deposed to)
PRISONER's DEFENCE.
I was coming along, and a man shoved it under my arm.

                   Boddington
               



            . I live in Russel-street


: I keep a silversmith's and hardware shop
. On the 18th of January my shew glass was taken away; it lies upon the lower part of the window; I was not at home when it was taken. My shew glass and a small quantity of my goods have been found. I can swear to this pair of buttons and a pair of silver buckles. I went out about four o'clock.
Q. Did you ever see any of the prisoners about your shop?
Boddington. No, not to my knowledge.
Q. The whole you lost were of considerable value?
Boddington . They stood me in about sixty-five pounds. I went the next morning to Mr. Sherwood's; he advised me to print hand bills; I thought that would make them to be secreted; I thought it best not; when I came home I was sent for to the Rotation office ; there Clark took me on one side while the Justices were examining Fitzgerald, and said if they would admit him an evidence, he would tell me where my property was; I was not used to this business; I went down immediately, and the other man's evidence was taken in writing; Fitzgerald was admitted an evidence.


                  John
                   Fitzgerald
               



             . Warren, I, and Clark, agreed to go out; we went along Ratcliff highway, looking for a place to rob at night; we saw four or five places that we intended to go to; the first we thought to go to was in Burr-street , next door to an alehouse; when we came there that house was shut up; then we were going to a shop with an undertaker's hatch at the door; as we were going along we saw this shew glass; we staid about an hour and an half, waiting for an opportunity to take it away; after we found these places, we went to the Sun in St. Catherine's-lane, and had two or three pints of purl; then I ran back into Petticoat-lane, and fetched Brown; we all stood in a lump together at the shew glass, and Warren and I took it, and I put it upon my head; we carried it into the Mulberry Gardens; we took all the goods out, and put them in handkerchiefs, and then we carried them to the house of 
               
                  Thomas
                   Hartman
               



             in Winfield street , and he lent us a white bag to put them into.
Q. What is 
               
                  Thomas
                   Hartman
               



            ?
Fitzgerald. I do not know rightly; he is no trade.
Q. Does he keep a house?
Fitzgerald. No, a room: he is a thief I believe. And then Clarke and Warren carried them to the house of one Fise in Houndsditch.
Q. That is a nick name is it not?
Fitzgerald. I do not know his other name, some call him Scampe.
Boddington. That man was committed to Newgate by the name of 
               
                  Philip
                   Abrahams
               



            , on suspicion of receiving the goods, and was admitted to bail.
Fitzgerald. They carried them there; I followed them unknown to them; he said he would only buy the plate of them two; I went to the Sun, and they came to me, and Warren said he had given them twelve pounds all but a half guinea; I did not see the money paid, and they said he was to give us a leg of mutton and a crown bowl of punch the next day, and then we were to have the half guinea.
Q. What goods had this man?
Fitzgerald. All the things I thought, without they took any thing out a going along. I looked through the door and there was a man in Fise's room, talking Dutch; I heard him saw the stones must be knocked out of some of the buckles ; I saw them go into his room with them . I followed them for fear they should run away with them.
Q. Why did not you go with them?
Fitzgerald. He would not buy them of more than two; Warren gave me and the other two prisoners a guinea each, and Hartman had a guinea for letting him see what we had got. These buckles and buttons we took from Mr. Boddington. We kept a pair of silver buckles a-piece, and Warren came back and fetched them, and said Fise was to have them all; I gave them all back but these buckles; there was a hole in my pocket, and they got down into the lining; I did not know I had them.
Warren. Fitzgerald was committed to be tried here last sessions for picking pockets, but ran away with the hand-cuffs as he was coming to Newgate. I never saw him before he was taken up.


                  Catherine
                   Bigg
               



            . About seven or eight o'clock Fitzgerald came in, and asked me to give him the key of my door; I gave it him; he went up stairs; he staid a little, then I went up; I saw a good deal of silver upon the table; I desired him to take it away for fear I should come into trouble about it. There were silver and stone buckles and silver things of different sorts; Fitzgerald put them into a bag and took them away. Hartman came up in the mean time, and saw the silver things upon the table; he put them in a bag.
Q. Did Hartman lend them that bag?
Bigg. No, it was mine; I boiled a pudding in it; he took it, because he said they would tear a silk handkerchief. I lodged in the same house with Hartman; Fitzgerald said he would go and sell it; they were in a public house.
Q. Did you see the other prisoner with him?
Bigg. Yes; they were drinking together at a public house, and they all went out together; they said they would make me a present of a pair of silver buckles; Fitzgerald gave me a pair; they bid me pick out which pair I would have; one of them took them away again, and said they would have no property to be produced against them; I cannot say which that was. The thief-catchers asked me if I had found any more of the property; I told them they were in a bird cage; they took them out.
Q. Who do you belong to, and how do you get your bread?
Bigg. I buy and sell old clothes.
Q. Are you married?
Bigg. No; I live with Hartman.


                  Thomas
                   Hartman
               



            . I was out; I came home about nine o'clock, and saw Fitzgerald in my room; I asked him what were those things upon the table, and how he brought them there; they said to look at; I said I would not have them there ; I bid them take them down; they did, and gave me part of a pot of beer ; we went into the Mulberry Gardens ; they had left the case in the Mulberry Gardens.
Q. Did they go with you?
Hartman. No, they told me it was there, and I went and told Mr. Mayland of it, one of the people belonging to Whitechapel , and they went and took Fitzgerald up; then I went with Mayland to find the case; the other two were in a public house with Fitzgerald ; we took Fitzgerald first; Fitzgerald and Clark were in the room; when I came home they were drinking together, at one Brand's, at the Sun.


                  John
                   Brand
               



            . I keep the sign of the Sun; I know them all by sight; they came the 18th of January, and had a pint of beer, and a pint of purl, and went out again; Warren was gone out about an hour and an half; Fitzgerald and Brown came in again; they were in the house all the while; Warren and Clark were out about an hour and an half, and came again about half after ten o'clock, and they all drank together in the house; but Warren never sat down at all; and then they all went together, and I fastened the door after them; that was before eleven. I did not see any thing they had at all.
Q. Was 
               
                  Catherine
                   Bigg
               



             there?
Brand. Yes, and Hartman; they were all in company together at that time: the three prisoners and Fitzgerald , went out together, and Hartman and Bigg together; I saw no more of them till next morning I heard they were in custody; then I recollected the time they were in my house, thinking I might be called as an evidence.
Q. from the Jury. Do they use your house much; how often have you seen them together?
Brand. Not very often.
Q. from Warren. Whether I did not come into the house by myself to have a pint of beer when I came from work, they were in the box where I was, I had nothing to do with them?
Brand. I cannot say in particular whether they came in together; they were in company together .


                  John
                   Mayland
               



             . I am an officer; I apprehended them; Hartman told me the shew glass was in the Mulberry Gardens, and said the prisoners had a handkerchief with silver buttons and buckles, rings, &c.
Q. He named the prisoners to you, did he?
Mayland. Yes; I took them and carried them before Justice Sherwood and Digby, at the Rotation Office. I found a pair of silver buckles, two pair of stone buttons, and a stone breast buckle on Fitzgerald. I took Clark and Fitzgerald in one room; there was a pair of solid silver buttons and some seals, which I believe Hartman's girl (Bigg) had.


                  William
                   Symonds
               



             produces the silver buckles and the two pair of buttons taken on Fitzgerald; the stone cross taken under Clark's bed, between the bed and the sacking ; the rest of the things taken from Hartman's (which were deposed to by the prosecutor) and found the shew glass in the Mulberry Gardens.
Warren's Defence.
I never was concerned with this man in what he has alledged against me.
Clark's Defence.
Ask the evidence if ever I had any concerns with him; I always stuck to my work ; I work hard for my living: I sell things about the street, potatoes and greens.
Brown's Defence.
I never had any concern with the evidence in my life.
Brown called three witnesses, his brother, 
               
                  Michael
                   Quin
               



            , and his uncle, who gave him a good character.
Clark called three witnesses, 
               
                  Martha

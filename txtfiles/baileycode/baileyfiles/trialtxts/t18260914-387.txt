            . I am servant to Andrew Luriottis, he lives in Sackville-street


. On the 26th of August, at a quarter before eleven o'clock, I saw the prisoner in the area - the gate was shut, but the people in the kitchen opened it for him - he said he came to know if there were any orders for fish - but he was quite a stranger - the bell rang, and I went away for about three minutes - on my return he was still there; but as he was going out, I saw some milk on his coal-sleeve - I then looked on the tray, and the silver cream ewer was gone - I ran out at the front-door, and overtook him running about the middle of the street - I found this milk ewer in his hat.

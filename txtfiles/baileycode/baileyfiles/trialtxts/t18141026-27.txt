            . I am the nephew of the last witness. I assist in the shop. I was at the far end of the warehouse. I saw the prisoner come into the warehouse, and take the cheese from off a tier which stood near the door. He took it up under his right arm, and run off immediately. I pursued him, and took him with the cheese under his arm, about ten yards from the spot, and conveyed him to our accompting house, and sent for an officer.

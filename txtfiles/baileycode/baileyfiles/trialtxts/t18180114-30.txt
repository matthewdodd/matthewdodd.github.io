            . I am a merchant's clerk. On the 2d of January, about twelve o'clock, I was in Philpot-lane, and saw the prisoner, Spicer, in Mr. Walker's show-room, tying up the indigo; I went in, and told Mr. WalkerReeves was in the passage; Spicer brought several parcels out, and put them on the slab in the passage; Reeves took them-we pursued, and stopped them in Philpot-lane.

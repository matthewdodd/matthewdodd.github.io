            , we keep a shop in Shoemaker row


, and deal in butter, flour, oats, and barley
; about eight at night, the Tuesday before the fire, I was going out to a neighbour's house, I saw the prisoner walking about my door; in about two or three minutes I heard my daughter cry, somebody was gone out with two tubs of butter; a neighbour said to me do not make yourself uneasy, Daniel has got them, we will go and see after him.

            . I am daughter to the prosecutor; my mother stood wringing her hands, saying she had been robbed of two tubs of butter; I was told by a neighbour that the prisoner had fell down with two tubs; we enquired, and found he lived in an alley in Whitechapel. I with others went down the alley to the bottom, a child shewed me his house; I heard his wife run up, and say they are coming, they are coming; I said you wicked creature, how could you rob my mother, and desired a girl to run for a proper officer, but before one came, the prisoner jumped out of a window and ran away; after that his wife came, and said he was killed; she said do not make a noise, come up, and I will give you the butter; I said then bring it down; some of the neighbours went up with me, she opened a closet, there was the butter, one was in the tub, the other out of the tub, all dirty. I took it and brought it home; there were the letters M O scratched on the tub.

            . I was coming home three nights before Christmas, I met the prisoner next door to Mordecai's; he fell down, I helped him up with his tubs; he went about four doors farther, and fell down again; he had two tubs, one full of butter, the other about half full. When the woman complained of being robbed, I told her of Daniel.
Prisoner's defence.
A man came running past and fell down, and left the butter; I said I should be glad to know who it belongs to; this man said it would be the best way for him to help it on my head, and I to carry it home, and see about who owned it afterwards.
Q. to S. Mordecai. Did these tubs stand in your house or at the door?
S. Mordecai. They stood behind my counter, there were two doors to open before he could get to them.
For the prisoner.
Markas Garrick. I was at work the same night, at the prisoner's mother's house, she is a baker; she sent me to call him to work; I went to him to the Blackmoor's-head, he was drinking a pint of beer; I asked him if he would come to work; he said he would come and tell his mother he was not able to come to work; he seemed to be a little in liquor; then when the woman came and said she had lost a tub of butter, he said he was coming along to his mother's and found it.
Marks Marks. The same night this affair happened about a bit of butter, I was sitting in a public-house in Duke's-place; the prisoner came in between seven and eight o'clock; he staid a little while, and asked me if I would be three farthings to his penny; we staid and drank it; then came in Cowen. The prisoner called Garrick, and asked him if he would come to work at his mother's; he went out with him, and came in again, and called to me; I said, what do you want; he said here is a man in Shoemaker-row with a firkin of butter, that wants to sell it; I said, why do not you stop him; presently after there came word, that the prisoner was taken up with a firkin of butter; he follows the baking business, in selling cakes about Duke's place.

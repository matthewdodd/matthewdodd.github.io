            . I am an engraver
, the prisoner lodged with me about six weeks.
Q. Is she married?
Thompson. She says she is, a man lived with her. She lodged with me on her own account in the name of Plint, at 3 s. 6 d. a week. She did not say she was a married woman when she took the lodgings: the man says he is not her husband. She absconded, and sent a porter every day to let me know she was coming home. I found the porter came from one part of the town and she another. Then I had a suspicion of her, and went into the apartment and found the things mentioned in the indictment were gone.
Q. Did you ever find them again?
Thompson. I have seen part of them again at Justice Welch's; a pawnbroker's man produced them. I have got all again but the sheets, looking-glass, and two table cloths. The prisoner was before the Justice, all her defence was that they were pledged in another person's name. They were pledged in the name of Anne or 
               
                  Sarah 
                  Price 
               



            . The next time she owned she did pledge them.
Q. Who paid for the lodging?
Thompson. I received 3 s. and 6 d. of her.
Q. Did she ever turn you over to the man to be paid?
Thompson. No.
Q. from prisoner. Whether I took the lodging for myself, or some body else.
Thompson. When first the prisoner came she took them for a gentleman's clerk and his wife; that is about 12 weeks ago: she said the clerk had married one of the servant maids. But after that she took it in her own name for herself.

            . I am servant to Mr. Allison, a pawnbroker, in Ryder's-court. I took in this tea-kettle of the prisoner at the bar, I lent her a shilling upon it, on the 28th of November. We had all the other things that are found pledged with us in the name of Price; she said her mother kept a house in St. Martin's-lane.
The prisoner in her defence said she did not take the lodging for herself, but for two young women that were turned out of their places.

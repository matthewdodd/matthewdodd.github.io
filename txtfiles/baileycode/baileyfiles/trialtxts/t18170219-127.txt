            . I am a carpenter
, and live in Adam-street, Manchester-square. On the 26th of January, about three o'clock in the afternoon. I was in Hyde Park


, I saw a mob there and went up to it. I felt for my handkerchief and missed it-it was safe ten minutes before. I ran from the mob, and saw about five boys standing together, I went up to them, and saw the prisoner with my handkerchief in his hand; I secured him, and the other boys went away.

M. A. MORTIMER
            . I was in the park and went up to the mob, who were looking at two boys fighting. I saw the prisoner attempt to pick several persons pockets, nobody was with him at first. I saw him draw the prosecutor's handkerchief out of his pocket - I told him of it, and he took the prisoner.

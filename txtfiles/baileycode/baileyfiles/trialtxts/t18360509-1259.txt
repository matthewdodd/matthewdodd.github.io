 was indicted for stealing on the

Thomas Dean.






THOMAS DEAN
. I am a market-gardener, and attend Convent-Garden market. I was there on the 7th of May, about half-past nine o'clock, and had a cart loaded with baskets—I left my coat in it—I was not absent ten minutes—I was not away from the cart above seven or eight yards in sight of it, and saw the prisoner snatch the coat from the cart and run away—he had a little boy with him—I took him seven or eight yards off, with it, and gave him in charge of the policeman directly.





JOHN TUCK
. I am a policeman. I took him in charge, and received the coat from the prosecutor.
Prisoner. The cart was loaded with manure—the coat was not on the basket—It laid in front of the cart—not inside it at all.






JOHN BRIGHT
. I attended the market—I saw the prisoner take the coat from the front part of the cart—it was not loaded with baskets—there was no dung in it.
(Properly produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner. I was coming from the public-house, when I was accused taking the coat.
(Bridget Coleman, the wife of a labourer, gave the prisoner a good character.)




GUILTY
. Aged 34.—


Transported for Seven Years.

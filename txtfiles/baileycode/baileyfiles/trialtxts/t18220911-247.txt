. On the 12th of February, the prisoner came to the house, and asked if Mr. Tonkin lived there, and said he had sent him for his great coat to go out with Mr. Mills: I asked his name; he said, 
               
                  William 
                  Hains
               



            , and that he worked at Mills's. I never saw him before but gave him the coat, and I am certain of his person.

            . I lived with Tonkin. I saw the prisoner on the 12th of February, when he came to the door for the coat. I opened the door to him. She consulted me about it and gave it him in a handkerchief. He seemed to know we did not like to give it him, and said we might depend on it all was right. I said, he must not be offended at us because so many tricks were played. I have no doubt of his person.
Prisoner's Defence. I never saw the coat, dont know where the gentleman lived, or any thing about it.

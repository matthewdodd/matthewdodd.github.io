             and I are partners: I live in Lawrence-lane: On the 8th, 9th, and 10th of last month we sent to our shop in
Broker's-Row, Moorefields


, thirty-five chaldron of coals: we keep a shop there for pressing. We received information that the two prisoners, whom we employed to shoot them, had stole a considerable quantity, and conveyed them to the house of 
               
                  James 
                  Ingram 
               



            , whose door opens into the alley. I got a search-warrant from Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            : I went, and told Ingram what I came about; he owned he had received some coals of them, and shewed us where they were, but declared he was absent when they were taken in; he requested not to be prosecuted, and said he would pay us for them: the next morning I sent 
               
                  James 
                  Gardner 
               



             to to measure the coals: he is here to give evidence.

                  Thistle 
               



            . I was near Ingram's door on the 9th and 11th of March, and saw Stringer take coals out of the sacks in the cart, and give them to Booth (they were large Scotch coals), and Stringer carried them into Ingram's house: he carried them at many times.


                  James 
                  Gardner 
               



            . I measured the coals at Ingram's, there were ten bushels.
The prisoners both denied the charge.

            . I am an attorney's clerk
. On the 17th of May, I was returning home, about twelve o'clock at night, and at the bottom of Stonecutter-street, on the West side of Fleet-market


, I lost this money. There were four women standing at the bottom of Stonecutter-street, the three prisoners, and another. As I passed; 
               
                  Ann 
                  Turner
               



             put her arm round my waist, thrust her hand into my pocket, and took this money out, handing it to the fourth woman, who made off. Dixon and the other girl were not doing any thing. I seized hold of Turner immediately, and never let her go until the watchman came up, to whom I gave her in custody.

            . I am a grocer
, and live in Banner-street, St. Lukes


, a box of raisins stood on a cannister inside my door; I saw them when I opened the shop, abouthalf-past seven o'clock in the morning. We were at breakfast in the back parlour, and saw somebody come in and go out of the shop; I ran and missed the raisins, and saw the prisoner with the box under his arm, about twenty yards off. I followed and took him with them.

Prisoner's Defence. I had just passed the shop, when a man asked me to carry the box to the end of the street, and he would give me a few halfpence; I took it without hesitation, when the prosecutor seized me, the man ran away. I did not state this to the Magistrate as I was advised not.

                  WILLIAM
                   TILT
               



             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am a confectioner
, in Cheapside


; the prisoner was my shopman
: In consequence of a suspicion that my till had been robbed, on the 7th of January I marked ten shillings; there was one half-crown.
Q. Was Mr. Garner present when they were marked? - A. I went to his house to mark them; I gave it to Mary Hill to lay it out in goods in my shop.
Q. About what time was it you marked this money, and delivered it to Mrs. Hill? - A. Between five and six o'clock.
Q. When was it you came to your house to examine your till after that? - A. Near eight o'clock; when I went out I left four sixpences in the till, to know how much money there should bein the till; there were ten shillings laid out by 
               
                  Mary
                   Hill
               



            , and a shilling by another person; when I came home, there were only seven shillings and sixpence in the till; I got a constable, and the person that marked the money, Mr. Garner, and took him into the counting-house; I told him I wanted to see what silver he had in his pocket; he pulled out fifty-three shillings in silver from his waistcoat pocket; upon examining that silver, I found a half-crown and three shillings marked with Mr. Garner's mark upon them; we asked him how he came by that silver; he said, it was all his own; Mr. Garner said, he would swear to the marks on the three shillings and half-crown; in consequence of that I sent him to the Compter; the half-crown and three shillings are in the possession of the constable, Mr. Mason.
Cross-examined by Mr. Const. Q. Mr. Garner marked this money? - A. Yes.
Q. Did you see him mark it? - A. Yes.
Q. What kind of a mark was it? - A. A kind of a half moon.
Q. Was it such a kind of mark as you could swear to? - A. Yes; I think I could.
Q. You left four sixpences in the till? - A. Yes.
Q. And found seven shillings and sixpence only? - A. Yes.
Q. How much did you suppose was gone? - A. Five or six shillings.
Q. Why do you suppose five of six shillings? - A. There was one shilling laid out by a person we saw come out.
Q. How do you know that? - A. I asked Mrs. Tilt; there might be more laid out.
Q. You think you missed five or six shillings? - A. There were thirteen, to my knowledge.
Q. You found in his pocket half-a-crown and three shillings? - A. Yes, of marked money, out of fifty-three shillings.
Q. Is it usual for the shopman to give change in the shop? - A. It is not usual; he has sometimes done it.
Q. He has lent money to the till, and taken money from it? - A. I don't remember more than half-a dozen times in the three years he was with me.
Q. He takes money when you are out? - A. I am generally at home, except when I am on a journey.
Q. Had he ever occasion to apply to you to advance money for him? - A. No.
Q. Has he ever left money in you hands? - A. Yes, his wages; if he had been with me to the end of the year, I should have owed him twenty pounds.
Q. Where did you get this man when he came to you? - A. He had been a bankrupt, and was very strongly recommended to me, he had been a jeweller, I wondered how he could live on my service as he did; I asked him if he had any other resources; he said he did not know that he had; he spent, I suppose, an hundred pounds a year more than I allowed him, that led me to suspect him.
Court. Q. When he took change from the till, did he ask your leave? - A. He had no business with the till.
Court. Q. You found no gold in the till in lieu of the silver? - A. None.

Prisoner's defence. I shall leave it to my Counsel; except observing, that I had free egress and regress to the till; and that I used to lend money occasionally out of my pocket to the till.

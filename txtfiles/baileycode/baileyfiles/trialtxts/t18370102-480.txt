DENNIS DODD
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
15th of December, 21bs. weight of cheese, value 1s., the goods of 



Joseph Peppercorn; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






JOSEPH DICKS
. I am shopman to Joseph Peppercorn, a cheesemonger. The prisoner came to our shop on the 15th of December, and bought a pennyworth of cheese—I accused him at the door of taking something—he said if he had taken any thing, it was by mistake—I said it could not be

a mistake—I found this piece of cheese in his bag, which was in his hand—it is my master's—it was agreed for, but the person who bought it had gone to the other counter to buy some more goods.

Prisoner. I was just outside the door, and he called me—I said if I had it, I had put it in by mistake—I had a pound of bread and some other things.





BENJAMIN LOVELL
 (police-sergeant R 15.)I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction of felony from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the man.




GUILTY
. Aged 45.—


Transported for Seven Years.

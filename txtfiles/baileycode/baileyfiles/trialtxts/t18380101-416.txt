JOHN SHOWLER
. I am a policeman. I was on duty yesterday, about half-past six o'clock in the morning, in Seymour-street, Bryanstone-square—I saw a wagon at a coffee-shop, and a cart alongside, and the prisoner in the cart—I saw the cart drive about four or five rods from the wagon—the book-keeper called out, "Stop him"—I went towards the cart, and the prisoner was then driving—I took the prisoner and the cart—in the cart was this package, which the wagoner owned.





THOMAS WHITNALL
. I torn in the service of John Robins and Mr. Mills, they are wharfingers at Paddington and at London Wall. I had the care of this wagon—I brought the property from No. 5, Wharf, Paddington, and was to take it to different parts of the City—this calico was to go to Wood-street—I stopped to get my breakfast—I went in first, and then the wagoner went in, and I was outside—I saw the cart come—the prisoner took the bale out of the wagon, and put it into the cart—he was then going on—I followed him, got in and stopped him—I called the policeman—it weighed 2cwt. and 20lbs.





RICHARD WEBB
. I am a carman. I lent the cart to the prisoner on Tuesday night—he had it at half-past four o'clock, and then he returned it at half-past five o'clock, and asked me to let him have a cart the first thing the next morning, which I did—that was this cart.




GUILTY
. Aged 28.—


Transported for Seven Years.

            . About five o'clock the day the King of Denmark was in the city, I saw the prisoner follow the prosecutor down Cheapside from near King-street; he made several attempts at his pocket, the pocket-lid being in he could not do it; just before we got to the Mansion house, I saw him take the handkerchief out; I collared him, and said to the gentleman, you have lost your handkerchief; the prisoner went to throw it into the coach-way, but he could not, I was too quick for him.

            . I was opposite the Mansion house at the time, the 23d of September; I saw the prisoner throw the gentleman's handkerchief into the kennel, and I picked it up.
Prisoner's defence.
I know nothing of the matter; I picked it up, and Mr. Paine got hold of me; I am an honest lad, and work hard for my bread, I am a farrier
 by trade; there is not a sessions goes over Paine's head but he transports twenty of them; I am eighteen years of age last April.

             and I are partners in the houses from which the lead was stole. On Sunday the 4th of June, about ten o'clock at night, the watchman came to my house and informed me there was a man on the house stealing the lead; he is a watchman we employ ourselves; I went with him to the back of the houses; there was a ladder; I placed the watchman at the bottom, and went up the ladder myself, and found the prisoner on the top of the house, and within half a yard of him there was a bag with 40 lb. of lead in it. I asked him if he had any confederates; he said he had not, but owned he cut the lead; it was taken from the sky light.

            , the watchman, confirmed the evidence of the former witness.
The prisoner said nothing in his defence, but begged the mercy of the Court.

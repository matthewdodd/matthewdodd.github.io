; I was taken very ill going up the New-road; she asked me to go into her mother's; I went in there, and I fainted away; she brought a little water and washed my face, and brought me too; and asked me to lay down on her mother's bed, in a little back room; I said, I would be glad; and she led me into the room; and I laid down on the bed; she said, nothing should hurt me, till she came to me again, and she would lock the door, and take the key in her pocket; the prisoner locked me in; I had a silk handkerchief about my neck; I awoke and found the prisoner searching my pockets; she ran away, and away she went; there were two guineas in gold. three silver half crowns, one shilling, and a sixpence; the gold was tied up in my black silk handkerchief, and round my neck in a double knot; the silver was in a japanned iron snuff box in my pocket; the snuff box was taken with the money in it; when she went out of the room, I could not go so quick after her, and there were three turnings; I could not tell which of the turnings she went down.
Prisoner. She asked me in the lock-up room to make it up with her, she said, she was very poor? - I did not.

            . You knew where this woman lived? - No; I knew where her mother lived.
You knew her name also? - I knew the name she went by.
How came it then you did not go before a Justice of the Peace? - I did the next day, and took the mother into custody; I made enquiries after her, but could not find her.
PRISONER's DEFENCE.
We came from Gravesend together; the prosecutrix borrowed three-pence of me, because she had no money; coming through Limehouse, she says to me Poll, I want to call for something to drink; I went to my brother's and had some breakfast; says I, now Mrs. Forecast, I wish you a good by; she went home with me; she was taken very ill, and sent for a quartern and half of gin, and changed sixpence; my mother asked her to lay down; says she, do not leave me; says I, I am sleepy, I must go home to bed; I left this gentlewoman at my mother's, and saw no more of her till five weeks ago she charged me with this.

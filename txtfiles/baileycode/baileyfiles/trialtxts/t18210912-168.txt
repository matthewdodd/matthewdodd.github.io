            . I belong to the ship Jane
, which laid near Wapping


; the prisoner had a passage on board from Amsterdam. On the 3d of September I missed these things from the captain's bed in the cabin; he knew where I kept them - I went ashore, returned between six and seven o'clock on the morning of the 4th, and they were gone - he had left the ship about an hour and a half after me. When he was apprehended my handkerchief was found in his hat. I have found nothing else. My clothes were new; I paid 3 l. 18 s. for them on the night they were stolen.

            . I am a Thames police surveyor. On the 11th of September I apprehended the prisoner at the Ship and Pilot public house - I could not find him before. I asked what he had done with these clothes. He said he sold them for 30 s. to a Jew in Rosemary-lane on the night he took them - I found the handkerchief in the crown of his hat.
(Handkerchief produced and sworn to.)

Prisoner's Defence. The handkerchief is mine. I did not steal the clothes.

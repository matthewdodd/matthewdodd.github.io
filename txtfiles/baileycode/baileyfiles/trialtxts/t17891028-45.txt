JUDITH M'NAMARA sworn.
I am servant to the prosecutor; he is a publican
 in Dyot-street


, the Noah's Ark: the boiler was stolen from our house; I saw it at seven at night, on the 21st of October; I missed it next morning; I saw the prisoner Pinnell there cleaning knives for dinner, and he was there after I saw it the last time; I know nothing of their stealing it; I did not see Hawley there.
GEORGE ALLEN sworn.
I am a constable: I caught these two prisoners going into an old iron shop, in Bowl-yard; I caught the little one, and the other put it down, and ran down stairs into the back kitchen; I called Mansfield: I saw them both come together to the house; they could give no account of it: it was advertised; it was Wednesday the 21st, about nine at night.
(Deposed to by the prosecutor, who had had it fourteen years.)
It is an old battered one, and a bit of the lip of the cock is wanting.
Prisoners. We were not in the house; we have no friends.

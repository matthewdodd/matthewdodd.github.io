            . I live in Bell-lane, Spitalfields. On the 1st of May, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, I had my purse containing this money in my basket - I had been to a shop in Aldgate


 to buy a gown - I had two sovereigns, and got change at the shop; I was going into another shop, close to the church. I stood looking in at the window; the prisoner stood at my side - I felt something touch me; I looked down, and saw him take his hand out of my basket, with my purse in his hand - he ran off; I pursued, calling Stop thief! he was stopped before I lost sight of him. Three boys were standing by him when he took it. The purse was not found - I am certain I saw him with it.

            . I live with Mrs. Crane, at the five bells


 at Bow


; on Saturday morning, before my mistress was up, the Prisoner came in, and called for a pint of drink, and took the pestle and mortar off the mantle-piece, and went away with them; I missed them, followed him, and took them from him.
Q. What did he say, when you charged him with them?
Higgs. When I took hold of him, I said he had got them; he said he had not, and I said I was sure he had them, but whether he had, or had not, I told him he should go along with me; he went back with me to the house, and I took the mortar out of his bag, and the pestle out of his pocket.
Prisoner. I own I was in the house, and called for a pint of ale; and when I was gone, a man came running after me, and desired I would hold them for him, which I did; and this gentlewoman came after me, and charged me with taking them.

            . On the 24th of March I was at work at this place; Cox's trowel was put into a box which I locked, and when I returned from dinner the box was gone; I had seen the prisoner about the place, and found him that afternoon, and said I wanted my box of tools - he said he had not got it, and told me to go with him to his lodging. I went and he gave me these two trowels; he worked on the premises once.

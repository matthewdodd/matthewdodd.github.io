, and live at Aldgate


. I can only say the handkerchiefs in question, eight dozen and seven in the whole, are my property. There are my marks upon them. I was not in the shop when they were taken.

            . I was called to, and told that Mr. Smith had been robbed of some handkerchiefs. I saw the prisoner look back and then run. I followed her. She dropped the handkerchiefs, and ran on. I ran and took her, and brought her back
Thomas Walker. I am apprentice to Mr. Smith. I saw the prisoner stooping down at our shop door, and likewise saw her go out. I knew she had got something, but could not tell what then. I looked, and missed the handkerchiefs out of the window. She was pursued; and she and the handkerchiefs were brought back: they are my master's property.

            . I saw the prisoner on the step of Mr. Smith's door, with some handkerchiefs under her cloak. I followed her, and saw her look back several times. She turned the corner of the Minories. My fellow-servant ran and brought her back, and I picked up the handkerchiefs.

I never laid my eyes on the handkerchiefs.

JAMES MOYES. I am helper at Mr. Tarling's liverystables; the prisoner was in his employ: I saw him there on the day he was taken; I do not know what day it was; he was employed that day, and he left without giving notice: he was employed by the day - when he was gone, I missed my handkerchief, my waistcoat, and 3s. 3d. which was in the pocket; it had hung on the nail, No. 2, in the stable; the head ostler gave information, and the property was found on the prisoner.

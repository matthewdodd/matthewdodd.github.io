            . I am a green-grocer
. I was looking in the New Times Office window, in Fleet-street


, and felt some person pressing my right-hand coat pocket, and saw the reflection of my handkerchief in the window - I turned round, and saw it in the prisoner's hand; he passed it to another man, who instantly walked away. I caught hold of the prisoner, and desired the crowd to hold him while I pursued the other, but no person would hold him, therefore the other got away.
Prisoner's Defence. I have always been honest, and am innocent.

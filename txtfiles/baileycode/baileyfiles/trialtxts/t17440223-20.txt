            . On the 15th of this instant I went to an eating-house over-against my house, but I kept my eye upon my shop: I had left this piece of flowered lawn upon the counter, I saw somebody go into the shop pretty quick, I went over and took this piece of lawn upon the Prisoner.
Q. Where-abouts in the shop was he when you took him?
Marsh. He was about the door, I cannot say whether he was in or out of the shop.
Prisoner. I was going on an errand for my mother who is a washerwoman, and was at the door knocking for somebody to come to me.
Jury. Does the boy
's mother wash clothes for you?
Marsh. No, I neither know him nor his mother.

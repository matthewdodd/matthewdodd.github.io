            . I am a cabinet-maker
, and live in Greek-street, Soho. On 27th of August, between twelve and one o'clock, I was looking at a print-shop in Cockspur-street


, an officer called out,
"You have lost your handkerchief;" I felt and missed it from my right hand coat pocket; they immediately produced it, and had the prisoner in custody, I had not seen him near me.

            . I belong to the Thames police. I was in Cockspur-street, and saw the prisoner at the print-shop, in company with another boy, and two others stood on one side; I saw him lift the prosecutor's coat pocket up three times, and the fourth time he got the handkerchief out. I immediately collared him and took it from his bosom, where I had seen him put it.
JURY. Q. Why did you not tell the prosecutor - A. Because two boys were in company - I took the other boy too.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. Another boy took it.

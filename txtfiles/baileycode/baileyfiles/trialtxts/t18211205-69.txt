, at the corner of Wardour-street, Cook asked me if my handkerchief was gone. I felt, and missed it from my coat pocket, he took me to a wine-vaults, at the corner of Charles-street, Soho, and charged the prisoner with it, he was there, and denied it. It has not been found.

            . I am an umbrella maker, and live in High-street, St. Giles's. The prisoner passed my shop with a man and woman, about two o'clock, they were trying to take Ball's handkerchief, I went out, and watched them to the corner of Charles-street, and saw the prisoner take the handkerchief out of Ball's pocket, and wipe his nose with it. I pushed him into the wine-vaults, and asked where the handkerchief was, (the man and woman were at the corner) he said, "What handkerchief?" I said, "The handkerchief you took out of the gentleman's pocket;" I said he had it when I laid hold of him. I give him in care of the people while I fetched Ball, who returned with me.

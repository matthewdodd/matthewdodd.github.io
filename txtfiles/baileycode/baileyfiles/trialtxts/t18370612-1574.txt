HESTER EMERY
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
12th of June, 1 watch, value 2l.; and 1 handkerchief, value 3d.; the goods of 



Abel Ewer, from his person.







ABEL EWER
. I am an under-gardener, and live at Denham. On Monday, the 12th of June, I was at Uxbridge, about eleven o'clock at night—I was sober—I saw the prisoner at the Gardeners' Arms, where I was—I had seen her before—we got into conversation, and went up the yard together—my watch was then in my fob, and my handkerchief in my hat—I paid her 1s.—we were there a very little while—my hat fell off, but I did not miss my handkerchief then, but missed my watch—I stepped back and charged her with robbing me—she denied it, and I told the watchman—this is my handkerchief—I know it by its having a piece on it of a different colour—I have never seen the watch since.





JAMES DARVILL
. I am a constable of Uxbridge. The prosecutor complained to me of being robbed of his watch and handkerchief about twelve o'clock on Monday night—he described the woman to me, and in consequence I apprehended the prisoner next morning—I told her the charge, and found this handkerchief on her—she said she took it out of his hat—she said she had not got the watch, that a person who went with a man named Gowl had got it, and was gone to the races, and if I went there I should find it—I said I was bound to be here next morning and could not go.

Prisoner. I never had the watch, nor ever saw it.




GUILTY
. Aged 32.—


Transported for Fourteen Years.

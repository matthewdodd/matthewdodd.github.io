MOSES COHEN
 was indicted

 for stealing 5 coats, value 42s., the goods of 



William Bryant.






JAMES KEAN
. I am in the service of William Bryant, a clothier, at Aldgate. On the night of the 17th of October I had five coats inside the door-way of the shop, and noticed a motion as if somebody was moving them—I ran out and saw the prisoner with them in his arms—I seized hold of him, and he dropped them—a policeman came up soon after—the coats were worth two guineas—they laid partly on some others, and were fastened with a chain, which was broken—they were not tied together—he might as well have taken one as the five.





HENRY FINN'S
 (City police-constable, No. 607.) I took the prisoner into custody, and produce the clothes—he had a large bag, which he wore before him as an apron.

Prisoner's Defence. I was walking down Aldgate; the prosecutor laid hold of me and threw me on the ground; he said I had stolen his coats.





JAMES KEAN

re-examined. I am quite sure he had them in his possession.




GUILTY
.* Aged 17.—


Transported for Seven Years.

(The prisoner had been in custody twice before, and once summarily convicted.)

JOSEPH DAVIS LEATHART
. I am a house-decorator, and live in Bath-place. On the afternoon of the 27th of February I saw the prisoners, and followed them into Crawford-street—I saw Jones with his back to Mr.

Norbury's shop, and Bennett looking into the window—he came away, and spoke to Jones two or three times, and then went up to the shop-door—I lost sight of him, and then saw him come out with something, and go round the street, followed by Jones—a policeman came round the corner—I told him, and we went up to York-street—I saw Bennett with the goods on his shoulder, and secured him—Jones immediately crossed over the road behind two women—I gave Bennett to the policeman, and took Jones, and gave him in charge—they had kept in company all the way, and were in communication together, and went away together with the goods—Jones afterwards said to me, "This is a case"—I said, "Do you think so?"—he said, "It looks very much like it"—he said, if we had taken him in the morning, there would have been something worth.





WILLIAM CROUCHER
 (police-constable B 97.) I took charge of Bennett, be had the six pieces of prints on his shoulder.





FREDERICK WILLIAM HANKS
. I am shopman to James Norbury, of Crawford-street—these prints are his property, and are worth 3l.—they were safe in the shop in the forenoon of the 27th of February.

Jones's Defence. I met Bennett in Oxford-street—he said he was looking for work—I went with him to Crawford-street—he said, "Wait a moment"—he looked into the window, and directly afterwards he went away from the door with something.

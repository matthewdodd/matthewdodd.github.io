ALEXANDER MAISEY
. On the 18th of April, I employed the prisoner to carry my box, containing these articles, from South-street, Chelsea, to Charles-street, Grosvenor-square—I never saw him again until last Saturday fortnight—I have never seen any of the articles—when I took him he said he had received the box from my brother and mentioned some of the articles that were in it, and then laughed at me.





ADOLPHUS MAISEY
. I delivered this box to the prisoner on the 18th of April.





MARY O'BRIEN
. A short time after Easter the prisoner showed me a comb and a nightcap.





EDWARD DUNBAR
 (police-constable F 102.) The prisoner was given into my charge—he said it was all through a woman that brought him into this trouble—when I took him to the prosecutor he laughed at him.

Prisoner's Defence. The prosecutor gave me the box to carry to Malpas Arms, Grosvenor-square—when I arrived near the top of Sloane-street I met George Cannon—he said, "I will help you"—I gave it him and crossed the street—he went on, and when I got to the corner he was out of sight—he must have got into a cab or an omnibus.




GUILTY

Transported for Seven Years.

            . I am a labourer
 to Mr. Cox, at Hillingdon


. On the night of the 8th of January I left my great coat in a private watch-house on his premises, which I have to lock up at night, and unlock in the morning; I went the next morning, about half-past seven o'clock; the watch-house was broken open, and the coat gone - the prisoner lives about three miles off.

            . I am constable of Hillingdon. Late in the evening of the 31st of January, I found a hare or a rabbit fastened in a snare, but it was dark, and I could not see what it was; I got up early the next morning, and went to the place with two other men - soon afterwards the prisoner and another were coming into the cover; I took the prisoner - the prosecutor saw him the next morning, and accused him of having his jacket on his back; this is the jacket.

            . This is my jacket; I lost two or three other little things at the same time.
Prisoner's Defence. I picked it up as I was going to work, and my mother mended it.

            . - I am matron of the workhouse of St. Giles' in the Fields, and St. George, Bloomsbury


. I have known the prisoner two years or more; she was at one time a pauper in the house - on the 29th of March she presented this order to me in the store-room, and I gave her a shift and a petticoat.
THOMAS TUCKER. I am assistant-overseer of these parishes. I have known the prisoner twelve months - she has been in the poor-house; this order is a forgery - it is not my writing, nor written by any person employed by or authorized by me.
Prisoner's Defence. Mr. Tucker gave me this order; I asked him for it, and he gave it me.
MR. TUCKER. I never gave the prisoner this order -I have a letter written to me in the name of Crook, and these orders appear in the same hand-writing as the letter.

            . Aged 18. - 


               Transported for Fourteen Years

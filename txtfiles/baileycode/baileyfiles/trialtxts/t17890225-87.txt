             sworn.
I was sitting in my parlour behind the shop, and I heard a noise; I turned my head, and I saw the street-door open, and saw the shop-door open; the prisoner was behind the compter on his knees; he had the till out on the floor, and was going to shut the door; I saw him, and catched him by the collar, and called my neighbour to assist me: I took him to the Justices' office in Clerkenwell; he got the till out, and got it on the floor; there was 12 s. 6 d. ten shillings and half-a-crown.
PRISONER's DEFENCE.
I was standing at this gentleman's door, and a child was standing by the door; a man came, and had liked to have knocked me against the child; he took and threw my hat into this gentleman's parlour, and that gentleman took me.

            . On Sunday, the 15th of January last, between eight and nine in the evening, a gentleman told me, as I was near the Horn-Tavern, Fleet-street


, the prisoner had then picked, my pocket; I felt, and missed my handkerchief: I seized the prisoner. I did not see my handkerchief fall, but the gentleman took it from the ground, and gave it to me. I had made use of it when I was near St. Dunstan's church.

            . The prosecutor and I were coming arm-in-arm along Fleet-street. A gentleman came and tap'd him on the shoulder, when near the Horn-Tavern, and said, a man had pick'd his pocket. We both took hold of the prisoner: soon after, the prisoner, took the handkerchief out of his pocket, and dropped it by his left side; I saw him do it. (Produced in court, and deposed to.)
Prisoner's Defence.
They took hold of me, and were going to carry me to the pump, in St. Paul's Church-yard: I got hold of his collar, and he of mine: I said it should not be done, without a right understanding for it.
Prosecutor. The prisoner was very resolute, and wanted to get away. I told him, if he would not submit quietly, I would take him to the pump: then he said, he would go to the watch-house, but before we got there, he offered to run away.

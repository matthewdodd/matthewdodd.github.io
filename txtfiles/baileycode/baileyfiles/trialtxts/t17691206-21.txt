            . I am servant
 to Mr. Hall, a distiller, at Moregate. The prisoner was servant
 to Mrs. Corral in Whitechapel


, where I had left my trunk, with the things mentioned in the indictment among other things in it. All were very safe in it the latter end of October; the box was locked, and I had the key. The day after Lord Mayor's day, I went to look in my trunk, and missed my piece of Irish and a silk gown. The trunk I found locked. I never got my things again.

                  Bailey 
               



             left her trunk at my house. I know the gown and piece of Irish were in it. The prisoner was my servant. She came the Wednesday week before Lord-Mayor's day. The trunk was in the room where she lay. She staid till Lord-Mayor's day three o'clock. She would stay no longer.

             came the day after to fetch the things away, and missed the gown and cloth. A warrant was taken out, and the prisoner was taken and charged with taking them. She owned she had sold the gown in Rosemary-lane for 1 l. 6 s. to 
               
                  Samuel 
                  Whitmore 
               



            . She owned she took it out of the trunk, and hoped we would not hurt her. We went to Mr. Whitmore's, and he owned he had bought a gown of her, but had sold it the Monday after to a country person.

            . I was with the constable when the prisoner was taken up. I heard her confess she opened the trunk with a key of her own, and took out the gown, and locked the trunk again, and went and sold it in Rosemary-lane. We went with her to Mr. Whitmore's, who said he bought such a gown of her for 26 s. and that he had sold it.


                  Samuel 
                  Whitmore 
               



            . I live at the Golden Ball in Rosemary-lane. On the Tuesday before Lord-Mayor's day my wife bought a silk gown of the prisoner for 26 s. it was a pink colour, lined with a dirty coloured white; and on the Tuesday following came a countrywoman and her two daughters; where they live I do not know. I sold it them with other things.
The prisoner in her defence said the gown she sold was her own.

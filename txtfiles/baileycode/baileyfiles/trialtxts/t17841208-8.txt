            , Esq; sworn.
The prisoner lived servant
 with me about a week, I had discharged the prisoner that morning, and upon some information I sent for him, but he did not come, I then sent to bring him by force, upon which he was brought to me, and in his presence 
               
                  Thomas
                   Archer
               



             said he had dropped a pair of buckles, which they brought in; on the landing of the stairs; I asked him why he took away the buckles, he said he had got them that evening from Gray's, in Bond-street, where I had sent them the evening before to get the plate put in; I told him that was impossible, as they had been brought home some days before, I paid the bill; I then told him I did not wish to be troubled, I had got the buckles, and he might go about his business; he very insolently told me he would not, I ordered him to be turned out, he knocked the watchman down under the bannister of the stairs, it was then thought proper to send to his lodgings to have them searched; after I had discharged him I understood he came back three or four times, on some pretence or other; a bundle was brought from his lodgings, in which was five of my shirts, and two pair of drawers, I then wanted to turn him out of the house, he swore he would not go out, and beat and abused the constable and patrol, and they then told me, if I chose to let him go, they would take him to the watch-house; since that time I have had bundles brought to me of laced waistcoats and stockings, and other things that were not in this indictment.
Prisoner. Whether Mr. Churchill was not all that time on the settee in the dining room?
Prosecutor. I was lame, he called out I want to speak to my master, I will speak to my master, you shall not force me out of the house; I went to the door, lame as I was, and said what have you to say? I saw him take hold of the bannisters of the stairs.

             sworn.
I went to the public house after the prisoner.
Court. You told Mr. Churchill that you supposed he had taken the buckles, what made you think so? - The reason I had was, a young man a fellow servant of mine took them out of his pocket; he took them out in the hall above stairs, the prisoner came to drink with us before we parted, my fellow servant's name is 
               
                  Charles
                   Taylor
               



            , when he found my fellow servant had taken the buckles of his pocket, which he had no reason for, I believe it was a mere joke, as I sat by the side of him he took them out, then the prisoner snatched them out of Taylor's hand and struck him; the prisoner put the buckles in his right hand pocket again, he said nobody should see them, his coat dropped down from under his arm, and

             took out one buckle after; I was present and saw it, then he snatched the buckle out of her hand, and it seratched her hand as he snatched it out; I told him I would not have any confusion in the house, he had better go to the publick house and have a pot of beer, and I would come to him immediately; he accordingly went, I went and told my master, I then went to the publick house to him, and told him my master wanted to speak to him, he said he would not come till the next morning; my master not being able to go, he got his brother to go to the publick house, I went with him, and the prisoner came with us, and the watchman and patrol; when we brought him to the house, he made an attempt to get out at the glass door which is behind the house, and the watchman stopped him; going up stairs, he put his hand in his right hand pocket and pulled out the buckles, and put them into his breeches, I was close to him, and saw him.
Could you see what he had in his hand? - I observed they were buckles, I told him it was of no signification to put them there, I was sure they were the buckles; he took them out immediately, and put them on the bannisters by me, I took them up and carried them to Mr. Churchill, and he said they were his property; I knew the buckles, I have them now, they were in a bit of paper, these are the same buckles.
(The buckles handed to Mr. Churchill.)
Court. By what circumstance do you know them to be your's? - By the size and pattern.
Is it possible to know a silver buckle, they are a pattern a good deal in use now? - I do not know, I have no doubt of their being mine.
What did the prisoner say about them? - I asked him how he came to take them away, he said he had them from Gray's that evening, he did not deny their being mine at all.
Court. Who went to his lodgings? - The watchman.
How were his lodgings found out? - He told me were he lodged the day he left Mr. Churchill; the publican came with him, we brought four shirts and two pair of drawers, they are now in the possession of the publican; after that he was carried to the watch-house, and to a Magistrate.

             was sitting by the fireside, by the prisoner, and he put his hand into his pocket in a joke, and he pulled out a pair of buckles, then the prisoner took the buckles from him, and put them in his right pocket, and struck Taylor; he wrapped up his coat, and said nobody should see them; and he dropped his coat again, and I put my hand and took out one of the buckles, and he scratched my hand in taking it away; I thought then they were my master's buckles, because he seemed to be so angry, and I saw them about a fortnight before.

             sworn.
We were all sitting in the hall together, and in a joke I put my hand into his pocket, and brought out these buckles; at the instant he missed the buckles, he got up and struck me, he catched them out of my hands, and put them in his right-hand pocket, I did not know whether he was angry or no, I took it as a joke; I saw him take the buckle from

            , I am a publican, I told him he was not there, I thought he might be up at the stables; he then said he was discharged by his master; I said I was sorry for it, he says, will you oblige me with a lodging to night, I am engaged with a gentleman for forty guineas per annum, to wait on him at nine o'clock; I said if he could lay with my little son, he said with all his heart; he came to my house about half after ten at night, and asked for a pot of beer, he said somebody was coming, he waited there about 15 minutes, at last

             came, and desired him to come to his master, he did not go at his request; soon after the Captain's brother came, and then he said he would go; I saw no more of him till the watchman came to ask if he had any property in my house; says I, why, what is the matter; O, says he, I am afraid there is a robbery in the house, I said, God forbid! the prisoner about four in the evening, when he came to engage the lodging, desired me to take these things, to take care of.
Did he give them you as his own? - I understood it so; this is the bundle he gave me, I left it in the house with some of the family, the bundle was opened that night, and there were four shirts, and two pair of drawers, and this dirty handkerchief, they looked at them, and said they were Captain

            's property; I did not look at them that night.
In whose hands did you leave that bundle? - I cannot say.
Archer. I had it in my care all night, I locked it up, the next morning I gave it to Kettle again.
Court to Prosecutor. Have you ever seen the buckles after they came home from Gray's? - I cannot say I have, they brought in the bill and told me they were come, the prisoner did not take them in; my things were under his care.
Archer. I took them in from Gray's man.
How came the prisoner not to take them in? - He was not in the way; this was three or four days before he was turned off.
Where were these shirts kept before they were lost? - They were kept in a side closet.
What may be the value of these buckles? - Near three guineas.
What may the value of the shirts be? - I cannot say, 'there are three of them that are new, they are fully worth the price charged in the indictment.
Prisoner to Kettle. What did I say to you when I gave you the bundle, did I tell you they were mine or my master's - Neither, he asked me for the bundle again at ten, then he flung them into the kitchen window.
PRISONER's DEFENCE.
In regard to the shirts, they were in my possession, and not out of it; I took the shirts in mistake of my own shirts; the buckles I had for four days in this coat pocket which I have on, my dressing coat: I was determined to come the next morning, and beg the favour of a character, and bring back the shirts; I neither took the buckles or shirts with intent to defraud the Captain: the gentleman that recommended me to Captain

             would bring my trial to so great a heighth, I thought to have a lawyer, I could get plenty of characters from Mr. Agar in the Temple, and from Mr. Osborn, in Brompton-row; the buckles I found in a window, rolled up in a piece of paper.

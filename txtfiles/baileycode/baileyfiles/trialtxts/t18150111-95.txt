                  CATHERINE
                  CREMER
               



            . I am the wife of 
               
                  Matthew
                  Cremer
               



            . I have got four children besides the twins, six in all I have had. The twins were born in the week after Bartholemew Fair, in September, and then I had four children alive besides them. I lost one of my twins. One day I was sitting in St. Paul's Church-yard; the prisoner came up to me; I only had sit there two days, She came up to me, and gave me a penny; she said, poor woman, you have got two fine babies. I said yes; she then said, you do not seem to get much money here; if you will go along with me. I will take you to a fine lady that will give you half a guinea. I walked with her, I took notice of her person; I saw there was a tooth out on the right side of her upper jaw, pock marked, and dark eyes. She had a reddish spotted gown on. I walked along with her, I was carrying both the twins; in Cheapside, the wind blew my cloak off the babies, my child of five years old was following me, I asked the prisoner to put the cloak over the babies, for fear they should get cold, She offered to carry one of them; I yielded to give her the biggest of the twins into her arms. We went into the Commercial road, and she kept close to me all the way, until I got to the Commercial road at the corner of a public house. She put her hand into her pocket, and gave me three pence, and told me to get a pint of beer; I told her I did not want beer or gin, I wanted to see the lady. She said, my dear woman, I'll not be long from you, I will go and shew this fine lady this twin. I followed her up a court, I kept sight of her until my child of five years old fell over a heap if bricks. I turned round to see whether my little girl was coming after me, I went and picked up my child, and when I turned back again, the prisoner had turned the corner out of my sight directly, I did not see her again for six weeks. This happened on the 14th of October, about three o'clock; then I screamed out; I searched about for my child from three o'clock in the afternoon until seven. When I lost the child, the child had on a striped cotton bed gown, a shirt, a flannel cap, and a cotton light bonnet. When I saw the prisoner again, I knew she was the woman that took the child from me; I saw her on board a ship; I wanted to have a kiss of my child; the sailor that was with her would not let me kiss my child; the sailor is here to day; the officer took tho child and the woman into custody. My child had not on the same clothes as I left with it; I undressed the baby at the public house for the first time again; I found my piece of flannel on it. I told the prisoner that was my piece of flannel. I claimed it in the hearing of the prisoner and in the hearing of the officer. I had handbills printed; I gave description of the baby and the prisoner, and I went to Lambeth-street office.
EBENEZEE DALTON. I am an officer: in consequence of the information given in the handbills, I searched after the prisoner and the child; I first saw the prisoner on board the Hugh Inglis East Indiaman, laying at the Northfleet, it was going out. I knew the prisoner by the description given by the handbills; I supposed her to be the person that had stolen the child.
Had you any information given you at your office - A, The person that gave the information did not know where she was; he said she was gone on board of this ship; the ship was laying at Graves-end. I did not see the prisoner until I saw her on board the 
               
                  Hugh
                  Inglis
               



            . I first saw the prisoner on board the 
               
                  Hugh
                  Inglis
               



             East Indiaman, in company with Swain, a sailor, belonging to that ship. I asked for Swain first when I came alongside of the ship, and then I saw the prisoner and the child. I told the prisoner that she was charged with stealing the child, that it did not belong to her. I said it was stolen from Mrs. Cremer. The prosecutrix was in a boat alongside of the ship. The prisoner seemed very much confused; said it was her own child; that when she came to London she would shew me the room where she was delivered on a Friday, six weeks before that very day. On the 26th of November she had been taken bad in the Minories, a young woman came by and took her to her room, where she was delivered, the young woman took her to her room in White Rose Court, Rosemary Lane. She said her name was Mary or 
               
                  Sarah
                  Brown
               



            . She said the young woman's apartment was in White Rose Court, Rosemary-lane, and that 
               
                  Mary
                  Brown
               



             would be able to show me where the doctor that delivered her. She said it could not be far; she was not gone above two minutes. The prisoner said she lived in Bly's buildings, Sun-street, Bishopsgate-street, that she went out of her mother's room at three o'clock, and went home to her mother at five o'clock the same day. She went home in a coach; she lived in the same house with her mother in the room above her; she said the name of the father of the child was Swaine. I assisted Mrs. Cremer up the side of the ship; she said that is my child before she saw it. I heard the child cry likewise as well as Mrs. Cremer. She said before she saw it that is my child. When Mrs. Cremer saw the prisoner, she would have struck her had not I interfered; she said that is my child, and that is the woman that stole it. The description in the handbill corresponded with the prisoner very much but as to age. On the next day I went to White Horse Court, Rosemary Lane; there is twenty houses or more in the court. I enquired for Mary or 
               
                  Sarah
                  Brown
               



            ; no such person lived there. I brought the prisoner in a chaise to town with me. I went and told the prisoner I could not find 
               
                  Mary
                  Brown
               



            ; she said if she went with me she could point it out; she took me to Johnson's Court, Rosemary-lane, she pointed out a house; she said she was sure that was the house, and she was delivered up in the one pair of stairs. Miller, my fellow officer, went and fetched the young woman down. It turned out to be 
               
                  Elizabeth
                  Fisher
               



            , she is here; I asked Elizabeth Fisher if she knew this young woman; she said no, she never saw her in her life before. I asked the prisoner if she was sure that was the house; she said she was. 
               
                  Elizabeth
                  Fisher
               



             said she had lived there three or four years. The prisoner was committed.
(The handbill read.)


                  ELIZABETH
                  FISHER
               



            . I live in Johnson's-change, No. 5, Rosemary-lane; I lodge in Mrs. Aaron's house, a front room up one pair of stairs; I keep the room to myself.
Q. Did the prisoner at any time in October come to your house, and was she delivered of a child - A. No person was delivered of a child in the house about that time; I was called down to look at the prisoner; somebody called Brown; I answered; my name is 
               
                  Elizabeth
                  Fisher
               



            ; that is my real name.
ISABELLA GRAY. I live at No. 3, in Bly's-buildings, Sun-street, Bishopsgate-street. Sarah Stone and 
               
                  Ned
                  Swaine
               



             lodged in our house; I remember the day perfectly well that she went out without a child, and returned with one; I saw her go out that day at half past one, she passed my window, she had on a light gown, with a pink spot, a dark blue apron, a whitish shawl, a faint blue flower, and a painted border; you could hardly perceive the colour, the colours in the shawl had all been washed out; I did not see the prisoner come home; I came home about eight o'clock; I went up stairs, and unlocked my apartment, I went in the prisoner's mother's room, asked for a light; the prisoner was in bed; I saw the child; I thought it looked more like a child older, than a new born infant. Before the prisoner went out, she had the appearance of a pregnant woman. I did not know but Swaine and she were married. On Sunday morning, she told me she gave the child the breast; I never saw her do it. I said to 
               
                  Ned
                  Swaine
               



            , is that your child; he said, so they tell me. On Monday morning between twelve and one, the sailor and the prisoner had a few words; he took up his hat, and went away; the prisoner enticed me to go and bring him back; I fetched him back, then as we were coming home, we met her in Sun-street, she had no stockings on; she was then in Sun-street, about three minutes walk from our house.
CRASE BROWN. I lodge opposite of the prisoner. I saw her come home that evening, at five o'clock; she had been big for ten months, she appeared lesser that morning than she had been for ten months before; when she came home that day, she had something in her lap; she walked up the court with a firm steady step, she had no appearance of having been recently delivered, she had the appearance of being pregnant for ten months; she was as big in the third month as she was in the morning of the day that she said she was delivered.

            . I am an officer. I was present when the child was undressed, in the presence of Mrs. Cremer; Mrs. Cremer claimed the piece of flannel as hers, and snatched it from the prisoner.
Prisoner's Defence. I had no money, I was very poorly indeed; I took a cap and tippet to sell in the Minories, as Swaine would not get his wages on board a ship until Saturday; I went to sell them until he brought me some money home on Saturday night, and when I got into the Minories, I was taken very ill; 
               
                  Mary
                  Brown
               



            , the woman in the green bonnet, that says her name is Fisher, she met me, and asked me what was the matter; I told her I was going to be brought a-bed; she said, no, nonsense, come along with me, I will give you a glass of liquor; I went; she gave me a glass of liquor; it made me worse; she took me to her room, and desired me to set on her bed; she fetched a doctor; I was delivered there. The doctor carried me down stairs, and put me into a coach; I went down the steps of the building as well as I could. My mother said I had been gone long; I said I had; she gave me a glass of brandy, and put me to bed.


                  MARY
                  CADWELL
               



            . The prisoner gave me twopence a week for three weeks to draw her breasts, at first it tasted sweetish, like milk.


                  JANE
                  MILLWELL
               



            . I am the mother of the prisoner. My daughter had the appearance of being pregnant when she went out at half past one; she returned at five o'clock, she was quite different whenshe came home; I perceived that she had a child; the infant had the appearance of a new born child, it had a bit of flannel round it; I sat up with her that night, and Isabella Gray, the child had an old shirt on, and an old cap; she was nursed about a month all but two days, and then she went to Church, Isabella Gray went with her; she said, the young woman had given her the things that the child was dressed in, her name was Mary Brown.
Q. You called on 
               
                  Mary
                  Brown
               



             that had been so kind to her - A. No I did not; she told me she lived some where in Rosemary-lane.
Q. You are quite sure that she never went out until she went to Church - A. Not as I know off.
Q. Is it true that she quarrelled with the man that she lived with, and went out after him - A. Isabella Gray and me led her home; she took the child with her.
Q. You forgot that - A. Yes. She went out no more that night.
Q. What did you do with the child's shirt after it was brought home - A. I think I made tinder of it; it looked like a poor persons shirt; I did not keep it.


                  EDWARD
                  SWAINE
               



            . I am a sailor; I cohabited with the prisoner in Bly's buildings; I had every reason to believe that she was pregnant. When I returned home, she told me that she was taken ill in the Minories. I now think it was her own child.

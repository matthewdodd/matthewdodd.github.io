I live in King-street, Wapping



, the prisoner came to me the 12th of December, and enquired if I could lodge him; I told him I could, and I lodged him, he told me he was Lieutenant Douglas's boy, belonging to the Elizabeth man of war, he wanted a bed for two or three nights; I lodged him that night, and in the morning he came down when I was to get my breakfast, he asked me to let him have a little tea, and he would pay me for it, I did so; after breakfast, he took my child out of my arms of six months old, and he walked about the room with it, my eldest child was in the room with him, who was between six and seven; I left them two in the room, and I went up stairs, where the prisoner had slept, to lock the room door, I looked at the watch when I went up stairs, it hung in the chimney corner, in the lower room, where I left him, it was then twenty minutes past nine; when I came down stairs again, my eldest child was sitting at the door, with my youngest child on his knee, I opened the door, and came in, and the young lad was not there, my child said he was gone into the yard, I looked at my fire-side, and immediately missed my watch and the prisoner; my door was open, my fore street door, and my watch and the prisoner was gone; the yard is a thoroughfare, where the people go through, but my door opens into the front street; I cried out immediately I was robbed, they pursued after the prisoner some yards, but could not find him, and a man, who heard me say I was robbed by the prisoner, and who was with him when he came for the lodging, he took him afterwards.
Court. What connection had he with the prisoner, that he was seeking out a lodging for him? - I do not know, he took compassion on him, the man is gone to sea, he took the prisoner in the Minories, and brought him to my house; he had not the the watch upon him when he was brought back to my house, neither would he confess that he took it; I said, my good boy, if you will confess what you have done with it, or if you have pawned it or sold it, I will not hurt you; he would not confess at that time: the officer has the watch.

The prisoner was brought to the publick office in Shadwell, and through this woman's promises, he told me, if I would go along with him, he would go and shew me the person that had the watch, which was one Milward, and I asked him if he had bought a watch of any woman; and he said yes; I asked him where it was; he said he had it in his fob.
(The watch deposed to.)
Court. What is the value of it? - Forty Shillings.
Who valued it? - The officer, Mr. Orange, valued it to that.

I am a wine porter, I met the woman prisoner, and she asked me if I would buy a watch, and she shewed me the watch, I told her I was in a hurry, I could not stop, and I saw her again at the Ship, in Crutched Friars, and she asked me again; she asked two guineas for it, I told her I did not know the value of it, I would not give that for it; she said her husband was likely to come into trouble, and she wanted to receive a little money, and should be glad to part with it; I told her I would let her have a guinea and a half upon it, if she would bring the man she bought it of; she said she bought it of a young man; but she never came again till she came with the officer, that was on the morrow evening.
PRISONER NICHOLLS'S DEFENCE.

PRISONER MASSIAS'S DEFENCE.
When the prosecutor was taken up before the Justice, the Justice asked her if she knew me, she said she did not; I did not take the watch; my witnesses were here till twelve last night.

             sworn.
I know the prisoner Nicholls; on the 13th of last month I came home about half past twelve, this woman and the boy had been at my house, and I was told by the boy, he had given her a watch to sell; I immediately turned round to the boy and said, you young rogue, where did you get a watch to sell; he said he came from America, and was a native of America, and was just come from Portsmouth, and had no victuals, nor no friends, and that he gave this watch to this woman to sell, to get him some money to get some victuals; I have known this woman twelve months before, she has a family of three small children, which she maintains.
What is she? - She deals in old clothes
 in Rosemary-lane, her husband is a very industrious man; the woman came afterwards, and left the money at the bar, one guinea and a half for the boy, but he never came for it.

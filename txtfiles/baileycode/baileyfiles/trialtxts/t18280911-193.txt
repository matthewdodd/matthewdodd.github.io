            . I am the wife of Jacob Enticott; we live in Long-alley


, and keep a broker's shop
. On the morning of the 24th of July, about half-past eight o'clock, I was in my parlour, and saw the prisoner at my window - he leaned ever, and took this glass out of the shop; I went to the door, saw him put it on his shoulder, and walk away- I went after him, took hold of his sleeve, and asked where he was going to take the glass; he said it was no business of mine - I told him it was; I took hold of the glass with one hand, and him with the other; he tried to break it, and struck me two or three times; I called a girl to take the glass from me; I called Mr. Gardener, who took him into custody - I never lost sight of him.
Prisoner's Defence. She is mistaken in the person; it was another man.

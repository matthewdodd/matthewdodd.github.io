             DENNIS. I am a Policeman. I saw the prisoner take the hat off a stand inside the shop; I took him immediately with it - he said he did not care any thing about it, for he wished to go and see his old palls in Clerkenwell - that Moore was transported, and he should not mind going to see him.(Property produced and sworn to)

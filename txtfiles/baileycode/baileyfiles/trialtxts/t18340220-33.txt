EDWARD DALTON. I keep the Holland Arms, Kensington






. The prisoner Davies lived with me as cook
 about three months - I did not miss anything then, but she was taken into custody about three months after she left me, and on her were found several duplicates, which related to my property - I have known Powell all his life; he was a neighbour's son, and was a kind of errand-boy in the neighbourhood.

            . I live with Mr. Wells, a pawnbroker, in High-street, Kensington - I have a pair of sheets pawned by a man on the 17th of September, in the name of 
               
                  William 
                  Powell

            . I live with Mr. Bird, a pawnbroker, in Long-acre - I have a book, pawned in August; a handkerchief, in July; and a gown and a shift, pawned in September - they were all pawned by a man, two of them in the name of William Powell, and two in the name of

             (police-constable C 15). I took the prisoner Davies, and found in her box fifteen duplicates relating to this property, and that of Mr. Lee - the name of 
               
                  William 
                  Powell
               



             is on some of the duplicates - I went to the Holland Arms, from information, and found the prisoner Powell bedding up some horses - I asked him if he knew the cook who had lived at the Holland Arms - he said"Yes" - I said, "Did you pawn anything for her?" - he said,"No, by my God, I never did" - he denied it several times- I told him to be cautious, as what he said I should have to tell in another place; and that I had some duplicates with his name, in full length, on them - he then said, "I will tell you all about it: I went to the back of the house, and the cook threw the pair of sheets out of the two-pair window, and I caught them and pawned them."
Property produced and sworn to.

THOMAS HODGE

twelve o'clock in the day, I saw the prisoner take this piece of gingham, and put it under her arm—I followed, and took it from her—I gave her in charge—this is the article—(loocking at it)—it has our mark upon it.





HENRY REDMAN
. I am a police-constable. I took the prisoner and produce the property.

Prisoner's Defence. I was in great distress, which made me take it—I had had no bed for four nights.





THOMAS HARRINGTON

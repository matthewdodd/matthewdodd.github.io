             (Police-constable G 99.) I stopped the prisoner on the 30th of December, at the corner of Sutton-street, with this glass, a little after five o'clock - he said he was going to Hatfield-street with it, and had brought it from Mr. Watts, near Sadlers' Wells.

            . I live in Northampton-place, Clerkenwell


. This glass is mine - I had seen it safe on Sunday morning, the 30th of December, in a back chamber on a table; I heard a noise a little before five o'clock - I went into that room, found the window open, and the glass gone; a person in the street could lift up the window, and take it.
Prisoner. I was going down Northampton-street, and saw the glass on the pavement; there were two boys close to it - I asked them whose it was; they said they did not know - I said I would take it to my house, and the next morning to the station.
JAMES JOSLEN. He said he got it from Mr. Watts', who keeps the wine-room at Sadler's-wells, and was going to take it to Hatfield-street, which is a very bad street - this is the seventh window which has been opened in the same street.

            . I am a piece-broker
, and live in White Horse-yard, Drury-lane. On the 19th of February, about five o'clock in the afternoon, I was before the hustings, Covent-garden


, and was hustled by a gang of pickpockets - the prisoner was one. I put my hand to my fob, to secure my watch; they rose my hand, and took it out. As soon as my hands were at liberty I seized the prisoner - I am certain he was acting with them - he had his hands behind him then. Some persons came to my assistance, and kept hold of him.
Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS, You went there out of curiosity - A. Yes - I am sure he is one of them.

            . I live in Queen-street, Grosvenor-square. I was close by the prosecutor, at the hustings - I saw several persons pulling him, and lifting his arms up. I saw the prisoner pull the watch right out of his fob; I saw the chain in his hand. I was pushed from him.

            . I live at Chelsea. I was at the hustings, near the prosecutor; I heard him say he had been robbed, and laid hold of the prisoner.

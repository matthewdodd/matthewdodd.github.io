            . On Saturday the 29th of June. between 9 and 10 at night, there was a fire in Lime-street


; I went to offer my service to a friend to take some of his goods; I saw a number of people about; I did my friend secure his other door; presently I felt something at my pocket; I observed the prisoner gently drawing my handkerchief out of my pocket; then he passed me; I seized him; he was trying to shift it into his other hand; I said, This man has got my handkerchief; he denied it: I said, I'll take care of you I took it out of his hand; he struggled. and got from me, but was never out of my sight before he was taken. (A linen handkerchief produced, and deposed to).
Prisoner's Defence.
I was about three or four yards from him; I took this handkerchief from the ground; he said it was his; I said, Then you may have it; he fell upon me, and said, if he had had a stick, I should never have gone from him alive; he would have broke every bone in my skin: he knock'd me down above twenty times.

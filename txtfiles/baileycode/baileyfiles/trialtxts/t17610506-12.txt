            . On Wednesday, the 8th of April, some blond lace was missing from out of our shop. I mistrusted the prisoner had taken it.
Q. Was the prisoner a servant of yours?
Wilkinson. No. She was a stranger that had been in the shop when it was lost. I took her up on the Saturday following, and charged her with taking it, and she said she found it.

            . The prisoner at the bar came into a shop in Carnaby-market, where I happened to be, and fell a crying, and said she had a piece of lace that she had been obliged to pawn, being in distress, and wanted to sell it. I asked her where it was; she told me it was pawned to one Mr. Johnson by St. Ann's church. I went with her there. She swore many bitter oaths that she found it. I bought it out of pawn. I asked the pawnbroker whether she knew her, or whether she was an honest person; she said, yes, she was. After that, as I was going by my Mr. Wilkinson's shop I saw some lace of the same pattern hanging in the window; I asked what that lace was per yard, the woman said 8 s. and that a woman came in and had stole the fellow-piece to it; then I said I am afraid I have got it.
Q. What did you give the prisoner for it?
J. Miller. I gave her 5 s. 1 d. for the whole.
Q. Are you a judge of the value of lace?
J. Miller. I am not a judge of that.
Prisoner. She has spoke the truth.


                  Henry 
                  Gear 
               



            . I took some lace of the prisoner at the bar on the 9th of April. [ Produced in court, and deposed to by the prosecutor.]
Q. What are you?
Gear. I am a pawnbroker.
Q. What did you lend her upon it?
Gear. I lent her 3 s. upon one piece, and 1 s. upon the other.
Q. Did you know the prisoner before?
Gear. I have known her a year and half. The prosecutor and the last witness came to me on the 10th, and he told me I must go with him to justice Welch's. I went with them. We could not find the prisoner till the Monday following; then she was brought there. She at first said she found it, but afterwards she owned she took it out of Mr. Wilkinson's shop.
Prisoner's defence.
I found the lace in a piece of new's-paper, and took it to his shop and pledged it. I found it in St. James's-street.
Q. to J. Miller. How much is there of it?
J. Miller. There is very near 10 yards of it.
Q. to Wilkinson. What is it worth a yard?
Wilkinson. It is worth 6 s. a yard.
J. Miller. I asked the pawnbroker the value of it, and he said he would lend her but very little more upon it.

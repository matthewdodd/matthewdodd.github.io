ANN BRYAN
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
5th of May, 1 sovereign, 2 half-crowns, 5 pence, and 4 halfpence, the monies of 




James Garner, from his person.






JAMES GARNER
. I am a brewer's servant I met the prisoner on Oxford-street,

after eleven o'clock on Thursday evening—I went home with her, to No, 10, Church-street—we went to bed together—I gave her 1s. before I went there—I bad the money stated, in my breeches pocket—I put my breeches under my head, and fell and fell asleep—I awoke at a quarter past twelve o'clock, and she was gone—I was not drunk—I had had a glass of drink—but I knew what I was about—I got up—a a person came, and said the good lady was gone—I found her in church-street again, and took her back to the same house, and the policeman searched her—he found the two half-crown and 5d. in her left hand, and the sovereign in her mouth.

Prisoner, The money was all mine, and this man took care of me as I had a little drop in the head.





JAMES COBBINS
. I am a policeman. The prosecutor told me he had lost a sovereign, two half-crowns, and other monies. I took the prisoner, and found the two half-crowns and 5d. and 2d., in her hand, and the sovereign in her month.

Prisoner. I have not a soul that knows me in London. I had just come over to meet my son—the prosecutor took me to a bad house—it was my money he was spending all night—he used me like a beast, till I cried out, and then he let me out—an old woman, fit to be his mother.




GUILTY
. Aged 48.—


Transported for Fourteen Years.

             sworn.
On the 2d of November, I lost out of my room, No. 9, Mary-le-bone-street


, two shillings and sixpence, and six-pennyworth of halfpence; this money was taken out of my breeches pocket; besides which I lost a pair of corderoy breeches, not that in which the money was; a pair of half boots, and a pair of knee buckles; the prisoner lodged with me, and got up that morning, and went out, before the house was open; and was away till the first day of this month, when he came back with the breeches and half boots on; on which day he was taken, and carried before Justice Read; who made him pull them off, and delivered them to me, and they have been in my possession ever since.
(The goods produced and deposed to.)

             came to me to work, as usual, on Monday morning, and told me what he had lost, and that he had a suspicion of the man that slept with him: on the first day of this month I saw the prisoner coming for a waggon load of bricks, at the buildings where

            . I am a woollen-draper and salesman
 in Monmouth-street


; I was cutting out some things on the 10th of November, the prisoner came up to the door, and said he wanted a pair of breeches; I shewed him several pair of leather-breeches; he seem'd very difficult; he at last put on a pair, and said, these will do; but we could not agree; he came back twice, and I could not take his money; there being but two shillings, between us, I went after him, to see if I could agree with him, I had lost him all of a sudden, but at last I came up with him in St. Giles's; there I found he had a pair of leather breeches, and the two sore pieces of a waistcoat, my property. I asked him how he came by them; he said I brought them after him. I then charged him with taking them. (Produced in Court, and deposed to.)

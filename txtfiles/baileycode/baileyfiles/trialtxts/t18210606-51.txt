. This serge was on the threshhold of the door. I was called from tea and informed a woman had taken it. I went up Eagle-and-child-alley, into Dean-street, Fetter-lane, where I caught sight of the prisoners, close together in company. Newland had something under her shawl; a boy whistled three times, they turned, saw me following them without my hat, they ran and dropped the serge in Fetter-lane; I pursued, and secured them in a court, it not being a thoroughfare. It was chained to the door post.

            . I work for Mr. Sparks in Shoe-lane. I saw the prisoners running up Eagle-and-Child-alley with the serge, they ran by me; I saw Mr. Stone following them, and saw them drop it. I picked it up and took it back; they were secured in Plough-court.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
CLARK'S Defence. I was talking to this woman, a gentleman knocked her down, I turned down the court, and he took me.

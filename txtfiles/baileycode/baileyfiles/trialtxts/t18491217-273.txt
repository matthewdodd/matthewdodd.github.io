ANN DONOVAN



; stealing 1 blanket and 1 shawl, value 21s.; the goods of 



James Charles Tinsley: having been before convicted.






MARY ELIZABETH TINSLEY
. My husband's name is James Charles Tinsley; the prisoner came to lodge with me in Oct., she was very kind to my little girl, who was ill, and I employed her, and she was about the place the same as myself—I found she was robbing me, and on 16th Nov. I missed a blanket from the room, where my children slept, level with hers—I accused her, she denied it—in the evening she said, "I want to go up-stairs, will you go with me?"—I said, "I will"—while we were up-stairs, she said, "I have taken your blanket, and intend replacing it again when I get some money"—when my husband came home she was taken to the station—this blanket, scarf, gown, and shawls (produced) are mine—some were taken from her own bed.





RICHARD ARTHUR
 (policeman). I saw something drop in the road, which nobody but the prisoner could have dropped—it was these twenty-four duplicates—I found a spencer with one of them at the pawnbroker's—Mrs. Tinsley gave me these duplicates next morning, with which I found all this property.





WILLIAM SALMON
. This property was pledged by the prisoner—it corresponds with the tickets.





GEORGE WILD
 (policeman). I produce a certificate of the prisoner's conviction—(read Convicted May, 1847, and confined twenty-one days solitary)—she is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 25.—


Transported for Seven Years.

(There was another indictment against the prisoner.)

            . I am in the employ of William Martin, a bedstead-maker
. On the morning of the 19th of May I missed two or three iron gates; I went to the station, and found this gate there, which is my master's; it had been in our waste ground, which has an iron railing round it twelve feet high - the prisoners were then in custody.

             , August 31st
.
Robert Heathfield. On the 29th of August in the Morning, the Prisoner came to my House, (I am a Surgeon
) with a Tumour upon her Hand: I told her I must open it, before it would be well, which I did accordingly. The next Day she came again to have it dress'd, and then she stole a Stock, and Stock-buckle. I mistrusted her; so as she was to come again, I pull'd out one of my Knee-buckles and laid it down in the Window, and when she came the next Day to have her Hand dress d, I went into a Back-room, and left her in the Surgery to put on her Rollers herself. When my Patient was alone, she took the Buckle; I watch'd, and saw her, and I suffer'd her to go out of the House, and follow'd her half-way up the Street; then I took her and the Buckle upon her. She was a poor Woman, and I had often done such Jobbs for her out of Charity, and never have had any Thing for my Pains. When she was before the Justice, she said if I would let her go, she would give me an Account of all she had taken from me at other Times, as well as at this; So she confessed, that about a Twelvemonth ago, she stole a Shirt from me, - I have lost a great many other Things, but did not charge her with them. She confessed that she had, (at this Time of her coming to my House) stole a Stock, a Stock-buckle, and a Knee-buckle.
Prisoner. I do not know any Thing of it - please to do any Thing with me, but pray don't Transport me. 

               Guilty

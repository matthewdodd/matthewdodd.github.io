             sworn. - I am a watchman upon Ralph's-quay


, the prisoner is a labourer
 upon the quay: On the 13th of December, I saw him at work between twelve and one o'clock in the day; I saw him again between three and four under the fore-sheet of a lighter; I asked him what he was doing there; he said, mending some bags; I asked him who employed him, and he told me, no one; I called him up three times before he came up; I then took him by the collar, and gave charge of him; I then went into the lighter, and found a coat under the fore-sheet, with cocoa in the pockets; there were two bags over the coat, I had seen the prisoner with the same coat on in the morning; I asked the prisoner what he was going to do with it; he said, the coat did not belong to him; the lighter was loaded with cocoa and coffee, it was in my charge; the prisoner had a fustian jacket on, which he wore under his coat; he had no business on board the lighter at all; we have a regular bag-mender.
- HARDING sworn. - I am a constable: I took charge of the prisoner and some cocoa, (produces the coat and cocoa), I took the prisoner to the Compter; in going along, he told me I had better go with him, we could make it up other ways; he said, it was a bad job, and I took him to the Compter.

            . I live in Pump-row. Old-street -road


. On the 18th of March last, I had taken the premises in question, on which were the two coppers. I had taken all the fixtures, and had paid for them on that day. On the 20th, in consequence of information, I went to the premises, and missed the property in question.

            . On the 20th of March, about half past nine, I and Mr. Mayhew were coming up Old-street-road, and we saw three persons in the road, two with each a copper on their shoulders; we crossed the road, and laid hold of Hooper, the prisoner, and he threw down his copper. He then got away from me; I pursued him, apprehended him, and took him to the watchhouse. I secured the coppers also; they fitted the place in the prosecutor's kitchen. The prisoner made a desperate resistance.

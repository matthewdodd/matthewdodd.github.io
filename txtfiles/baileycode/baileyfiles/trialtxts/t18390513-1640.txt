WILLIAM FISHER
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
9th of May, 1 handkerchief, value 3s. 6d., the goods of 



Henry Badger, from his person.







HENRY BADGER
. I live in Owen's-row, Clerkenwell. On the 9th of May, about nine o'clock, I was in Goswell-street—I felt a tug at my pocket, and missed my handkerchief, which I had had in my hand about two minutes before—I turned, and a gentleman behind me pointed out the prisoner—I went and collared him, and accused him of having taken it—he pulled it from under his apron, and begged I would let him go—he said distress was the cause of his doing it.

Prisoner. I did not say I had done it—I was passing the dead-wall, where several people were passing—I saw the handkerchief on the curb-stone—I and the gentleman who told the prosecutor both stooped to take it up—I got it first—the prosecutor took me to the station-house, and said his handkerchief was marked, but it is not Witness. I said I thought there was a mark, but I was not certain—I know it is mine—it corresponds with one I have now in my pocket.





STEPHEN SADLER
. I am an officer—I took the prisoner in charge.




GUILTY
.* Aged 33.—


Transported for Ten Years.

ELIZABETH ANN CROWDER
. I am the wife of Nicholas Crowder—we keep a clothes'-shop on Great Saffron-hill. On the afternoon of the 12th of October we had five pairs of boots hanging at the door-post outside, on a nail—I was in my back parlour, heard an alarm, and ran out—Mrs. Spaul gave me information—my little girl followed the prisoner, who was brought back with five pairs of boots—I never saw her in possession of them.





GEORGE KNOTT
, (police-constable G 99.) I was going through Hatton-yard, and heard an alarm of stop-thief—I saw the prisoner run by me with the boots hanging under her shawl—I followed her—she threw them down, and I caught her—the prosecutrix's little girl took them up, and gave them to me—I took her to the shop, and then to the station-house.





ELIZA CROWDER
. I am the daughter of Nicholas Crowder. On Friday afternoon, I was in the parlour—I ran after the prisoner down Hatton-yard—I saw her drop the boots—I picked them up, and gave them to the policeman.

Prisoner. A young lad gave them to me—I did not take them myself—I did not have them in my apron.





ELIZABETH SPAUL
. I live opposite Mrs. Crowder. As I stood at my first-floor window, I saw two females and a young man—I saw the young man jump upon the step, reach down the boots, and drop them into the prisoner's apron—she put them into her apron, and ran off directly with them.




GUILTY
. Aged 16.—


Transported for Seven Years.

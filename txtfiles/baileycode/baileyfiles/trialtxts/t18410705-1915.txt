JAMES M'NEILL
. I and the prisoner wept home, I went to sleep, and when I awoke these things were gone—part of them were in a box—I lost a shawl, a cloak, a gown, two handkerchiefs, and a petticoat—these now produced are my property—they were found by a policeman.





HARRIET HAYWARD
. I searched the prisoner, and found 6s. 5 1/2 d. on her, and this cloak and shawl on her—I took them from her.





GEORGE DOREY
. This property was all found on her at the station—I stopped her in the street—she said her brother-in-law gave them to her.
(The prisoner, in a long address, stated that she had gone home with the prosecutor, and that he, being intoxicated, had opened the box and given her the articles.)

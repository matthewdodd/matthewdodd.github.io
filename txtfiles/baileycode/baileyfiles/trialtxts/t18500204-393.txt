DONALD M'GREGOR
. I am a warehouseman, in Noble-street. On the the afternoon of 11th Jan. I was coming out of my warehouse, and saw the prisoner with a bale of goods on his shoulder, which had been in my passage—I called to him—he dropped the bale and ran away—I followed him, and he fell—I merely lost sight of him while he turned the corner—I caught sight of him directly afterwards—I know the bale of goods—it is called coating—it is used for warm climates—it is my property, and is worth about 26l.—there was another man with the prisoner, but he got away—I caught the prisoner when he fell, and took him back to the warehouse.

Prisoner. I was not away from the door of the warehouse when you came out. Witness. You were just going out of the street door when I opened the other door and called after you—you had the bale on your back, just going out—you could not have taken the bale up yourself.

I had been to my brother, who is a porter, in Watling-street, and as I was coming back a man asked me to give him a lift up with this; 1 took it up; the gentleman called, and the man ran off; I ran after him to catch him; I was taken back to the warehouse and given in charge





EDWARD JEFFERIES
 (policeman). I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction—(read—Convicted March, 1849, and confined nine months)—he is the man—I found his lodging in a very bad condition—he has been in custody several times.

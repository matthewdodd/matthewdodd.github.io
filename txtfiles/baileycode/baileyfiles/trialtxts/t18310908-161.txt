             - he lives in Theobald's-road


. On the afternoon of the 30th of July I saw the prisoner in the shop; he took down these articles from a nail, and ran off with them - I pursued. and called Stop thief! I saw him go into Mr. Beecham's, in Lamb's Conduit-street - I went in, and found him in the kitchen; he had dropped these things before he entered the house, and I took them up; he denied having had them, and then offered to pay for them.
Prisoner. Q.When you saw me take them, why did you not ask me what I was going to do? A. You did not give me time; our's is a corner house, and has two doors, and he went right through - I saw him run up a court, and caught sight of him just as he was entering Mr. Beecham's house; I asked him if he had been in Green-street, because I had been into several rooms, and could not see him - he then offered to purchase the articles which I had in my hand.
JOSEPH STANNARD. I am a Police-officer. I took the prisoner.(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I never ran away with them at all; I took them down to buy them for my little boy, and I all at once thought I would go to Mr. Beecham's - which I did.

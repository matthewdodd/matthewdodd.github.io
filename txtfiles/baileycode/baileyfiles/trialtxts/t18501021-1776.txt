CHRISTOPHER DAYMON
. I live at Glasshouse-yard, and let trucks for hire. On Friday afternoon, 20th Sept., the prisoner came to hire a truck, which he said was to take some boxes to the Blackwall Railway—he gave his name, "Johnson, 3, Whitecross-street"—I let him have it—he was to pay me 3d. for it, and bring it back in two hours—he never came back—I afterwards found part of it in Smithfield for sale—the springs, wheels, and axle, had been taken away, and fresh ones put, and it was painted over.





JOHN MURRAY
. On the Friday afternoon, about three o'clock, I was in Gresham-street, with a barrow, and the prisoner came to me with a truck, and asked me to buy it for 13s.—I offered 9s. for it, and he said I should have it for 9s. 6d.—I saw Mr. Daymon's name on it, and I agreed to buy it if he would go with me to Mr. Daymon, to see if was all right—he would not go, and I would not buy it.





HENRY TODD
 (policeman, G 221). I took the prisoner, and charged him with stealing the truck—he said he did not have it.

            , we live in Great Aliff-street, Whitechapel


. On the 30th of March, about seven o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came to look at some apartments I had to let, she said they were for a gentleman in the Bank. As she came down stairs she asked for my name and address, I asked her into my sitting-room to write it. She kept talking to my little boy, and said she would call again next morning at ten o'clock. As she was leaving the room she drew near the fire-place, and I heard the chain to the watch jingle - I immediately missed it off the shelf, and charged her with it, she made no answer, and held up her right-hand, I saw the chain hanging out. I sent for my husband, who came and took the watch out of her hand.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

             sworn.
At the time of the robbery, I lived in Petticoat-lane


. I was a lodger. Mr. Howard rented the house. - I have a woman lives with me, who leads me. On the 5th of December, I went out, about 20 minutes before ten o'clock in the forenoon. - We returned, and we both went up stairs together; but I went into the room first, and the door was open. - When I came into my room, I found my sheets taken off my bed; and I went to my box, and found it was broke open; and I found a coat, 2 shirts, a shift, a petticoat, 2 towels, &c. missing; 2 half-crown pieces, and 7 s. 8 s. 1 d. in halfpence, and 2 s. and upwards in farthings, that was all tied up in a bit of green stuff, as I am informed.

             lives in the house, in a pair of stairs lower. I got a search-warrant; and Mr. Harpur and Armstrong, broke their place open to search, but could not find any property of mine in their room. An officer, who is here, found some of my property upon him. I know nothing of the other prisoner.

             sworn.
I live in the same room with the prosecutor. On the 5th of December, we went out about a quarter after 10, and we were at home by twelve o'clock. - When we left the room, I double-locked the door, my own self. - This good man found it open. He went to unlock it himself, as he always does. The things mentioned in the indictment were missing. When we went down stairs, both the prisoners were in the same room together, - one lived next door, and the man, who robbed us, lived in the same house, another story higher. A search warrant was obtained, but nothing found in the apartment.


                  PETER
                   MAINE
               



             sworn.
I am a constable. I took these articles from the prisoner, Trimmer: a towel, a piece of green stuff, with two shillings-worth of farthings in it, one half-crown piece, 7 s. 5 six-pences and 9 s. 6 l. in halfpence, together with some pick-lock keys; one of which I tried the prosecutor's door with, and it locked and unlocked it as well as the key the prosecutor has: this was taken from him the day of the robbery, between eleven and twelve o'clock: I, in company with Mr. Cooke, saw the prisoners coming up George-street, in White-chapel. As soon as they saw us, they ran into a house. We pursued them. - I got into the house first, and I met the tallest of the prisoners coming out. We had no warrant. - We did this on our own suspicion. - And if we had not known them that was sufficient to cause suspicion. Mr. Cooke stood withinside the door. I let the tallest pass me, in order that Mr. Cooke should lay hold of him, and I laid hold of the other. Accordingly, I took Trimmer, in a backyard, that was there; and there I found all this property on the prisoner, Trimmer. A shift I picked up in the passage; but cannot take upon me to say which of the prisoners it was that dropt it. - There was no coat found on him - nor sheets. I found this piece of stuff with the farthings, and 9 s. 6 d. in half-pence; and as soon as I had found the farthings, he tookhold of the piece of stuff, and shaked them in among the half-pence: with that I secured him, and took him to the office, and advertised the articles, on account of which the prosecutor came.
Prisoner Trimmer. Did you take that property from me? - I took every article, expect the shift, out of his pockets.


                  JOHN
                   COOKE
               



             sworn.
I am a constable. I and Mayne met the two prisoners. We pursued them, and I met Morrison, the tall one, coming out of the house first, and the other retired into the house. I searched Morrison, and found nothing; and then I went in to Mr Mayne, and he was searching Trimmer. I saw the keys found on him, and Mr. Mayne asked him where he got all this money: he said, it is my own. - What do you take my money from me for? I had known the prisoners before, and they knew us to be constables. We had no warrant (The things deposed to by Martha Wiggins, the prosecutor being blind.)
Prisoner Trimmer. I stand here indicted for a crime I am entirely innocent of. Last Wednesday morning I was going to work; and in crossing a place, called the Green-yard, near Houndsditch, I saw these things lay; and in returning home, I met Mayne and Cooke. I found the money.
Jury. Are you a Smith? - I am a Sawyer
.
Q. Who had you those keys of! - I found the keys with the things. I know nothing at all about them.

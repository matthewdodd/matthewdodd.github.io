            . As I was going along Thames street


, about nine in the evening, on the eighteenth of August, I felt a twitch at my pocket; I turned round and caught the prisoner by the arm, and saw him drop my handkerchief. I gave charge of him to the constable.
"The constable deposed that he searched the prisoner and found six handkerchiefs under his coat."
"The prisoner said in his defence, that a young fellow dropt the handkerchief, and the prosecutor took him by mistake."

            . I am a cheesemonger
, and live in Prescot street, Goodman's-fields


. It is customary, for want of room, to set two or three firkins out at the door; my wife missed one about candlelight, I happened to take the right way; I found the prisoner stopped by 
               
                  Stephen 
                  Jones 
               



             at the corner of Chambers's street, in Lemon-street; he had the firkin, there was above 50 pounds weight of butter in it my property; I laid hold of the prisoner, and Jones brought the butter back to my shop.

            . I am a carman; I was going with a load of flour, and stopped the prisoner with a firkin of butter; he was running, made me suspect him; I kept him till the prosecutor came.
Prisoner's defence.
I got the butter in the middle of the road; I was going to carry it back to show the carman where I found it, when the prosecutor came.

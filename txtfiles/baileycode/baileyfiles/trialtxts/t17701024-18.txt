            . I keep a public house
 at Stepney


. The prisoner came into my house on the 2d of October, and had a pint of beer; she went away and did not pay for it; this was about four o'clock: about six she returned again, and the bundle, containing the things mentioned in the indictment, was found upon her by 
               
                  Maria
                   Eccles
               



            . When Eccles stopped her she called out shop thief, and then I went to her assistance. When we asked her how she came to steal the things, she said she was so much in liquor that she did not know what she did.

. On the 30th of November, about six o'clock in the evening, I went into a room behind my shop, a neighbour came and asked if I had lost my barrow, I then missed it, ran out and overtook the prisoner in Red Lion-square with it on his head, collared him, and charged him with stealing it, he said he was going to take it to a gentleman in Queen-square. I took him to the watch-house.

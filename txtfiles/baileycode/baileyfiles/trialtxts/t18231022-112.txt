WILLIAM CULBARD. I am a fishmonger
, and live in Gracechurch-street


. I did not miss this spoon until the officer brought it to me; it was kept up stairs usually. The prisoner was in my service two months, and had left me five or six days before.

            . I am a pawnbroker, and live in East Smithfield. On the 13th of September, about four o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner offered this spoon in pawn. I asked where he got it. He said from his mother. I told him to fetch her. He refused, and I detained him, and said, if he did not give up the person he stole it from, I would give him in charge. He then resisted, and struck me in the face, and I gave him in charge.

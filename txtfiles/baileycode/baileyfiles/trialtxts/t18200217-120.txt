            . I am a surgeon
, and live in Manchester-street, Manchester-square. On the 28th of January, about seven o'clock in the evening, I was in Piccadilly


, and felt my handkerchief going; I turned round, missed it, and saw the prisoner in custody with it.

            . I live in Castle-street, Oxford-market. I was coming along Piccadilly, and saw the prisoner and another attempt to pick the prosecutor's pocket. I followed them about two hundred yards, then saw the prisoner take up the skirt of his coat, and take the handkerchief out; the other man got behind him. I secured him with the handkerchief under his arm - the other man escaped.

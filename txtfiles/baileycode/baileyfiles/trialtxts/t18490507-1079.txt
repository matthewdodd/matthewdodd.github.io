JERRY SULLIVAN



, feloniously, with others, assaulting 



Benjamin Ratcliff, with intent to rob him.






BENJAMIN RATCLIFF
 On Sunday evening, 22d April, I was passing along the high-road from Barnet to Hatfield, in South Mimms parish, with my brother—three navvies came up, the prisoner was one—they all three laid hold of our basket, and asked what we had got—we said, "What has that to do with you?"—they tried to get it, and said, "What you have got I mean to have"—I was knocked down by the prisoner, and my brother by one of the others—one of them kicked me on the head—while we were struggling a policeman came up—I gave one man in charge; he got away.





JOHN RATCLIFF
 I was with my brother. The prisoner and his comrades came on us—I was kneeling down to tie up the basket—they all three caught hold of it—I asked what they wanted—they said, "What you have got we will have"—the prisoner knocked my brother down; one of them knocked me down, and as I was getting up another one kicked me in the

mouth—a policeman came up and took one, but the policeman was knocked down, and the chap got away—I followed them, and heard one of them say that the first who came to them he would run him through.





JOHN M'CARTHY
 (policeman, S 145). I was on duty, heard a noise, went up, and saw the prisoner and two others walking on the road, and John Ratcliff behind, bleeding profusely from the mouth—he pointed out the man who had kicked him; I took him—the prisoner and the other man came between us, one dragged the prisoner, and the other dragged me away—one of them gave me a violent blow over the eye, I have got the wound now—on the Friday following I found the prisoner, and took him in charge.

Prisoner's Defence. I never struck him in my life.

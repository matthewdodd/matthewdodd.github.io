            . I am a patrol of Bow-street. I met the prisoner at Ball's-pond Common, on the 30th of December, about five o'clock in the evening, with a bundle. I asked him what it was? he said it was his clothes, which he had brought from Mr. Kershaw's; that he had been painting the house, and slept in the stable while he was there. I took him back to Mr. Kershaw's, who claimed the bundle.
ULYSSE HARRISSON. I am servant to Mr. Kershaw. The prisoner was not employed about the house.

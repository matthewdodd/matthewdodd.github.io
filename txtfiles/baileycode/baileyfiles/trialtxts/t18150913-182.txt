            . As I was going home through Well close square


, on the evening of the 16th of August, the prisoner and another man said they knew me, and laid hold of my arms; and soon after pushed my arms forward and took my pocket book, containing seven pounds, eleven shillings and sixpence out of my pocket. I asked for my pocket book back, and they immediately knocked me down. They then ran away, and I pursued the prisoner. I was not sober, I was about half and half; but I knew very well what I was about. The watchman stopped the prisoner when I sung out. He was never out of my sight.

             , the 30th of January

 last.
Mr. Cabel depos'd, That the Coals were lost out of a Lighter at the Wharf, the Prisoner being suspected, they making it their Business to loiter about the Shoar, under Pretence, of picking up Coals, that are scatter'd , and being carried before the Justice, did own the Fact, and that they had sold them to one A - J - ; the Fact being plainly prov'd, the Jury found each of them 


               Guilty to the Value of 10 d.
            





             was indicted as an Accessory after the Fact, 


               for Buying the said Coals, knowing them to be stolen
            ; but there not being any Evidence against him, but the Confession of the Prisoners, nor any Proof that he knew them to have been stolen, and he producing several Persons of Reputation who gave him a fair and honest Character, the Jury 

               acquitted
             him.

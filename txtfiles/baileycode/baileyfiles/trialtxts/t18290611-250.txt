            . I was with Robert Morris on the 7th of June, about half-past twelve o'clock at night - the two prisoners were passing by; Wright took the handkerchief from Morris' pocket - Morris gave a jump, and said,"My handkerchief is gone;" I ran after them to the corner of Compton-street - I saw no watchman; they then turned, and run down a street - I and a friend ran after them - they crossed Frith-street; I saw three watchmen coming up with a charge - I spoke to them, and one of them came and took the prisoners to the watch-house; the handkerchief has not been found; I am sure I saw Wright take it, and run it into his trousers pocket; Mr. Morris and I were afraid to take them, we were afraid we should be knocked down; Mr. Morris is not here; Farrell was close to Wright at the time it was taken.
CHARLES O'NEAL. I am a watchman. I took the two prisoners at the corner of Compton-street - they denied all knowledge of it.
FARRELL'S Defence. I went to a man who owed me a few shillings - I then met this young man, we were walking on; this gentleman crossed the road, and said we had been picking a pocket; I know no more of it than I do of my dying hour.

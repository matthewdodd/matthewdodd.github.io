EDWARD BERRY
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
3rd of January, 1 coat, value 8s., the goods of 



Richard Copsey.







RICHARD COPSEY
. I live at Norton, in Essex, and am a butcher. I loft a coat off my horse, on the 3rd of January, about a quarter put six o'clock in the morning, while I was gone to Mr. Venables—I was away about two minutes, and it was gone when I returned—this is it.





JOHN BARKER
. I am a patrol of Farringdon-ward. I was on duty, and saw the prisoner take the coat off the horse's back in Newgate-street—he put it on his arm, and ran down Butcherhall-lane—I took him there with it—he said he had found it.

Prisoner. There was another young man with me. I had received some money the night before, and we staid out all night—when this officer came to me he said, "I thought it was another that took it, but 1 could not get him." Witness. No, I said I did not think it would be you that took the coat; I thought it would have been your companion: because I had seen him take the trouble of taking up some hay, and giving it to the horse.





THOMAS HIGHLAND
. I was with the officer, and saw the coat found on the prisoner.




GUILTY
. Aged 21.—


Transported for Seven Years.

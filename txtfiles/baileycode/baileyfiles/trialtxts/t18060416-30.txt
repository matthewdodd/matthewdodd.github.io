. On the 16th of April, about half past two in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner at the bar go into the warehouse, he said there about two minutes, and then come out with a firkin of butter on his back; I followed the prisoner down a passage, and spoke to him; he then let the firkin fall; I followed the prisoner till I had him taken, he was out of my sight ten or fifteen yards.
Q. Can you take upon you to swear that he is the man. - A. Yes.
(The firkin produced, and identified by the witness.)
The prisoner said nothing in his defence, called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.

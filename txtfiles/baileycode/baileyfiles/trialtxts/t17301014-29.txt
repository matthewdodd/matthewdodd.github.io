            , the 29th of September

The Prosecutor depos'd, That he having employ'd the Prisoner to mend two Cane Chairs, that he bringing them home, he and his Wife having been telling some Money, dropt a Guinea, that no Body was in the Room but the Prisoner, and that when he was going out, the Guinea was gone; that as he was going out, he call'd to his Wife to stop him, for he had got the Guinea; that the Prisoner was search'd, but no Guinea was found, and he believ'd he might have it in his Mouth; that he desir'd his Pay-Master Serjeant might he sent for, that when he came, he desir'd him to pay him (the Prosecutor) a Guinea, and he would deduct it out of his Pay, that the Serjeant desir'd to speak with the Prisoner by himself, and afterwards came out in a great Passion, and said, they might take him to the Devil if they would, he had got the Guinea in his damn'd Guts, and he would never appear for him.
This was likewise confirm'd by the Prosecutor's Wife, who added, That she saw the Prisoner take the Guinea up.
The Pay-Master Serjeant, Mr. Crawford depos'd, That the Prisoner did always deny that he had the Guinea; and also he deny'd that he said to the Prosecutor, that the Prisoner had the Guinea in his damn'd Guts .
The Right Honourable the Earl of Albermarl, Colonel Hamilton, and Captain Southly, gave him a very good Character; but the Fact being plainly prov'd, the Jury found him 

               Guilty
             of the Indictment.

            . On the 18th of January
, the Prisoner came to my Master's in Mint-square, on the other Side of the Water; and said he wanted two Dozen of Tea, one Dozen of Green, and one Dozen of Bohea, for a Gentleman's Servant in Grosvenor's-square, - My Master's Name is Prior, he sells Tea and Sugar, &c. My Master told me, he had not so much Tea in the House, and could not serve him; and gave me leave to do it, and told me where I could get the Tea to serve Charles Tanner with. - I went and bought two Dozen of Tea at an Inn in the Borough, of a Sussex Man: - My Master owed me 8 l. for four Years Wages, and he had paid me the Money: I bought one Dozen of Green, and one Dozen of Bohea, and gave 6 l. 10 s. for it; and I was to have 7 l. 4 s. if the Gentleman's Servant liked it; I was to go with the Prisoner to Grosvenor's-square, I took one Dozen over at a Time, I carried five Pound, four Pound in a Band-box, and two half Pounds in my Pockets, and he carried seven Pound in a Basket; we went over the Water: and he carried me to the two Brewers


, at the Corner of Nibs's Pound, by Tyburn-Road : He said he was going to Esquire Boothby's in Grosvenor's-square, and took the Basket with the seven Pound of Tea with him; says he, You must give me the Box with the four Pound, and the two half Pounds out of your Pocket; I gave it him, and he brought me my Box again: Said I, Mr Tanner, Why don't you give me the Money for it? He said, the Gentleman's Servant would not give him the Money for that, till he had the other Dozen; we came back and fetched the other Dozen. I had a Link coming over St George the Martyn's-fields, and lighted him till we came to the two Brewers by Nibs's Pound : He not paying me for the first, I thought he would cheat me, and was resolved to see where he was going with the Tea; just before he came to the Place, says he, You must not go along with me to the House, they will be angry; says I, Mr Tanner, Why not? I may pass for your Cousin there's no Harm in that; he said the Gentleman's Servant would come to the Two-Brewers and pay him: I said I would see where the Goods went to, and then he said, Put out your Link, you Rogue; and before he came to

            's House, he said, D - n your Blood, give me the two half Pounds of Tea. He took the Tea out of my Pocket. - It was cut out of my Pocket. Here is the Cut he made to get it out. Then he went into Mrs Sutton's about Ten o'Clock; says she, Lord, Mr Tanner, What do you do here, at this Time of Night? He asked who was in the House; says she, There's no Body in the House but Thomas. He called Thomas, and then he said to me, D - n your Blood, you little Dog, give me the Box; and he took the Box, which was in a Handkerchief, and gave it to Thomas, and he run away with it. He sat down in the House a little while, and I asked him what he meant by taking the Tea from me; he said, D - n your Blood, you Dog, what makes you uneasy, the Man will come with the Money presently; and a little while after, he went towards the Door, and run away from me; when Thomas came back, I asked him what he had done with the Goods, he said he had carried them to the Two-Brewers, and that Tanner then took them away from him. I did not know what to do for a Lodging, and they let me lie at the Two-Brewers, and I gave them two-pence for it. I knew Tanner belonged to the Horse-Grenadiers, and I knew the Corporal. I went to the House where Tanner lodged, and knocked at the Room-Door, and asked for him; says a Woman that lay with him, - I do not know whether she is his Wife or not; says she, he is not within; What do you want with him? Said I, I want to speak with him. I listened at the Door, and heard him whispering; said I, Mr Tanner, I want to speak with you; D - n your Blood, says he, What do you want? Says I, you know what I want, you know you robbed me last Night; I want nothing but what you robbed me of, or my Money: He got up, and said I should have it; but he never would give me either Goods or Money. Says he, D - n your Blood, and threatened me if I did not go back what he would do to me. I knew the Captain, and went to him, and he sent him to the Black-Hold. Then he said, a Custom-House-Officer had taken the Goods from him by St Giles's Pound, and when he found the Commitment was made for him to go to New-Prison, he owned where the Tea was; that there was nine Pound at Mr Lovelace's, ten Pound in another Place, three Pound at another, and two Pound his Wife had.
Prisoner. Ask him whether I took the Pound of Tea away from him before I came to Mrs Sutton's, or whether I did not say, Let me have the Pound, of Tea which is in your Pocket, for this is the House I was coming to, I will send the Tea away here?
Poule. You did not say any such Thing; you cursed and swore at me, and said you would have it, and cut my Pocket to get it out.

            . I keep a Publick-House; one Tuesday, Tanner brought a Basket to my House, and desired it might be put by safe for him, and I said to my Wife, Dame, Mr Tanner desires this to be put by for him. I did not know what it was, but when it came to be enquired for, I found it to be Tea; it was put into a brown Paper Bag, and my Wife's Sister carried it to Justice De Veil.

                  Tanner 
               



             came to my House one Tuesday Night, between Nine and Ten; this Boy was with him with a Link and a Bundles, says he, Who have you at Home? Says I, there's Thomas; he went up Stairs, and said, Hollo, Thomas, Thomas; Thomas answered him, and he went up to Thomas's Room. The Boy had something that looked like a square Bundle tied up in a Handkerchief. I saw him take it from the Boy, and the Boy said, What do you mean by that, Sir. - The Boy said he must have the Money before he delivered the Goods; he took it from the Boy, and gave it to Thomas, and bid him go where he told him. I was afraid he was coming to do me some Mischief, - because he did not pay me a little Matter that he owed me, and I went after him for the Money.
Poule. There was four Pound of Tea in that Handkerchief in a Bandbox, which he took from me at Mrs Sutton's.
- Stafford. I live in Oxford Road, the Prisoner, one Thursday, left a Basket, and something tied in a Handkerchief like a Wig-box, and desired I would let those Things stand there till he came off Guard. I never knew the Man before; he sent for them away, but I was not at Home then.

             deposed, that Prior came to ask her Husband whether he knew any Body who was well enough acquainted with Tanner, to help him to the Money for the Tea.

            . I was at the White-hart in Gravel-Lane, on the other Side of the Water, and heard Tanner agree with Prior for twenty-four Pound of Tea, and he was to pay him for it when he had sold it; and he said he was very welcome to the Tea, if he was an honest Man, and would pay him for it. - I did not hear him say who the Tea was for. - I do not know whether he deals in Tea. - I do not know what he was to pay him for it. - He said it was for a Customer, that he could help him to the selling of it. - I happened to go to the White-hart for a Pint of Beer, and heard this. - I live in Smithfield. - I have an Aunt lives in Little Bandyleg Walk. - I call in sometimes for a Pint of Beer there. - I do not know which Side of the Way the White-hart is on.


                  Thomas 
                  Sagewell 
               



             deposed, that Tanner called him down Stairs at Mrs Sutton's, delivered him the Goods at the Door, and ordered him to carry them to the Two-Brewers, and promised to follow him directly; that he carried them to the Two-Brewers, but Tanner not coming to him, he brought the Things back, and took them into his own Room, and that Tanner came for them the Thursday Night following. Tanner lodged three Weeks or a Month in Mrs Sutton's House. I did not know him before that.

            . I heard this old Woman (Mrs Sutton) say, that the Prisoner owed her four Shillings for Lodging, and deserved to be hanged, because he would not pay her; and I heard the Boy say he was robbed at Tyburn.
Prisoner. Prior had me confined, and kept me four Days upon Bread and Water, in Order to make this Affair up. Prior is a Prisoner in the King's Bench, and therefore cannot be brought here.

             was called again, and asked how he came by the Money to buy the Tea.
Poule. My Master had paid me eight Pound some Time before for Wages. I was going out Apprentice to a Shipwright at Woolwich, and this Money was to buy me Cloaths. - I am almost sixteen Years of Age. - My Master belonged to the Guards, and Tanner came on the other Side of the Water, to see some Men that belonged to the Troop, and came for some Tea, and my Master not having the Tea, he gave me the Privilege of buying it. 

               Guilty
             of the Felony.

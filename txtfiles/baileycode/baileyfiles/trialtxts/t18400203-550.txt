JAMES FISHER
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
25th of January, 1 pair of trowsers, value 5s.; and 1 handkerchief, value 4d.; the goods of 



Thomas Bruce; in a vessel in a port of entry and discharge.






THOMAS PARSONS
. I am a watchman of the London Dock, which is a port of entry and discharge. On the 25th of January, I met the prisoner in the dock carrying something—I asked what he had got—he said a pair of trowsers which he had brought into the dock, and was going to take them out—I detained him, and found the owner.





THOMAS BRUCE
. I belong to a ship lying in the dock, which came from Leith. I left these trowsers in my chest, which was not locked—it was in the forecastle, on board the ship—both these articles are mine—(looking at the handkerchief and trowsers)—the prisoner did not belong to the ship—I saw them safe on Friday, the 24th of January—we came into the dock on the Wednesday.





GEORGE DIX
. I am a constable of the London Docks. The prisoner was brought in custody with the trowsers—I asked where he got them—he said he bought a suit of clothes at Hart's, in Ratcliffe-highway, and these were part of them—he does not work in the docks, and had no right there.

Prisoner's Defence. I bought these trowsers at the same time that I did the waistcoat I now have on.




GUILTY
.* Aged 25.—


Transported for Ten Years.

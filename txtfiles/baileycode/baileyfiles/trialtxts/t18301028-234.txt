            . I am the wife of John Michael White - we live in the City-gardens


. On the 27th of April Williams came and brought this letter - he said he came from Mr. Horne, to borrow three sovereigns; I asked him if he would wait, as my husband was out - he was there three quarters of an hour, and I asked him a great many questions; at last, in consequence of the letter, and believing he came from Mr. Horne, I gave him the three sovereigns; I know nothing of Wood - this is the letter - he asked if there was any work to go back, and I gave him the two rings.

            . I am a constable. I took the prisoners from the information of Mrs. Horne.(Letter read.)
MR. WHITE, You will excuse my sending you this note, but if you could oblige me with the loan of 3l. until Saturday next, as I have a bill come which I must settle this evening; if you can send it by bearer, I will call on Saturday and settle the same. THOMAS R. HORNE.

            . I never sent this letter or the boy
, to get this money - Wood called to ask me where Mrs. White lived.

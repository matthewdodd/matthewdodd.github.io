            . I am a cheesemonger
. Last Thursday week, I sent the prisoner to Mr. Thompson, with a bill and receipt for 12 s., and gave him 8 s., in case he wanted change - he did not return. He was apprehended on Sunday night. I searched, but found nothing on him; he said, he received 12 s. from Thompson, who did not want change, and had spent the money. I told him he had been to Astley's that night - he did not deny it.

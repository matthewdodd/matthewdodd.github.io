JOHN DIXON
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
14th of Dec., 36 yards of carpet, value 5l. 8s., the goods of 




Thomas Brooks and another; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






HENRY BOYS
. I am in the employ of Thomas Brooks and another, drapers, in Farringdon-street. This carpet is theirs—it has never been sold—the mark is not taken off it, which it would be if it had been sold—it had been on their premises.





ANGUS BAINS
 (City police-constable, No. 280.) I saw the prisoner at half-past five in the evening of the 14th of Dec. coming along West-street, Smithfield, in a direction from Smithfield—he had this roll of carpet on his shoulder—I asked him what he had got there—he made no reply—I wished him to stop—he dropped the carpet, and ran away—I pursued, and took him on Saffron-hill—Eliza Cain took the carpet—I went back, and found it.





ELIZA CALE
. I was standing at my door in West-street—I saw the prisoner coming down with this carpet—the policeman crossed to him—he threw it off his shoulder, and immediately alter he ran off—I got a young man to help me with the carpet into my shop, and as soon as the officer returned with the prisoner I gave the carpet into his care.

Prisoner's Defence. A man met me, and told me to carry it, and he would give me 1s.





JOHN SSCROGGINS
 (City police-constable, No. 281.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 20.—


Transported for Seven Years.

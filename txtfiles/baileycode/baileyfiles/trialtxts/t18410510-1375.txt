HARMENIA DUNAGE
. I am the wife of John Dunage, a shoemaker, in Grafton-street. On the 8th of April I had the things safe now produced—I missed them about seven o'clock in the evening—they are mine—the value of the whole is 8l.—they have all the marks picked out, but so badly, that I could distinguish them on some things, on the other things I could not.





ELIZABETH MOULDER
. I am the wife of William Moulder, of Duke-street, Portland-place. On the 8th of April the prisoner came to my place, and a person with her—she had these five shifts, and other clothes—I bought them—I do not keep a shop—I have seen the prisoner many times before—I gave 1l. 16s. for them.

Cross-examined by
MR. HORRY. Q. There was a man came with her? A. Yes—I had never seen him before to my knowledge—he bad never been to my house before—I suppose the prisoner spoke first—I could not swear which—she was carrying the bundles—they were together all the time—the man did not talk about selling these things—I do not recollect whether he interfered about the price—I did not ask either of them where the things came from.
(—Lyon, Union-street, Middlesex Hospital; Mary Conly, Grey-street, Rathbone-place;—Terry, Newton-street, New-road; Michael Dignum, general dealer, Pelham-street: and John Delany, a porter, gave the pri-soner a good character.

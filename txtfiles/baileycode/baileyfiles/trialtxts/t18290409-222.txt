            . I live in Homer-street


, and am a poor working woman. The prisoner, whom I had known before, came to see me on the 21st of March, and while she was there I brought some shirts into the room, in a basket; they belonged to my landlord; I had them to wash - she remained from nine o'clock in the morning till two or three; these are the shirts.

            . I am a pawnbroker. These shirts were pawned with me, on the evening of the 21st of March, to the best of my belief by the prisoner. I gave her this duplicate.

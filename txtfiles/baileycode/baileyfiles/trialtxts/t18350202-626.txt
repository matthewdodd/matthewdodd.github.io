GEORGE BROWN
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
27th of January, 1 handkerchief, value 3s., the goods of 



John Valentine, from his person.






JOHN VALENTINE
. On the 27th of January, about nine o'clock in the evening, I was entering a house in Drury-lane, and felt a kind of a pull at my coat pocket—I put my hand, and missed my handkerchief—the prisoner was close to me—I took hold of his arm with one hand, and I took him by the collar with the other—he had my handkerchief in his hand, and dropped it behind him—I took it up, and secured him—a great mob came up, who attempted to push me down Charles-street, but I dragged him on the other side of the road—I held him, and called for an officer for two or three minutes—the prisoner was begging me to forgive him, and said it was the first time he had ever done it—Daniel Sudden wood then came up, and struck me on the nose—the policeman came and took him and the prisoner, but he could not manage them both, and he gave me the prisoner; telling me to take him towards the station-house—we were knocked about a great deal—several persons struck us, and there was one man very active in striking us with his basket—my hat was knocked off, but another officer came up, and we secured them both.





DANIEL JOHN SMITH
. I am a tailor. I was Covent-garden, and heard the noise—I went and saw the mob—what has been stated is correct—the witness was very much ill-treated by the mob.





WILLIAM DUNGATE
 (police-constable F 22.) I was called to assist—there was very great resistance made—if I had come up, the prisoner would have escaped.
(Joseph Bendon, a plasterer, and John Child gave the prisoner a good character.)




GUILTY

Transported for Seven Years.

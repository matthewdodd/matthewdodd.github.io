            . I met the prisoner in Fashion-street, Spittlefields, I asked her the way to the Queen's-head, she undertook to shew me; she led me up a narrow alley, and in at a door, the moment I was in the door was shut, I heard a man's voice, I desired to be let out, and I got out in about four or five minutes, and then I missed my handkerchief and pocket-book, which I know I had just before; I got a warrant the next day, and took up the prisoner; she denied taking them some time, at last she desired her husband to go and look for the pocket-book, he went and brought it, then she confessed she had pawned the handkerchief, where it was found.

            . I am a pawnbroker in Lower Dean-street, Spittlefields; the prisoner and her husband came and pledged this handkerchief with me for 18 d. on the 25th of April. (Produced and deposed to.)

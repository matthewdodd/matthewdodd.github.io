JOHN SIBBALD. I was in the Strand


 on the 27th of February, nearly opposite the Adelphi Theatre - a gentleman told me the prisoner had had his hand in my pocket - I felt, and my handkerchief was gone - it was safe about an hour before; the prisoner was not far from me - I followed, and laid hold of him; I accused him of having taken the handkerchief - he made no answer. A little boy gave me the handkerchief, and said the prisoner had thrown it down in the street.

            . I am a trimming-manufacturer. I was coming up Durham-street, into the Strand, and saw this gentleman passing the top of the street - the prisoner had hold of his coat with one hand, and drew the handkerchief out with the other; he put it into his own pocket, and passed by; I told the gentleman, and said that was the boy - he ran, seized hold of him, and said he had robbed him; he then took it out of his pocket, and threw it into the kennel, behind him - a little boy picked it up, and gave it to the prosecutor.

conducted the Prosecution.






WILLIAM CLARK
. I keep the Jew's Harp, Regent's-park, in the parish of St. Pancras. On the night of 15th April 1 went to bed at twelve o'clock, and left all safe—I got up at half-past five, and found a square of glass taken out of the back parlour, which enabled persons to take the shutter down and get in—the till was empty—it had contained 5s. in copper the night before—I also missed a pair of gloves, a corkscrew with the point broken off, a scarf of my cousin's, a snuff-box, two bottles of brandy, and a stone bottle which I had left empty.





JOSEPH LAWRENCE
. I am assistant to Mr. Thompson, pawnbroker, of Frederick-place, Hampstead-road. I produce a scarf and two handkerchiefs, pledged with me, by the prisoner, on 19th April—I had seen him before.

Cross-examined by
MR. WOOLLETT. Q. Had he ever pledged there before? A. No; but I had seen him before.





MARY GREENWOOD
. I am Mr. Clark's cousin. This is my scarf—I lent it to him on 15th April.

Cross-examined. Q. How do you know it? A. By the pin-marks, and by the peculiar fringe—I have had it five or six years.





JAMES MASON
 (policeman, A 168). On 27th April I searched the prisoner's sister's house, and found these gloves, corkscrew, snuff-box, and stone bottle.





WILLIAM CLARK

re-examined. These are my property.
(The former conviction was produced, as in the last case.)

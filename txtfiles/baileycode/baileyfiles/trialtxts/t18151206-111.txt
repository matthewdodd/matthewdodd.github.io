            . I am a sister of the prisoner's; I live at home with my mother now. The prisoner broke open my box; there was nobody to break it open unless he did. He owned he broke it open, and said he sold the things.

            . I can't read; but I know it is a bad thing to tell a lie. I saw my brother, the prisoner, take the hammer, and break open the box, and take out the two shawls, and the calico.

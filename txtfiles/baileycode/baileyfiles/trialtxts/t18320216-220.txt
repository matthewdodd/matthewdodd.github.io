            . I am an officer. I was coming from Museum-street, and met the prisoner, in company with another man, and watched them - the other got on one side of the cart; the prisoner got up on the other side, and helped the firkin down; the prisoner put it on his shoulder, and walked off with it - I collard him, and said, "Halloo, where are you going?" he threw it down, and I lost my hold, but I secured him - he did not get an arm's length from me.
Prisoner. I was out of employ.

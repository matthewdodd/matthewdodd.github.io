 - I keep a shop. On the 28th of August, about two o'clock, I left the back room for five minutes, and on returning I saw the prisoner taking the watch, which hung over the mantel-piece; he went out on his tip-toes; I followed, calling Stop thief! he was taken, without my losing sight of him; I saw him take the watch from his pocket, and throw it into a yard, where it was found. It is worth 3l. with the chain and seals, as they are gold.

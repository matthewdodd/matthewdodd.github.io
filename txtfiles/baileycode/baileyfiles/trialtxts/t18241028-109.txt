            . I live in Bride-lane. On the 26th of September, I was in Fleet-street


; about a quarter to eleven o'clock at night, and felt a tug at my right-hand pocket. I looked over my shoulder, and saw the prisoner passing my handkerchief to another person. I immediately seized him, and took him to the watch-house - the handkerchief was gone. I am sure I saw it in his hand - it was safe ten minutes before.
Prisoner's Defence. I was passing along; he turned round and asked if I had his handkerchief - he immediately collared me, took me up Chancery-lane, and said
"Now if you will tell me if you took it, or who did, I will let you go.
MR. BELL. I said if he would tell me who he gave it to I would let him go.

                  Mary 
                  Hust 
               



            . I live in Dean Street, Soho. The prisoner was my servant
. I bought a diamond bracelet of Mrs. Gifford. I lost it, and all I know is, that the prisoner offered some diamonds to sell to Mr. Priest.
Q. How do you know that?
M. Hust. I was before the justice, when he was charged by Mr. Priest as having offered these diamonds to sell.
Q. Before what justice?
M. Hust. Before justice Fielding.
Q. How did he say he came by them?
M. Hust. He said he found them.
Q. Who were they produced by?
M. Hust. By Mr. Priest.
Q. Were these diamonds produced by him part of your diamonds?
M. Hust. I believe they were.
Q. Was Mrs. Gifford there at the time?
M. Hust. She was, and she thought so too.
Q. Where were these diamonds taken from?
M. Hust. From a drawer in my chamber; but he was not my servant at that time.
Cross examination.
Q. How long had he left your service before you missed the bracelet?
M. Hust. About a fortnight before.
Q. Had not you other servants in the house that had frequent opportunities of taking this thing?
M. Hust. There was a charewoman that I took up, and had before the justice.
Q. Was she not committed upon this account?
M. Hust. She was, to New Prison.
Q. How long did she continue there?
M. Hust. She continued there about a week.
Q. How came you to suspect the prisoner at the bar?
M. Hust. Because I heard he had offered some diamonds to sell.
Q. Have you any particular reasons to apprehend they were your diamonds, because one may be like another?
M. Hust. They were very like what I lost.
Q. How long had you had them?
M. Hust. About six months.


                  Mary 
                  Gifford 
               



            . I sold a diamond bracelet to Mrs. Hust.
Q. Where do you live?
M. Gifford. I live with Mrs. Hust.
Q. Was you along with Mrs. Hust when Mr. Priest produced some diamonds before the justice?
M. Gifford. I was. There were four large ones in particular, and those four to the best of my knowledge I sold to Mrs. Hust, they seem to be the very same size.
Cross examination.
Q. Do you believe they are the same you sold for no other reason but that they were of the same size?
M. Gifford. No, for no other reason.

                  Fluroe 
               



            . I am a jeweller. I remember selling a diamond bracelet to Mrs. Gifford.
Q. When did you sell it her?
Fluroe. About seven years ago.
Q. Did you ever see them in Mrs. Hust's possession?
Fluroe. No, I never did.
Q. Was you before the justice when the diamonds were produced?
Fluroe. I was. They resembled them, but there is no swearing positively to it; it was my opinion they were the same.
Cross examination.
Q. Have you ever seen the bracelet since you sold it?
Fluroe. I don't know that I have.


                  John 
                  Priest 
               



            . The prisoner brought four diamonds to me much about Easter last, and ask'd me if I knew the value of them; I told him I did not know whether they were diamonds or not.
Q. Are you a jeweller?
Priest. No, I am not.
Q. Did you enquire how he came by them?
Priest. No, I did not. I said I had a brother that possibly might know what they were worth. He lef t them with me all night, and I gave them to my brother to enquire what they were.


                  George 
                  Priest 
               



            . I live with a jeweller. I had four large diamonds of my brother, and the prisoner brought me fourteen more. I ask'd him how he came by them; he said he had them of a gentlewoman that served the dutchess of Somerset. He wanted to know what they were worth. I took him to a jeweller in Greek-Street (my master not being at home) but that jeweller did not know the value of them.
Q. Was you before the justice?
G. Priest. I was, and saw the prisoner there.
Q. What did he say there, as to his coming by them?
G. Priest. He said he found them in a paper.
Q. Did he say where he found them?
G. Priest. In Dean Street, to the best of my knowledge, in a paper tied up with a packthread.
Q. How long was it between the time he told you he found them, and the time he was before justice Fielding.
G. Priest. About 5 or 6 days.
Q. Did you say any thing to him about what he said concerning whom he had them of?
G. Priest. No, I did not.
Q. Was Mrs. Hust there before the justice?
G. Priest. She was. There she said, to the best of her knowledge, upon the diamonds being produced, that they were hers.
Q. Was Mrs. Gifford there?
G. Priest. She was, and said the four capital stones were the same, she believed, that she sold to Mrs. Hust.
Q. to Prosecutrix. How many diamonds did you lose ?
Prosecutrix. I can't be certain.
Q. Did you lose eighteen?
Prosecutrix. Yes, and many more.
Priest. The prisoner told me he would bring me some more diamonds when he brought the four others; he said the gentlewoman whom he had them of, wanted two guineas on them; I said I would let him have one, which I did. The next day he brought fourteen more. The diamonds produced in court.
Q. to Mrs. Hust. Look upon these diamonds. Do you know them?
Mrs. Hust. I believe they are mine.
Q. to Mrs. Gifford. Do you know them, or any of them?
Mrs. Gifford. I believe the four large ones are the same which were in the bracelet. I told Mrs. Hust.
Q. to Mrs. Hust. Are these the same that were shewed before justice Fielding ?
Mrs. Hust. They are the same.
Prisoner's defence. I left Mrs. Hust's service about a fortnight before my wife did. I married her out of her house. She left the house the Friday before Easter, and I and my wife have never been in her house since.
For the prisoner.

            , Esq; The prisoner lived servant with me about six months; he left my service about a year ago; he behaved exceeding well. He had an opportunity of robbing me, would; when my house was partly burnt down bury Street. He had a great opportunity of robbing me. He brought me back silver spoons, part of an ear-ring, and plate, which I could not have charged him with.
Mr. Cissel. I have known him four years, or something better; he lived servant with me about nine months.
Q. What are you?
Cissel. I am an apothecary.
Q. When did he live with you?
Cissel. He left my service about a year ago; but I have seen him going backwards and forward. When I parted with him it was from this motive, that he might get more money. He was trusted in my house with things of great value.

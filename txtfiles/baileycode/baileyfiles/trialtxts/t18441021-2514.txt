JOHN JOHNSON
 and 




CHARLES KERCHEVAL



 were indicted for stealing 1 desk, value 10s. the goods of 



Frederick acland Hamerton; and that Kercheval had been before convicted of felony.







FREDERICK ACLAND HAMERTON
. I live in Belgrave-street, Pimlico. I had a desk in my bed-room, which I had seen safe on Sunday last about five o'clock—I missed it at near eleven o'clock at night—this now produced is it—I lodge at a private house—the street door is kept shut.





FREDERICK JAMES PENNY
 (policeman.) On the 20th of Oct. I saw the prisoners in company with two others, about a quarter to seven o'clock, loitering on the pavement. I went on my beat twice—on coming back the third time, I was standing under a lamp-post, and Kercheval passed me, and made a noise with his mouth—Johnson crossed the road, and turned into Gillingham-street—I followed him—he saw me coming and ran—I ran after him—Kercheval ran up Frederick-lerrace—I followed Johnson about 300 yards—when he was turning Gillingham-street, into Wilton-road, he had a desk—I saw the brass on it—he took it and throw it on the steps of a door—I followed him 300 yards, hallooing "Stop thief!"—a gentleman stopped him, and I took him—he asked what I wanted him for—I said I would tell him when I got him to Westminster station—he said he would be d—d if he would go to Westminster station, he would go to Pimlico—I asked why—he said he knew his way there—I said I did not—he resisted, caught hold of a shutter-bar, and pulled it down upon us—I had seen them before about a quarter to seven o'clock—they had nothing with them then—this was at eight o'clock.

Johnson. He said he took me for a bundle, and at the station he told the inspector that I had thrown it over a high paling, and he knew where to find it, and the desk was found in a door-way.

Witness. He threw it on the pavement between Gillingham-street and Wilton-road, at the corner house—alter taking him to the station, I returned to look for it at the place where he had thrown it, but it was gone—while I was looking about, the witness, George Hind, came up, and said he had found it, and taken it to Pimlico station—I went there and got it—Mr. Hind took me to the place where he found it, and it was the place where I had seen Johnson throw it.

Johnson. Q. How could you see where I threw it vhen I was in another street? A. I was so close on him—I never lost sight of him from the time Kerchcval made the signal with his mouth—he is an excellent runner, but so am I.

Kercheval. He said at the station-house that I came on first; I was not in company with Johnson, or anybody; the policeman coughed at me, and I at the same time coughed at him, but I did not know what it was for; I know the policeman well by living in the neighbourhood; I was coming along with my hands in my pocket; he had not seen me before; he said at the office I walked away. Witness. I saw him watching the other policeman on duty on the other side—he ran away.





GEORGE HIND
. I picked up the desk and took it to the station—I found the policman looking for it when I came back—I picked it up at the place where he was looking.

Johnson's Defence. It is evident the policeman could not see me throw away the desk, when he was in one street and I in the other; no one can say they saw me in Belgrave-street, or near the prosecutor's house; the policeman brought in another prisoner at Queen-square, and the Magistrate would not take his evidence against us; the inspector asked him what sort of a bundle it was, and lie could not tell; but directly he saw the desk he said, "That is it," and ho said he was fifty yards behind me.

Kercheval's Defence. I was not in Johnson's company; I do know him,

but I had been to my grandmother's, who allows me a few shillings-every week, which I had in a piece of paper when I was taken.





FREDERICK JAMES PENNY

re-examitied. I was not ten yards behind Johnson. As we were bringing him to the station he threw a key away, which I produce—it does not fit the latch of the house where the prosecutor lives—it was a common spring-latch.





WILLIAM MILLERMAN
 (police-constable B 95.) I produce a certificate of Kerchevars former conviction—(read)—he is the person—he has not been out of prison above six months.

1727. 




GEORGE DAVIS
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
2nd of June, 1 handkerchief, value 6d., the goods of 



John Powell Hunt, from his person.





THOMAS MALEY
. I am a police-constable, H 74, but am suspended, in consequence of a robbery which took place on my beat, and about which I am now making inquiries; that is the reason of my being in plain clothes; I am not discharged. On the morning of the 2nd of June I was in St. Paul's Churchyard, and saw the prisoner draw a handkerchief from the prosecutor's left pocket with his left hand—I seized him—he directly put the handkerchief between his legs, and a companion that was with him took it from between his legs behind, and carried it off—it was a brownish coloured handkerchief, with spots on it.





JOHN POWELL HUNT
. I live in South Molton-street—Maley gave me information in St. Paul's Churchyard, and I missed my handkerchief—I had used it within half-an-hour—I have one of the same pattern with me.

Prisoner's Defence. As I was standing in St. Paul's Church-yard, the policeman collared me; he did not say any thing; I shoved him away; he then told me the charge; and while I was talking to him, a young man made off with the gentleman's handkerchief. 


GUILTY.** Aged 18.—



Transported for Ten Years.

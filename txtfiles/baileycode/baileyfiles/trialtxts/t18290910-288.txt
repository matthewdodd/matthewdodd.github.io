            . I am a Bow-street patrol. On the 4th of September I saw the prisoner in Bartholomew-fair


, about five o'clock; he took this handkerchief from a gentleman's pocket, who was standing looking at Clarke's show - he handed it to a woman who appeared as his wife; she put it into her bosom - I seized him; some persons came up and hustled me - an officer came up and I took him to the Compter.
Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Was this during the fair? A. Yes; there were a great many people - I distinctly saw the prisoner take the handkerchief; he was not a yard from me - I went back and looked for the gentleman, but could not find him; I had not an opportunity of mentioning it to him at the time, because I was hustled by the prisoner's confederates - I had seenthem with the prisoner before; there were four of them.
Prisoner's Defence. When the officer took me, I said"Why do not you speak to the person I took it from?" but he dragged me away.

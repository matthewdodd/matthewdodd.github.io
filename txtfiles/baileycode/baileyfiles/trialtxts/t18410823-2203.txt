WILLIAM JOHNSON, alias
 Bailey,

 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
18th of August, 13 loaves of bread, value 5s. 6d., the goods of 



Joseph Jackson; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






THOMAS MEADOWS
. I am journeyman to Joseph Jackson, a baker, in Tooley-street. On the 18th of August I left my basket and bread at the corner of William-street, Hampstead-road—I went to Mornington-place to serve a customer—I returned in six or eight minutes, and missed twelve 2lb. loaves, and one 4lb. loaf—I went up William-street, and found the prisoner's basket standing at the door of a doctor's shop, and found it contained my bread—I stopped there about two minutes—the prisoner was coming down the street with a man holding his collar, with the 4lb. loaf under his arm—I could swear to the bread—it was my make.





PHILIP SMITH
. I saw the prisoner take twelve 2lb. loaves, and one 4lb. loaf out of the prosecutor's basket, put them into a basket, and take it with him—I followed him till he put it down—he took one out, and I took him.





JOHN ROUSE
 (police-constable E 24.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 13.—


Transported for Seven Years—Convict Ship.

 were indicted for

 stealing, on the

John Milner, in his dwelling-house.






WILLIAM BROON
. I am servant to Mr. John Milner, who lives at Clapham Park, in the parish of Clapham—it is his dwelling-house. On the 27th of September, I saw my master's plate safe in the pantry at three o'clock—these five ladles, these knife-rests, and other things (looking at them) are part of them—I missed them at a quarter after three o'clock—they are worth 13l. 8s. 6d.





WILLIAM JAMES FRANKS
. On the 27th of September I saw the two prisoners together coming from Mr. Milner's house.

Smith. He said he could not say whether it was me or not. Witness, I am sure he was one, and they were both together—Smith was against the wall—I spoke to Curley, and told him he was dropping his lucifers, and be took no notice of it—I saw them both come from Mr. Milner's—another lad came from Mr. Shepherd's, and another from another gentleman's premises—they walked a short distance, and then commenced running—I am certain the prisoners are the two persons.





WILLIAM WOODWARD
.(police-constable P 157.) I met the prisoners at near four o'clock on the 27th of September—they ran by me—I asked what they had got in their possession—Smith said, "It is all right"—I laid hold of Curley, and of another who got away—I then took Smith, who made great resistance—I took the two prisoners into a shop—on Curley I found these silver articles, and Smith had a box of congreves.

Curley's Defence. The boy who got away told me to carry these things, and said he would pay me for carrying them—I thought he was selling them.

SMITH—

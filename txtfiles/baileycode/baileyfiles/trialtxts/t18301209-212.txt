ELIAS GRIFFITHS. I live in King-street, Golden-square


, and am a tailor
. The prisoner was my apprentice
, and had been so for five months - on the 24th of November, I went out for half an hour, leaving him at home; when I returned he was gone - I missed a coat, a pair of spectacles, a gown, two yards of cloth, and a basket; he was taken early the next morning - he always behaved very well before.

            . I am an officer. I was on duty on the 25th of November, and saw the prisoner come down White Lion-street; I took him, and found these spectacles on him - I found this basket, which he had left at a public-house in Whitechapel, with two linen shirts in it.(Property produced and sworn to.)
GUILTY. Aged 16.

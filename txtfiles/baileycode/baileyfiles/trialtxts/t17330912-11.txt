* She and her Husband were convicted in October 1732, of paying counterfeit Money in Bartholomew Fair. He was fined two Marks, and both were to suffer three Months Imprisonment. See the Sessions Paper for that Year, Numb. VIII. page 246.
About six in the Morning the Prisoner came to the Prosecutor's Shop before it was open, to fetch a Shirt out of pawn; the Prosecutor's Servant went up for it; the Watch then lay on the Counter; when he came down she paid him and went out in a great Hurry. As soon as she was gone he miss'd the Watch, and upon Enquiry found it at another Pawnbroker's, where it was pledged by the Prisoner and her Husband.

WILLIAM JONES. I am a silk weaver
. On the 7th of May, about half-past nine o'clock in the evening, I was in Wilson-street, Finsbury-square


 - my wife was with me: a young man came by, and took my watch from my fob - he ran away in a moment; I cannot tell who it was. I gave an alarm of Stop thief! and Mr. Fisher stopped the prisoner. I saw the case of my watch, but the inside of it was gone.


                  SAMUEL 
                  JOHN FISHER
               



            . I was going up Smith-street, and heard the cry of Stop thief! I made a start immediately, and saw a gentleman before me stop the prisoner; he was running, and fell down, when he was stopped - he said, "Don't stop me, I have only broken a window;" he was taken to the watch-house. I found this watch-case on the spot where he had fallen.

            . I am a constable. I heard the cry of Stop thief! and when I came up I saw the prisoner, and took him to the watch-house. Fisher showed me this watch-case afterwards.
(Case produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I am innocent.

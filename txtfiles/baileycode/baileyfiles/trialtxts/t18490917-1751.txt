THOMAS CASTLE



, stealing 1 pair of boots, value 5s.; the goods of 



William Joseph Ingram: having been before convicted.






WILLIAM JOSEPH INGRAM
. I am a bootmaker, of Marylebone. On 25th Aug., I was at dinner—a person said something, and I ran out—Kenny beckoned to me that the prisoner was gone down William-street—I ran down

Circus-street, but I lost sight of him—I lost a pair of boots—these are them (produced).





JOSEPH KENNY
. I saw the prisoner come out of Mr. Ingram's with the boots in his hand—he turned up the New-road, down William-street, and then into York-street.

Prisoner. Q. What do you swear to me by? A. You had no coat on when you were token, but you had when you came out with the boots—I know it was you.





WILLIAM JONES
. About a quarter-past one on 25th August I saw the prisoner come across the New-road with the boots, and he threw them over the wall—I tried to stop him—his comrades came and said, "What have you to do with it?"—they struck me and gave me a knock on the jaw, and on the Sunday night afterwards they assaulted me again, and gave me the wounds which I now have on my face.

Prisoner. Q. What do you swear to me by? A. By your features—I have seen you in the New-road several times, trying to pick pockets.





ISAAC SPREADBOROUGH
 (policeman). I found these boots in the garden, over the wall.

Prisoner's Defence. I was going on an errand for my father, and heard a cry of "Stop thief!" I asked a little girl to let me go to the water-closet; I was there two or three minutes, when the policeman came; he went in the kitchen, brought out an old velveteen coat; he said, "I dare say this is his coat;" but I had had no coat on.





WILLIAM RANSLEY
 (police-sergeant, S 61.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's conviction—(read Convicted July 1848, and confined six month)—he is the person—this is the same coat he had on when I took him then. 


GUILTY
. Aged 18.—


Transported for Ten Years.

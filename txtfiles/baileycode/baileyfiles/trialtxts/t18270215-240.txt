            . I am in the employ of John Higginson, a hatter
, who lives in Crawford-street


. I saw the prisoner near the shop, about eight o'clock on Saturday evening, with this hat - it had been near the door, but inside the shop - I had seen it about half an hour before - I had been out, and on returning home. I met him running round the church with it - I stopped him with it in his hand - he had been loitering about the shop the whole evening - he had it under his arm; the shop mark was on it - he threw it down, and said he had no hat.(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I did not have it.

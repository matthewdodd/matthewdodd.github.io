            . I am in the service of John Graham, linen-draper
, of High Holborn


. About half-past four o'clock, on the 11th of October, we were uncommonly busy; I had not seen the prisoner come in, but a woman told me a woman had taken a parcel of stockings- I went to the door; the prisoner had left the shop, and was very near Great Turnstile, about a dozen doors from our shop; I stopped her, and took from her these twelve pairs of men's stockings, which are Mr. Graham's - I had put them into the window about ten o'clock; when I brought her back she said she had done it merely on purpose - I had got my property, and she was very glad of it.

            . I am an officer. I took the prisoner at the shop, and heard her say she was glad of it.

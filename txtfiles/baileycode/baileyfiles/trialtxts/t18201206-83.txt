            's bedding manufactory, on Fish-street-hill


. On the 10th of November, about half-past six, I saw the prisoner and two companions walking several times by the shop. I suspected them. In a few minutes one came into the shop and while he was there I saw the prisoner slip one of the beds out of the window, and put it on his back. I immediately laid hold of him. He dropped it and set violently upon me - the other two came to rescue him - they beat me about the body. An officer came up at the time, and seeing my face covered with blood, immediately took the prisoner into custody.

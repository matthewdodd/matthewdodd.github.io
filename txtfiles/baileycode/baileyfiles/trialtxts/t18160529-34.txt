In consequence of an alarm given me by my sevant, ringing the shop bell most violently, and calling out master; I ran down stairs, and found she had stopt the prisoner, from whose person I immediately took the coat mentioned in the indictment; she must have gone up stairs, and taken it off the landing place; she had it on her arm.

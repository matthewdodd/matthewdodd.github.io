THOMAS ALGAR
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
5th of December, 1 handkerchief, value 5s., the goods of 



Henry Tuckett, from his person.






HENRY TUCKETT
. I live in South-street, Finsbury-square. I was walking along Ratcliffe-highway, between twelve and one o'clock on the 5th of December, and felt something moving at my coat tail-pocket—I turned suddenly round, and found two young men close behind me, one of whom, the prisoner, had my handkerchief in his hand—finding he was detected, he immediately threw it away—I seized him and called "Police," and in about five minutes the beadle came forward, and I gave him into his charge—the other one ran away immediately.

Prisoner. It was not me that picked his pocket. Witness. I am certain I saw it in his hand, and he threw it away.





WILLIAM SUMMERS
. I am a beadle. The prisoner was given into,

my custody from the prosecutor, who had the handkerchief in his hand, and said the prisoner had taken it from him—I conveyed him to the station-house—he said his name was Thomas Williams, and he lived in the Commercial-road—I asked him where there—he said he did not know—I said if he was an honest lad Iwould inquire about his character—at the station-house the sergeant said his name was Algar, and he had recently come out of the House of Correction, and had been in custody five times—he afterwards said his name was Algar, and he lived in Southampton-street, Bethnal-green.
(Property produced and sworn to.)




GUILTY

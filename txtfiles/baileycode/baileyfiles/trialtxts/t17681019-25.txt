            . I was a little in liquor one night at a public-house; the publican said I abused him, and he got me into Clerkenwell Bridewell


, there I lost 6 l. there were two guineas, four half guineas, five 5 s. 3 d. pieces, and the rest in silver; I know nothing who took it, but by Tantrabobus as they call him, his confession.

            . I was servant to the deceased Mr. Stoddart, the keeper of Bridewell; I took in the prosecutor between twelve and one o'clock at night; he would not have a bed, so I put him among the others, and in the morning he complained he had lost 6 l. I found Matthews and Antrobus, who we call Tantrabobus, on the women's side; I brought them round; the prosecutor offered a guinea to any one that would help him to his money; I knowing Tantrabobus to be a thief, having robbed many since he was there, I charged him with taking it; he told me it was put into a stocking and throwed down into the cellar; we went down, and there we found two 5 s. 3 d. pieces, and half a crown; we took the prisoners before Justice Welch, there Tantrabobus owned he picked the man's pocket, and gave it to Matthews in his hammock; Matthews owned he had two 5 s. 3 d. pieces handed up by Tantrabobus, (13 s. 3 d. produced in court.)
Prosecutor. Here is one 5 s. 3 d. piece I can swear to be my property.
Antrobus's defence.
I was threatened to be chained down if I would not tell, so I did tell.

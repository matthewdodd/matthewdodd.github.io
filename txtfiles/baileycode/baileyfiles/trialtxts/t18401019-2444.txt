EDWARD M'DONALD
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
16th of September, 1 ring, value 3l. 15s., the goods of 



John Henry Bradley.






JOHN HENRY BRADLEY
. I am a jeweller, and live in Great Russell-street. On Wednesday evening, the 16th of September, a gentleman who

had ordered some rings came and selected one of them—while he was there the prisoner came in and requested to see a pencil-case—I showed him some—he leaned over the counter and nearly covered it—the gentleman went back from the counter, and while his back was turned, the prisoner requested to see some other pencil-cases—I snowed him some others—he then left the shop in a hurried manner—I then had the gas lighted, and the gentleman requested to see the other rings, that he might see how they looked by candle light—I then missed one ring—I heard no more of it till I saw in the newspaper that the prisoner was taken—I went to the office with the gentleman who had been in my shop, and we identified him—this is the ring I missed—(looking at it)—I am quite sure the prisoner is the person who was in my shop.





BENJAMIN BULLEN
. I am shopman to a jeweller in Holborn. On the 17th of September, the prisoner came and asked me to show him some gold seals—I laid a tray of them before him—he looked at several, and asked for one with "Fidelity" engraved on it—I said I had not got one, but I would get one and wait on him with it in the morning—he gave me an address in Hatton-garden—I saw something in his hand, and gave him in charge—the ring produced and a gold pencil-case were found on him.





JOHN ARMSTRONG
 (City police-constable, No. 211.) I took the prisoner, and found the ring produced on his finger.

Prisoner. I hope you will show me mercy.

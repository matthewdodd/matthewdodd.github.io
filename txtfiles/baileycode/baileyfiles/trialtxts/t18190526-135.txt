LEPMAN POLACK. I am a tailor
, and live in Mansell-street, Goodman's-fields


. On the 25th of May the prisoner came to my house, and asked for some clothes for Mr. Jacobs; my sister called me down - I told him to send Mr. Jacobs himself for them. About three-quarters of an hour after he was gone I received information, and then missed the table-spoon off the beaufet. I went to a coffee-shop in Church-street with an officer, took him into custody, and asked him for the spoon; he said he gave it to Jacobs - he then pulled it out of his breeches-pocket.

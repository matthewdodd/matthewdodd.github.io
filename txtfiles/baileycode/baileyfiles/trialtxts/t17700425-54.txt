            . I am a gangs-man at Fresh-wharf. I saw the prisoner on the Keys, (I do not recollect the day.) I had some business out; on my return I met the prisoner in Thames-street, coming out of Summer's-key gateway. The street-keeper was by; I gave him charge of the prisoner. I found a large pocket of sugar upon him; I believe there were ten or a dozen pounds of it. There was a hogshead of sugar, with the head out, upon the key. (The sugar produced in court.)
Mr. Fleming. I am one of the street-keepers. Mr. Burch gave me charge of the prisoner. I lifted up his apron; there he had this sugar in a pocket.
Burch. I believe the prisoner has got his bread in this pilfering way these ten years.
Prisoner's Defence.
I saw other people pick up sugar; so I picked some up.

Elizabeth Smith. I belong to Sir Charles Buck. We missed several things at the fire in Glass-house-street


. I missed a gold ring, a black sattin gown flowered with colours. The ring was Sir Charles's, the gown my own.
Q. Did you ever see them, or either of them, since you missed them?
E. Smith. I saw them again at justice Fielding's. I cannot swear to the ring, I believe it to be Sir Charles's property.
Jane Barker. I bought a gown sprigged with flowers, and a capuchin, of the prisoner at the bar.
Q. When?
J. Barker. I cannot say to the day.
Q. How long ago?
J. Barker. It may be near a fortnight ago?
Q. Was it since the fire in Glass-house-street?
J Barker. It was since that. [A gown produced in court.] This is the gown.
Q. to E. Smith. Look at that gown. Do you know it?
E. Smith. This is my property, the same I lost at the fire.
Q. Did you know the prisoner before?
J. Barker. I don't know that ever I saw him before?
Q. Do you deal in such things?
J. Barker. I deal in buying and selling of cloaths. The prisoner lived within four doors of us. I knew his wife, but not him.
Q. Was you before justice Fielding with him?
J. Barker. I was.
Q. What did he say there?
J Barker. He said a man gave them him in a bundle at the corner of Saville row.
James Mortimore. I am a constable. When I took the prisoner he denied the fact.
Q. Where did you take him?
Mortimore. I took him in Leicester-fields.
Q. What is he?
Mortimore. He is a chairman.
Q. Did you search him?
Mortimore. I did. I found nothing at all upon him. I carried him before justice Fielding. [He produced a gold ring.] I had this ring from Mrs. Barker.

Q. to Mrs. Barker. Did you deliver this ring to the constable?
J. Barker. I did.
Q. Where had you it?
J. Barker. I had it of the prisoner's wife. The prisoner said he knew nothing of the ring when I produced it before the justice.
Prisoner's defence.
I carried a lady home one night, and picked up this bundle in the street, and the very next morning I sold that gown to this woman. I did not know what was in the bundle, till I opened it, no more than the man in the moon.
For the Prisoner.
William Smith. I have known the prisoner 15 years.
Q. What is his general character?
Smith. I never knew any harm by him.
Moses Oates. I have known him five years.
Q. What is his character?
Oates. An honest industrious man as ever lived.
Daniel Burr. I have known him some time. I never knew any ill of him.
John Lion. I have known him between 10 and 11 years. My lady Cooper uses my house. He has carried her some years.
Richard Bourn. I have known him 15 years. He lodged with me.
Q. What has been his behaviour?
Bourn. I never knew any thing of him but what was just and honest. He was so to me.
James Dove. I have known him five years.
Q. What has been his character?
Dove. I never heard any ill of him in my lifetime.
A witness. I have known him seven years. He carries several people of quality. I know nothing of him but what is just and honest.
John Goodwin. I am his brother. I never knew any thing of him besides that of an honest character. How this came I cannot tell.

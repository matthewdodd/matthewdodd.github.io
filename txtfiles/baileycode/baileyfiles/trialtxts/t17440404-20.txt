            . The Prisoner was my lodger. On the 10th of March, about eight o'clock in the morning, news was brought me that I was robbed. When I found in what manner, I said to the Prisoner, it cannot be a stranger that has done this; it must be you, or through your occasion. She said, she wondered I should say so, for her honesty was never questioned; and she declared she did not do it. She went out of my house, and was dogged into a pawnbroker's shop, at the Hand and Lock of Hair in Shoe-lane. She came back again afterwards, and still said, she had nothing of mine. Then I said I must charge a Constable with her. One Mr. Wilson said, it does not signify any thing talking, for I saw you go into a pawnbroker's, and I know some of the goods. Then she fell a crying, and bid me put my hand into her pocket, and take out the key of her room, and I should find a great many of the things. The Constable pushed me away, and said, she should give me the key herself. She said the things were under her bed; and accordingly I found part of the goods there, and part at Mr. Sheldon's, the pawnbroker. I found my daughter's mantelet, and several other things, at Mr. Weyburne's, the Five Roses in Shoe-lane. And before my Lord Mayor she cried, and owned the fact.

            , the Constable, proved the finding some of the goods under her bed, some at Mr. Sheldon's, and some at Mr. Weyburne's.

THOMAS PRYCE JONES
. I live in Tothill-street, Westminster. I saw these four handkerchiefs hanging inside my shop, on the 18th of March, about half-past eleven o'clock at night—between that and twelve o'clock the policeman came in, and asked if I had lost any thing—I said "very likely, "as I had seen a man run very quickly out of the shop—I described his dress to the policeman—he had a jacket, a white apron, and a cap on—these four handkerchiefs are mine—they have my tickets on the corner.

Prisoner. Q. Did you see me in the shop? A. Yes, you had been in the shop, and brought a duplicate to me—I said it did not belong to us.





RICHARD COLLARD
 (police-constable B 110.) About half-past eleven o'clock that night I saw the prisoner in New Tothill-street, about two hundred yards from the prosecutors—he had a jacket, a cap, and while apron on—he had something in his side—I asked what he had got there—he said, silk handkerchiefs, that he was going to pawn, and 1 found there four handkerchiefs, which he said he found in the street.

Prisoner. I ran up against him, as I was going to get a shawl—I asked him which was Mr. Williams, the pawnbroker's—I had been drinking that afternoon—I said I had got some silk handkerchiefs which I bad just picked up.





RICHARD COLLARD
. I produce the certificate of the prisoner's former conviction from Mr. Gillbee's office at Westminster—(read)—the prisoner it the person.

            . I live at the Nelson's Head. On the 23d of March, about half-past ten o'clock at night, I was in the parlour, and saw the prisoner coming out of the bar - he turned by the counter; I went and looked at the till - that was all right; I did not think of the coat till the prosecutor applied for it.

            . I took the prisoner, and found the duplicate on him.
Prisoner's Defence. I never took the coat; I met a man who asked me to pawn it for him, as he did not like to go into a pawnbroker's; and he gave me the ticket.

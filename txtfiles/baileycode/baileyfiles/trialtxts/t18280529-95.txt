CHARLES WOODCOCK. I am a groom
 and valet
, and live in Little Marlborough-street. I lost my handkerchief from my coat pocket at the corner of Sackville-street, Piccadilly


, between five and six o'clock in the evening of Friday last; I did not feel it taken, but the officer asked if I had lost anything: I felt, and missed my handkerchief - I saw the officer take it from under the prisoner's apron; he was then about two yards from me.(Property produced and sworn to.)

            . I am an officer. I was passing Piccadilly, and saw the prosecutor looking at the caricature shop; the prisoner was close behind him - he attempted to pick his pocket two or three times, but failed; at last he got the handkerchief, and put it under his apron; I took him, and spoke to the prosecutor.

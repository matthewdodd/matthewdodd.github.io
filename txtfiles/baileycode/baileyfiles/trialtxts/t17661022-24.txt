            . I am a relation to Mr. Squibb, where I live; I lost a silk petticoat out of the chamber where I lie; the prisoner lived at the next door.

            . On the 6th of September I saw the prisoner get out at her own window, and go in at the gariet window belonging to Mr. Squibb; she continued there about half a minute, and returned to her own room again, with some things in her apron; just as she was getting out she let it fall on the leads, but I did not know what it was; I went over and acquainted the people with what I had seen, and upon searching, they said they missed a silk petticoat; upon which the prisoner was taken up.

             I am servant to Mr. Hill, in Castle-street, a pawnbroker; the prisoner pledged this petticoat with me on the 6th of September, between nine and ten o'clock, for 7 s. (produced and deposed to by prosecutrix.)
Prisoner's defence.
I leave it to the mercy of the court.

            . On Whitsun Tuesday morning I missed eleven globe lamps from Spitalfields where I contract for lighting them; I had often seen the prisoner about with my men, and suspected him long before.

            . On Whitsun Tuesday in the morning, I was called up and shewed three globe lamps; I knew them to belong to the prosecutor; I put the rims on them for the prosecutor, (produced in court.)

            . I am a watchman; I stopped the prisoner with these lamps in Monmouth-street on Whitsun Tuesday in the morning; he offered me a shilling rather than be carried to the watch-house; he had a burner on his finger, one side of it was alight; before we got to the watch-house, he offered me a crown to let him go.
Prisoner's defence.
I had been drinking with my father and mother, uncle and aunt, and coming home about a quarter after one I found these three lamps, and knowing whose they were, I intended to give them to the prosecutor.
He called three witnesses, who said he was a journeyman weaver
, and that they knew no harm of him.

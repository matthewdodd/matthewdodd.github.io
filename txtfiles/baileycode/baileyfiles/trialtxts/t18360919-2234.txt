JOHN POVEY
 was indicted

for embezzlement.






NATHANIEL FREDERICK OKEY
. I keep the Hero of Waterloo, Waterloo-road. The prisoner was my pot-boy—I sent him, on the 3rd of September to Messrs. Cotton and Allen, in Cornwall-road, for an account, amounting to 11s. 4d.—he never returned, and has never paid it to me.





THOMAS EDWARDS
. I am clerk to Cotton and Allen, of Cornwall-road, iron-founders. On Saturday, the 3rd of September, I paid the prisoner 11s. 4d. for his master, Mr. Okey.

Prisoner. I took the money and made use of a small portion—I had some money owing to me—I could not get it on Saturday or Sunday, but I should have got it on Tuesday.





GEORGE WILSON
 (police-constable L 162.) I took the prisoner on the 6th of September, and asked him if he knew Mr. Okey—as we were going along, he said, "It was only 11s. 4d.; that I took."

Guilty.

(The indictment also charged a previous conviction.)





THOMAS EDWARDS
 (police-constable L 31.) I produce the certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from the office—(read) the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 17.—


Transported for Seven Years.

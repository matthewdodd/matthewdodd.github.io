            . I am son to

                  Martin 
               



            : I can only swear to the goods being my father's property: I know nothing of the time when they were lost.


                  Alice 
                  Ripley 
               



            . I was housekeeper to Lady Doddington Montague, in Grosvenor-square; the prisoner was a servant there. About the latter end of September, or the beginning of October, the cook called me up stairs, and shewed me the goods mentioned in the indictment; they were found in the prisoner's possession in his box in his room: she desired I would not tell the prisoner how I came to see them, but desired I would talk to him when he came in: when he came in I asked him if he had any acquaintance in that branch of business; he said he had.
Q. Did any body lie in that room beside the prisoner?
A. Ripley. No: I told him there had been a person to enquire if I had seen such sort of things, and I had searched his room and saw such things, and desired he would give me an account how he came by them: he told me part of them he had taken from out of a house where he had lived, and part of them were given him by another man, named John.
Q. Did he mention what house?
A. Ripley. No, he did not; upon that I told him they were very bad things to be seen on such a person, and in time he might come into trouble. I bid him carry them back again the next morning, for I would not suffer stolen goods to be in the house: I thought he had taken them away, he told me afterwards that he had: I did not know that he had them by him, till the day he was taken up: my lady's cook came and said he had behaved in a very bad manner, and used me very ill to my lady; and that he had charged the servants, on the peril of their lives, never to let me see my lady, if he was gone out, (I had married and was gone away). I asked her if she knew any thing of the things that we had seen before; she said they were in the house: upon that I went to my lady's house, and the prisoner opened the door to me: I asked to see my lady; he said I could not see her: I said, I should insist upon seeing her: he went in and told my lady I was there. I went in to her, she was angry with me: I said, if I had deceived her in any thing it was concerning the prisoner, and I was there to answer for what accusations might be laid against me: we had a great deal of debate. I told her what things I had seen upon him, and that I believed they were still in the house; the house was searched, and they could not be found. My lady bid me go down with the servant; I went: I observed him with a bundle, which he was taking out of a closet: I took the bundle out of his hand; there were the things that were mentioned in the indictment, with other things: I carried them up stairs, and shewed them to my lady; my husband was with me. My lady ordered him to fetch a constable, and take the prisoner up. We gave charge of him to the constable, and the goods were delivered into his care, we went all together to Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            's: when in the coach, he told us the goods belonged to Mr. Martin: Sir John sent for Mr. Martin; Mrs. Martin came, with others; they owned the goods. When he was re-examined, two days after, Mr. 
               
                  Joshua 
                  Martin 
               



             swore to the things, as his father's property.


                  John 
                  Sutton 
               



            . I am an officer: I was sent for to my Lady Doddington Montague's, to take the prisoner in custody: I asked him if he had any accomplice; he said there was a young man (he did not know where to find him); he said that man had given him some of the things. When he came before Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            , we found that man was Sir John's servant; that servant was examined, and it was proved, before Sir John, that that man had no concern in it. As we were going in the coach, the prisoner told us he brought part of these things from the place where he had lived servant, and part of them were given him; that he brought them all out of his master's house: he desired Mrs. Ripley to be as favourable as possible with him. (The goods mentioned in the indictment produced in court.)

                  Martin 
               



            . These things are all my father's property.
Q. Did such a man, as has been mentioned, live servant in your house, named John?
J. Martin. Yes; he lived in our house twelve months, or more; he wanted to go down into Cheshire, and the prisoner was in his place the time he was absent, which was about three weeks; when John came up again the prisoner was discharged, and we recommended the prisoner to a place afterwards: that John went away, and now lives with Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding

Prisoner's Defence.
I did not steal the things: I received them in part of a little money that I lent: I did not know they were stolen.

PHILIP JONES. I am a Policeman. I was on duty on the 12th of February, near the Three Colts, Grove-street, Hackney - I saw the prisoner with a pig-trough under his arm; I asked where he got it - he said he bought it of a baker, for 2s., on the Saturday night - I said I was not altogether satisfied; and in taking him to the station, he said it was of no use telling me lies, that he found it in the field.

            . I live in Wick-lane, Hackney


, and am a market-gardener
. This trough is mine; I can swear to it by the two ends - I had seen it safe about five o'clock on the Saturday evening, and it was taken before seven the next morning - the prisoner was taken about one hundred and fifty yards from my house.
Prisoner's Defence. I honestly picked it up in the field, about half-past six o'clock in the morning - it was laying down by a bit of cow dung.

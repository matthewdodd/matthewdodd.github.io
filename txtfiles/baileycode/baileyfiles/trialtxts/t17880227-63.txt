             sworn.
I am the son of 
               
                  James
                   Caney
               



            ; on the 18th of January, I was informed the lead was gone from my father's houses.

                   NEWELL
               



             sworn.
On the 18th of January I came home about six o'clock in the evening, I heard a noise in an empty house adjoining, and saw the shutters open; I got a light, I found the door open, I went up stairs; when I got to the garret, I found the roof broke, big enough for a man to go through; when I got out at the top of the house my candle went out; I saw a man behind the chimney hiding himself, he went over the tops of the houses, and got clear off; the people in the street hallooed out shoot them, shoot them; Colly and Hayes came to where I stood, and said they would resign themselves, and desired me not to use them ill; I told them I would not hurt them, they would hurt themselves by coming there; they said they had no father, and no money to pay their lodging; that seeing this house open, they came in to lay there; I saw the lead piled in heaps in the gutter, it was light enough to see them; the moon shone very bright.
(James Miller confirmed the last witness as to the taking Colly and Hayes.)


                  JOHN
                   SHEFFIELD
               



             sworn.
I live in an alley adjoining, I heard the alarm; I saw Hunt slide the tiles upon his backside, and come upon the wash-house of my house; he ran along a brick wall, and jumped over some pales into the next yard; I jumped over after him and took him; he said he was no thief.



                  SAMUEL
                   CROMARTIE
               



             sworn.
On Friday evening I heard the alarm, I went up stairs with Miller and Newell, and apprehended Colly and Hayes; there were three or four parcels of lead rolled up; I carried part of it to the Justice's, I did not examine the place it was taken from.
To Caney. Did you see this lead? - The first time I saw it was at Justice Staples's office, I tried them upon the gutter, and they fitted exactly, it weighed one hundred and fifty pounds, it was a gutter, and run the length of four houses.
HAYES's DEFENCE.
My father and mother had been quarrelling, and I could not bear to stay at home to see that; I met with these other prisoners, and we went into this house to sleep.
The other prisoners did not say any thing in their defence.
Hayes called one witness, Hunt called five witnesses, and Colly called two witnesses, who gave them very good characters.
ALL THREE, 

               GUILTY
            .






               Transported for seven years
            .
Tried by the first Middlesex Jury before Mr. RECORDER.

            . I am wife of

            ; I live at No 80, in Wood-street


. I lost my hat on the 10th of July from off the counter. The prisoner came into my shop to buy a petticoat; my child called me down; after she was gone I missed the hat; I called her back again; I said come in; if the petticoat fits, you and I may agree for it. I found the hat concealed under her apron, pinn'd to her petticoat, (the hat produced and deposed to.) It was a new one, but not trimmed; this was one of the three that lay on the counter.
The prisoner in her defence said, she sells things in the market; that a woman who lived with her gave her the hat to carry home for her, and as there was no ribbon to it she pinned it under her apron for fear she should soil it.
Prosecutor. When I took it from under her apron, she said we put it there.

JAMES OSBORNE
 was indicted

 for stealing 8lbs. weight of pork, value 2s., the goods of

Prisoner. I was walking down the street; he collared me, and said, "You have got my pig's head;" he took me a little way, and found it in a bag.

Witness. He had put it into a bag; he was running, and dropped it at his feet.





JOHN BRADDICK
 (police-constable R 64.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person.

1533. 




HENRY WHITEHAND
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
15th of June, 2 yards of carpet, value 6s., the goods of 



Henry Garrett.






HENRY GARRETT
. I am a publican, and live in South Molton-street. I had this carpet safe on a pair of steps which go down to my cellar in my yard at twelve o'clock at night, on the 15th of June—a person could get to my yard without going through the house, by getting over the wall, which I think they did—I missed the carpet about seven o'clock the next morning—I had seen the prisoner—I found the carpet afterwards sold at an old rag shop—this is it—it is very old—there are two yards of it.





THOMAS LANE
. I keep a marine store-shop. I bought this carpet of the prisoner, I think, but I cannot positively swear to him—I have not much doubt of it—we buy it by the pound—there was five pounds of it—we gave him 2 1/2 d. for it—that is at the rate of 4s. 8d. a cwt., and I get but 5s.





ROBERT THEOBALD
. I live with the prosecutor. I came down that morning about a quarter to six o'clock, and on going into the cellar to shift the ashes, I saw the steps were moved, and the carpet was gone—I met the prisoner in Oxford-street, with the carpet under his arm, about ten o'clock the same morning—it was in a handkerchief under his arm, and a bit hanging out—I saw him go into a marine store-shop—I knew him, as he lived at the back of our house.

Prisoner. I know nothing of the carpet.




GUILTY
. Aged 19.—


Transported for Seven Years.

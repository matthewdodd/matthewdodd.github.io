EDMUND VENIS
. I live in St. Ann's-lane. About five o'clock in the evening of the 21st of February, I left my shop to get some coals—I returned to the top of the stairs in half a minute, and saw the prisoner with a jar under his left arm, going out of my door—he looked round at me, got out, and ran—I pursued about ten yards, and he then threw down the honey-pot on the pavement—I did not stop to pick it up, but followed him on to Carey-lane, where the policeman took him—some man took up the honey-pot—it was broken—I put the honey into another pot—this is it—I missed the honey-pot from my shop.





CHARLES CRUTCHER
 (City police-constable, No, 327.) I took the prisoner back to the shop—the honey was there—the pot was broken.

Prisoner. I had been looking after a place, and as I was going down the street the policeman took me—it was not me that had the pot.





EDMUND VENIS
. I am certain he is the person—I never lost sight of him for a moment—I saw him with it, and he threw it down.

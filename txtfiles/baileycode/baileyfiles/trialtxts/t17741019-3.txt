            . I live in Marsham-street, Westminster. On the 26th of August, coming from Ham, between eleven and twelve o'clock at night, in a coach, in company with Mr. Jackson, a clergyman, and two other gentlemen; all four in the coach in the broad part of Turnham Green



; we had heard before we came there of a robbery that night in Gunnersbury lane; having arms we determined not to be robbed; at the broad part of Turnham Green, Mr. Jackson observed a couple of fellows there; he asked Mr. Churchill what he thought of those fellows; he replied that they looked very suspicious; while we were talking in that manner one of the men rushed out from behind some trees; upon which Mr. Jackson repeatedly told him he would fire at him if he did not keep off; I looked out on the other side and saw another man running after the coach; upon which I told him if he did not desist, I would shoot at him; still he kept running on till he came within about fifteen yards of the coach; I believe that man that ran after the coach was 
               
                  James
                   Knight
               



            ; but I cannot be positive as to his person, but am positive to his size, and can swear to the clothes he was in at Sir 
               
                  John
                   Fielding
               



            's; I fired at him, and this man, whom I took to be Knight, put himself in a posture of firing, but I saw no weapon that he had at that time.

                   Jackson
               



            . I was in the coach on Friday evening, the 26th of August last, with the other gentlemen; this happened between eleven and twelve o'clock at night, at Turnham Green, between two houses that have each the sign of the Pack Horse. I sat back on the right hand; Mr. Churchill on my left hand; there is in that place a row of trees railed from the common road that are before some houses; just at the corner of the rail, to the best of my belief, stood 
               
                  James
                   Knight
               



            ; but I cannot positively say it was him; he is of the same size and had the same clothes when I saw him at Sir 
               
                  John
                   Fielding
               



            's that the man had at that time, but I cannot be positive to the person of the man; I asked Mr. Churchill what he thought of that fellow; seeing him there, he replied he thought he looked very suspicious, and then this man ran a-cross the road to the other side of the coach; he said nothing at that time, nor did I see any weapon that he had; when we came about twenty yards further, another man rushed out, who I believe to be Tomlin; he kept on our side of the coach; upon which I leaned out of the door, presented my pistol at him, and threatened to fire if he did not keep off; still he continued to pursue us, apparently with a design to reach the coach door, but before he could get so far as that, he put his hand to his breast, and took out a pistol, which he presented and fired. I am pretty sure that Tomlin is the man: I can speak much more positively to him than to Knight. It was a moon light night; I leaned out of the coach with the pistol in my hand, and kept looking at him; therefore I am more positive to his person than I can be to Knight. Upon his fireing I opened the coach door and jumped out, and Mr. Churchill followed me, and pursued the fellows; but they went off by a bye path, which I since find goes to Acton Common, and escaped. These two prisoners were afterwards brought to Sir 
               
                  John
                   Fielding
               



            's, among other men brought there under different accusations; they were in the same clothes, or clothes exceedingly like the clothes they had when this attempt was made upon us; I charged them both, being very sure of Tomlin, but not quite so sure of Knight; when I saw them at Turnham Green, the two men did not appear to be connected together, or be in company with each other; possibly they might be, but I cannot say they were, and neither of them spoke a word.
Knight's Defence.
I lay at Dartford on Saturday and Sunday night, with an acquaintance; on the next night he and I came five miles to an old fellow servant's on the road; there we lay on Tuesday night; on Wednesday night I lay at Kent-street; we both lay at the Bull at Kent-street end on the Tuesday and Wednesday night. I went to the White Bear in Piccadilly, there I had my things directed to the Ship at Turnham Green, in order to go down to see my friends; going along Piccadilly I met a young woman and a young fellow; she picked me up; I went with her to Kensington; there two young fellows came after me; one struck me; in the mean time Tomlin came up to me; I said I could not stand as there were two men against me; I asked Tomlin to hold my clothes; I charged the watch with them; when the watch came to Tomlin, I found Tomlin had a pistol in his pocket; I said to the men I had business in the country, I would depart and make it up; Tomlin said he had a pistol in his pocket, he would stop a coach; between the Adam and Eve at the turnpike, came a coach, which he was going to rob, but I catched the pistol out of his hand; when I came to Hammersmith, there was a light in the road; we went into a house; I told the landlord there was a man upon the highway, and insisted upon his aiding and assisting me; Tomlin then said I was confederate with him; the landlord asked him if he knew me; he said he knew nothing of me.
Tomlin's Defence.
The first acquaintance I had with this man was at the Adam and Eve; he was quarrelling with two men there; I was coming by at the same time; he said, young man hold my clothes while I fight these two men; I held his clothes; after the quarrel was over, he said he would treat me for my civility; as we were walking along I saw a pistol in his pocket; I said what have you here; he took it out of his pocket and shewed it me; I said it does not belong to me, I will not meddle with it; we went into the White Bear; he had the pistol in his hand; I followed him; the landlord came in directly; the landlord saw the pistol, and snatched it out of his hand.

            . I am the prisoner's father: my son drives a post chaise

Tomlin called several witnesses, who gave him a good character.

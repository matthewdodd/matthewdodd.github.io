            . I am in partnership with George William Erck, we are tailor

s, and live in Henrietta-street, Covent-garden


, the prisoner was our errand-boy
. On Saturday evening, the 6th of June, about seven o'clock, I put the 1l. note, with others, in a drawer in a private room - I returned home about half-past ten and missed it. I had just sent him home. I went to his father's, and found he had not got home. I found him under the Piazza in Covent-garden, just as the Theatre was over, and charged him with taking the note, which he denied several times - I took him to the watch-house. On searching him, he gave up 15s., which he said was part of it, and said he was very sorry for having taken it. It was No. 56,456.

            . I am the wife of Charles Manicom. On the 27th of March, I lost a gown from behind the bedroom door - I missed it on the Sunday morning, when I went to put it on; I had hung it there on the Saturday - the prisoner chared for a person on the first floor; this is my gown.

            . I am a pawnbroker. I took in this gown on the Saturday evening from the prisoner, I am almost certain; I gave this duplicate for it.
SUSAN MANICOM. When the prisoner was taken she said she had pawned it in Berwick-street, and the duplicate was in her drawer - my husband went and got it.

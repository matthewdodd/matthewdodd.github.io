            . I am a tailor

. Marran ran into the shop and alarmed me; I missed these trowsers, which hung at the door two minutes before. I pursued the prisoner, and took him in Ironmonger-lane - he threw them from under his arm as I secured him.

            . I am servant to Mr. Wilson, of Cornhill. About seven o'clock in the evening I saw the prisoner, with his companion, looking in at the prosecutor's window. I watched, and saw his companion go in at the door, pull the trowsers off the nail, let them fall on the ground and run off; the prisoner ran and picked them up. I went in and told Roberts, then followed and saw him taken with them in the Old Jewry.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I was going to buy a pair of shoes - came by this shop, and close to the wall saw something laying down - picked them up, held them in my hands - nobody owned them. Roberts came and almost strangled me, and said.
"Where are my trowsers, you rascal?" I said,
"If they are yours, there they are."

JAMES HENSHAW. I am a licensed victualler
. The prisoner is my wife's brother, and served behind my counter
 - but at the time of the robbery, he was only living in the house, till something could be done for him. I missed a coral necklace on the 6th of October - I had seen it in the dressing table-drawer, in the bed-room, three or four days before.

            . I am an officer of Marlborough-street. I apprehended the prisoner; he said, that he and another boy took it, but the other boy got it pawned, and the duplicate was sold. I went to the pawnbroker's, and found it there.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

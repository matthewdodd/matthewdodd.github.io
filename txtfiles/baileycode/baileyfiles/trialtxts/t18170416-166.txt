            ; we are corn and coal-merchants

. The prisoner was our servant
. On the 24th of February, I missed two sacks, and some barley-meal. I went, with an officer, to Burket's shop, in Old Gravel-lane, and found the barley-meal, and one of the sacks, hid under the prisoner's bed, and the other in the cellar-it had some barley-meal in it.

            . I am a chip-hat dyer
, and live in Aldersgate-street. The prisoner was in my employ for eighteen months, as a journeyman
; he was to give me an account of what he had received, and I entered it in the book.

            . I am a customer of the prosecutor's. I paid the prisoner on his account, on the 14th of July, 13s. 4d.; on the 23rd of July, 10s. 5d., and on the 28th, 7s.; he gave me these receipts for them.
MR. LOVELL. I spoke to the prisoner several times about these accounts; he sometimes said Mr. Lacy was out of town, at other times, if I would send a stamped receipt it would be paid, but I never received the money - I gave him in charge in November; he begged me not to prosecute him, that it would be his ruin, and he knew I could transport him; we were then talking of the sums of money which he had received and not accounted for.

               Transported for Seven Years
            .
There were two other indictments against the prisoner.

            . I live in Scotland-Yard


, the prisoner was with me six or seven weeks before she went away, then she took the key with her; the room was let to her, her husband she said was in Jamaica. I opened the door, and missed the goods mentioned. She was taken in less than a fortnight; when taken she told me where the things were pawned and sold, and that she took them in the morning before I was up; we went as she directed, and found some of the things. [produced in court, and deposed to.]

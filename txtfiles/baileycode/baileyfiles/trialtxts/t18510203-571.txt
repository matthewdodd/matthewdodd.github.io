, and 




ELLEN ROACH



, stealing 1 brooch, 1 ring, value 4l., and 12 sixpences; the property of 



Hannah Roberts, the mistress of 



Eliza Roach.—2nd COUNT, Ellen receiving.






HANNAH ROBERTS
. I am single, and am a dressmaker, at 48, King-street, Soho-square. I took Eliza Roach into my service on 29th Oct.; she left on the 30th—she did not say she was going—I missed a brooch, a ring, and 12s. 6d. in money, which I bad seen safe in a drawer five minutes before she went—I have since received the brooch and ring from Jones—they are my property.





EDWARD HENRY JONES
. I am assistant to Messrs. Barker's, pawn-brokers, of Hounsditch. On 30th Oct., the prisoner Ellen brought this brooch and ring and asked 5s. on them—I asked if they were her own—she said no, she brought them from a Mrs. Hinds, of Hounsditch—I asked if she bad any objection to get a note to prove it was correct—she left the property, and went to get one, and never came back—there was a girl with her; I cannot say whether it was Eliza.





JAMES WESTMORELAND
 (policeman, C 27). I took Ellen on 14th Jan. and told her the charge—she was so drunk she could not answer.

Eliza's Defence. I took the things, and met a woman who I asked to come with me and pawn them; it was not my mother.

Ellen's Defence. I wrote to the lady, informing her where her property was.

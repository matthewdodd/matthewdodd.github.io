            . On Tuesday, the 9th of November, about four o'clock, I was going along Cheapside


, and felt as if some person was pulling my watch out of my pocket - I turned round, and saw it in the hands of the prisoner; he let it fall on the pavement. I immediately took hold of him with one hand, and picked it up with the other. I took him across the street into a shop - two gentlemen came in, and we took him to the watch-house.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I was coming through a mob in Queen-street, and saw a crowd round the prosecutor, he was speaking to some women. I said,
"Take care, or you will lose something." At that moment the watch fell, and he took hold of me. He said he could not say he saw it in my hand, and if it was not me it was somebody else.

             re-examined. I never said so. He asked me if I could swear he took it? I said I could not, but I could swear it was in his hand.



               GUILTY

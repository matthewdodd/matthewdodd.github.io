THOMAS RUSSELL
. I am master of the Friends schooner, lying at Bede's-wharf, Surrey—I had watch-guard, two keys, and a ribbon—on Wednesday evening, the 15th, I had it in my hand—about eleven o'clock. at night I put it into my drawer—the following morning it was gone—this now produced is it.





JOHN PHILLIPS
. I am a watchman—I was walking on this wharf—I met the prisoner between one and two o'clock on Thursday morning, the 16th—I stopped him, and asked how he came there—he made some altercation, and said he belonged to a Gainsborough vessel that was then come up—I said, "You have no business here, they do not come here"—he said, "They come to Hazel-wharf"—I let him go—when I came down to the wharf at eleven that night, the prosecutor asked me if I had seen any strangers, and said he had lost his watch—then I told him.

Prisoner. Can you swear I came through your wharf that morning? Witness. Undoubtedly I can.





ROBERT ELSTON
 (police-constable M 28.) I found the prisoner in a public-house in Morgan's-lane—he had a duplicate of the watch in his hand—I traced the watch—this is it.





FREDERICK BRUCE
. I took the watch in pledge of the prisoner.

Prisoner's Defence. This is my own watch; I bought it last Tuesday morning in Thames-street, of a sailor; I was not on the wharf.





THOMAS RUSSELL

re-examined. I bought this key which was attached to it, two months ago in Guernsey.

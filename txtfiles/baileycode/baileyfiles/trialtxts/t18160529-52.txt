            . I am a traveller to Fairs

            . I am an officer. I was at Brook-green Fair. I saw the prisoner attempt a number of pockets; but without success; he had a great coat thrown loosely across his right arm; he made a drive in among the stalls, and went up to the prosecutor; he stood there for the space of five minutes, and then took a piece of ribbon with his right hand, and put it into his jacket lining, and went away. He came back again, and took another piece, and the handkerchief, and we followed him until he got through the thickest part of the Fair, and then apprehended him, and found the property on him.

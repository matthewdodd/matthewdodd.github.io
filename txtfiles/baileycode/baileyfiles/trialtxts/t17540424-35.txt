                  Mary
                   Merrit Slipper
               



            . I live in Kingsland Road, and am a pawnbroker. I was sitting by my fireside in the kitchen, and hearing a noise turned about and saw an arm reaching cross the counter. My child said, Mamma, mamma, there is a woman reaching two gowns with a long iron fork. I saw a woman go out with something under her arm. I ran to the door and saw the prisoner go in at Mr. Martin's, a publick house next door to me but two. I called her; she went in, and after some time she came to me. I told her she had taken two gowns from me, she said I might search her. We found one of the gowns in Mr. Martin's house of office about a quarter of an hour after this. The other we did not find.
Q. Are you sure you had these gowns in your shop that day?
Slipper. I am sure I had just before I missed them :


                  John 
                  Martin 
               



            . On the 16th of March the prisoner came into my house, and ran back into the yard. There was nobody in our house but the prisoner and her sister between that time and the finding of the gown.
Q. How long did the prisoner stay when she went into your yard?
Martin. She staid about as long as is common for persons in the necessary house, and the prosecutrix was in my house before she returned. The prisoner was then in the yard.
Q. What is the prisoner?
Martin. She lives about 100 yards from me. I never knew any business she followed. I saw her and her sister straitening an iron fork at my fire just before the prisoner went out.
Q. How long was that fork?
Martin. It was about as long as my arm. After she had streightened the tines of it, the sister said to her, here go along, you bitch, it will do; then she went out with it; the sister never went out of my house, only into the yard.
Q. to prosecutrix. Whose gown did you find?
Prosecutrix. That was the property of 
               
                  Ann 
                  Shaw 
               



            , I took it in as a pledge.


                  Ann 
                  Shaw 
               



            . I had pawned a gown to Mrs. Slipper, and it was stolen away. [Produced in court by 
               
                  John 
                  Tompson 
               



             the constable, and deposed to by 
               
                  Ann 
                  Shaw 
               



            ; also the prosecutrix deposed she had taken it in as a pledge of 
               
                  Ann 
                  Shaw 
               



            .


                  Jane 
                  Fitzgerald 
               



            . I saw the prisoner and her sister in Mr. Martin's yard at that time, and I went to look in the necessary-house, as Mr. Martin said, if the gowns were any where in the yard, they must be there. I took this gown, here produced, from under the seat there.
Q. Did you see the prisoner in the necessary-house ?
Fitzgerald. No, I did not; but I saw her near it.
Prisoner's Defence.
I know nothing that they alledge against me.
For the Prisoner.


                  William 
                  Smith 
               



            . I have known the prisoner near five years, she has lodged with me above four, I keep a cook's shop; I have trusted her to take money for almost a day together; I cannot say I have ever heard an ill character of her: if she was out, I would as soon take her in as I would any body in the neighbourhood.
Q. What business does she follow?
Smith. She used to mend, and such like.


                  Sarah 
                  Smith 
               



            . I have known her twenty-six years, and never heard any ill of her.
Q. What business does she follow?


                  Sarah 
                  Smith 
               



            . She sews, makes caps, foots stockings, and a great deal, for Mr. Smith.

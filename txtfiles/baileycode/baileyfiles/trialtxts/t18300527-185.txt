JAMES RALPH KENT. I am a tailor
. On Wednesday last I went out between nine and ten o'clock, and left this coat safe - I returned home, and was at dinner; two officers came in and asked if I had lost a coat; I then missed it from the sideboard - this is it; it is a new one - it is my own make.

            . I caught the prisoner in the Quadrant with this coat last Wednesday; I asked what he had - he said it was all right; I took him to the watch-house - he asked me to forgive him; I took him to Marlborough-street.

            . I am the prosecutor's wife; he went out at a quarter-past nine o'clock in the morning; the prisoner came and asked for a person named Adams; I told him where he lived - I did not know that the coat was taken till the officer brought it.

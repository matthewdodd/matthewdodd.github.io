             an inn keeper
; I put the pint mug on the bar, and in about a quarter of an hour I missed it; I never saw the prisoner to my knowledge till she was committed, then I heard her say she came in for a pennyworth of beer and took the mug from the bar.

            . I am a pawnbroker; the prisoner brought the mug to me on Monday night; she said it belonged to a young man that did not choose to come himself; she went away and brought a young man; I thought he did not appear to be the owner of it, and desired him to bring somebody to his character; while he was gone I saw the mug advertized.

            . I am a constable: I took the prisoner into custody; she said first that a man gave it her, but before the magistrate she said she had a penny worth of purl in the house, and took it from the bar.
The prisoner said nothing in her defence, but called one witness who gave her a good character .

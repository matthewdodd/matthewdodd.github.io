JOSEPH JAMES HEATH.
I am a house decorator, and live at Bayswater. On the 1st of June, between seven and eight o'clock, I saw the prisoners in Oxford-street, with two others—I knew, and watched them—I saw them go to Mr. Robertson's shop, and pass it—they went on, and then the prisoners went to the prosecutor's shop—I saw Williams take something from the door, and put it inside his coat—he walked round to Oxford-market, followed by Daley—Williams got into the market, and began dancing-Daley said, "They are after you"—I let them go on to the corner of Market-street, and there I saw a policeman—I said to him, "I want these four for a robbery"—I took Williams, and said, " What have you go there? "—he said, "Nothing"—I took these handkerchiefs from him—the officer took Daley—the other got away.





THOMAS WALLIS.
I am a policeman. Heath called me—I saw him like these handkerchiefs from Williams.





FREDERICK STAMMERS.
I am in the employ of Henry Verey, a haberdasher, in Oxford-street. These two handkerchiefs are his, and were taken from the window near the door.

Daley's Defence. I met Williams and two others—I asked them to direct me to Crawford-street—they said they were going—I went with them, and then they went round to Oxford-market—we came to the corner of the street—they said they were not going any farther, and they were directing me, when the officer and Heath took us—I had nothing to do with the robbery.

 were indicted for

stealing, on the 
6th of April, 1 handkerchief, value 3s., the goods of a man unknown, from his person.






JOHN WILSON
 (police-constable A 154.) On the 6th of April I saw the two prisoners in Spring-gardens—they were in company, and running—Gathen ran into New-street, and threw this handkerchief down an area—I

took it, and took him—I took Morgan last Friday—I am sure he is the same boy.





SAMUEL GREEN
. I am a licensed victualler. I saw the two prisoners in company on the 6th of April, about three o'clock—I saw Morgan draw a handkerchief from a gentleman's pocket—he turned round, and they both ran off—I pursued them to Spring-gardens—Morgan then gave the handkerchief to Gathen, who threw it down an area—I saw no more of the gentleman from whom it was taken—I do not know his name.

MORGAN—

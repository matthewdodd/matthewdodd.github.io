WILLIAM ASPIN
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
29th of May, 1 jacket, value 15s.; and 1 handkerchief, value 6d.; the goods of 



Henry Pearcy.






HENRY PEARCY
. I am captain of a Gravesend steamer. I was lying at Hungerford Pier on the 29th of May, about half-past eleven o'clock at night—I left my jacket and handkerchief in the cabin, and went to bed—I missed them about five o'clock the next morning—the handkerchief is now here—the jacket has not been found—three of the crew's pockets were picked while we were asleep.





THOMAS GRIMSTON
. I am a Thames policeinspector. In consequence of the robberies on board the steamers I was induced to watch—on Monday night last I was in ambush, and saw the prisoner pass in a boat belonging to the Westminster Pier Company—I followed in about two minutes, and saw the boat lying alongside the Nymph—I went on board, and hallooed out to the crew—I turned on my light, and saw the prisoner crouching, with his shoes off, close to where the crew were lying—I said, "What are you doing here?"—he said, "I am the fireman"—the crew awoke, the captain said they knew nothing of him—I searched the prisoner, and found two silk handkerchiefs, a cotton handkerchief, a knife, a brush, and a purse—I said, "How did you come by these?"—he said, "They all belong to me, I have had them twelve months"—this handkerchief belongs to the prosecutor.

Prisoner. I throw myself on the mercy of the Court.




GUILTY
. Aged 21.—


Transported for Seven Years.

             sworn.
On the 16th of May, I was at my master's house; I heard the bell ring in a violent manner; I overtook the prisoner on London-bridge, with the net on his left shoulder; I did not get sight of him directly; Mr. Davidson's house is the last house but one on Fish-street-hill


; he used several oaths and curses, and knocked me down with several violent blows; I believe it was four or five minutes before I got any assistance; I brought him back with the greatest difficulty, as well as danger; I took him to the Poultry Compter; he continued his outrageous behaviour till we got there; I gave the net to the other witness Collyer.
- COLLYER sworn.
I saw the prisoner looking about some time; I suspected him; I saw him take the net, and go to London-bridge; I told the prosecutor; he was pursued, and brought back; I brought back the net; I am sure the prisoner is the man.
(Deposed to.)
PRISONER's DEFENCE.
A man gave me the net; they used me very ill, and knocked out two of my teeth, and a gentleman, a blacksmith, used me very ill; I was going to Greenland dock; I am a sea-faring man
, I never knew any roguery in my life.

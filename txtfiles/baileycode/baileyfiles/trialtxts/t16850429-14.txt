Widow
: That on Saturday last, about 9 or 10 of the Clock at night, the said Langley was found in the Chamber of the said Mrs. Rochester
            ; and being ask'd, what he made there; he said, He thought it had been a Coffee-house. The proof against him as to the taking of the Cup, was very plain and full and that he had taken the Linnen and Clothes, and laid them in the middle of the Chamber in a heap with an intent as was supposed, to carry them away, but had not the opportunity. He was found 

               guilty
             of Felony.

            . I live in Long-alley. On the 26th of March I was in Norton Falgate


 - I saw the prisoner go to the tail of a cart, and move a heavy bag - he did so three times - he then took it on his shoulder, and went down Spital-square - I watched him as far as there - I then turned back and saw the carman come out of Mr. Boxall's - I told him what I had seen, and we went after the prisoner - he was secured with this bag on his shoulder.

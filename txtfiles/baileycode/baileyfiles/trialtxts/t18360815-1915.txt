ALICE HANSON
. I am the wife of Robert Hanson, of East-road, Shoreditch. I went for the dinner beer on the 28th of July—I left my shawl on the table and the door ajar—as I came back I met the prisoner with it under his arm, and took him back.

Prisoner. I met the lady ten or fifteen yards from the door—I had picked up the shawl outside, and gave it to her when she stopped me.

Witness. He begged to be let off—he took the key of the front door as well.




GUILTY
. Aged 27.—


Transported for Seven Years.

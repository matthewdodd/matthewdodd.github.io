            . On the 9th of November, I had taken my brother, who is lame, to see the Lord Mayor's procession. We were in Cheapside


, and had just passed Queen-street, about half-past four o'clock. There was a great crowd, and we were in the middle of the road. I walked backwards to make way for my brother. I put my hand to my pocket, and found my handkerchief safe. I had scarcely taken my hand away, before somebody called out,
"Catch him, he has got it." I turned round, and saw the prisoner with my handkerchief in his hand. I secured him, with a gentleman's assistance.

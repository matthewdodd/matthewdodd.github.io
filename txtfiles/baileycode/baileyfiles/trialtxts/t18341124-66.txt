JAMES GIDDINS
. I live at Bed-font, and am a retailer of beer. I missed my boiler on the 9th of November—my wife had used it on the 6th, and placed it in a shed—there were the marks of some person having got over the, folding doors into the shed, and where they got out—I made inquiries, and found the boiler about two hundred yards off—this is it—I know the prisoner—he is here and there, wherever he can get a lodging.





THOMAS GODDARD
. I am a horse-keeper to Mr. Payne. The prisoner brought this boiler to me on the 8th of November, about four or five o'clock in the morning—he offered it for sale—I said I had no money—he left it, and said I should see him again—I then heard it was stolen, and gave it to the prosecutor.




GUILTY

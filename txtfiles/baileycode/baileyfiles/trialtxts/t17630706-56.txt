, the prisoner was my carrier, we lay together in one bed, in White-chapel


; I left the key of my box in the lock where my money was, which I saw on the Wednesday morning; she picked a quarrel with me, and went away that night, after which I missed six guineas out of nineteen; on the Friday morning I found her, when I was about to charge an officer with her she ran away, she was soon taken again; we took her into a public house, she said she had not a shilling in the world; I observed she had something in her hand, I took hold of it, a person by held his hat, and she put half a guinea, some silver, and some halfpence into it; when before the Justice, she said she borrowed the money of one Watkins; she was sent for, who declared she knew nothing of her; she was searched by the constable, and with what she had dropped in the hat was found 4 l. 9 s. 9 d. upon her; after the woman had contradicted her, she then said she had saved the money by her industry.

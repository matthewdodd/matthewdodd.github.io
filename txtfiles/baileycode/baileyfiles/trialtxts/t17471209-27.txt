            . I lost a plow-chain and a bolt, the things were in a common field when they were stolen, I cannot say that the Prisoner stole them, but a man came to my house and ask'd me if I lost my plow-irons, and he told me there were such and such irons at a Smith's, Joseph Saltmarsh: I went, but I would not swear to them, but my men could; I went to Mr. Long, and he came to town, and we charged them with the constable; this has been a common practice with the plows these two years, it has caused great disappointments.


                  Robert 
                  Smith 
               



            . I am sure this is my master's chain that was in the field.


                  Joseph 
                  Saltmarsh 
               



            . I bought these things of Seal the Prisoner, I gave him a penny a pound for it.
Q. Did he give any reason for selling of it?
Saltmarsh. He gave me no reason, neither did I ask him any.
Seal Prisoner. This man, the Evidence, I carried the chains to, and he bought them, and he did not ask me any question.

                  Seal 
               



             brought these things to me the 14th of November, I am a nailer, and turning them out of the bag I did not like them; I told him they did not look as if he came honestly by them, and I advis'd him to carry them back where he had them.
Q. to Weyborn. How came Hambilton to be indicted? I don't find any thing against him.
Weyborn. Sir, I'll tell you, Seal said he received them of Hambilton.

            . Seal the Prisoner was my apprentice
, I had five guineas with him, from that time 'till about five week; ago, since I have been in the Hospital, I never heard the boy was charg'd with any thing for 13 years; I am a chimney-sweeper, and have swept at as great men's houses as in all the country, and this young man us'd to be with me, and I never knew any ill of him.

            . The things were gone the 9th of November, it was out of a common field, Mr. Weyborn came to my house, and told me that a man had told him there were such irons at Saltmarsh's, so Saltmarsh brought them to the George at Enfield; he brought a spindle markt in my own name, and I can swear to the particular links of the chain. Saltmarsh told me he bought them of Seal, and Seal said he bought them of Hambilton.
Saltmarsh. This iron was brought all at the same time.

Hambilton 

               not guilty
            .
The reason of their being tried again was, they hoped it might affect Hambilton, but it did not.

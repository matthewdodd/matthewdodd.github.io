             sworn.
I have chambers at Lyons Inn, No. 2


, the ground floor. About the latter end of July, I had occasion for a person in the capacity of an amanuensis, to transcribe various things that I used to send to the press; the prisoner was recomended to me as a person in great distress, but who belonged to a very respectable family, and whose misfortunes he had not contributed to by any bad action; he wrote a very good hand, and I employed him in that capacity; he had recourse to my chambers, copied for me, and went away; I being concerned in a house that was in Gravel-street Harton-garden, and unlet, I let him sleep at my chambers; I placed such an unlimitted confidence in him, that Ivery seldom went there; however having occasion to be there on the 27th of March, I desired him to be there and prepare the fire; I went there, and the first thing I observed was, that there was no carpet on the large parlour; I said where are my carpets? he said, I have taken them up, and put them in the next room; I thought it was so, I found no carpets there; I went into the kitchen, and, in short, in every room in the chambers, then I followed him where I had sent him, and desired him to come to the chambers, I told him; he very candidly then confessed that he had made away with them, and some stockings, various matrasses, a bolster, pillows, and in short a variety of articles, and he produced the pawnbroker's tickets, pawned at various places, and in the name of Mason, some were pawned at Mr. Cooper's; I immediately applied to Mr. Cokayne, an attorney, who lives in Lyon's-inn, and the prisoner was taken into custody.
How lately before the 27th of March had you seen these things in your chambers? - It happened about six weeks before that.
Court. How long had you left the chambers so entirely to him? - From about the middle of August.

Prosecutor. These things were in my chamber before the prisoner first went to sleep there.
PRISONER's DEFENCE.
My Lord, I did not mean to steal the things, I only took them for a temporary relief; I was in hopes by applying to my friends to have got sufficient money to replace them all, I had even replaced some of the things that very morning, which was a large bowl, two china mugs, and a tea-tray.
Court to Prisoner. By the account that is given of you, Sir, you must have known that you were not at liberty to make that sort of use of another person's property? - Yes, my Lord. I have sent to two or three people, but I did not expect my trial to come on so soon.
What part of the world did you come from? - Originally from Spital-fields.
I know there was a very respectable man of that name? - It was my father; I was drove to the very greatest distress, I had not a shirt to put on my back.

            . I left my barge at Brook's wharf; at three o'clock in the afternoon a boy came and told me, he saw the Prisoner take my coat out of the barge. I was informed the Prisoner was up at the Barracks in the Savoy; I had him taken up and carried before a Magistrate; he owned he stole the coat, but was very much in liquor; this is my coat.

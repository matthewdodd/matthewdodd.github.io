            . I am porter to Messrs. Gordon and Johnson, who are tea-dealers, and live in Cannon-street. On the 17th of April I sewed 18 lb. of tea up in a bag, which was directed to Mr. Oldham, Burslem, Staffordshire. I took it to the Castle, in Wood-street, it was booked to go by the waggon.

            . I am clerk at the prosecutor's receiving-wharf at Paddington. On the 19th of April this canvas bag, directed to Mr. Oldham; Burslem, was brought to the wharf; it weighed 18 lbs., and was to go by the Liberty boat. The prisoner was afterwards taken, and asked what he did with it? He said he knew nothing about it.

            . I am boatman of the Liberty. I put the bag on board, the prisoner was employed as boatman - I went away about a quarter of an hour - I returned between six and seven o'clock in the evening, and it was gone. I had left Little on board. As I returned, I met the prisoner in another boat, going from the Liberty, with something under his frock, about the bulk of the bag - I did not suspect him. When I got on board, Little gave me information, and I missed the bag, went in pursuit of the prisoner, and found him at the White Lion, public-house, and took him into the counting-house.

            . I am boatman of the Liberty. After Owen was gone, the prisoner came on board - I saw him fetch the bag from the farther end of the barge, and take it to the Manchester boat. I told Owen; I said nothing to him.
Prisoner's Defence. If he had seen me take it, would he not have said something?

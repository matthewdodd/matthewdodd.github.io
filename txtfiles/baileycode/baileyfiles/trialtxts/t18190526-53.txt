            . I am a watchman. About a quarter past two o'clock I was going my rounds, and saw the prisoner with two others by Hood's shop. When I came close I saw them lifting a window-board up at the next house. I secured the prisoner - the others got away. He said he knew his sentence, and they could only give him six months. I took him to the watch-house, returned to the shop, and found the door broken open.

            . I searched the prisoner at the watch-house, and found a razor, and two knives in his pocket. I went to Hood's and found the door forced apparently by a crow-bar. I found the jackets and an apron by the door.

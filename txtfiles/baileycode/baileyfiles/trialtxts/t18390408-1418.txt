WILLIAM HAWKES
 was indicted

for a misdemeanor.






SETH BULL
. I am a victualler. I had bottled beer of Mr. Drybrough—he used to allow me 3s. a dozen for the empty bottles—on the 2nd of March the prisoner came to me for Mr. Drybrough's bottles, and I delivered them to him—he said he came from Mr. Drybrough for the empty bottles—I cannot say exactly that I believed him, because I had had a note from Mr. Drybrough a fortnight before, saying he had been robbed to a great extent, and he would send his book with the person who came for them in future—I let the prisoner have six dozen of bottles, and then I asked to look at his book, and he had not got one—he took the bottles off my premises—I followed him and came up with him—he made some excuse, stating that the man would bring the book presently—I took him into custody—the man did not come with the book.

Prisoner. Q. How far did I take them? A. Not more than two or three yards—you carried them off my premises—I detained you, and told you to bring them in, which you did—you called on me two days before, and I should have given you them then, but I had not time.





ANDREW DRYBROUGH
. I serve the prosecutor with bottled beer—I did not send the prisoner for any bottles—I never saw him in my life till at Worship-street—he went quite without my knowledge.


Prisoner's Defence. I was engaged by a wine-merchant's porter with a truck—he gave me 1s. 6d. to help him draw it—he stopped near Mr. Bull's house—took a basket off and said, "Go to that house, as I come back I will call for you and take the bottles"—I went, and he gave me six dozen and four bottles—I rolled them to the door-post—I could not carry them—Mr. Bull then gave me into custody—he acknowledged at the office that his wife told him that two men came with a truck while he was giving me into custody.




GUILTY
. * Aged 45.—


Transported for Seven Years.

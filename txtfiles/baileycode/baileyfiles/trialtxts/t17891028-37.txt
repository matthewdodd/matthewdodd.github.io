; I keep a small linen-draper's shop; on the 24th of October, I lost twenty-four yards of Irish linen, between three and four in the afternoon, as near as I can guess; the prisoner took it; I saw her in my shop; a man came in about ten minutes before her; and she and another man came in for a piece of muslin; she said, no hurry, it is very cold; while I was reaching down the muslin, the prisoner took the cloth in her hand, from the shelf, by the side of the counter, about a yard from the ground; she carried it out immediately; the man staid in the shop; I said, I was robbed; and I ran to Fisher-street; and the whole four were standing together; it was not longer than seven minutes before I saw them; when they saw me they ran; I followed them; the man had the cloth under his arm; but he out ran me, and I caught the woman; she never was out of my sight, from the time I saw her in Red-lion-square; I never got the cloth.
Mr. M'Nally, Prisoner's Counsel. Have you always been positive to the person of the prisoner? - I have; that is the prisoner.
Did you never make any proposal to forgive her? - No.
Not for a sum of money, in the presence of Baker or Cooke? - No.

             sworn.
Deposed to the same effect.
Prisoner. I never was in the place, or touched any thing.
The prisoner called five witnesses to her character; one of whom swore the prosecutor and the prisoner's party came to his house to compromise the matter; and upon being directed to find out the prosecutor, he fixed on the constable, and appeared not to know who the prosecutor was.

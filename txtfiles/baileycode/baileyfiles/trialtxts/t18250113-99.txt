JOHN CRUIX. I am a waggoner
. I was at the King's Head, public-house, Pudding-lane


 - I hung my coat in the tap-room on the 8th of December, and went out for about five minutes, and left the prisoner in the room - when I returned it was gone. I saw a knife, which had been in my pocket, a week afterwards, when he was in custody.

            . I am a pawnbroker. The prisoner came to pawn this knife for 6 d. - I refused to take it in; he said he would sell it for 9 d., as he wanted to get a dinner, and I bought it of him. I gave it to the officer a few days after.


                  WILLIAM

            . I am an officer. On the 14th of December I apprehended the prisoner; the prosecutor said he was the man; he then voluntarily acknowledged that he had taken the coat, and sold it to a Jew, and had pawned the knife.
(Knife produced and sworn to.)

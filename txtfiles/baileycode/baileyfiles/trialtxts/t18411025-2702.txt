THEODORE PIERRE POUZADOUX
. I am a Frenchman. On Wednesday the 27th of October I was passing down Fleet-street at half-past one o'clock—I put my purse into my pocket—I felt if it was right in my pocket—it was, and a lot of keys, and a pocket handkerchief in it—a moment after I turned round and saw my purse in the prisoner's hand—he directly began to run—I ran, and in two or three minutes I took him—he said, "Oh, pray Sir, let me go"—there was a sovereign, a half-sovereign, a half-sovereign, two half-crowns, and four shillings in the purse—I did not lose sight of him, and am sure he is the man—I took the purse out of his hand.






MICHAEL MAGNIER
 (City police-constable, No. 868.) I was coming on duty, and saw the prisoner run from the gentleman—he was quite close to him—he ran by St. Bride's church, and then across Fleet-street to Poppin's-court—the prosecutor secured him there.

MARY TAYLOR
 was again indicted

 for stealing, on the 
30th of October, 2 onions, value 8d. the goods of 




Edward Mordecai; and 1 shirt, value 2s. 6d., the goods of 




Joseph Lakin.






JOSEPH LAKIN
. I live in Edgeware-road, and am a haberdasher. I lost this shirt on the 30th of October—(looking at it)—it has my shop-mark on it—I cannot say that it was not sold—my shopman saw it safe at five o'clock, when he went out to tea, and when he came back it was missing—it has not been sold to our knowledge.





GEORGE HENNINGTON
 (police-sergeant D 9.) I found this shirt on the prisoner at half-past six o'clock the same day.

Prisoner. It belonged to the person I lodged with, and I was going to pawn it.





EDWARD MORDECA
. I live in New Church-street, and am a fruiterer, and sell onions. I missed two onions on the 30th of October—they were similar to those that are here.

Prisoner. I bought the onions in Covent-garden.





WILLIAM CLARKE
. I Saw the prisoner walk into Mr. Mordecai's shop, and take two onions out.




GUILTY
*. Aged 30.—


Transported for Seven Years.

             - we live in Cartwright-street, Rosemary-lane


, on the ground-floor; my husband was not in town - it is a lodging-house for single men. The prisoner came that night, and paid me 3d. for his bed, and I trusted him 1d.; I was awoke at four o'clock in the morning, by hearing the plates moved, and saw him going out at the door - he slept up stairs; I followed him, but lost him - I found him at a public-house about ten o'clock; I heard him say to the Policeman, "Don't let her give charge of me - I have left the things at the public-house, and will give them up;" they were found at the public-house.

            . I was on duty in Rosemary-lane. The prosecutrix gave the prisoner in charge; he was in the yard of the public-house, washing himself - I went to the Anchor and Hope, East Smithfield, with him; he took the loaf off the shelf in the tap-room, and told me he had done it to get transported - I found the sheet there; he said he had taken it there.(Shirt produced and sworn to.)

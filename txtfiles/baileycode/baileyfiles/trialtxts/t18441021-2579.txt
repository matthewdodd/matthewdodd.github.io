BRITAIN BENSON
. I am master of the workhouse of St. Saviour's. It is managed by a board of guardians of the poor—the property in that house is under my care and custody—the prisoner had been an inmate of the workhouse—he came in some time in Aug.—he left, on the 23rd of Sept, by discharging himself—he had been provided with a pair of shoes, for his wear in the house—these shoes are a pair of new shoes, part of the stock of the house, not what the prisoner had worn—he had a pair of shoes on when he went out.






SAMUEL HARRIS
 (police-constable L 177.) I was near the workhouse between seven and eight o'clock in the morning of the 24th of Sept.—I saw the prisoner standing underneath the side door which goes into the yard, which is surrounded by a wall—I saw him repeatedly look through the key. hole of the door, and then a bundle was thrown over the wall near where he was—he took it up, put it under his arm, and walked away with it towards me—directly he saw me he turned and ran away—I pursued and took him and the bundle—it contained this new pair of shoes.

Prisoner's Defence, I was passing there, and looked through once; I was then going away, and this bundle came over with the shoes in it.





GEORGE GIRLING
 (police-constable G 94.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person.

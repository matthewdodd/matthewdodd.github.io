, in St. Giles


. About a quarter past nine o'clock, on the 5th of February, I went into his shop, and saw the prisoner with this bacon under her shawl, concealed - she was having another piece weighed - I secured her, and she pulled it from under her shawl, fell on her knees, and begged pardon - it was under her arm, under her shawl.

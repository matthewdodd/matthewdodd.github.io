Mr. Richardson. I have the direction of the business of Mess. Strahan and Woodfall, printers

. The prisoner was what we call warehouse-man
; he used to have the keys of the warehouse, and the management of the books. On the 28th of July I detected him in selling some waste paper, and on the Saturday, the day after, I desired him to deliver the keys up to me. On the Monday morning I was informed he had been seen to carry out a bundle of paper, and he ran so fast, that he was soon out of sight. I told him of it, he denied it, but at last owned he had taken a parcel, and that it was some of Atkins's Reports; but said they were rathe waste than otherwise (though that I knew to be false.) I got a warrant from Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            ; but he was gone. I was informed in the evening he was at a public-house just by. I went for a constable to take him, then he was gone again; but in waiting half an hour he returnde. We then took him; he desired me to let him go till the morning, and he would bring the parcel back. I desired him to tell me where it was, and said I would make it easy. He would not. We then took him to Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            's; but he not being in the way, we lodged him in Covent-garden round-house. The next morning he told me he had left the parcel in Shire-lane, at the Goat, for one Brown, a book-binder, and before Sir John he owned the same. The Justice ordered the parcel to be brought there; it was brought; it was Atkin's Reports in sheets. (Three books in sheets produced in court.) Sir John ordered a warrant to apprehend Brown; he came; then there was a warrant to search his apartment, and he living in London, it was backed by my Lord Mayor. There was nothing found there, and Brown was discharged. These books in sheets are the property of 
               
                  William 
                  Strahan 
               



             and 
               
                  Mary 
                  Woodfall 
               



            , widow. There were several sheets mis-placed, that we should not find it out.

            . The prisoner brought these books, and left them at my house, desiring me to take care of them till Mr. Brown called for them. He had brought parcels to my house several times for me to take care of.



                  William 
                  Gander 
               



            . I had a warrant to search for these things. I went according to the prisoner's directions and found them.
Prisoner's Defence.
I took those books, and left them at Mr. Price's. It is common for the warehouse-man to have a copy for himself, when books run over. Suppose there are a thousand books ordered to be printed, sometimes it happens that there are fifteen over.
Q. Can you make it appear that these ran over?
Prisoner. No, I cannot.

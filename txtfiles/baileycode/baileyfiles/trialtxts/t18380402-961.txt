GEORGE SAVAGE
. I am shopman to James Thomas Hawes, of Whitechapel-road, a pawnbroker. About half-past ten o'clock at night, on the 10th of March, I saw the prisoner about my shop—I watched him for as hour or more lurking about—I had occasion to go in—I had not been in five minutes before the lad at the door called me—I missed the two waistcoats and a stock from the rail outside—I ran out, and saw the prisoner running, with the waistcoats under his arm—as I caught him he fell down, and I picked up the waistcoats and him together—he used great violence, and tried to throw me into the mud—these are my master's—(producing them.)

Prisoner. I picked them up.





GEORGE HOGSTON
 (police-constable K 128.) I took the prisoner—he said, "I took the waistcoats."




GUILTY
.* Aged 23.—


Transported for Seven Years.

, in Holborn


. On the 19th of August I saw the prisoner in the shop, about twelve o'clock - she said she was a servant
, and her mistress had sent her to buy a pair of shoes; she brought a pair, as a pattern; I missed a pair from a parcel of eight, and accused her of it - she said she was surprised at me - I called my brother, who sent for an officer - they were found under her dress.

CHARLES WILKINSON
. I am coachman to Ann Tatnett. Her stables are in Glo'ster Mews. On the 5th of March, between one and two o'clock, a man called me into George-street, and I there saw the prisoner running—he had nothing then—a coachman, a neighbour, collared him—I brought him back to my stable, and took him towards the station-house, for stealing my box coat, which I had seen safe at one o'clock, on the box—the prisoner begged of me to let him go, and said it was the first time he had ever stolen any thing—this is my mistress's coat.





GEORGE KING
. I live in South-street, with my mother. I was passing through Glo'ster Mews, and saw the prisoner step on the coach-wheel, and

take the coat and run off with it—I ran after him, hallooing out "Stop thief, "he dropped the coat, and a man took it up who it not here—I saw the prisoner stopped by a coachman—I am sure he it the man who took it.





JOHN RYAN
 (police-sergeant D 2.) The prisoner was given into my custody—he said it was the first coat he had ever taken, and he would never do the like again—I got from him two shillings, a halfpenny, twelve duplicates of an umbrella, and carpenters' tools, and other things.

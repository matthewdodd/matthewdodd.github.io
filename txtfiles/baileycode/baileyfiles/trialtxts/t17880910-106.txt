                   M'Daniel
            .
JOHN RUSSELL sworn.
On the 15th of July, I lost seven handkerchiefs; I bought them over-night, I missed them between five and six in the morning out of the locker in Mr. M'Daniel's bar; I brought them there and gave them to Mrs. M'Daniel to put by for me till the next morning; it is a public-house.
What, were they India handkerchiefs? - Not that I know of, I did not buy them for that; I lost two watches which were in my chest up two pair of stairs; I had lodged there some time before, my chest was there; I went up about two o'clock on the Saturday, the same day I missed the handkerchiefs, I found my chest broke open; the chest was in the two pair of stairs room; there is a bed in the room, I only slept in it; nothing else was gone out of the chest; there were a pair of silver buckles and some wearing apparel; I heard the prisoner had the watches; I knew her before, she had been a servant girl, she had been a chairwoman there; I got a warrant for her, and took her up on suspicion, and she was searched, and one of the watches with the chains and seals of the other watch were found upon her; I was at the bottom of the stairs, Mr. Orange searched her, nothing else was found; at the justice's, she said she picked up these things at the door; I saw them at M'Daniel's house the day before.
Did the prisoner know whose the watches were? - She had seen my watches but not in the chest, she was there in the house at the same time I lodged there; she saw me wear them, sometimes one and sometimes the other; she did not see me put them in my chest.
MARY M'DANIEL sworn.
On the Friday afternoon, the prosecutor gave me the handkerchiefs to put up for him; there were seven; I put them into the bar in a locker; I missed them in the morning; the locker was broke open; there were many other articles in the locker, but nothing else was gone but them; I locked the locker with my own hand the night before, and at six the next morning I was going to open it and found it had been broke open.
Did you see the prisoner at your house that night? - That evening between eight and nine she came in, and had a quartern of gin at the bar; she did not stay long with me.
Did she go out again? - I did not observe that; I did not see her go out.
Did you see the other woman that was with her go out? - I did not take any notice of them.
Was there any part of the house where she could be concealed? - There are many places; there are two rooms in the yard.
Do not you fasten the back door? - Yes.
Was any of the doors in the house open? - Not that I know of.
Did you understand that the house was broke open at all? - No.
Did Russell sleep at your house that night? - No.
When did he leave the house that afternoon? - He was in our house, I believe, between nine and ten that night.
What time did he come in the morning? - A little before six.
What for? - He belongs to Mr. Mellish, a butcher, in that parish; they serve the pensioners with provisions, and he stops at our door before he goes any further, so he called for these handkerchiefs, and then I found they were gone; I went to see if I could miss any thing, and there I found his chest broke open, and the things all thrown topsy turvy.
How do you conceive that this woman got at the locker and chest that night? - I cannot say.

applied at the public office at Shadwell for a warrant; accordingly I went to execute it on the prisoner; I told her I had a warrant against her, on suspicion of a couple of watches; I told her, I must search her; she insisted upon it I should not; I then caught hold of her petticoat and her pocket together, and endeavouring to get my hand in her pocket she struggled; Mr. Fosresten came, up and took hold of one of her arms while I put my hand into her pocket; on searching her pocket, I found one watch, and the chain and two seals of another; a metal watch, the silver one is absent; (produced) I have had them in my possession ever since; she said she found the things between four and five near Mr. M'Daniel's door; at first she denied having any, then I took her to the justice's.
Court to Prosecutor. What sort of a watch was it you lost? - A smooth cased metal watch, much worn.
Not carved? - Not carved at all; the maker's name was Draper, London, upon the face of it.
Are you sure there was no carving upon the case of it? - I do not recollect there was any, there might I believe, the No. is 8423, to the best of my knowledge; I never set down the No. before I lost it, but I looked at the No. particularly before I lost it; my watch had two cases, and there is no spring to the inside case; the chain had a single link, the other chain was a double link.
A long or short link? - A long link; the metal watch had a key to it, no seal, the other watch had two seals, a key, and a hook.
What were the seals, do you recollect? - One was a green stone, the other a yellow, not a deep yellow but a kind of a red one; the red seal belonged to a metal watch, and I took it off and put it on the other; I won the watch and red seal at a raffle last winter; there is a silver rim round the green seal; (looks at the things) I can swear to these things.
How could you mistake that watch for a plain watch? - I so very seldom wear it, I did not take so much notice of it as that; Mrs. M'Daniel knows the watch.
Court to Mrs. M'Daniel. Have you seen this metal watch often? - I have seen it about half a dozen times; I would not wish to swear to it; I think it was a carved case, but the carving was worn off a good deal.
PRISONER's DEFENCE.
I was going by my mistress's house about half after five, and picked up a watch, which may be the same as this, and a piece of the chain; I had it for a day or two at home, so they searched me and found it.
Court to prisoner. Is the woman here that was with you at Mrs. M'Daniel's house that night? - No, I never saw her since, I came out of the house directly.

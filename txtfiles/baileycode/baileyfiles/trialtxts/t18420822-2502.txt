James Alsford.






JAMES ALSFORD
. I am a dealer in mahogany, and live at No. 23, Grove-street, Commercial-road. On the 21st of May, a person named Moss called on me, to ask if I could discount this bill for 100l.—I said I could not then, I had not more than 25l. in the house—on the 23rd he introduced the prisoner to me, and I paid him 20l.—he did not say a word to me—the agreement was drawn up between me and the prisoner, but the transaction was between Mr. Moss and the prisoner—this is the agreement—I saw the prisoner write it—I took it from the evidence of Mr. Moss that it was a genuine good bill—I do not recollect the prisoner mentioning that—I paid the prisoner 20l. that evening, and he was agreeable to take it, and, on or before Friday, the remainder of the money was to he paid to him—I paid him the remaining 60l. on the Thursday—the bill was offered to me at 80l.—it is a two months' bill—it had within a few days of two months to run—when it became due it was presented, and refused—the prisoner put the bill into my hands, after endorsing it—he said nothing to me about it—Mr. Moss was the agent between the two.
(Bill read.)—"100l. London, May 17th, 1842. Two months after date, pay to my order 100l. for value received. WILLIAM JOSEPH LATEL Accepted, JOSEPH LAYEL, No. 13, Cottage-grove, Mile End-road. Payable at No. 6, Finch-lane, Cornhill, London."





JOSEPH LAYEL
. I live at No. 13, Cottage-grove, Mile End-road. I have no connexion with Finch-lane in business—the prisoner is my son—he had no authority to draw on me—I never accepted this bill—he has no funds in my possession—he has never drawn bills on me before—I never had any conversation with my daughter about accepting this bill.

Cross-examined by
MR. LUCAS. Q. I suppose if your son becomes indebted, and enters into obligations, you do not object to answer them? A. Not for a moment.





JAMES SAMUEL MOSS
. I live at No. 5, Cannon-street-road. The prisoner brought me a copy of this bill, which the officer has in his possession, and asked me if I could get any thing of that sort done—he said he had had a very serious conversation with his father, and that his father had agreed to accept a 100l. bill for the benefit of himself and his sister, who held some money in the Accountant-General's hand in the Bank of England, and she was to repay it when she became of age—I knew that the prisoner was living at home with his father under great difficulties, and in great distress—I had it for a day or two, and applied to several of my neighbours, to know if they could do any thing of the sort—we knew the young man not to possess any thing, and so I represented to Mr. Alsford—it was done on the strength of the respectability of the elder Mr. Layel—I applied to Mr. Alsford on Saturday morning, the 21st, and said,

"Here is a young man who has been, like a great many more, rather wild at home—(I knew that, and expressed it particularly to Mr. Alsford)—the father seems inclined to serve them, as the sister has got some money, has brought me a 100l. bill, which he wants discounted"—he said, "If you had come last night, and it is a real thing, I could have done it, but I have paid all my money away, and have not got above 20l."—I met him again on Saturday afternoon—I had no idea at that moment that the bill would be done—however, we were to make inquiry, to get news of the elder Mr. Layel—I had not the slightest doubt of the prisoner's representation, that his father would do it—I told Mr. Alsford, that the best way would be to depute some one to go to Mr. Layel's house, and make inquiry, and he asked me to do it, as he was rather busy—I went, and the prisoner was standing at the street-door in his shirt-sleeves, and his tooth-brush in his hand, as if just up—I said, "Good morning, I have come to see the old gentleman"—he replied, "Oh, he got so terribly lushy last night, when we had company, he is not up yet"—he asked me into the parlour—the place seemed all in confusion, and it seemed feasible that company had been there—he went up stairs, knocked at a door, came down again, and said, "The old man is too lushy to get up yet; sit down"—I said, "No, thank you, I will go and get a glass of beer"—he said, "I will have breakfast, shave myself, and come down"—I went to a public-house, and stopped there three-quarters of an hour, and as I was coming away, hardly intending to go back again, I met the prisoner near the end of the street—I said I was just going—he said, "Well, I can't help it, I have been out some little way; come in, perhaps the old man is about now"—we went into the parlour, and his sister came in—he said, "Martha, go up and tell the old man (or "father," I will not swear which) that the person is come here about the bill"—she went up, and in a short time came down with a piece of paper in her hand; with "The Bill" written on the outside, which was the envelope, and gave it into the prisoner's hands—he said to her, "What did the old man say?"—"Why," she said, "all he said was, 'There it is, don't make a fool of it'—I said, "Oh, is that all he said?"—the prisoner opened the envelope, and wanted to show it to me—I said, "I am not going to do it"—"Oh," they said, "it is a 100l. bill, with two months' date on it"—he put it in the envelope, and put it into his pocket—we then walked up to London together, went to the Duke of Gloucester, had dinner, and a little brandy afterwards—at three o'clock we went to Mr. Alsford—I had promised to go to him in the middle of the day, to tell him the result of the inquiry I made at the house—we had three or four tumblers of brandy and water, but that was afterwards, between five and six, and we had something at the Red Lion—Mr. Alsford went with me to the Red Lion—I should think the prisoner was drunk at the time Mr. Alsford came—I judged so from his writing that he made, a memorandum—he was quite capable of taking care of himself—he had drank enough to make his hand shake.

Q. And when he was drunk he agreed to take £20 for the present? A. No, I do not consider he was very drunk—there is a good deal of difference in what is called being drunk and fresh—he was not so drunk but he knew what he was about—I told him Alsford had not got the money—he said, "You know my situation; I am very short; I don't want people denying me; I want a few pounds"—I think he was drunk when he wrote the agreement, and he certainly was when he uttered the bill—I consider Alsford was sober, but I had been drinking myself, and I never know after I take

a drop of grog—I was in a drunken state—I did not think it a strange proposition if the father was a good man, to pay £20 for the use of the money for two months, for I had heard several accounts of the old gentleman as being very eccentric, and a man that never paid any debts without giving a bill for them—the prisoner scarcely knew who was going to discount the bill, and he said to me in the morning, "I hope it is not going into any Jew discounter's hands, for my father has been punished so much through them with me"—I most decidedly thought it was a good bill—if I had not thought so, I should not have recommended it—the daughter brought it down, as if the father had written it up-stairs, otherwise it would not have been done by my recommendation—I believed it to be a bona fide transaction.

Q. Pray How much did you get in this transaction? A. I had 1l. of the prisoner, which I did not ask for, he gave it me of his own accord as we were going away from the house after he had signed the agreement—I had £5 of Mr. Alsford besides—I have not returned that to him yet.

JURY. Q. How do you get your living? A. I am an engraver by business—this was the first transaction of the kind I ever had—I cannot tell How the prisoner came to apply to me—he was not a particular friend of mine—I have met him at the Prince of Hesse public-house, and he was accepted at that room which I have been in the habit of using—he was looked on as a neighbour and a companion, and on one occasion he asked me if I could call on Fryer and Locksly about a sum of £1700 in Chancery, and on that occasion I saw his writing in pencil, which was nock better than this—I do not see the slightest resemblance to his handwriting in this—I never saw the father write—I never discounted a bill—I have been acquainted with Mr. Alsford for some time.

COURT. Q. Did it not occur to you as remarkable that Mr. Alsford should ask £20? A. It was offered by the prisoner—there was no specific agreement as to what I was to get—when the prisoner gave me the pound, he said, "I suppose Mr. Alsford will satisfy you"—I said, "I am quite satisfied he will do what is right."

Q. How did you know that Mr. Alsford would do the thing? A. I did not know that he would—I scarcely had any idea that he would when I went to him—I shall have to resign Mr. Alsford his money that he gave me—it has not been a good thing for me—I could have earned almost the £100 in the time, besides the trouble and the anxiety it has put me to.





JOSEPH LAYEL

re-examined. My daughter Jives in my house, and acts as my servant—I do not recollect her coming up to me one morning—I am in the habit of being out of my place by half-past eight o'clock every morning—my daughter is not here—I did not know it was requisite, or else she should have been here—she brought down the note innocently, I believe, and gave it to my son, and my son gave it to Mr. Moss—I had not taken any thing too much the over night—all this about my being lushy, and so on, is an untruth, an invention, made up—I was never asked to sign such a note—I had never signed any notes for my son—I understand the note was left in my daughter's bed-room, and she brought it down to him—I cannot say positively whose handwriting this acceptance is—I have no opinion about it—it is not mine—I see no resemblance to my son's writing in it—I do not believe it is his writing—I do not know whose it is—I have no idea—I do not believe it to be a feigned hand—it is not at all like my writing—my son is not well acquainted with my handwriting

writing—he seldom saw me write—I signed my name to my deposition—I did not authorise this acceptance to be written—there is property in the bands of the Accountant General, coming to my daughter when she is of age—it falls to the family in consequence of the death of the mother, two years and a half ago—I never employed my daughter or any body to write for me, or sign my name for me—I never put my hand to an acceptance without taking the bill up—my son had not applied to me to accept any such bill—(looking at the copy of the bill)—I had no communication with my son about that paper, that I positively swear—he never had any communication with me whatever on the subject of my accepting such a bill—I know nothing of my daughter having the bill—I do not know where my daughter is now—she has been away from me three or four weeks—she left me two or three weeks after this charge was made against the prisoner—I did not take her before the Magistrate—I knew nothing of her going away—I have not heard from her since—I have every reason to believe that she is in the country with a son of mine at Dagenham—if I had been aware she would be wanted she should have been here with me, but I was not—I am not aware that I have been asked many times for her—I believe Mr. Most has called, and he wanted her.





WILLIAM LAPWORTH
 (police-sergeant K 22.) I took a constable with me to apprehend the prisoner, and took him to the station—I found on him several bills that have not been negociated, but nothing connected with this case—the bill in question, the copy, and the agreement were handed over to me at Lambeth-street, by the Magistrate's wish, and I have produced them—I believe the daughter is kept out of the way—I endeavoured first of all to apprehend her—I afterwards thought it would answer the purpose to summons her as a witness, but I have not been able to find her—I have applied for her attendance, and used every effort—I have not asked the father for her—the clerk at Lambeth-street said the father was not bound to produce her—I have used every other means to produce her—I went to the father's house for her.





JAMES ALSFORD

re-examined. The body of this agreement is the prisoner's writing—I saw him write it—I do not know that he was drunk when he wrote it—he dictated it himself—I signed it first.





HENRY MILSTSD
. I am a policeman. I took the prisoner in charge at the Commercial Coffee-house, London-road—I went up stairs, and knocked at the door—he opened it—I said, "Your name is Layel?"—he said yes—I said, "I am come to take you into custody for forging a bill of 300l."—he said, "Well, I suppose it is all over with me now," or "this time"—he put on his clothes, and went with me—before the Magistrate he denied having said this—he had been in custody before, but not of me; my sergeant had him, and I was with him when he apprehended him.

J. S. MOSS
re-examined. When the bill became over due, Mr. Alsford and I went into Turner's, the lawyers, in Whitechapel-road, and when we applied to them to proceed criminally against the prisoner and his sister, the clerk there said, "It is very much like old Mr. Layel's writing"—Turner was their attorney—he had some casein hand for the old gentleman before.

MR. LAYEL
re-examined. My daughter's expectations are beyond 100l.—she has never endeavoured to persuade me to give my name to my son, nor promised to make it good to me—she is nineteen years of age.

Cross-examined by
MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. Had not your son applied

to you about advancing him a sum of money for the purpose of taking him abroad? A. He has been anxious to go abroad for some length of time and for me to get a sum of money to assist him in doing so, but it has not been in my power to do it—he has said that several times, in consequence of not getting any thing to do, he has asked me for money—I cannot say that it was for the specific object of taking him abroad—he mentioned several times that he should like to go abroad if he could get a steward's place, or something of that sort—he has very likely applied to me once or twice on that subject.

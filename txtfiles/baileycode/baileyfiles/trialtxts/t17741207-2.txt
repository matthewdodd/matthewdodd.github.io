            . On the 4th of November about 9 or 10 in the forenoon, going along Fenchurch-street


, I felt a hand at my pocket, I felt in my pocket and missed my handkerchief, there was no one near me but the prisoner, I followed him, and found the handkerchief between his waistcoat and shirt, (the handkerchief was produced in court and deposed to by the prosecutor.) I am sure I had the handkerchief in my pocket but a minute before, I had just wiped my face with it.
Prisoner's Defence.
I went to work on the keys, there being nothing to do, as I came back through the city, I found this handkerchief on the ground, I never had my hand in the gentleman's pocket, I am as innocent as a child unborn
The prisoner called his serjeant, who gave him a good character as a soldier

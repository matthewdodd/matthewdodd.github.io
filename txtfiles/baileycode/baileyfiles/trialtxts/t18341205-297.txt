ZACHARIAH BAKER
 (police-constable H 95.) I saw the two prisoners

with another in Petticoat-lane, on the 8th of December, between four and five o'clock—I saw them again between six and seven o'clock, and then again between seven and eight o'clock; and Harrow had this table-cover—I got hold of the two prisoners—the other, who was less than these, got away—I asked what they had got, and Harrow said, a bed-cover, which he was going to take to the pawnbroker's—I took them to the watch-house, and then he said he lived at No. 11, Butler-street—I went there, but the house was not inhabited—they seemed all three friendly together.





ISAAC JOEL
. I live in Sandy-row, which leads to Petticoat-lane. I had this sofa-cover in my shop, between nine and ten o'clock I the morning of the 8th of December—I then went into the country; and when I came home, between four and five o'clock, I missed this cover and another—I have known Russell nine or ten years—he has been an honest lad.

Harrow's Defence. I was going down Petticoat-lane, and found this on the pavement—I picked it up, and this boy knows nothing of it.

            . I am a shoemaker
, and live in Ratcliff-highway


. About twelve o'clock on the night of the 1st of February, I heard a knock at my door - I inquired what was wanted, and they said some boots, as they were going to Gravesend in the morning; I opened the door, and the two prisoners came in - they each had a pair of boots, for which they paid 5s. 6d.; I went to the station-house the next day, and identified a pair of shoes, and boots; they were not what I had shown them.

             (Police-constable K 63). Between two and three o'clock in the morning of the 2nd of February, I heard some conversation between two persons who passed me, and in consequence of that, I went to a house of ill-fame, at No. 6, Isaacs-buildings - I found the prisoners there, and a man who goes by the name of Stewart; I took them into custody - the women was so tipsy that they refused to go; I called in further assistance - when we were going out the woman who keeps the house, sung out to them, "Where are the boots and shoes you had? I saw you give Broomy (meaning Stewart) a pair, and a pair to Peamey" (meaning a man who sells peas) - the other officer went up stairs, and found these two pairs of boots; and when we were at the station, 
               
                  Edward 
                  Crouch
               



            , who goes by the name of Peamey, was brought there; he stated where he lived, we went there, and found this pair of boots and shoes.

             (Police-constable K 94). I went up stairs, and found this pair of Adelaide boots, and this pair of leather boots; Crouch said these Adelaide boots were hers - I saw these other shoes and boots found at 
               
                  Edward 
                  Crouch

                  Peate
               



            . I attend his shop - this pair of men's shoes were safe in his shop at eleven o'clock, at night, on the 1st of February, no person came to buy any thing afterwards but the prisoners, and these Adelaide boots were in the shop the same night.


                  JOSEPH

            . I did not sell either these men's shoes or these Adelaide boots to the prisoners - the shop was shut at ten o'clock.
Stewart's Defence. I told the officer I bought my boots at Mr. Peate's.

            . Yes, she did.
COURT. Q. When the woman talked of their giving a pair of boots or shoes to the Peaman, did either of the prisoners make any remark? A. No, my Lord; when 
               
                  Edward 
                  Crouch
               



             was asked how the boots and shoes came into his room, he said he could not account for them in any way - he has lived with Crouch for some time.
Crouch's Defence. I never saw them till they came to the station.

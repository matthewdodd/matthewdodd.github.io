            . My husband is a linen-draper
 and hosier
. We live upon Little Tower-hill


. The prisoner came into my shop, I think on the 11th of April, about a quarter before ten in the morning; I was in a room behind the shop. I got up to go to serve him, thinking he had been a customer. When I got into the shop, I saw he had a bundle in each hand tied up in paper; they were stockings; I saw my husband tie them up. I said, Sir, don't serve yourself, we will serve you. He immediately went out, and I followed him; he ran, and I called, Stop thief! A man came up and laid hold of him, the prisoner throwed the bundles away. They were taken up, and them and he brought back into our shop. ( Produced in Court, and deposed to.) Eight pair in one bundle and ten in the other.

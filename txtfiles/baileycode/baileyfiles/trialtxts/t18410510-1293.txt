 and

 were indicted for

 stealing, on the

Sarah Bar foot, from her person.






SARAH BARFOOT
. I am a widow, and live in Regent-street, Fen-church-street. About eleven o'clock in the morning of the 7th of April, I was going up Fenchurch street, near Gracechurch-street, in company with Mr. Tanner—I felt an obstruction in my walk—I immediately turned round, and Mr. Tanner seized Mason—I had a purse in my pocket, containing some duplicates and six small clasps—I lost them—I found the purse at my feet—this is it, and the clasps.

Cross-examined by
MR. PHILLIPS. Q. When Mason was taken, did he not ask you to feel whether you were robbed? A. No—I did not say that my purse was hanging half out of my pocket.





JAMES WILLIAM TANKER
. I am a tobacconist, and live in Star-court-row, Mark-lane. I was in company with the prosecutrix—I felt some one tread on my heel—I turned round, and found Mason's hand under the prosecutrix's gown—I seized him, and observed two others behind—Hudson was one of them—the other escaped—Mason begged hard to be let off, and said he was of a respectable family—Hudson begged for Mason to be let go—I cannot exactly say what he said.





JOHN MASON
. I was with the prosecutrix—she had hold of my arm—I turned, and saw Tanner with his hand on Mason's collar—I looked down, and saw the purse lying on the pavement, at her feet—I called to the officer—he came and took them—I heard Hudson saying, he thought the young man was a very respectable young man, he had better let him go.






JAMES BRADLEY
 (City police-constable, No. 502.) I saw Tanner take hold of Mason—I do not know any thing about Hudson.

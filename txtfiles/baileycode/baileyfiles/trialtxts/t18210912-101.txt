            . I am headborough of St. Pancras. I was looking into a picture shop in the Strand


, the prisoner and two others came round me - the prisoner and another had knives drawn. I got out of their way, and stood about three minutes on the curb; a baker came up, the prisoner whipped his hand into the baker's coat pocket; I laid hold of him, and saw him take the halfpence out, and put them into his own left hand pocket - there was no bottom to it, and it fell on the ground. The baker said he had a good many halfpence - he went away. The prisoner offered me a pot of beer to let him go - the baker ran away and left me; he said the halfpence were his, but he did not know his pocket had been picked. When I took the prisoner's hand from the pocket, it had halfpence in it he had no halfpence in his hand before he put it in, for it was wide open as he put it in. I do not know the baker's name.
JURY. Q. Did you search him - A. Yes; he shut the knife when I laid hold of him,
Prisoner's Defence. I was going down the Strand, went up to the shop, but never put my hand into the baker's pocket. I had some halfpence in my own pocket - I pulled my hand out, and they all fell down.

            . I am the wife of George Parke. I was in the shop on the 30th of December, and saw the prisoner come in about seven o'clock; the prisoner came in, and 
               
                  Elizabeth 
                  Thornbury
               



             served her.She asked to look at some black silk handkerchiefs; she found a good deal of fault with them. I did not like her manner, and I went and stood by the side of Thornbury; when I stood a minute or so, she dropped a key, and stooped to pick it up; she offered five shillings and eightpence for the handkerchief; on our refusing which, she was about to quit the shop, when I stopped her, I shook her clothes, and the silk handkerchief fell down from her cloak; she tried to get out at the door: but I held her; she threatened to break every window if we did not let her go; but we sent for a neighbour, and she was apprehended.

            . I did not see her take the handkerchief. She asked for a black silk handkerchief; I shewed her a box full, with which she found a great deal of fault; she was going out when Mrs. Parke stopped her, and the handkerchief fell from her.

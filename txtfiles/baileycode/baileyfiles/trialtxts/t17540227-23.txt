            . I lost two holland shirts within a fortnight, about a fortnight ago. Upon suspecting the Prisoner, who was servant at Mrs. Grant's, where I live, his box was searched by Mr. Eager and Mr. Ridge. One shirt produced in Court and deposed to: which was one that they brought down.
Q. Had you asked him after these shirts?
Tavan. I did, and he denied knowing any thing of them. Then I produced the shirt, and told him, it was taken out of his own box; he persisted upon having no knowledge of it. I took him before a magistrate, then he said the washerwoman brought it among his linnen.

            . I belong to Westminster-school, and board at Mrs. Grant's, the Prisoner was servant there; I went and looked in the Prisoner's box, he being suspected to have taken several things, and at the bottom of it I found this shirt, here produced. It was clean, and folded up. This was not his proper box, in which he used to put his linnen.
Q. Was the box locked?
Ridge. It was, but we found the key in another box of his.
Q. How do you know it was the Prisoner's box?
Ridge. He owned it was: it was in the room where he lay.
Mr. Eager. I was present with Mr. Ridge at the searching the Prisoner's box. He confirmed the account given by Mr. Ridge.

            . I washed for the Prisoner and Mr. Tavan. I washed this shirt here produced last, and ironed it. When I brought Mr. Tavan's linnen home, I used to deliver it in his room; and when I brought the Prisoner's home, I used to leave that in the laundry, where I carried all the young gentlemen's shirts.
Tavan. I am positive I gave this shirt to the woman on the eleventh of December last to wash.

            . The last I brought home to the Prisoner were six shirts together, it was either in Christmas-holidays or a little before: I never was in the Prisoner's room in my life, or saw his box.
Prisoner's Defence.
I do not know how that shirt came in my box, except the washer-woman brought it home instead of one of mine.

            . I board at Mrs. Grant's, I lost a silver stock-buckle the latter end of Jan. Mr. Ridge and Mr. Eager brought it to me last Saturday night. When I lost it I asked the prisoner if he knew any thing of it, but he denied it, and told me he believed it was the maid-servant that had taken it. but gave me no reason why he believed so. After I found it I asked him how he came by it; he said one Mr. Davie, who has been gone from us since last August, lent it him; but I had it in my custody the latter end of January.
Mr. Ridge. Upon the search we made at t he time I mentioned, we found this stock-buckle in the prisoner's box where the linen was.
Mr. Eager. I was with Mr. Ridge in this search, and saw the stock-buckle found in the prisoner's box. I have seen it in Mr. Biggs's custody since Mr. Davie went away.
Prisoner's defence.
I do not know how that buckle came into my box, or who put it there.




               Guilty 10 d.

CHARLES BURTON
. I am an optician, of Regent's-terrace, Caledonian-road. On 12th May I was in Newgate-market, and felt a tug at my pocket, a woman spoke to me, I missed my handkerchief, turned round, saw the prisoner, and said, "I will trouble you for my handkerchief"—he gave it me—this is it (produced).





JAMES PRING
 (City-policeman, 228). I searched the prisoner at the station, and took this other handkerchief from his pocket—he had a dirty white one as well.

Prisoner. I have had that one two years, and used it to carry my victuals in; I picked the other one up.





MICHAEL HAYDON
 (City-policeman, 21). I produce a certificate of the prisoner's conviction—(read—Convicted Jug. 1847, of stealing a handkerchief, confined three months)—he is the man.




GUILTY

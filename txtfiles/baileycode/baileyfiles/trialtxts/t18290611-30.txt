             LENHAM. I am single
. I knew nothing of the prisoner till I saw her brought back to my house by my landlord's son, in Duke's-court, St. Martin's-in-the-Fields


, at about half-past two o'clock: this table-cover, tippet, and carpet were brought back; they are my property - I had seen them safe five minutes before.

            . I saw the prisoner go out of the house with the things; I pursued her into Long-acre, and took her - they were in her apron; she had got about two or three hundred yards - she gave no account of them.

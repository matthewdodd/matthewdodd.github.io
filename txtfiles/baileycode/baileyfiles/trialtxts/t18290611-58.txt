. On the 6th of May, about nine o'clock in the evening, I was in Regent-street


; I felt a pressure against my pocket, and missed my handkerchief; I looked round, and saw three boys standing close behind me - the prisoner was one; he ran off - I pursued him, and he was taken in my presence; I took him to the watch-house - my handkerchief has not been found; the other two got away.

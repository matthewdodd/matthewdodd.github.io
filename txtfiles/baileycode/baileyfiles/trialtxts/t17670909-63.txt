                           Mary 
                           Watts

                           Taylor 
                        



                      
                  ; five silver table-spoons, and four silver tea-spoons, the property of the said Mary, in her dwelling-house
            ; and the other for 


               receiving the four silver tea-spoons, well knowing them to have been stolen
            . ++


                  John 
                  Taylor 
               



            . I live with my grandmother 
               
                  Mary 
                  Watts 
               



            , in Blossom-street, White Lion-yard, in the parish of Shoreditch



; her house was broke open on Friday the 7th of August; It was discovered in the morning about seven, on the eighth; the maid came up to my room, and told me the house had been robbed: I went down, and found the yard-door open, and there was a door in the middle of the entry; that door they had bolted, so that we could not get there; we found a pane of glass taken out of the kitchen-window, and the window shutter and casement open; out of the kitchen we missed five table-spoons and four teaspoons; from my room I missed my watch, and a pair of silver knee-buckles, my property; they were taken off from the table: on the Monday the prisoner Davis was taken accidentally, and carried to the Rotation Office. I was sent for; he owned to every thing, and mentioned the spoons, watch, and buckles, and said he had an accomplice with him; he said the other went into the house, and he stood in the yard, and received the things as the other gave him them out.
Q. How old is he?
Taylor. I believe he is about twenty-two years of age; the spoons were 
               
                  Mary 
                  Watts 
               



            's property; the woman at the bar was with him; she confessed in my hearing, he gave her the tea-spoons.


                  Sarah 
                  Smith 
               



            . I am servant at Mrs. Watts's; I went last to bed over night, and left all fast; the door that opens into the yard, and kitchen-window were fast; the shutter was up, and barred; I got up first in the morning, and found the house was broke, as Mr. Taylor has described; I called him up; there were five large spoons and four tea spoons missing.


                  John 
                  Julian 
               



            . I am a silversmith at Brentford; the girl at the bar had lived in my neighbourhood; she came to my shop with some tea-spoons to sell, she said she brought them from her sister; I knew her sister; I brought them; here are three of them, which Mr. Taylor has swore to; (produced in court.)

                  Whitebread 
               



            . The prisoner Davis was brought to my house; when he was brought to the Rotation Office, he said he would tell the whole truth; he said he and another lad went into a certain area between ten and eleven at night, and lay there till about one; the grandmother's birthday was then, and they were very merry, which he said made them lie longer; when all was still, they got over a place into the yard; he never said he went into the house, but the other lad went in, and gave him the things out at the window, and that the tea-spoons were sold to Mr. Julian by the woman at the bar; then I got a search-warrant, and we went to see for them; we found one spoon at the woman's sisters, and the other three at Mr. Julian's,

            . The woman at the bar told me, two table spoons were in a stable behind a beam, where I went and found them.

            . I happened to be at Shepherd's-bush, where was a merry-making, on the 10th of August; the prisoner came by with two women, Mills was one of them; a man in company, said he would go and take one of the women from him; he went, and fetched one away; then we persuaded him to go and fetch the other; the other resented it, and fell to fighting; the prisoner pulled off his clothes to fight, and some spoons fell out of his pocket; he delivered the watch into the woman's hands that is at the bar; I said, here are a great many silver things, he ought to be examined how he came by them; so after he had washed himself, I said to him, you must give an account where you had these things: he said he could send for a person where he had them in ten minutes; I went to a necessary-house; he made through a little bit of a hedge, and got into a pond of water, up to about his middle; we ran after him, and in about three fields running, I saw him throw something away; we took and brought him back to the place where I first challenged him; then he went on his knees and begged for mercy, saying he was a young man, and had been guilty of a great fault; he begged I would let him go; I said, if I do, I shall be as bad as he; he said, if I would let him go, he would let me know where he had put the watch and three spoons; I went back to where I saw him cast away something; there I found only one silver knee-buckle. I heard him own before the Justice, where and how he got the things; I gave the knee-buckle to Mr. Whitebread the constable.

                  Biddiford 
               



            . I was going to Shepherd's bush with the prisoners; while we were there, we had a pot of groat beer; I paid 2 d. and the two prisoners 2 d. each; coming back, the people played the joke with us, and asked us if we would sit down; one of them pulled me down, and another went to fetch Mills back; I still continued sitting; I saw no spoons; after that, when Mills was in the Round-house, she sent for me, and desired me to take two table-spoons, and throw them away; I thought I would not throw them away, and I hid them: they were afterwards found, and then Mills owned she had given them to me; so I was taken up, and put in the Round-house next day.



                  William 
                  Shaw 
               



            . I am a constable at Kensington; these two table-spoons I had of Mr. Cowdery; (produced in court;) he told me how he came by them.
Taylor. These spoons are my grandmother Marry Watt's, property; the prisoner Davis was a servant to my grandmother for six months, about three weeks before he committed this robbery.
Davis's defence.
I picked the things up as I was coming along in the morning in White Lion yard; I had been very much in liquor over night.
Mills's defence.
Davis asked me if I would sell these spoons; I went to Mr. Julian's and sold them; I told him they were not mine; Biddiford came after I was in the Round house, and asked me to give them her, and said she would take care of them, that they might help me while I was in prison.
For Davis.
Mr. Taylor.

            , that has given evidence, is my son; the prisoner Davis was servant
 to me; I had a good character with him when he came. I have made it a rule, whenever a servant gets drunk to discharge him; I discharged him for getting fuddled.

            . I was in St. Paul's Church-yard

             came and told me he saw the prisoner, pointing to him, take my handkerchief out of my pocket. I went and took him into a shop. I saw him take my handkerchief out, and throw it down. The constable took it up. He had two or three more besides mine.

            . I saw the chap at the bar standing at a print-shop in St. Paul's Church-yard: he put his hand into a great many gentlemen's pockets without taking any thing out. I was going on business; when I came back, there he was. I saw him take the prosecutor's handkerchief out of his pocket, and put it in his breeches. Then I went and told the prosecutor.
Prisoner's Defence.
I am as innocent as the child unborn. I am but a poor lad, and get my living by drawing beer.

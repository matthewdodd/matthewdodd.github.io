            . I keep the Seven Stars public-house, Brick-lane, Spitalfields




. I saw the prisoner, on the night of the 5th of May, passing my bar to go out, about half-past eight o'clock; I had seen him a few minutes before - he had a great coat on; my servant came and said she suspected the person who had gone out had taken a skittle-ball, and she called her fellow-servant to bring him back - I rubbed him down, and finding the ball into his pocket, I put him into the parlour, and sent for the officer.
Prisoner. Q. How can you swear to it? A. By having it so many times in my hand.
CHARLOTTE MASSINGHAM. The prisoner came to the room I was in, and asked if any one was in the skittleground - I said No; he went into the skittle-ground, and when he came out I saw something heavy in his pocket- he went out, and I called my fellow-servant to bring him back, which he did; I saw this ball taken from his left-hand pocket - it has three holes in it.

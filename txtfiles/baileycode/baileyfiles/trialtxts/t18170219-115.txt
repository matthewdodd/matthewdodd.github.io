            . I am a solicitor's clerk
, and live in Edward-street, Blackfriars-road. On the 29th of January, I was in Bedford-row


, between eleven and twelve o'clock in the day. I felt something at my pocket, and put my hand down, and missed my handkerchief. I turned round, and found the prisoner and another person with him; the prisoner had the handkerchief in his hand - I charged him with it - He said nothing. Mr. Hammond came up and secured him; the other man ran away.

            . I am an oilman, and live in Brownlow-street. I was standing at my door, and saw Donne walking, and two men behind him, attempting his pocket. I followed them into Bedford-row, and saw the prisoner take the handkerchief out. I took him - He attempted to run away.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

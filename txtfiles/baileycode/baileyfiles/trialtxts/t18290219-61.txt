            . I am a broker. I bought a yoke of Edwards, on Tuesday afternoon, the 20th of January; they both came together to me, but Beaumont did not speak - Edwards asked me 1s. for it, and I gave him 9d.; I asked him if it were his own - he said it was.

            . I am a constable. On the night of the 22d of January I went to Beaumont's; Eagles took him, and I took Edwards, in his house - I found a milkpail in his house, and in Edwards' house I found another pail.(Property produced and sworn to.)
BEAUMONT'S Defence. I was going down Petticoat-lane, and bought the pails and things for 3s.; being in the milk business, I thought they would be useful - I sold Edwards one of them; we were both together when I bought them.

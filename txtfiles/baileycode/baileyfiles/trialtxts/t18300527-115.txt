             EDWARDS. I am a shopman to Mr. John Sowerby, of Brick-lane - he is a pawnbroker
. Mr. Sutton came to me on the 29th of April, and brought a handkerchief, which he asked if I knew - I said yes it was my master's, and had our mark which I had put on it; I had seen it an hour and a half or two hours before.

            . I am a shopman to a pawnbroker. The prisoner brought this handkerchief to our shop, which is two hundred or three hundred yards from the prosecutor's - I stopped him on suspicion, as I had seen him attempt to steal a waistcoat from our shop.

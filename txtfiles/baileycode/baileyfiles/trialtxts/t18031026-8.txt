            , Esq. sworn. - I live at Tottenham


; I kept turkies in my orchard enclosed with a high paling, and spikes at the top; I missed three of them on Sunday the 16th of October; I had seen them the night before; I observed the footsteps of some person; I went round outside the fence, and observed feathers of turkies about fifty yards from the orchard; I then found the three turkies under a bush; I traced the feathers to the place; I knew them to be mine, and desired two persons to watch; I know no more of it myself.

             sworn. - I am a constable; I was ordered by Mr. Williams to watch these turkies, which I did, behind a hedge about three yards off; about nine o'clock the same night, I saw three persons come to the place; they stooped down, and packed them up; a man that escaped had two turkies, and I took the prisoner with one of them upon him.
Prisoner's defence. I am innocent of the crime.

ELLEN NEWLAND
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
28th of March, 3 1/2 yards of merino, value 6s., the goods of 



Thomas Reed and another; and that she had been before convicted of felony.






JAMES ROBERTS
. I live in Farringdon-street, and am in the employ of Thomas Reed and his partner. On the 28th of March, the prisoner came for a common calico, about 3 1/2 d. or 4d. a yard—she asked me to cut her off a yard—in the mean time I perceived her putting something under her clothes, that she had taken off the counter—I rolled up the calico—she was going to receive her halfpence, and I told her to give up

that which she had got under her clothes—she threw this merino on the ground, and ran out immediately—this is it—I had not sold it her—I picked it up, and immediately ran after her—I overtook her just as she was going into Field-lane, and brought her back—she begged me to forgive her.

Prisoner's Defence. My mother sent me out to gut a yard of calico—I was coming out—I do not know but I might knock the merino down, but I had not got it Witness. She had got nearly out when she threw it down, and ran out, and left her calico and halfpence—it was about half a yard from the counter—I saw her throw it down plainly.





THOMAS BOYLE
. I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former con viction, from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—she is the girl.




GUILTY
. Aged 14.—


Transported for Fourteen Years.

            . I am a saddle and harness-maker, in Tothill-street, Westminster. The prisoner came to me on Thursday, the 23th of August, in the evening, between seven and eight o'clock, he asked me if I bought harness. I told him, I did. On Saturday morning, at three o'clock, he came again, and knocked me up. He brought the harness, and saddle, and brown Holland, in a sack, altogether. He made an appointment to call for the money, between one and two. I appointed for him to come at eight o'clock. He never came. I had an officer to take him. There was a man came with him on the Thursday; that same man came on the Saturday night. I gained some information from him, and the prisoner was apprehended on the Monday. This is the harness and the other property.
Prosecutor. They are mine.
Prisoner's Defence. I never saw the saddle.
The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.

            . I live at the George-inn, Snow-hill; on Friday the 31st of January my ostler took the prisoner and brought him and my saddle into the yard; I know nothing how he came by it, the prisoner said his wife had been lying in at the Lying-in-hospital, and wanted something to support her.

            . On the 31st of January the Monmouth waggon came into the yard with my master's horse returned by it, which he had lent a person, it was tied to the tail of it; the waggon stopped to tie a wheel to come down the yard, it being down-hill, a man told me a person had taken a saddle off a horse, I ran and took him by the four lamps on Snow-hill, with the saddle on his shoulder, he said he had been at Smithfield-market and sold a horse, and was going to carry home the saddle. I took him into the yard, then he said it was necessity that drove him to it. ( The saddle produced in court, and deposed to ).
Prisoner's defence.
I was going up to Smithfield to get business, and saw this saddle lying on the ground, I took it up and put it on my back, and stood there a minute or two, till this man came and owned it, he said he knew it only by the saddle-cloth.

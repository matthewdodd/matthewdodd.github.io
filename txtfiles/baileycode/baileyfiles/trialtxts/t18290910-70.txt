            . I am a butcher. I was sitting in my master's truck, by Mr. Powis' door, on the 28th of July, in Anchor and Hope-alley, St. George's in the East


; I saw the prisoner come out with a bundle under her arm, between three and four o'clock - I went and told Mrs. Powis; her brother came out, and ran after the prisoner- she ran down the alley; Mrs. Powis' brother and I stopped her with the bundle in her hand - she said it was her own.

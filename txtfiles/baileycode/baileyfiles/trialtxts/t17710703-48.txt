             was indicted for 


               breaking and entering the dwelling house of 
                     
                        James
                         Vansomner
                     



                  , on the seventh of June
, and stealing six guineas in money, numbered, in the dwelling house of the said James
            . +


                     James

            . The prisoner was my livery servant;
 he left me about three months ago: I had for some time suspected his honesty. On Sunday, the ninth of June, the prisoner having come to my house, I went out of the way on purpose; and, suspecting that he came upon no good design, I left a servant of mine, 
               
                  Thomas
                   Carter
               



            , in order to watch him: I had left a sum of money in my warehouse. There is a communication out of the yard without going into the house, the general way is to go through the house, for this was formerly a part of the dwelling house; it is under the same roof.


                  Thomas
                   Carter
               



            . I am servant to Mr. Vansomner. The prisoner had left my master about seven weeks; he came about noon, about two o'clock; I let him in he went down in the kitchen, and there dined with the servants; they went away, and left him at dinner. I went away, in obedience to my master's orders, to watch what he would do: he went into the compting-house, and opened the counter (that is, the top that lifts up at the counter) and took out a purse: he took the money out of it (that is, poured all out) he took what he chose, and put the rest in again. As soon as he was gone from the counter, and had shut it down again, I immediately laid hold of his collar, and said: You rascal, I have now catched you. He had the money then in one of his hands; upon my taking hold of him, he laid the money out of his hand, upon another counter that was there, and said to me, God bless you, don't say any thing against me: I came here for a sheet of paper. I called assistance, and told them he had put the money upon the counter. The prisoner said, You may have put it there yourself.

            . I marked the sixteen guineas, and three half guineas. (Six guineas are shown him.) They have the same mark: I am certain they are six of the sixteen that were put into this purse.
The prisoner said nothing in his defence, but called three witnesses to his character; 
               
                  Mary
                   Fireman
               



            , 
               
                  Joseph
                   Fireman
               



            , and 
               
                  John
                   Fireman
               



            , who all gave him a good character.




               Guilty of stealing only

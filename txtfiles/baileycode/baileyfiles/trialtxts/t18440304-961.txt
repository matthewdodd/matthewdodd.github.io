SARAH LANE
. I am the wife of George Lane—we live at No. 6, Hart-street, Covent-garden. I went out on the 1st of March, and locked my room door—I returned a little before two o'clock, tried my room door, I found it moved a little way, but I could not push it any further open—Mr. Skelton, a lodger, was coming down stairs—I called him, and said 1 thought there was somebody in my room—I pushed several times, and got the door half open—I then saw the prisoner behind the door—he rushed out of the room, and Skelton caught him on the stairs—I found my drawers were open, and a large bag in my room—the things stated in this indictment were in the bag, and ready to be taken away—they are all ours—I called "Police" out of the window, and the policeman came—our house is in the parish of St. Paul, Covent-garden—it is our dwelling-house—these things are worth nearly 7l.—I am sure they are worth above 5l.—I locked my door when I went out, and had the key With me—it had been opened with another key.






WILLIAM SKELTON
. I was called down, and caught the prisoner.

Prisoner's Defence. I went to go to the next room; there was nobody there, and on coming down I was taken by the witness; I told him he had no cause to hold me. I waited there till the officer came; I was searched, and nothing was found on me by which I could open the room to get in. My mother came to see me yesterday, and one of the turnkeys told her I had already been tried and had three months, and she sent my witnesses to character away.




GUILTY
. Aged 21.—


Transported for Ten Years.

            . I am the wife of Samuel Wiley; we live in Crown-street, St. Pancras


 - I am a laundress. These articles I had to wash - they were safe at twenty minutes past six o'clock, in my wash-house. I went into my kitchen, and on returning they were gone.

            . I am a watchman. On the 11th of January, in the evening, I saw the prisoner come out of King's-mews, with a bundle under his arm; I received information of another robbery, and went up to him; he ran across the road, and threw the bundle down, for me to fall over it, but I picked it up, and sprang my rattle; he turned a corner - I lost sight of him; Jennings followed, and took him. I believe him to be the man, by his dress.

            . I followed the prisoner into Portpool-lane, and took him; he said, "I picked up the bundle in Gray's-inn-lane;" he gave me his proper address, and I find he bears a good character.
Prisoner's Defence (written.) I was coming down Elm-street, and picked up the bundle - in about ten minutes I heard a cry of Stop thief! and threw it down, not knowing the contents.

SIMON SIMONDS. I live on Sydenham-common


, and kept my ass in a field - there was a gap in the fence. I found it on the Friday following, exposed for sale, in Smithfield - the prisoner asked 15s. for it - I said it wasmine - he said he had bought it of a man in Kent-street, but was not to pay for it till he had sold it. He could not tell the name or number where the man lived - I had him secured - he said he would have the ass locked up, for I should not have it.
Prisoner. I told him the man's name, and where he lived. Witness. He did not.

            . I am a cow-keeper on Sydenham-common. I was at Smithfield when the prisoner was taken - he could give no account of the ass - he told me he bought it in Smithfield the Friday before - it had only been stolen on Sunday - he said he lived in Kent-street himself.

            . I am an officer, and took him in charge. He told me at Newgate he had bought it in Kent-street, of one Cadit; I have inquired, but find no such person - he said he lived at the last house at the corner of Ann-street; no such person was known there.
Prisoner's Defence. I gave 10s. for it.

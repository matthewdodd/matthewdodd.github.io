HENRY BARGE EDWARDS.
I live in Great James-street, Lisson-grove, and am a grocer. On the 28th of December, about two o'clock, I was packing up 5l. packages of silver—the prisoner came to the counter, and asked for something—I turned my head to speak to my young man, and missed one of my 5l. packages, containing the half-crowns, shillings, sixpences, and groats mentioned—I reached over the counter, and asked the prisoner what he had done with it—he said he knew nothing of it—I desired my young man to call a policeman, and then the prisoner said, if I would not tell his father, he would give it me, for his father would beat him—he produced the package from the sleeve of his jacket.

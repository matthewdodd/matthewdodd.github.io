JAMES HUNTLEY
. I live in Upper Rathbone-place, and am a broker. About eight o'clock, on the 16th of October, the prisoner came to my shop—shortly after my little boy came in, and soon after he was gone I missed a pair of trowsers—I went out and found the prisoner in Union-street, offering them for sale.





JAMES HARLOCK
 (police-constable E 24.) I was called, and took the prisoner.

Prisoner. I went into the shop to sell a pair of boots, and on coming out I kicked against the trowsers in the street—I took them up, and was offering them for sale.





JAMES HUNTLEY
. They had not been out all day—I had seen them hanging up safe at three o'clock, inside the house.




GUILTY
.* Aged 18.—

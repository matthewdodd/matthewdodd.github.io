            . On the 7th of September I went into a show at Bartholomew fair - I had my pocket cut and my handkerchief taken - I saw the prisoner there, and watched him some time; I saw him attempt another person's pocket - I then took him, and found my handkerchief in his coat pocket - this is it, it is marked 
               J. B. 
            - I belong to the Police, but was not then in uniform.
Cross-examined by MR. STURGEON. Q. Was any body by you? A. Not that I know of; I do not know what my expences are - I have never been at any other Session; I did not see the prisoner take the handkerchief - I took him in about half an hour after; I had not been in any public-house - I suspected the prisoner because he stood close by me.

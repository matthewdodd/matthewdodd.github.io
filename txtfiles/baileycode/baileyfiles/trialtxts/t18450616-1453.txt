SAMUEL PALMER
. I am a carpenter, and live in Artichoke-place, Camberwell. The prisoner was in my service, and left, without notice, on the 27th of Feb., at noon—I missed a bevel—I spoke to the police, and it was put in the Hue and Cry—I looked about, and found a number of duplicates—I then found I had lost the articles stated—these are them—they are all mine.





RICHARD LAW
. I am a pawnbroker. I have some planes and saws, which were pawned by the prisoner.





GEORGE CLARDGE
. I am in the service of a pawnbroker. I have some tools of various sorts, which I took in of the prisoner at different times.

Prisoner. I have worked for him for two years; he not only gave me tools to pawn, but he sanctioned my pawning them; I gave him the duplicates, which he put into a dressing-glass drawer in the workshop; he said he found them behind some blinds; I have been pawning his tools for eighteen months when the work was dull; he said I absconded, but I was run over, and went to the hospital; I left, and went to him at Camberwell, and was taken on the 10th of June; he gave me his watch to pawn once,

Witness. That is not true—I never gave him anything to pawn in my life.
----BOCKER. I have heard the prosecutor ask the prisoner about tools which were missing, and he denied knowing anything about them.




GUILTY

            . I am an officer. On the 7th of August the prisoner and Williams were locked up in the watch-house together, and in the morning John Williams complained to me that the prisoner had robbed him of a brooch and 16s.; he denied having a farthing about him, or any thing else, but I found both the money and brooch on him.
Prisoner. It was my own money, which I received from my master. Witness. No; he gave all his money to his sister the night before, and she came that morning, and said to him, "How can you say this is your money, when you know you gave it to me last night." I found 12s. and the brooch at the bottom of the leg of his trousers, which Williams claimed as his, and described the brooch before he saw it.
Prisoner's Defence. I had occasion to get up, and saw the brooch on the floor.

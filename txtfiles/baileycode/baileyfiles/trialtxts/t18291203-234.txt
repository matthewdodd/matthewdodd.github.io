. I heard that a pelisse was taken, but I did not miss it; I cannot say that I had seen this pelisse at all- it has my shopman's writing on it.

            . On the evening of the 2nd of December I took the prisoner with this pelisse in his possession, about a yard and a half from the prosecutor's door - a companion of the prisoner's took it, and gave it to him; I saw the transaction - the prisoner was close to him, and must have seen him take it.

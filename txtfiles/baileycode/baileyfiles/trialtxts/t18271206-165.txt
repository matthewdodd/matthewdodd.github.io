JOSEPH CLARKE. I am a sawyer
. On the 9th of November I was working at Mr. Elslop's, at Wapping


, and left two saws there; next morning I missed two of them; there were eight saws there - I had left one which I worked with, at the Pitt's Head public-house, and the other stood against the wall; the yard is left open for the ac commodation of the captains and mates; I found them at the office that day - I know them - one has a tooth broken out, the other I know - those who use saws always know the filing of the teeth.(Property produced and sworn to.)
EBENEZER DALTON. I am an officer of Lambeth-street. The prisoner was brought to our office by a saw-maker, who said he had offered to sell him a saw for much less than its value; he only produced one - I asked the prisoner where he got it - he said he brought it from Birmiagham, and had another at home; I went to his lodging, and there found this other saw.
Prisoner's Defence. I brought these saws from Birmingham.

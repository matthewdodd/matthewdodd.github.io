JOHN BOWLER
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
18th of March, 1 stove, value 23s., the goods of 



Henry Perkins; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






BENJAMIN BRITTAIN
 (police-constable D 73.) On the 19th of March I went into a public-house, and saw the prisoner—I told him I took him on suspicion of stealing an ironing-stove from Mr. Perkins, of Lisson-grove—he said I was wrong, he knew nothing about it, and he had not been in the neighbourhood that night—this is the stove—(producing it)—Mr. Perkins allowed me to take it from his door after it had been replaced.





HENRY PERKINS
. I am an ironmonger. This stove is mine—when I came home on Monday evening, the 18th of March, I was informed it had been taken away, but it was then brought back, and was on my premises.





ALFRED CALCUTT
. I live with Mr. Handford of Lisson-grove. On the evening of the 18th of March I saw the prisoner loitering about our door, which is nearly opposite the prosecutor's—I watched and saw him cross the road, take up the stove, put it on his shoulder, and walk off with it—I and Mr. Bevan ran after him, and called, "Stop thief"—he threw it down, and ran—I pursued till he was stopped by some persons, but there was no policeman, and we let him go—he was taken the next day—I am sure he is the man.





WILLIAM BEVAN
. I am shopman to Mr. Handford of Lisson-grove. On the 18th I saw the prisoner looking about—he then crossed, and took the stove—I ran out, and the boy called, "Stop thief"—the prisoner dropped the stove—I took it back—I am sure he is the man.





GEORGE HEALEY
 (police-constable D 42.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person who was tried.




GUILTY
. Aged 27.—


Transported for Fourteen Years.

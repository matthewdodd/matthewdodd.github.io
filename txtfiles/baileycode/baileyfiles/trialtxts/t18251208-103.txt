            . I am a porter, at the Green Man and Still, to Mr. Edward Cross. On the 23d of November, about half-past seven o'clock, I saw the prisoner, whom I had known before, take up the flat of butter on his shoulder, and walk towards Newcastle-street; when he had got about forty or fifty yards I said to him "You have made a grand mistake with that butter - where are you going with it;" he said "To Mr. White's, in Newman-street;" I brought him back and sent for an officer, who took him - there was 38lbs. of butter in it.

            . I am a cheesemonger
. I expected a flat of butter to come to the Green Man and Still - this is it.
Prisoner's Defence. I met a man, who asked me if I wanted a job - I said Yes, and he took me to the place where the flat of butter was - he said if I would take it to Tottenham-court-road he would give me 2s. for it. The witness stopped me - the other man ran away.

             is my mother, she is a silk mercer
. On the 9th of November, at six o'clock in the evening, the two female prisoners came to the shop, and looked at some black and coloured silk handkerchiefs. I shewed them a quantity, they chose one black and one coloured, left me 2 s. on them, and promised to call in a few days for them and pay the remainder. In about an hour, on folding the handkerchiefs up, I missed six. I immediately sent to the different, pawnbrokers and found one at Mr. M'Ennis's, Sparrow-corner. Having occasion to go to Ratcliff-highway in the evening, I accidently saw the prisoners at a house looking at some silk handkerchiefs. I beckoned to a person in the shop to detain them till I got an officer. I did so, and we followed the prisoners to two public houses and then took them. I am positive they are the women.

             was scuffling with the officer, and two pieces of handkerchiefs fell from her, which the person at the house where I found them claimed. On Terry we found a duplicate of one of my mother's handkerchiefs. Nobody else had been in the shop till I missed them.

            . I am servant to Mr. Sowerby, pawnbroker, who lives in Cable-street. The prisoner Terry, on Thursday, the 9th of November, pledged a silk handkerchief for 3 s., and about seven o'clock Bird pledged one for 3 s.

            . On the 9th of November Mr. Wilson came and informed me, that two women in Mr. Sanders's shop had robbed him. I watched them out, and followed them along Ratcliff-highway to the Jolly Butchers. They came out of there and went to the Crooked Billett. Terry then came out and called for Toms. I apprehended them immediately. I found a duplicate on Terry. The male prisoner came to see them in the morning, and I stopped him.

            'S Defence. I went to my husband and asked him to pawn the handkerchief. I told him I bought it.
TERRY'S Defence. A young man came into the public-house, and asked me to pawn a handkerchief. He gave me the ticket as he was going to sea.

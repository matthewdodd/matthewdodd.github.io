RICHARD JONES
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
9th of November, 1 watch, value 20s., the goods of 



James Martin, from his person.






JAMES MARTIN
. I live with my father, in Mare-street, Hackney. On the evening of the 9th of November, at about four or five o'clock, I was standing at the corner of Queen-street, Cheapside—I had a watch in my waistcoat-pocket, fastened with a ribbon-guard round my neck—I did not miss it till I was told of it—I then found the ribbon was cut—I felt nothing snatched away—a person came up, and asked if I had lost any thing—the watch was afterwards produced—this is it.





JAMES WILD
. (police-constable R 141.) I saw the prisoner, in company with another, standing at the corner of Queen-street, Cheapside—they made way for the prosecutor—that made me suspect—I told Dyke to keep close up—I saw the other man cut the ribbon from the prosecutor's neck, and pass the watch to the prisoner—they had got the prosecutor jammed between them—I laid hold of the prisoner—we had a struggle, and Dyke called out, "I have got the watch."





WILLIAM DYKE
 (police-constable R 193.) I saw Wild scuffling with the prisoner, and saw him throw the watch from his right hand under the coach-wheel—I took it up, and said, "I have got it."

Prisoner. I am innocent—I am a cripple in one hand.




GUILTY
. Aged 21.—


Transported for Seven Years.

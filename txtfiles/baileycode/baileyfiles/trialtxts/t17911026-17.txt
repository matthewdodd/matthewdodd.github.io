I did not go with the waggon that morning, one Pass drove it, he is not here; they were in the fore part of the waggon, when I searched nothing else was missing; none of the ropes had been cut, it was a covered waggon.

; we knocked at the door, my partner Carpmeal was let in first, and proceeded to the back room, and saw Tellfair standing over this property, and part on the table looked as if it was divided, being all unpacked. I said, Mrs. Harris, come hither, whose property is this, and who brought it here, is it yours? she said no, Mr. Townsend, it is not, that man (pointing to Tellfair) brought it here; he was standing by, we secured them both.

            . I live at Southgate. I purchased some fixtures and furniture in the house of Mr. Gundry, Enfield Chase


; the furniture and fixtures remained in the house after Mr. Gundry had left it, until I had an opportunity of selling them. On the 13th of November, I received information of the house having been robbed, and on the 14th the house was robbed, and on Tuesday, the 16th, the house was again robbed. In consequence of that I went to Winchmore-hill.
Q. Did you find there any cart - A. Yes; when I get there the cart was in the public-house yard, the things were taken out, and lodged in the house; a bedstead I saw, and I have sworn it to be mine; the other things I have no doubt is mine. I am sure the bedstead is part of the furniture I bought at Mr. Gundry's house.
THOMAS PRIOR. I had the care of this house; it was broken open and robbed on Saturday morning, the 13th; when it was robbed again I cannot tell.

2912. 




ALEXANDER HALL
 and 




FREDERICK LUCAS
 were indicted for

 stealing, on the 
29th of Sept., 1 handkerchief, value 2s.; the goods of 



John White, from his person; and that Hall had been before convicted of felony.






JOHN WHITE
. I live in Gracechurch-street. On the 29th of Sept. I was in Holborn about a quarter past eight o'clock at night—I saw the prisoners walking behind me—the policeman came and asked me something—I then felt in my pocket, and missed my handkerchief, which I had had about half an hour before—it has not been found.

Cross-examined by
MR. PAYNE. Q. Were you walking with another person? A. Yes—I happened to look round, and saw the prisoners about a couple of yards from me.





JOHN RUSSILL
 (police-constable G 165.) I saw the two prisoners following the prosecutor—when they arrived at the corner of Bartlett's-buildings, Hall lifted up the prosecutor's left-hand coat-pocket, drew the handkerchief out, and handed it to Lucas—they both ran away towards Field-lane—I went after the prosecutor—we then went down to where the prisoners lived—I saw prisoners again—they were about to enter the house—I said I wanted for stealing a handkerchief—Hall said I was just too late—I took them the station, and afterwards to Smithfield—I never found the handkerchief.

Cross-examined. Q. Arc you quite sure Lucas was the person you saw

with Hall behind the prosecutor? A. Yes—I was on the opposite side, about twentyyardsfrom them—I could see distinctly who they were.

Hall's Defence. The officer has stopped me two or three times when I have been selling articles; it is only spite.
(Lucas received a good character.)





JOSEPH THOMPSON
. I produce a certificate of Hall's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person.

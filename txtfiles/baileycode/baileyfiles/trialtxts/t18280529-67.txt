OLIVER BEMAN. On the 11th of May, after eleven o'clock at night, the prisoner accosted me in Ratcliff-highway


; she affected to be in liquor; I disengaged myself from her, and walked about twenty yards; she came to me again - I again got from her; we walked on to the next turning, when I missed my purse; I took hold of her, and called the watch; she then threw part of the money down; I got my purse from her hand - it had been in my trousers pocket.

            . I am a watchman. I was called, and assisted in taking the prisoner to the watch-house; I saw some money on the ground, which the prosecutor took up, but I cannot say how much; I did not see the purse taken from her, but I heard a noise, and the gentleman said he had been drawn of his purse; it was then in his hand.(Purse produced and sworn to.)
The prisoner put in a written defence, denying the charge, and pleading poverty.

            . I am servant to Mr. Fennell. On the 12th of this instant between eight and nine in the morning, the prisoner went into the kitchen pretending for the news-paper; I saw something bulky under his coat, I looked and missed a pair of brass candlesticks from the shelf; the prisoner made towards the door; I called my young master, who with assistance went and brought him into the tap-room, and the candlesticks were taken out of his pocket, (produced and deposed to;) the prisoner said he did it through poverty.

            . I am an officer, I had the prisoner in custody; when we were going to Justice Girdler, I asked him how he came to take the candlesticks; he owned he was guilty of it, and that it was necessity that caused him to do it.
Prisoner's defence.
I had been ill a long time in Essex of the ague and fever.

. On March the 3d, at half past seven in the evening, I was standing at the compting-house desk; the door was opened very gently: I saw a man come in; I asked him what he wanted? he made no answer, but took a prince's metal candlestick; I pursued him; he threw away the candlestick; I never lost sight of him; he was taken.

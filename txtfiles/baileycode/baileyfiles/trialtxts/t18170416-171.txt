            . I am foreman to Mr. Waterhouse. On the 1st of November, he sent two loads of hay to town. A man named Marchant, drove the waggon - I watched it down the road. When he came opposite the King's Head, at Holloway


, I saw the carter get on the top of the waggon, and throw four trusses down. The prisoner, who was the hostler
, came out, and carried three trusses into the gateway of the King's Head as fast as he could. I secured him before he took the last truss, and told him he was carrying Waterhouse's hay away. Watson came up. I told him to notice it. Marchant went on to town. He has been secured since, and tried-the prisoner ran away. I saw him again on the 12th of February, and secured him. The carter had no orders to deliver the hay there-it was to go to Lad-lane - He was not to sell it.
Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. It was a misty morning, but not dark - I could see very well.

            . I am a carpenter, and live at Holloway. I was at the King's Head-Kendrick called me to see the man throw the hay off the waggon. I saw the prisoner take it in. I am sure he is the man.

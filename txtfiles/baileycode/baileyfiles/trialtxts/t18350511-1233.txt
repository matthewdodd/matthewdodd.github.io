GEORGE KEMP
. I am a policeman. On the 3rd of May, I was on duty, about ten minutes before nine o'clock at night, near Shoreditch church—I saw the prisoner with another named Marshall—I saw Marshall put his hand into the gentleman's coat-pocket, take something out, and give it to the prisoner, who was close to him—I could not see what it was he took—the prisoner put it into his breeches pocket—Marshall ran away—a young man in my company secured the prisoner—I came up immediately

and laid hold of him—I saw him put his hand to his breeches pocket, draw this handkerchief out, and chuck it down at his feet; the young man took it up, and gave it to me—I told the young man to go after the gentleman, who came back and claimed the handkerchief—I took the prisoner to the station-house, and have kept the handkerchief ever since.





JOHN WARD
. On the night of the 3rd of May, I was near Shoreditch Church. A person gave me information—I went to the station-house—I saw a silk handkerchief which is mine—I had seen it in the officer's hand before that—this is it, and is the one I lost that night—I was not aware of it till I received information—I know it by a hole in the middle of it.

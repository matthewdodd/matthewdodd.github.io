MATTHEW SIMMONDS
 was indicted

 for stealing 86lbs. weight of beef, value 3l.;, the goods of 




John Butler; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






JOHN BUTLER
, butcher, New Park-road, Brixton-hill. Between four and five o'clock, on the 26th of Dec., I had some beef—I missed it, when it was brought back—my daughter had stuck the steel into it to keep it open, and it was brought back with the beef.





JAMES CREASY
. On the 26th of Dec. I stood at a distance, with a young man, and saw the prisoner come and take the beef from the prosecutor's window—I followed him, and he dropped it—I am sure he is the person—he had got about fifty yards from the shop—he escaped to a public-house about a quarter of a mile off—he was not taken for an hour and a half—I have known him ever since I can remember.

Prisoner's Defence, I had not been near the shop.





GEORGE WARDER
 (police-constable P 33.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from the Clerk of the Peace of Surrey—(read)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 30.—


Transported for Seven Years.

HENEY MARTEN
. I am shopman to Thomas Marchant, a pawnbroker, in Edgeware-road. On the 10th of May. about eleven o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner loitering about the shop—I suspected and watched her—I missed two shawls in the morning—in the afternoon I saw her again, and watched her for some time—I saw her pull a gown at the door several times, and then go away—she came again, pulled it, and at last got it down—(I had missed the shawl between eleven and twelve o'clock in the morning)—I asked her to walk into the shop, and gave her in charge—she said it was all false, she had not pulled the gown-piece down at all.

Prisoner. Q. Did you take it from me? A. Yes.

Prisoner. I paid for the shawl Witness. She did not.





WILLIAM LIQUORICE
. I am a policeman. I was sent for, and took the prisoner into custody—I took her to the station-house—she refuted to give her name and address—on the following morning she requested the Inspector to send somebody to No. 2, Praed's-place, Edgeware-road, to Mrs. Ryder, who had her child—I went there, and found this shawl hanging over the bedstead, and the prosecutor identified it. (Property produced and sworn to.)

Prisoner's Defence. (written.) I was passing the prosecutor's shop-several people were standing at the door—a woman spoke to me, and asked about some things at the door—the shopman then tapped me on the shoulder, and said they had missed the shawl, and gave me in charge—I told them my name was Mary—they asked me my other name, and I said I thought that one was enough—when I went to the office, to my surprise I saw my own property produced and sworn to as being the prosecutor's—I lent that shawl to a person last Christmas, who promised to come here and prove it was mine.




GUILTY
. Aged 34.—


Transported for Seven Years.

First Jury, before Mr. Sergeant Arabin.

, who lives in Whitcomb-street


. On the 12th of April, about half-past seven o'clock at night, the prisoner and another came in - one asked for a pair of finger plates, and the prisoner for a pair of hinges. While I shewed the finger plates, he reached down some parcels - one of them fell, I picked it up, and saw he had two parcels of metal cocks under his arm - there were five in each parcel. I ran round the counter and secured him - my husband secured the prisoner - the other ran away.

            , he is a cutter of boots and shoes
; he lives at No. 9, Church-lane, St. Martin's parish


.
Q. Did you lose any of your clothes. - A. Yes, I missed them on the 27th of October, about four in the afternoon; I had seen them on the same day at twelve at noon, they were safe in my father's house in the one pair of stairs room.
Q. Is the door of the house generally left open. - A. It is always open, from morning to night. At four o'clock I was going up stairs, I saw the door on a jar,in which room I had left the things, they were in a drawer all but two of the gowns; they were left hanging up in the next room. I turned the key when I came out, I cannot say whether it was locked, I did not try the door to see whether it was or not; on seeing the door of the room a-jar I went in, nobody was there: the drawers were open, and the things taken out; I missed four gowns out of the drawers, and these two gowns from the line.
Q. What was the value of the six gowns. - A. I cannot say, I think two pounds; the petticoats are worth four shillings, the shifts three shillings, a pair of stockings a shilling, the habit shirt and the half shawl are worth sixpence each; I saw two gowns and a bed gown the same night.
Q. Did you find all your clothes at the pawnbrokers. A. No, I have not found them all yet.

            . I live at 178, Drury-lane.
Q. Do you know either of the two persons at the bar. A. I know the prisoners are the two persons that came to pawn the gown on the 27th of October, about seven o'clock in the evening; they both came and brought this gown; I lent them seven shillings on it, it was Riley that gave me the gown; I gave her the seven shillings; I perceived the gown was too wide for her, I asked her whose gown it was, she said it was her sister's, and she had sent her with it. The young woman came to enquire, and left a pattern; when I came home I found the gown. Going along Drury-lane I saw Townshend, I acquainted him with it; they were apprehended the next day, and I appeared against them at Bow-street. I produce the gown.
Prosecutrix. This I am sure is my mother's gown; I had put it in my drawer that morning with my own.

            . I am a shopman to Mr. Collins, Long Acre. On the 6th of October, about six o'clock in the evening, both the prisoners came to the shop; they pawned a gown and petticoat; I gave ten shillings on the gown, and four on the petticoat.
Q. Who offered them to pawn. - A. Chapman did; they did; they had the duplicates made out in two names; I gave Chapman the money for them.
JAMES FLYSN. I am a servant to Lee and Barnes, Broad-street, Bloomsbury. On the 27th of October, both the prisoners came into the shop between six and seven in the evening; they pawned this gown in the name of Chapple; I gave four shillings on it; I am sure they are the persons.

When the prisoner came again to our shop, I told Mr. Hinckesman the circumstance as Townsend the officer had been to our shop. Mr. Hinckesman stopped them, and I went for an officer. They had pledged the shawl with us for sixpence.
- PICKERING. I am a patrol of Bow-street; I was fetched by the last witness; I took the prisoner in custody at Mr. Hinckesman's shop and searched them. I found the duplicate of a half shawl upon Chapman. I asked them what they had done with the things; they said they knew nothing about it.
JOSEPH TOWNSHEND. I know nothing more than tracing the property.

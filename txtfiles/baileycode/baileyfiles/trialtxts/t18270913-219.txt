            . I am a watchman. On the afternoon of the 5th of September, I was at my door in Tufton-street. and saw the prisoner come round with the truck, and seventeen sacks, as he said; he offered them for sale for 5s. I told him, if he would go with me, I would take him to a person who would deal with him - I took him to the officer.

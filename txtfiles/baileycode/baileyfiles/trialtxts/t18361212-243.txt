243. 




ELIZABETH HANCOCK
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
6th of November, 1 sheet, value 2s., the goods of 



Isaac Moore.






ELIZABETH MOORE
. I am the wife of Isaac Moore, of Earl-street Marylebone—I take in mangling. On the 6th of December, the prisoner came to have a petticoat mangled—on her taking it away. I missed linen sheet—on Thursday afternoon I saw her in a house in York-court—I called her out, and asked her if she knew me—she said "Yes"—I asked her about her out, and asked her if she knew nothing about it—I got her to my room, and there I begged her to confess—she pulled a bag of duplicates out of her bosom, and gave me one for my sheet.





JOHN GREYGOOSE
. I am a pawnbroker, and live in Crawford-street. I produce the sheet and petticoat which were pledged by the prisoner—she

said it was the property of her mother—the sheet being made of several pieces, I thought it was likely to belong to a poor person, and took it in—she has pledged at our shop before.

Prisoner. I did it through distress.




GUILTY
. Aged 16.—Recommended to mercy by the Jury.




Transported for Seven Years.

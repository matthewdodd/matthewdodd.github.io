CHARLES JONES
 was again indicted

 for stealing on the 
lst of December, 9 ivory balls, value 15s., the goods of 



John Schofield.






ROBERT UPSALL
. I am a pawnbroker, and Jive in Barbican. These ivory bagatelle balls were pawned on the 1st of December by the prisoner—I did not know him before.





JOHN SCHOFIELD
. I live in Wood-street, Cheapside. These nine ivory balls are mine—I lost them on the 1st of December—I know two of then by particular marks—the red ball has a flaw in it—I dyed it myself, and did it very badly.





ANN SCHOFIELD
. I am the prosecutor's daughter. The prisoner was at our house on the 1st of December, and I served him with a glass of ale—he took it into the parlour—I went in about a quarter of an hoar and missed the bagatelle balls, which had been there—I swear to them.





JAMES BRANNAN
. I am a policeman. When I took the prisoner to the stationhouse this duplicate was found on him, but I was not there at the time.

Prisoner. I have a wife and four children—I have been in respectable circumstances, but have been so reduced that I was obliged to do any thing I could.

MR. EDWARDS. I have known his wife's friends to be very respectable—I believe he was in business, but has been unfortunate the last few, years principally through his own misconduct, by excessive drinking.

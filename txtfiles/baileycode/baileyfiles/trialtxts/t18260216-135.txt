WILLIAM DAVIES. I live in Chiswell-street


, and am a linen-draper
. I saw the prisoner in my shop between eleven and twelve o'clock on the 24th of January - she bought several small things of my assistant; I watched her for some time, and saw her put her hand into her basket two or three times, very quickly; she had a shawl on her shoulder, which did not quite cover the basket; when she left the shop I followed, and asked if she had not got some of my ribbons in her basket - she said she had not, and I was welcome to look. I found three lengths of ribbon in her basket; I took her back, and gave charge of her.
Cross-examined by Mr. CRESWELL. Q. Did you not state at the office that she resembled a person whom you had seen before? A. No.

            . I am the prosecutor's shopman. I served the prisoner with some little articles - she was about half an hour in the shop. I did not see her take the ribbons.
Cross-examined. Q. How were the ribbons laying before her? A. In a basket on the counter - they could not have slipped down.

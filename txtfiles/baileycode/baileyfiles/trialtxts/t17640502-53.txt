            . I am a head borough of St. Giles's parish. Between the 7th and 8th of March, I was with Mr. Marsden: I took Lewin somewhere by Golden-lane: he had a bag with him: I asked him what he had there? he said it was tea: we examined it, and there were three parcels of tea, a parcel of coffee, pins, fans, and other things: we had an information against him.

                  Ringwood 
               



            . I live in Cheapside, by Foster-lane, and am a fan-maker. I had an order to deliver forty-two fans to Mr. Lamden, in the Poultry, to be sent to Chichester, with some of his things; there is my hand-writing with them, (Forty-two fans produced) here is my bill of parcels; those are the same I delivered at Mr. Lamden's, and Mr. Lamden was to send them to the carrier: I heard nothing of their being lost, till Mr. Quinnell, the waggoner
, advertised them.

                  Davis 
               



            . I am a pin maker. (A parcel of pins produced.) These pins seem to be part of the pins sold to Mrs. Jowel, of Chichester: there was a bill inclosed, which is not here: here are one thousand of these. Mrs. Jowel was in town the 7th of March last, and bought the pins, and paid for them; they were delivered to Mr. Lamden, by her order, and packed with his goods, to be sent by Mr. Quinnell, the waggoner, to Chichester.
Richard Hill. I am servant to Mr. Walington. I carried a parcel of wax candles, by my master's order, to Mr. Lamden's, at the corner of Grocer's alley, to be packed up with his goods, to go to Chichester: (A parcel of candles produced) these are part of them: here is my hand-writing on them.

                  Lamden 
               



            . I keep a china and glass-shop. There were some teas and other goods that I sold to Mrs. Jowel at Chichester; she had bought some other things, and desired I would pack them together, and send them by the waggon; and by the appearance of these things produced here, these seem to be the goods (he takes up some empty bags): these I believe to be the bags the teas were in: the teas are re-delivered, in order that, they should not be spoiled: here is one or two of them with my mark on them: the size also answers: they were put into a box: there was a parcel appeared to be fans, and another parcel of pins, by the form of them, and some wax-lights: the coffee, as well as the tea, was sold by me: I packed them together, and sent them by my servant, Humphry Thomas, to the inn, to be delivered to the waggoner, to go to Chichester.
Humphry Thomas. On Thursday, the 8th of March, I carried a box to the White-hart, in the Borough, to go by Mr. Quinnell's waggon.
Q. to Langrig. Did you find these things in a box?
Langrig. No, I found them in a bag, on the prisoner.

                  Read 
               



            . I am book-keeper to Mr. Quinnell: I remember a box coming directed to one

                  Jowel 
               



            , of Chichester, which was missing afterwards. On the 8th of March, Lewin, before Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            , confessed he took the box, and that Fossett was with him, between 10 and 11 at night.

Holton Vere. There was an order came to me, on the 8th of December, to send a box of candles to Mr. Doltrey, a druggist, in Cannon-street; they were sent on the 10th: (I live in Bear-street, Leicester-fields, and am a tallow-chandler): my man carried them, and brought the money that afternoon; and some time after Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



             sent for me, and shewed me two or three candles, and asked me if I could swear to them; as to that I could not do it, but they seemed to be the same.


                  John 
                  Simpson 
               



            . I live with Mr. Doltrey. We bought the candles for Mr. Smith, of Huntingdon: I delivered them myself to Mr. Bull's porter: I believe there were six dozen of them: they were directed to Mr. Smith, surgeon, at Huntingdon. Mr. Bull is the waggoner
.


                  John 
                  Wheatley 
               



            . I am porter to Mr. 
               
                  Robert 
                  Bull 
               



            : he sent me to the chymist's to fetch the candles: I brought them safe to the inn-yard, at the Cock, in Aldersgate-street. I set them down, and went and told my master in the kitchen of them: he came and looked at them, and when we came to load the next morning, they were lost.


                  Thomas 
                  Lloyd 
               



            . Mr. Solomons, Mr. Fosset, and I took those candles away, on a Saturday night, a little before Christmas, about 8 o'clock, from the Cock-inn yard, Aldersgate-street. Solomons had seen it before, and he came and fetched Fossett and I: we went on purpose to fetch that, and carried it by turns, to a house on the other side Bishopsgate, hard by Stoney-lane, where Solomons is acquainted; we uncorded the box, and looked at it, and saw it was candles; then we left it there, and went to the Coach and Horses, in Shoreditch, to the house of 
               
                  Richard 
                  Swift 
               



            , and told him what we had got; he bid us bring them: then we went to Bishopsgate-street, and gave a shilling for a basket, and put the candles into it, and all three of us carried them to Swift's house, and he bought them: he gave us four-pence halfpenny a pound.
Fossett. This fellow was taken up for picking of pockets, when the Prince of Brunswick was married: he was an evidence against his own brother, and was tried for stealing a handkerchief.


                  William 
                  Steers 
               



            . I bought a parcel of candles of 
               
                  Richard 
                  Swift 
               



            , about two days before last Christmas-eve: there were about five dozen and a half of them. Swift told me they belonged to Fossett and Solomons; I said that was nothing to me, who they belong to; I was to give five-pence halfpenny a pound for them: I gave him 30 s. for them.
Q. Where did you agree for them?
Steers. In Swift's own house.
Q. Does Swift deal in candles?
Steers. He said they did not belong to him; he had them to sell for Fossett and Solomons.
Fossett. Steers is the greatest rogue in England; he bought a pocket-book and bills, which Brinklow was tried for.


                  John 
                  Adams 
               



            . I heard Fossett acknowledge before Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            , that he was concerned with Lloyd, in taking away those candles from the Cock.
Fossett's Defence.
That man is a thief-taker. I suppose they all belong to M'Daniel and Berry; I never was along with Lloyd in all my life.
Solomons's Defence.
I never was in company with Lloyd in my life: no man ever saw me in that villain's company.
For Fossett.


                  John 
                  Townsend 
               



            . I have known Fossett twelve or fourteen years: I know him in the capacity of a drover: I never heard any thing amiss of his character till now.
For Solomons.

                  Moses 
               



            . I have known Solomons above fourteen or fifteen years: he bears a very honest good character, and always worked honestly for his bread.

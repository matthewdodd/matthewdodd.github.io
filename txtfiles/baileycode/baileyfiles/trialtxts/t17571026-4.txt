                  Jones 
               



            . On the 23d of July the prisoner came and ask'd me to let her lie with me one night.
Q. Where do you live ?
M. Jones. I live in King-Street, Bloomsbury


. She had lived fellow servant
 with me some time before this.
Q. Do you keep a house?
M. Jones. No; I am a servant

 to Mr. 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Baynham 
               



            . The prisoner being a good workwoman with her needle I employed her to work for my master, having never heard any ill of her before.
Q. Did she lay at your house only one night?
M. Jones. She lay there several nights, best part of a month.
Q. Did your master know that?
M. Jones. No, but he saw her at work in the house. I missed a silver spoon of my master's on the 24th of July, but did not suspect her. After she was gone I missed my silk gown and a pair of jumps.
Q. From what part of the house did you miss the spoon?
M. Jones. From out of a closet in the kitchen, and my things from out of a garret where I lay.
Q. How do you know she took them ?
M. Jones. They were found at Mr. Spencer's, pawn'd in her name, and I had them again on my paying for them.
Q. How much did you pay for them ?
M. Jones. Seven shillings and two pence halfpenny.

            . Mr. Baynham came to me and ask'd me if I had taken in a silver spoon, mark'd J. B. I looked in my book and said I had, but had delivered it again a few days before to Jane Hickey. There was 5 s. put down against it, which she had on it.
Q When was it?
Spencer. It was delivered on the 27th of July, and she brought it on the 23d. As I had deliver'd it I cannot swear to it now. The prosecutrix and Mr. Baynham's son came and ask'd me if I had ever a silk gown or jumps of any body's bringing. I looked, and found that on the 28th of July I had taken in such things of the prisoner. I went and brought them down, and the prosecutrix own'd them. She ask'd me what I lent upon them. I said I lent her 7 s. upon them, which she paid me, took them away, and has had them in her custody ever since. (The things produced in court.) As to the spoon, that which I h was like it, but I can't say this is it. The gown and jumps are like what I took in, and I believe they are the same.
Q. Are you certain the prisoner is the woman that brought the things you mention?
Spencer. I am.
Q. How long have you known her?
Spencer. I have known her six or eight months.

            , the prisoner at the bar, on the 27th of July, and lent her 8 s. on it.
Q. Where has it been since that time?

The prisoner had nothing to say in her defence.

JOHN GIBBS FOX. The prisoner was my servant
. On the 13th of April I went out in the afternoon, and when I returned at six o'clock in the evening, my wife told me something was missing; I looked and missed these articles - the handkerchiefs were mine, and the gown my wife's; the prisoner had left my service while my wife was out - I found her the next day at No. 20, Wych-street, and charged her with taking the things; she said the property in her box was mine.

            . I am an officer. I took this box and the prisoner in Wych-street - she told me she was induced to take them by a young man.
Prisoner's Defence. It was no such thing; I do not know any young man - I did not take the things myself.

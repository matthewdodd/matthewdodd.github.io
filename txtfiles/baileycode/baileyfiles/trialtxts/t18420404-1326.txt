CHARLES CARTER



for feloniously receiving the same, well knowing them to have been stolen; against the Statute, &c.


MR. CLARKSON
conducted the Prosecution.






FREDERICK MULLETT EVANS
. I am in partnership with William Bradbury, as printers, in Whitefriars—ours is the only house in London that prints "Chambers's Edinburgh Journal"—the prisoner Andrews was our apprentice, and acted as a machine-man—there are six machines in the machine-room—Andrews worked at the machine we call No. 2—there are two machines close together on the right immediately you go in at the door—when the copies of the journal are taken from the machine, they are laid down quite flat on a board by the side, on one another—they are then counted up in hundreds, and folded over once, then taken up into the ware-house to be dried, and afterwards distributed to the trade—copies are never sent out to the trade in a wet state and folded but once—they are simply folded so for the purpose of counting in hundreds—Andrews by being in the machine-room, would have the opportunity of possessing himself of a hundred numbers of wet sheets folded once—I am not aware at which machine No. 528 of the journal was printed—a person named Hall worked

at one of the machines, side by side with Andrews, he at one machine and Andrews at the other—we sell the journal to the trade at 13 1/2 d. a dozen—that is the wholesale price—some are sent to the binders, and some to the publishers—we fold a portion of them, and the others are sent to the binders.

Cross-examined by
MR. CHARNOCK. Q. HOW long has Andrews been in your service? A. I think between four and five years altogether—he came first as a machine-boy—our superintendent engaged him—we direct that none but persons of good character are to be engaged—he has been an apprentice about two years—we apprenticed him partly in consequence of his good conduct, and partly out of compassion, to teach him a trade—I understand he lives opposite our establishment in Lombard-street, Whitefriars—each machine requires one man and two boys—I entertained a good opinion of Andrews.

MR. CLARKSON. Q. Have you had any reason for changing that opinion? A. Yes, for some time past I have had a very bad opinion of him indeed.





THOMAS SELBY
. I am an apprentice of Messrs. Bradbury and Evans. I am seventeen years old, and have been in the establishment about three years—I live at No. 10, Zoar-street, Southwark—Andrews was in a different department—on Wednesday evening, the 9th of March, about half-put seven o'clock, I was going home in company with Robert M'Cauley, another apprentice, and in Fig Tree-court, Temple, I saw Andrews, about the centre of the court, with a round parcel under his arm, rolled up and wrapped round with an old brown paper wrapper, like this now produced—one end of it was open behind, so that I could discern that it contained paper—I believe along the Temple would be the nearest way to Holywell-street from Whitefriars.

Cross-examined. Q. Where had you come from? A. From Regent-street—I was going towards Blackfriars—I know Andrews well—I cannot say how many lights there are in Fig Tree-court—there are not many—I did not speak to Andrews, nor did M'Cauley—it was dark—I do not undertake to swear this is the wrapper I saw—it was one similar to it.

MR. CLARKSON. Q. Was there any gas-light in the court? A. Yes, I saw by the light of the gas that the parcel was open behind, and contained paper—the white showed from the brown paper.
f ROBERT M'CAULEY. I am one of Messrs. Bradbury and Evans apprentices. I had been with Selby to Regent-street, on the 9th of March—on our return home, we came into Fig Tree-court about half-past seven, and saw Andrews there with a parcel under his arm, wrapped in a wrapper like the one produced—it was open at one end, and I saw that it was paper—from the appearance of the roll I should say there were about 100 sheets of paper in it.

Cross-examined. Q. I suppose you will not swear to the wrapper? A No—I cannot swear whether there were twenty-five or fifty sheets.





CHARLES HALL
. I reside in Lambeth-square, New-cut, and am in the prosecutors' service—I was working the machine, No. 2, which prints "Chamber's Edinburgh Journal" on Wednesday, the 9th of March, Andrews was working in the same room at one part of the evening—I missed him from the room just after seven o'clock—he had something to do with some numbers of "Chambers's Journal," but not with No. 528—I bad that all to myself—he had to pass my work while in the room—I

sheets up wet in hundreds, and folded once—if he were so disposed be might take them in that state—I never took any to the prisoner Carter's, or any where else—I never saw Carter till he was in custody.





ELIZABETH M'ARTHUR
. I keep a shop in Holywell-street, Strand, for the sale of weekly publications. On Friday evening, the 4th of March, the prisoner Carter came and asked me if I dealt in "Chambers's Journal"—I told him no, nothing of any consequence, I had been for the last three years conducting the business for my brother, but our business was large, and I did not enter into any other publications—he said if I did, he could supply me very largely at 1s. a dozen—I asked if they were the right copies—he said, "Yes," and went over and fetched one—I knew that the regular price was 1s. 1 1/2 d.—he brought one over to me, which he left—I said I could not say any thing to it, I would look it over, as that was not the proper price, and the publishing day of that week was over—I told him I would make inquiry among the trade, but be would understand that was not the proper price—he said his reason for offering it was, he had dealings with a printer, that he took a certain quantity, and if he did not sell them he took them again, and that their dealings together were only in money—he said it would not be worth his while to take them unless I could promise to take 100 dozen or more—next morning, Saturday, the 5th of March, he came to me again—I told him I would make inquiry among the trade during the week—on Wednesday, the 9th, he again came over during the day—I told him that I had made inquiry among the trade, and that they would take them, provided the goods were right—I told him I supposed I might depend upon him that they were right, and I was to have the quantity named, which was 100 dozen—he said, "Yes"—he said I could have them on Wednesday if I pleased—I said Thursday morning was the publishing morning—he said I could have them on Wednesday night if I chose—about half-past ten o'clock that night he came, and brought with him these 100 copies of "Chamber's Journal" now produced—I asked him if that was all—he said, "All, to-night"—I told him I thought it was a pity, if that was all, to have mentioned it to me, because that was not sufficient to supply one publisher—he said I could have more to-morrow—he did not say how many—no arrangement was made about paying for the 100 dozen on Wednesday—I said, "You can leave them, had I better pay for them now or when you bring the remainder of the quantity stated?"—he said, "Very well, I will leave them"—after he was gone I examined the 100 copies—they were wet, and folded once, just as they come from the printers—they were not folded as I had seen them in the trade—I left them as they were till the morning—the publishers sent, and I refused to sell them—I went to a publisher in the street, made inquiry, and a communication was consequently made to the prosecutors—on the following morning, the witness Humphreys came to me, and I delivered to him about a dozen of the copies Carter had left with me—about one o'clock the same day (Thursday) Carter came to me again, and said, "How about Jose ' Chambers?"—I said, "I have done nothing with them, they lay here as you left them, but as you have not brought any more, I shall not think of doing any thing with them"—he said, "The party is at my house now, I will make inquiry when you can have any more"—he went away, returned in about a minute, and said I could have another hundred in the evening, that he thought that was all I could have that week, but I could

have as many more as I liked in the following week, at the same price—I delivered that same evening to the officer the remainder of the copies Carter had left with me.

Carter, The first time I called on you was on Thursday—I asked whether you did any thing with "Chambers's Journal"—you said "A little," but you could say nothing about them unless I showed you a sample and on the Friday I brought you a sample—you said you would ask the trade—I called on Saturday, and you said you would take 100 copies. Wit ness. No, for 100 copies would have been of no service to me it was the large quantity you offered which made me suspect they were not stolen—I asked if I could have "Chambers's Information," also—you said you would inquire—I said one was of no use without the other, as they were both sold together.

Carter. I did not deal in weekly publications, and came to you for advice; I asked you whether they were about the price, and you said they were. Witness. You asked me what they sold at, and I told you 1s. 1 1/2 d. to the trade—you brought them about half-past eight o'clock on Wednesday evening—I did not examine them while you remained, or count them to see how many there were—I did not say that I had been in the habit of having twenty-six sheets to the quire, and these were but twenty-five, nor ask if that was the lowest price they would take—you said on the Thursday morning that that was the least you could sell them at, as you were allowed so little discount—they were wrapped in one of the set-off sheets—I told you that 100 was of no use to me—I bad not paid you for them.

Q. If they were of no use to you why not give them me back again? A. You were to bring me the others in the course of the day, or the following morning.

MR. CLARKSON. Q. What business does Carter carry on? A. I really cannot tell—I have seen books and pictures of various sorts in his shop—he lives nearly opposite me—I had never spoken to him before he came to me, to offer these—he did not ask me my advice—he said he had taken them of a man who was a printer, that they transacted business together, and he owed him money—he came to ask me if I did any thing in "Chambers's Journal," and what he was to give for them—he said he did not understand much about it, and asked what the price was, and I told him.





SAMUEL HUMPHREYS
. I am chief warehouseman to Messrs. Bradbury and Evans. In consequence of directions I received from Mr. Evans, I went to Mrs. M'Arthur's in Holy well-street, on Thursday, the 10th of March, somewhere between twelve and one o'clock in the morning—she showed me a parcel of the journal, No. 528—they were quite wet, apparently as if just from the machine, and were rolled up in this sheet of paper, which is one of the set-off sheets—that is, a sheet which has been through the machine several times—we never allow those sheets to go off the premises in a whole state, we always tear them up or destroy them—they are never sold—I have the custody of all the stock of this publication—it is one for which there is a considerable demand—before the weekly numbers go to the trade, they must pass through my hands—on Wednesday, the 9th of March, a portion of No. 528 had gone through my hands in sheets, to Messrs., Orr the publishers, and 8500 copies to Mr. Bone, the folder, for the purpose of being delivered by him to Mcssrs. Orr, the publishers,

when folded—no others passed through my hands for the purpose of the trade, and no others went out of the house to my knowledge—the 8500 copies delivered to Mr. Bone were partially dried before they went—the greater portion of them had been on the lines for the purpose of drying.

Q. Could they have been in the state in which those were which you found at M'Artburs? A. According to the time, no—those were quite damp, as if from the machine—on Thursday evening, the 10th of March, I went with Beard and Weston the officer, to Holywell-street again, and watched there for some time; about nine o'clock I saw Andrews and another—Andrews left the other one outside in Holywell-street, and he went into Carter's shop—it is a shop-front with second-hand books, candles, knives, and miscellaneous things in it—the principal stock was second-hand books—there was no name over the door—a board hung at the door stating that miscellaneous property was bought, sold, or exchanged—I followed Andrews into Carter's—I was close at his heels, and Weston was close at my heels—I found Carter in the shop with Andrews—no conversation passed between Andrews and Carter while I was present—Weston said to Carter, "Have you any Chambers's Edinburgh Journal?"—he said, "No, I have not"—Weston said, "Did you ever have any?"—he said, "No, I did not"—Weston said, "You are sure you have not?"—he said certainly, he never did, he knew nothing about it—Weston then said, "Did you ever sell any?"—he said, "No, I did not"—Weston said, "Did not you sell some to a neighbour?"—he said, "No, I did not"—Weston said, "I can assure you have," or "I can prove to you that you have"—he immediately sent me across the way to Mrs. M'Arthur's, and I brought Mrs. M'Arthur's man over with a portion of these—Weston said to the man, "Who did you purchase these of?"—the man said, "That man," nodding to Carter—Carter then said, "Oh yes, I did; oh yes, I did; but I sold them on commission"—Beard then tapped Andrews on the shoulder and said, "Andrews, what do you do here?"—he turned round and said, "Oh, I am only come here for a piece of music, Mr. Beard"—Weston then said to Carter, "Well, I shall take this young man for stealing the journal, and I shall take you on suspicion of receiving the same; and I will search your shop"—in searching the shop these two wrappers were found—I said to Beard, "These are ours, George"—Carter said, "Yes, they came round the journal"—as they were going along to the station, he and the policeman were talking together, and Carter said, "It was not this little one—(meaning Andrews, who had gone on before in custody of another policeman) I bought these of, but he was with him."

Cross-examined. Q. Do you know whether Arnold is partial to music, or whether he attends any concerts? A. I do not know anything about him—Beard is superintendent of the machines—he is also the landlord of a public-house in Fetter-lane—his wife carries on that business, I presume, as he is in business daily—I never go there—I cannot say whether he gives concerts there—the 8500 copies which went to the binders were not wet, they had been hung up in the air for four or five hours, and were partially dry—I am sure these had never been done so, there are no mould marks on them—I should certainly say these were never on the lines at all—if they had been they would have been more dry—I would not positively swear it—I cannot myself swear that these formed no portion of the 8500—there are about 200 persons employed in the factory—these

wrappers are not common pieces of brown paper—they are peculiar wrappers, which come from Scotland with the paper—there is no mark on them, but we only have that sort of paper in the house, which comes from Scotland—I cannot say whether other places have wrappers like them.

Carter. Q. Was there any one else in my shop? A. did not see any one else—a Mr. White came in afterwards—I think he was in conversation with you while we were searching the shop—I did not say, "I think these are our wrappers"—I put them on the counter, and said to Beard, "Here, George, these are ours"—you said, "Yes, they came round the journal"—I said, "I know it"—these were the only two there—the policeman pulled a lot of rubbish out, and said, "Are any of these yours?" and I said, "No"—you said, "There is nothing there belonging to you, but you may take them if you think proper."





GEORGE DUERDIN
. I am a warehouse lad in the prosecutors' printing-office—I, came for 5000 copies of the journal, No. 528, to he sent to Mr. Bone—I afterwards counted 3500 more—they were all counted up in quires, folded over once, and put in bundles of one thousand each.





THOMAS LAWRENCE
. I am in the employ of Messrs. Orr, the publishers of the journal—none of the No. 528 went out from our place on Wednesday, the 9th of March, in an unfolded and wet state as they come from the machine—it is quite impossible—some did go out on the Wednesday, folded, but none in hundreds half folded and damp.

Cross-examined. Q. I suppose you were not at home the whole of the day? A. No—there are seven or eight persons on the premises—I generally arrive on the premises about nine o'clock in the morning, and leave at eight at night—I did so that day—I went out to dinner at one o'clock—I sometimes have out-door work to do—I cannot say whether I had that day—I will not swear I had not—I was gone about an hour and a half to my dinner—I take my tea on the premises—I am obliged to leave the warehouse occasionally, and leave it in the care of other persons.





MR. CLARK SON
. Q. What portion of this publication came to your house on the day in question? A. We received 10, 400 on the Wednesday evening—they were all in a folded state—we never receive them unfolded, like these produced by the officer—all that came to us were folded and partially dry.





WILLIAM THOMAS BONE
. I am in partnership with my father, in Broadway, Ludgate-hill. On the morning of the 7th of March I received 5000 unfolded copies of No. 528 of Chambers's Journal from the prosecutor's—on the 9th I received 3, 100 more in an unfolded state—they were all folded before they left our premises—these produced formed no part of them.





GEORGE BEARD
. I am a printer; I am also a publican, but my wife manages that business for me. On Wednesday evening, the 9th of March, I was in the machine-room where it was Andrews's duty to be working—I missed him from the room about ten minutes past seven o'clock that evening—he returned about five or ten minutes to eight, I cannot say to five minutes—he had no right to be absent without my knowledge—I afterwards accompanied the officer to Holywell-street.

Cross-examined. Q. Where does Andrews live? A In the same

street as the office—he has frequently been absent without my knowledge—I do not know whether he has gone to his father's—he has been at my public-house two or three times—we leave off work at eight o'clock at night—Andrews and I never went to my place together—he has come in occasionally of a Saturday evening—that is the only time I ever saw him there—be never drank there with me—I do not give concerts there—we have what the printers term an "auxiliary" for the benefit of a building-fund for aged printers—we have no music—we have a little harmony—Andrews has sung there—there are no ladies admitted—Andrews's sister has never been there.

Carter. Q. What took place when you came to my shop? A. Weston asked if you had got any Chambers's Edinburgh Journal—you said no—he asked if you ever had any—you said no—he said, "Are you quite sure you never had any?"—you said, "Yes, I am"—he said, "Did you never sell any to a neighbour?"—you said, "No"—Weston said, "I can prove that you have," and he sent over the way to Mrs. M'Arthur's—a young man, who, I believe was the shopman, came over with this bundle, containing four quires—Weston asked him where he bought them—be said, "Here"—he asked who of—he pointed to you and said, "That man"—you then said, "Oh, yes, I have sold some, but it was only on commission"—I swear you said so—I heard nothing else pass between you and anybody else.





GEORGE WESTON
. I am a policeman. On the Thursday evening I went to Carter's house, in Holy well-street—I was in plain clothes—I have heard the account given by Beard of what passed between myself and Carter in the shop—it is quite correct—I received from Mrs. M'Arthur the four parcels I have produced—they were unfolded, just as they are now.

Carter. Q. What took place between you and me? A. When we first came into the shop you asked what I wanted—I said, "Some Chambers's Edinburgh Journal"—you said, "I have not them"—I said, "Did you ever have any?"—you said, "No"—I said, "You are sure of that?"—you said, "Yes"—I said, "Did you never sell any of them to any body in the street, any of your neighbours?"—you said, "No"—I said, "I will prove that you have," and told Humphreys to go over the way—they brought the journals, and after that you admitted that you had sold them on commission—on our road to the station you said, that, previous to this, Andrews and another had been to your shop, and asked you to take some of the Journals; that Andrews was not the party who brought them, but the other man who came with him.

Carter's Defence. On the 3rd of March a young man came into my shop and asked if I dealt in weekly publications; I said I did not, and asked what publications they were; he said, "Chambers' Edinburgh Journal;" I said I did not do anything in it myself, but I would make inquiry; I asked where he lived, he said, in Water-lane, Fleet-street; I said, if he brought me a sample I would inquire in our street of the publishers, who lived there, whether they would like to purchase them—on the Friday I went over to Mrs. M'Arthur and asked her if she dealt in "Chambers Journal;" she said she had done a little; I said, a party had offered to supply me with them at 1s a dozen, and asked her if that was the price—said that was about the price, as far as the could recollect; I asked if she would like to make a purchase of some; she said she

could not say till she asked her customers; she asked me if they were the right sort; I said I was not aware, I would get her one; I went and fetched one to show her; she said they were right, and what she had been in the habit of having before; nothing more passed till Saturday, when I called over and asked if she had asked her customers; she' said she had, and they were all supplied with journals for that week, but the following week she would have some of me; on Monday I went again and asked if she bad made up her mind; she said she had, she would have some, and would let me know how many; I went over on Wednesday morning, she said she would take one hundred journals, and asked me if that was the lowest price; I said I believed it was, but I would inquire; I directly went over to the young man, who was then at my shop, to make inquiries; he said that was the lowest; I was to have 6d. a hundred for selling them; she gave me an order for one hundred; on Wednesday evening, about ten o'clock, the journals came wrapped in a piece of printed paper; I said, "It is late, I thought you were not coming;" he said, "The wetness of the night prevented my coming before;" I took them over to Mrs. M'Arthur; she never objected to the quantity; she asked how many there were in a quire; I said I could not tell; she counted and said there was twenty-five, which was one less than she generally had in the trade; she counted them all over; I said, "There is one hundred and seven, and the odd seven will do to make up;" she asked if she should pay me that night or next morning, or give me a note of hand for it; I said there was no occasion for that, knowing her to be a neighbour; next morning the young man called to know if I wanted any more; I went over and asked Mrs. M'Arthur; she said she should like to hare another hundred, and she would pay me when the other hundred was brought; she sent over in the afternoon to see if they had come; I said I had not seen the young man; I went to find his address, but was unable to do so, and could not procure her the other hundred; nothing more passed till the policeman came and asked if I had any "Chambers' Journals;" I said "No;" he asked if I had ever sold any; I said, "No;" he asked if I had had any; I said, "I have had some, I have not sold any, I have merely sent over the way to sell on commission;" he sent the young man over the way and fetched some over; I said there was no occasion for him to fetch them; I knew there were some there; he directly said, " What does this young man do in the shop;" I said he came to buy some music; Mr. Beard then spoke to him, and while he was doing so, Mr. White, a printer, living in the street, came into the shop; he said, "This is a bad job, especially for a neighbour; it was through me it was found out," and Mrs. M'Arthur says it was through her that it was found out; Mr. White asked the policeman if he was at liberty to speak to me; he said, "Certainly;" Mr. White asked me if I knew the party who brought the journals; I said I should do so, and if they only waited a little longer I had no doubt the party I had the others of would be there that night, but on account of our going to the station I never saw the party—as we were going to the station the policeman asked me what sort of a young man it was; I said he was taller than Andrews; he asked whether he had whiskers, and how he was dressed; I stated as well as I recollected, only seeing him once or twice; I did not say Andrews had been in the habit of coming with him; I said one evening, while the

young man was in the shop, Andrews came in; he was only in the shop a few minutes, but before he left he did speak to him, and I thought by that he might know him; if it had not been for what Mrs. M'Arthur said to me, I should have had nothing to do with the journals; it was through her advice that I had anything at all to do with them.

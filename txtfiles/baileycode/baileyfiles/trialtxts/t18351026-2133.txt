WILLIAM WHEATLEY
. I live in the Commercial-road, Lambeth. On the night of the 30th of September, about nine o'clock, I was in King William-street, London-bridge with a relation—we stopped to look into a shop-window, and had been there but a few seconds, before I felt my pocket for my handkerchief, and it was gone—it was safe a few minutes before—I felt my pocket because there was a crowd at the window—I turned round, and saw the prisoner standing by the side of a man, with his arm through that man's arm, and my handkerchief in his hand—I took it outof his hand, and secured him.





RICHARD WILLIAM FAUSTOR
. I am an officer. I took him into custody, and have the handkerchief.

Prisoner's Defence. I was standing by the window—a man took the handkerchief out, and gave it to me—I shoved it under the man's arm again.




GUILTY.* Aged 11.—Recommended to mercy.

Transpoted for Seven years.

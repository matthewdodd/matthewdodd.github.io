             and 
               
                  Mary 
                  Davies 
               



            , of St. Sepulchres



, were indicted for 


               stealing one hundred and four China oranges, the property of 
                     
                        
                           Thomas 
                           Kender 
                        




                      
                  , in his warehouse
            , April 11
.


                  Thomas 
                  Kender 
               



            . Between eight and nine at night, on the 10th of April, I left my warehouse fast shut up, and on the last day, between nine and ten in the morning, I found my warehouse broke open, and missed a great many oranges; 
               
                  Elizabeth 
                  Robinson 
               



             owned, that one 
               
                  Catharine 
                  Cox 
               



             broke the warehouse door open, and that they stole 104 oranges, and that Cox delivered them to her. I believe Davis is not guilty of the felony, but was only concerned in selling of them.

                  Eves 
               



             (servant to Mr. Kender) said, that Robinson owned, that she was concerned with one 
               
                  Catharine 
                  Cox 
               



             (who was discharged) in breaking open the warehouse. Robinson 


               guilty, 10 d.
             Davis 

               acquitted
            .

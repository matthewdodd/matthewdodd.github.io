            . On the 10th of September, about half-past ten o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner coming out of the area, and tapped at the parlour window twice, and asked him what he wanted; he made no answer. I flew to the door and called out Stop that man! - he was stopped and brought back. I went into the kitchen and missed my watch, which was there three minutes before. It was not found on him. Smith produced it; he had no business in the area.

            . I was standing by the top of my place when the prisoner ran by me. The prosecutrix called out Stop that man! I saw him taken and brought back. I saw him take something from his pocket, and lay it on the window cill. I immediately said,
"Let us see what he has put there," and found it was the watch.

, of Holborn


. A person gave me information - I went out, and took the prisoner - he ran when he saw me; I followed, and took him with this piece of print concealed under his coat - I took him back with it; I had seen it in the shop five or ten minutes before.
JAMES SANSOM. I am servant to Mr. Willis, opposite Mr. Brown's. I saw the prisoner go to the shop, and take the print from the doorway - I went and informed Griffith, and saw him brought back; I am sure he is the person - I had seen him watching about the shop for five minutes, with another person.
Prisoner's Defence. I saw three sailors there; I thought one of them was my uncle, I went back, and by the gateway I picked up the print.

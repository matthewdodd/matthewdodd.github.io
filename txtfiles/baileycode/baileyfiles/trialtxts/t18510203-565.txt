On Tuesday, 14th Jan., at a quarter-past six o'clock in the evening, I was on duty at Notting Hill—I saw the prisoner with a bundle; I asked him what he had got; he said, some dirty clothes he was going to take home to wash—I found the things were wet, and took him to the station—he dropped the bundle, and ran; I ran, caught him, and took him and the bundle to the station—I found in it these gowns and other things.

            . I live in Long Lane by Smithfield


; I went out to get change for a shilling to the next house. I pull'd to my hatch and my door; I was not gone above a minute, I saw the prisoner come out of my door with the leather under his arm. I call'd stop thief; he dropp'd the skins and run away. The neighbours run and took him; I took him before an alderman; there he said he was fuddled, which made him do it.

            . I was in the street, saw the prisoner come out of Mr. Beckett's shop with the skins under his arm; Mr. Beckett call'd out stop thief; I pursued him, he dropp'd the skins, I took him; and before the alderman he said he was drunk when he did it.
Prisoner's Defence.
I had been to measure a gentleman for a pair of breeches, and I went in there to buy 2 skins to make the linings; I design'd to pay for them, but being a little in liquor, and the man came and call'd stop thief, it frighted me, or I would have paid for them.
For the Prisoner.
A Serjeant. The prisoner is a soldier in the first regiment of guards, and has been a soldier ever since the 10th of last August; he behav'd well as a soldier, as to his private affairs I know nothing of.




               Guilty, 4 s. 10 d.

            . I keep a public-house
 in Westminster


. I lost two linen table-cloths; I cannot say the exact time; the boy at the bar confessed to the taking and pawning them. I also lost halfpence at different times. The prisoner drawed beer for me at different times.
Q. How old is he?
Wood. His father says he is seventeen years of age. I never got the table cloths again. The boy owned to me he got into my house at the upper window, and came down to the till, and took the halfpence. He said he pawned the table cloths to 
               
                  Henry 
                  Still 
               



             in the Almory, but he says he has no such things.
The prisoner said nothing in his defence.

            . On Tuesday the 12th Day of November, between 7 and 8 at Night, as I was in my Shop, my Maid took in the Grate, but before she set it down, I perceived a Hand take the Parcel out of the Window: I cry'd Stop Thief, and the Prisoner was taken by Mr. Tims. I look'd out and saw the Prisoner drop the Parcel.

, I heard a Cry of Stop-Thief, I saw the Prisoner and no body else near him, upon which I struck at him with my Stick; I miss'd his Head, but hit his Hand, and then he dropp'd the Bundle.

On the 2nd of February I went to Lead-enhall—market—I left my horse and cart in Gracechurch street—my great-coat was in it—I was away three or four minutes, and my great-coat was gone—a policeman produced it in the evening, and I identified it—this is it—I missed it a few minutes after eight o'clock in the morning.





WILLIAM WHICHER
 (City police-constable, No. 619.) I saw the prisoner in Bishopsgate-street, with this coat under his arm, on the 2nd of February, about a quarter before eight o'clock in the morning—I asked where he got it—he said, from his brother, and he was going to Cambridge—I took him to the station, and in the afternoon I found the prosecutor.





JOHN ANDERSON
. I am clerk of Giltspur-street prison. I know the prisoner well—I was present on the 12th of August, 1839, when he pleaded guilty to a charge of stealing a sovereign—I produce a certificate of his conviction from Mr. Clark's office—(read.)

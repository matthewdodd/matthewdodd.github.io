WILLIAM JONES
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
17th of May, 1 handkerchief, value 2s. 6d., the goods of 



Ernest Hawkins, clerk, from his person.






REV. ERNEST HAWKINS
. I am curate of St. George, Bloomsbury. On the 17th of May, I was in Middle-row, St. Giles's, at ten minutes before eleven o'clock—as I was going down to St. Martin's church, I was rather in a hurry—I felt some person's hand at my pocket—I turned, and saw the prisoner—I took him, and found my handkerchief in his breast—I took that and let him go—I thought I ought to take him into custody, but I saw no officer; no one would assist, and he got away—he was taken afterwards, and I have no doubt he is the man.

Prisoner. Q. Do you swear that is your handkerchief? Q. Yes; I had but one of this pattern, I have no other mark on it.





JAMES BRADLEY CHAMBERLAIN
. I was coming out of my private door, and saw the prisoner, whom I knew—I said to Mr. Hawkins, "Sir, you will do the public great service by keeping that man"—there were a great many people round him, some threatening, and some begging him to let him go; and he got away—I ran after him—he went into a house—I asked the prosecutor to wait at the door—he said he could not, as he had duty to do at the church—I then gave information, and he was apprehended.




GUILTY
. Aged 20.—


Transported for Seven Years.

             sworn.
I live opposite to Mr. Christopher; I saw the prisoner Harris go into Mr. Christopher's house, about nine in the morning, he staid about five minutes; I was at my window; I suspected him, and ran to acquaint the prosecutor; and before I could get across the road, he came out, and ran away; I did not see the other two.

             sworn.
I live with the prosecutor; that young lad, Muzarad, came into our house, about nine in the morning, and asked for one Moore; I told him, next door; and he went out.
PRISONER HARRIS's DEFENCE.
As I was taking a walk over Stepney-fields, I met these young lads going along; and I saw a great many people running along, and we stopped; and two young men came up and took us; they knocked us about, and told us we must go with them; and the man said we took some silver spoons, and some salts from the gentleman's house.
The prisoner Harris called four witnesses to his character.

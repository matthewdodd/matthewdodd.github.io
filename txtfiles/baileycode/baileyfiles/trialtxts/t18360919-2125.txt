THOMES FARRANT
. I am a policeman. On the 31st of August I saw the prisoner in company, at half-past ten o'clock, in Oxford-street—I watched them down Regent-street to Mr. Dudley's shop—they stopped and looked in at the window, and then I saw Jones attempt to go in two or three times—they went down Foubert's-passage, and stopped some time at a cheesemonger's—they then went on, and came back to the prosecutor's shop, and I saw Jones go and take a pair of boots—he went to Robinson—I pursued Jones—he dropped the boots—I took them up, and called "Stop thief"—a man took him in my sight—I had watched them from half-past ten till half-past twelve o'clock.





HENRY LOWMAN
. Farrant called me to his assistance, and pointed out the two prisoner—what he has stated is correct.





WILLIAM FARRELL
. I am in the service of Mr. William Dudley. These are his boots.

Jones's Defence. I was walking on, and this lad came and asked me the way to Poland-street—I directed him, and that is all I knew of him till I was taken.

Robinson's Defence. A few minutes after I left this young man the policeman came and collared me—I knew nothing of the robbery nor the other prisoner.

1737. 




THOMAS COOMBS
 was indicted

 for stealing 8 sixpences and 3 groats; the monies of 




George Tranent; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






SARAH REED
. I am bar-maid to Mr. George Tranent—he keeps the French Horn, at Lambeth-walk. On the morning of the 3rd of Aug. I saw the prisoner behind the counter—the till was open, and his hand was in it—he had no business there—I ran to catch him—he got off, and I called the constable Goose—he took him—I examined the till, and found it empty—there ought to have been eight sixpences and three fourpenny pieces in it.

Prisoner. She never called any policeman at all; she never saw me in tht house. Witness. I found him behind the counter and bis hand in the till—he threw the money down.





THOMAS GOOSE
 (police-constable L 160.) I saw the prisoner come any from the bouse—he ran down a court about four yards long and dropped the money from bis hand down in the mud—I found eight sixpences and two 4d. pieces—I am sure he dropped it—there was nobody else down the court—I Wl watched him before he went into the house.





SARAH WEDDELL
. I manage the business of Mr. Tranent's house. I had left eight sixpences and three 4d. pieces in the till the night before.

Prisoner's Defence. It is false; I never was near the bouse.





RICHARD ARTHUR
 (police-constable L 26.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction at Newington—(read—Convicted 13th of April 1845; confined three months and whipped)—the prisoner is the person.

Prisoner. I am not the person. Witness. I have not a doubt of it—I the officer who took him—I had known him before—I am sure he is the person.




GUILTY
 † Aged 19.—


Transported for Seven Years.

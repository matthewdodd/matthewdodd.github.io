            . I am a broker
, and live in Charterhouse-lane, Middlesex


. On the 19th of October I went out between nine and ten o'clock, returned in about a quarter of an hour, and found a mob round my door, with the prisoners in custody, and the bed-castors.

            . I am a constable. I saw the prisoners loitering about the street, watched them, and saw Bealton go up to Taylor's shop window, put his hand over, and take a castor off the counter, he immediately came and gave it to Rawlins, who was waiting; he returned, got another, and brought that also to him. They walked to the square, I secured them, and took the casters from Rawlins; I took them back - Taylor soon after came home, and claimed them.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

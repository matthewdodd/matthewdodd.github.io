GEORGE MICHAEL
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
5th of June, 1 spoon, value 15s., the goods of 



Susannah Ann Stoneham; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






SUSANNAH ANN STONEHAM
. I live in the Minories. On the 6th of

June, the prisoner came to my house to take an apartment for himself and his brother, who he said was captain of a ship—he slept there the first night himself—the next morning I had a tea and a salt spoon, at breakfast about half-nine o'clock; he left about ten o'clock, and then I missed the two spoons—I am a widow.





JAMES TESTER
. I am a neighbour of the prosecutrix's. I took the prisoner into custody—I found this table-spoon in his right hand coat pocket, between twelve and one o'clock.





SUSANNAH ANN STONEHAM
. This is my spoon—this had not been missed more than ten minutes.





WILLIAM EVANS
 (City police-constable No. 60.) I took the prisoner, and produce the spoon.





JOSEPH LATCHMAN
 (police-constable S 44.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction (read)—he is the man who was tried and convicted.




GUILTY
. * Aged 24.—


Transported for Seven Years.

Before Mr. Sergeant Arabin.

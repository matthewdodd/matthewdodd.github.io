ANDREW GARRETT. On the 4th of August, at a quarter before nine o'clock in the evening, I was in Elm-street, Gray's Inn-lane


; the prisoner and another person had made an attempt at my pocket, while I was in Cold Bath-fields, but when I got to Elm-street, the prisoner snatched the handkerchief from my pocket; he ran away - I pursued him, and took him to the watch-house; when I turned round he was secreting it in his breast, but in running he threw it away, and I have never seen it since.
Cross-examined by MR. QUIN. Q. Elm-street, I believe, is not a very light street? A. There are gas-lights in it. I am positive he is the person who made the two attempts - it was my handkerchief he was secreting; he turned several corners, but I did not lose sight of him till I secured him, in Laystall-street.

            . I received the prisoner at the watch-house, but I found nothing on him.
Prisoner's Defence. I was going towards Spa-fields - I met a person I knew, and when I got to the corner of Elm, street I turned down a court leading to Mount-pleasant and some person called Stop thief! I never saw the handkerchief.

THOMAS HICKEY,



 CHARLES MARSHALL
 and 




THOMAS WILKINSON
, were indicted for

 stealing 1 handkerchief, value 2s.; the goods of a man unknown, from his person; Marshall having been before convicted of felony.






GEORGE SCOTT
 (City policeman, 560.) On the morning of the 25th of Sept., I was in King William-street, and saw the three prisoners together—I knew them, and watched them—I saw them follow seven or eight different gentlemen, lay hold of the tails of their coats, and attempt to pick their pockets—I saw Wilkinson try two, and Hickey tried three or four, and Marshall was in company with them—they went up to a gentleman, and I saw Hickey take a handkerchief from his pocket—he ran across the road, and my brother officer stopped him, and took the handkerchief from him—the gentleman went up towards the Mansion-house—I have not been able to find him—it was about half-past ten o'clock.





ALEKANDER DICK
 (City policeman, 521.) I was in King William-street—I saw Hickey running across the road, and Scott after him—I stopped Hickey, and took this handkerchief from him.

Hickey's Defence. I never stole it; I saw it lying down as I was going on an errand for my master; I picked it up, and put it into my pocket; the officer knocked me down, and took it for me.

Marshall's Defence. I came out from home, and was going to Billingsgate; this officer came across the road, and said, "I want you;" I went with him and they said I was charged with picking a pocket.

Wilkinson"s Defence. I know nothing about it.





THOMAS BRADLEY
 (City policeman, 269.) I produce a certificate of Marshall's former conviction at this Court by the name of Henry Arnold—(read—convicted the 2nd of Feb., 1846, and Confined one year)—he is the person.

            .) What have you to say against the Prisoner?
Hudson. I charge her with stealing a Coat and Waistcoat on the 28th of April; I put them into the Drawer and lock'd it, at my Lodgings at

.
Q. What is the Coat made of?
Hudson. Silk Camblet. I put them into the Drawers the 28th, and I found them the 30th.
Court. You don't know who took them away.
Hudson. Sir she (the Prisoner) pawn'd them.
Q. Did you hear that she own'd them?
Hudson. Yes. Before the Justice.
Court. You say she confess'd before the Justice. As she was confessing, was he writing?
Hudson. I thought so.
Court. You thought so, than let that be return'd.
Q. Did she sign any Confession?
Hudson. No, Sir. But she said it was true.
Q. Now will you tell us what she did confess before the Justice?
Hudson. The Justice said to her, that I laid these Things to her Charge that she took them, and he ask'd her whether that was true; and she said that it was true.

Q. Was that the Question he ask'd her?
Hudson. Yes, Sir.
Q. Did the Prisoner tell you where she had pawn'd them?
Hudson. Yes. At the three blue Balls in St. Martin's-Lane. She own'd she took the Waistcoat and pawn'd it for Half a Crown; then she took the Coat the second Time, and put them in her own Name for 7 s. 6 d.
Q. Did you redeem them?
Hudson. No. I took them away and brought the Pawnbroker before the Justice, by his Order.
Court. (to the Prisoner) You hear what this Witness says; that you told him that you pawn'd them at the three Blue Balls, and for three Half Crowns, and you confess'd before the Justice that it was true? Did you know this Woman before?
Hudson. My Landlady let her lay there out of Charity.

             brought me this Waistcoat. Afterwards she came with the Prisoner at Night; and the Prisoner put them both in her own Name.
Q. And what had she upon them?
Caddy. Seven Shillings Six-pence.
Q. So you lent the Woman the three Half Crowns. Did you ask her how she came by them? Did you know the Prisoner?
Caddy. No.
Q. Did you know the other Woman before?
Caddy. Yes. I have seen her before.
Q. Do you take in such Sort of Things of any Body?
Caddy. The other Woman came along with her.
Court. I don't find you know much of the other Woman. So you ask'd her no Questions at all how she came by them. What was the other Woman's Name?
Caddy. 
               
                  Margaret

Court. Then you lent but three Half Crowns upon them?
Caddy. They wanted more Sir.
Q. Are you sure the Prisoner came at Night, and brought the Coat, and order'd the Waistcoat to be put in her Name.
Caddy. I can't positively say; but I believe it to be her.
Q. Do you know any Thing more of it?
Caddy. No. I don't know any more of it.
Q. But Sir, do you make it a Practice of taking Things in that Manner of People you know nothing of?

Q. Was that the whole of his Questions?
Cook. Yes.
Q. Did she confess any Thing more?
Cook. He ask'd her what she had done with them.
Q. Well, what then?
Cook. That she had casry'd them to the Pawnbroker's and pawn'd them for three Half Crowns, in St. Martin's-Lane; as to the Pawnbroker's Name she could not tell. Whereupon he order'd me to take her away to the Round-House. The next Morning he granted Mr. Hudson a Search Warrant: Accordingly we went to Mr. Caddy's, in St. Martin's-Lane; we takes the Woman at the same Time from the Round-House, and brings her before the Justice, and the Pawnbroker at the same Time, and she was committed to the Gatehouse.

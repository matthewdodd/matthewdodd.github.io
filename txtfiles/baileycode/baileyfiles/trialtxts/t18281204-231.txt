SARAH HARMAN. I am single
. On the 20th of November I asked the prisoner to go and shew me the way to a pawnbroker's, at Pimlico, where my gown was in pawn; we got it out, and he took it under his arm; I asked him for it - he said he would carry it; when we came to Tothill-street


 we went to Mr. Jones', to get a ring out of pawn - I asked the prisoner to read the duplicate, which he did, and gave it to the pawnbroker; I laid my handkerchief, with the gown in it, on the counter and pulled out half a crown and two shillings - the prisoner took them up, and said he should be back in a minute or two, and went out.

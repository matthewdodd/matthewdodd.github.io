            , the 25th of January

 last.
It appear'd by the Evidence, that the Dray-Man having left the Dray in the Street, while he went into a Customer's House to see for emty Casks, when he came back, the Housing was gone, and that it was afterwards stopp'd, where the Prisoner had carried it to sell.
The Prisoner pleaded, That he found it in the Street; but this Plea did not avail; and the Jury found him 


               Guilty to the value of 10 d.

               feloniously stealing Trace-Chains, and Iron-Pins

            ; which Fact also being fully prov'd, the Jury found him 


               Guilty of this Indictment likewise, to the value of 10 d.

 from his person
            .
HENRYJAMES LLOYD, ESQ. I live in Gloucester-place. On the 16th of February, about twelve o'clock at night, I was coming from Covent-Garden 
               Theatre
            , crossing from James-street, into Covent-garden


, my handkerchief was in my coat-pocket, and heard a quick step following me, which afterwards increased, as if the person was coming nearer. I looked round, and saw one of the prisoners, I do not know which, reaching his hand to a person behind him - I saw my handkerchief on the ground which the other person was picking up. I seized the person which was nearest to me, and took the other as he passed me, with my handkerchief - they were the prisoners - they were close to each other. I gave them in charge. Nobody was near enough to take it but them.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
WALKER'S Defence. I saw the handkerchief on the pavement, picked it up, and gave it to the gentleman.

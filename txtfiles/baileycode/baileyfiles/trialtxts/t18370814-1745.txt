1745. 




RICHARD GARRATT
 and 




WILLIAM WOODMAN
 were indicted for

 stealing, on the 
15th of July, 241bs. weight of lead, value 2s. 6d. the goods of 



William Broughton, and fixed to a certain building; against the Statute, &c.






WILLIAM BROUGHTON
. I have a stable at Isleworth. I missed a quantity of lead on the 15th of July—I have fitted this lead to it—it is the same—I saw it safe a week before when I was on the stable.





LUKE WEST
. I am a labourer. At half-past six o'clock on Saturday morning, the 15th of July, I was at Hounslow, and saw the two prisoners and another—they had 65lbs. weight of lead—Woodman was carrying it.—I said, "Halloo my lad, you have got some pigeon"—he said, "I am in the habit of going to get iron and bones"—I said, "I don't see any bones or iron"—he put it down against a house where he was going to sell it—I said, "I must see what you have got"—I found this, and I took him—the other boy and Garratt ran away—this was about two miles from the prosecutor's.

Garratt. You did not see it with me. Witness. Yes, I saw you give it to Woodman.






WILLIAM KILBEY
. I came out of Mr. Goddard's yard about half-fast six o'clock—I saw Garratt running away, and West called to me to stop him.

Woodman's Defence. I was going up the road, and met a man who asked if we would buy this lead—I paid him 4s. for it.

Garratt's Defence. I was out mushrooming, and I met this boy in the road, and saw him talk to a man—I saw him take 4s. out of his pocket, and give it for the lead, and he went across the road, and this man took him—I did not have it at all—I thought he was running after me because I was tresspassings.

GARRATT—

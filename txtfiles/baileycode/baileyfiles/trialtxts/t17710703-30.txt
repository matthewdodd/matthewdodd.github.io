            . I was at the Three Crowns, in Drury-lane


, last Tuesday morning, between four and five-o'clock; I had been to dinner with an acquaintance, and had got fuddled: I went to sleep there and lost my hat.

            . I am a watchman; my partner and I went into the Three Crowns to get a pot of purl about four in the morning; the prosecutor was sleeping upon a bench; I saw the prisoner put his left hand up upon his elbow against the clock, and take the prosecutor's hat off his head; he shuffled about some time; I thought they were acquainted, so I let him alone; after some time he shuffled the hat under his coat, and at last ran out. I took the hat from under his coat.
The hat produced and deposed to by the prosecutor)
Prisoner's Defence.
I was going out of town that morning; the evening before I went to take leave of my brother; I got in liquor; I wandered up to that house; they took me before I went out of the room; the prosecutor lay his head upon my back and went to sleep; whether I had it or no I can't say, I was so in liquor.

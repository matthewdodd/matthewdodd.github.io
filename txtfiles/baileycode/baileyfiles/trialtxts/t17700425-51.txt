            . On the 27th of March, about eight at night, I was at Holborn Bridge


, going up the hill. I belong to the excise. I had put my rule on my handkerchief in my pocket. The prisoner in snatching my handkerchief out, made the rule strike against my thigh. I turned round, and catched him with my handkerchief in his hand; he was just going to drop it; it fell on the ground. I took it up; it was a linen handkerchief. The prisoner said, he never did so before.

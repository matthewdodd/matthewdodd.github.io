JOSEPH DANIELS
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the

ANN HOLDEN
. I am the wife of James Holden. I was at a fishmonger's, in Thames-street, on the 30th of July—I had 1s. 6d. in my pocket—I received information, and missed it—I saw the prisoner running down a gateway, and ran after him—I did not lose sight of him.





GEORGE ROBERT WINCH
. I am assistant to Mr. Chaplin, a fishmonger, in Lower Thames-street. I saw the prisoner take his hand out of the prosecutrix's pocket—I told her of it.

Cross-examined by
MR. PAYNE. Q. Where were you standing? At the shop-door—I had never seen the prisoner before—he was there a very short time—he ran down Nicholson's Wharf—there were other persons running as well—he had on black trowsers and a blouse, and a black silk handkerchief—I am positive he is the man—I ran after him, and never lost sight of him.





PHILIP COOK
. I am a smith. I heard a cry of "Stop thief," and saw the prisoner running—I saw him throw something away, and picked it up—it was a shilling and sixpence.

Cross-examined. Q. Are you sure the prisoner is the person? A. Yes—I did not lose sight of him—I was up to him almost directly he was stopped—there were a great many persons running after him—I have been six months in the employ of Mr. Pillington, of Earl-street, Black-friars.






DAVID EVANS
. I am a policeman. I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction—(read)—he is the person.




GUILTY

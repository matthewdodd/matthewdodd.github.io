SUSANNAH ELIZABETH SMITH
. I am sister-in-law to Thomas John Sinclair, who keeps a china and glass warehouse in Old-street. On the 26th of October, the prisoner came to ask the price of two figures in the window—my attention was taken to a person at the door, and as I turned I saw the prisoner drop his hand—I said, "You have taken something"—he denied it—I said, "You have, don't tell me a story"—I took hold of his hand, and saw a paper in his pocket—I took it, and it contained these twenty-four large glass drops, which are my brother-in-law's, and had been on the counter.

Prisoner. I took them out of my pocket myself.




GUILTY
. Aged 15.—


Transported for Seven Years.—Convict Ship.

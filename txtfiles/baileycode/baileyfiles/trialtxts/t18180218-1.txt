WILLIAM WILSON. I am a private in the Coldstream Regiment of Foot Guards
, the prisoner was in the same regiment. On the 4th of December I left my knapsack, which contained the articles stated in the indictment, at a public-house; I went on guard at nine o'clock, I returned at two, and missed it, Hubbard said a man, whom he described, had been for it; before that I had seen the prisoner come out of the back-door, with a bundle under his arm; I ran out and overtook him in York-street, with the bundle, he saw me and dropped it-it contained my things.
JOHN HUBBARD. I keep the house. On the 4th of December the prisoner came in and asked for Wilson's knapsack, saying, that he was confined for abusing the sergeant; I went up to the room with him - He took the prosecutor's knapsack away.

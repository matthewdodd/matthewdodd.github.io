            . I am errand-boy to the prosecutor - he is a batter. On the 30th of April I took six hats out of the window. and put them on the counter; the next morning I missed one, and told my master - I told the prisoner of it; she said she knew my master had lost a hat, and that he was very vexed about it.
WILLIAM OSBORN (Police-constable E 38). I went with Mr. Eness to his house, and questioned the prisoner - she quite denied this at first, but at last pointed the hat out in a cupboard in the back kitchen, tied up in this handkerchief; she said she took it, but why she did not know.(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner. I brought it down to take a pattern; I wrapped it up in the handkerchief, and for fear of my master knowing it, I put it by.

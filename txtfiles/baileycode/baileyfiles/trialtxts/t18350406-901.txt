GEORGE TAYLOR
. I am a musician. On the 13th of March, at a quarter before seven o'clock, I was at the corner of King-street—I felt something at my pocket, and missed my handkerchief—I saw the prisoner on the opposite side, putting his foot on the curb-stone—I went and accused him of it—he said he was innocent—I said he should go to the station-house—

he said, "Very willingly"—when he got a short distance, he struggled very violently, and I saw him put his hand behind him—he dropped the handkerchief when I got him to the corner of Snow-hill, and the officer came and took him.

Prisoner's Defence (written.) Passing through King-street, Snow-hill, my prosecutor came up to me, and said I had got his handkerchief—I told him I had not—he immediately took me by the arm, and we walked twenty or thirty yards from the spot where he accused me with having his handkerchief—by this time there was a mob collected about us—I was then on the curb-stone, and the prosecutor going to the side of the house, picked up a handkerchief, which he said was his—he stated before the magistrate, that he never saw his handkerchief in my possession, but that he only suspected me.




GUILTY
. Aged 19.—


Transported for Seven Years.

I was shopman to the prosecutors at that time: on Wednesday, the 25th of March, about half past eleven, the prisoners came in, and asked to look at some Irish cloth, the same they had on the Tuesday before; they came together, and both asked for two yards of Irish cloth; accordingly I pulled down a piece, and cut them two yards of it; afterwards they asked to look at some muslins; they did not pay for the cloth; I put it on one side; there was another young man in the shop shewing the muslins; he is not here.
Court. Is he alive and well; that young man? - Yes; but he has nothing to do with this business; I shewed them the muslins; the young man was shewing muslins to another lady: they asked the price of the top piece of muslin? I told them five shillings and six-pence; the woman desired me to cut a yard; they came together, the same as man and wife; I knew nothing to the contrary; turning myself round I perceived the woman fumbling with her hands under her apron; the man prisoner asked her what she wasdoing; she said, she was feeling for her handkerchief; Phillips asked her if she wanted any thing else? she said, yes; Phillips desired me to shew her some more; but I took no notice of what he said, but took the wrapper, and put it on one side, being of opinion she had stolen some: I sent for my master; I immediately came back to the linen shop, where I left the prisoners, and found Trotter was gone; I had still stronger suspicions that she had stolen something; and I enquired of Phillips, who was in the shop, where she was gone? he said, he knew nothing about her, the prosecutor and I pursued her; we took her in Bowyer's court, a very small distance from our house; we brought her back, and found the property upon her, which is here; it has been in my custody ever since; it is the property of

            ; I know it by their private marks, O. R. it is my own writing; there is seventeen yards of it; it is muslin; it cost fifty shillings; it was under her cloak; I saw Mr. Worthy take it from under her cloak, after she was brought back to the silk shop: this piece was in the same wrapper with that I cut the yard from.
When you saw her hand under her apron was she stooping? - Rather so; I was behind the counter; the wrapper was on one side of me; the movement of her hands was the first thing that induced me to think she had taken something: the prisoners were taken before a magistrate, and committed: they conversed together as man and wife; he purchased a gown for her at our shop, which she had on.

            . As soon as I returned my man told me his suspicion of the man and woman; I told him to look sharp after them, and I followed him into the linen shop; then the woman was off; I and my man went after her, and brought her back; she had the two muslins, one on each side of her; and she said, there are your muslins, and it is my first offence. The property is mine; it has my private marks on.
Prisoner Trotter. He promised to favour me if I would confess.
Court to Prosecutor. Did you or not promise to shew her any favour? - I did not.
Prisoner Phillips. I am innocent of the affair.
PRISONER TROTTER's DEFENCE.
To the Right Honourable Lord Judge. I take leave, my Lord, being brought before you to be tried for what I am innocent of: I hope I shall not offend you, or any of the gentlemen of this Court, in producing this, my defence, in declaring myself Not Guilty. I am brought before you for stealing some muslin that I had given me, as a present; I hereby declare myself innocent of knowing it to be stolen; therefore, as I am a stranger, poor and distressed, having no one to plead my cause, but God, I leave myself to your Lordship, flattering myself I shall have some mercy shewn me by the Court, which is all the humble desire of the prisoner at the bar,

            . This man, Phillips, hired me as a servant, in Bristol, and asked me one day to go and take a walk, and asked me to have a present of some wearing apparel; he had promised me a muslin gown; he took me into this shop, and he handed me that gentleman's property; and as he was handing it to me it fell down, and I picked it up; I did not put it any ways out of sight, but put it under my arm, till I got out of the shop, and some way down the street; I did not know this man was a thief; when he gave it me he told me to go forward, and he would overtake me.
Court to Bixley. Did any thing of this kind happen? - Not in the least.
And the account you have given in is the truth? - It is; he might do it when my back was turned.

Did you hear him tell her to go out, and he would follow her? - I heard him say that; but he bought only one yard.

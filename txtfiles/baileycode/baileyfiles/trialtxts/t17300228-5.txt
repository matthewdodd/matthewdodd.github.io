            , the 11th of February
 last.
It appear'd by the Evidence, that the Prisoner being seen with the Cheese, and suspected to have stol'n it, was apprehended, upon which he threw the Cheese into the middle of the Street, and the Shopkeeper claiming it, he was committed to Prison. The Prisoner pleaded, that he was desired to carry the Cheese by a Boy, who was carrying that, and some other Things; but this Pretence not availing him, the Jury found him 

               Guilty
            .

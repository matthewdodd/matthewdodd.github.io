HANNAH ABRAHAMS
. I live in Newcastle-court—my husband's name is Abrahams—my gown was hanging at the door in the kitchen when I went to bed at twelve o'clock at night, on the 20th of July, and in the morning it was gone—this is it—the shawl is not mine—I know nothing of the prisoner.





GEORGE WALTON
 (police-sergeant F 6.) On the 21st of July, a little before six o'clock in the morning, I was watching, and saw the prisoner get from the area, take something and put it into his bag—I did not know what it was—I searched him and found this gown—he had this stick—I asked him what he had got—he said some bones—he was in the act of taking something off this stick—I found four nails and two strings on him—this shawl was in the bundle, and this shawl and handkerchief were in his hat—I found two hooks in his pocket.





MARY WELSH
. This shawl and handkerchief are mine.

            . I am servant to the Hon. Mr. 
               
                  Charles 
                  York 
               



            ; there was a gold cock pheasant and a hen taken out of his menagerie in his garden at Highgate


, on the 7th of April; (produced in court) these are the same, I know them well.

            . I am Mr. Yorke's gardener; on the 7th of April I found the menagerie door open; it seemed as if it had been been forced open by an iron instrument, and the cock and hen pheasant gone; I am very sure these are the same here produced.


                  Joseph 
                  Rowe 
               



            , a salesman in Newgate-market, deposed, that on the 7th of April at night, the prisoner produced these two pheasants to him, who carried them to Mr. James in Holbourn, who dealt in such things; that Mr. James told him he had just received intelligence there were such stole, the property of the prosecutor.
Mr. James confirmed the account given by Mr. Rowe. The prisoner in his defence said he catched them in a wilderness by the road-side, near Highgate.

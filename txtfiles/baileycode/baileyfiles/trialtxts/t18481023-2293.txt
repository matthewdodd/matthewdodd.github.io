THOMAS POWELL
. In April last I joined the Chartist Association. I do not remember on what day—the association was divided into different localities in London—I belonged to the Cripplegate locality, the place of meeting for which was at Cartwright's Coffee-house, Redcross-street, Cripplegate, in a front room on the first floor—the affairs of that locality were conducted by a council of five persons—I was appointed by that council to attend a meeting of a committee at the Black Jack, in Portugal-street—it was called the secret committee—I have notes that I made from time to time of the transactions that I witnessed—that meeting at the Black Jack was on Thursday, July 20—when I got there I found Payne, Brewster, Rose, Mullins, Dowling, Allnut, a delegate from Greenwich, and others, amounting altogether to fourteen assembled—I did not then know the name of the delegate from Greenwich; I have since discovered it was Davis—I do not think I have any recollection of the persons' names who attended the meeting, except from this paper—sometimes I made the memorandum two days after the meeting, and at the latter part of the meetings I took care to put it down when I got home on the same night—I always did it within a day or two after—I got there about nine o'clock in the evening—I was asked for my credentials—I attended as a delegate from the Cripplegate locality—I stated that I was one of the council appointed to attend there as a delegate—I produced my credential, which was a leaf torn out of a book which I had received from Mr. Bezer, the secretray of the Cripplegate locality—I gave the half to Payne, who was chairman, and he compared it with a book he had in his hand it corresponded with the leaves in that book, and he said, "That will do"—each delegate was called on to give a report of the feelings of the members of his locality, and the number of fighting men, and now they were disposed for a physical-force movement—each delegate made a return of the kind—I have not a note of the number, but I remember that the number I gave in was eighty or ninety—I do not remember the numbers given in by of the others—some papers and credentials, and leaves of a book in which the names of people were kept who had attended other secret meetings, were burnt at the gas—at that meeting a committee of five was elected as a plotting committee, to draw up five plans of action—those five

plans were to he produced to the general body of delegates at the next meeting, and the best of those five plans was to be selected and acted on—the five persons appointed were Payne, Brewster, Rose. Mullins, and Dowling—the meeting was then adjourned to Denny's Coifee-house, Great St. Andrews-street, Seven-dials, on the following Sunday, the 23rd—I got there about ten, and found Mullins, Rose, Dowlining and Breuster there—Payne went with me—we remained there about an hour before the general meeting of delegates took place—Mullins had a pocket-book and a map of London lying on the table, and there were other plans—each of them had pipers in their hands, and were busy in conversation—I did not see the papers that the others had, except one plan—I had a perfect view of it—that was a plan of the Seven Dials—I saw Dowling take the plan into his hands, and he said he thought he could not undertake the management of the Seven Dials—he then returned the plan to Mullins, who put it into his pocket-book, and put the pocket-book into his pocket—I do not recollect that anything was said about the other plans or papers which the other members had—it was not said at ill what the other plans were—I do not recollect it—Payne took the chair at this committee—I recollect him saying, "Gentlemen, our object is to destroy the power of the Queen, and, if possible, to establish a republic"—there was a general concurrence in that observation—there was some conversation about assassinating the police—Rose said, "We must first assassinate the police, burn down the station-houses, and build barricades"—there was some conversation about pouring vitriol into the policemen's faces—I cannot say who made use of that observation, but I think it was with Rose and Brewster—those suggestions seemed to be generally concurred in—I saw one plan distinctly, this is it (produced, marked "A")—it is the one produced by Mullins, and shown to Dowling, and put by Mullins into his pocket again—a resolution was passed to admit the general body of delegates, after which they were admitted into the same room—five came in, and there were then ten present, including myself—I know Allnut—he was there, and came from Hopkinson's locality, which is Saffron-hill—when the other people were admitted, Mullins remarked that the plans were not sufficiently mtured for their inspection—a report was then given in by the new delegates who then attended of the number of fightingmen, and the feelings of the members of their locality—they were similar reports to those which had been before made—arrangements were then made to meet at Cartwright's the same evening—I went, and found Payne, Mullins, Rose, and Brewster there—they all went into a small back room, on the landing of a staircase that goes down into the back kitchen—they did not admit me with them—I waited until they came out again—they were in there about an hour—the next meeting I attended was at Hopkinson's Coffee-house, Saffron-hill, on Wednesday, July 26th—that meeting was in consequence of arrangements made on the Sunday—Dowling, Rose, Mullins, myself, Davis, Ferdinando, Allnut, Flanagan, and others, in all eighteen, were present—it was Ferdinando's first appearace—he stated he was a delegate from the Green Gate, Hackney-road—the fresh delegates gave in their credentials—I think they were not of the same kind as I had given, but written credentials—reports were received of the number of fighting-men from their localities, and how far they were disposed for a physical force movement; the same kind of reports as before—a resolution was then passed that Rose should wait on the Northern Star Newspaper Office, and put in an advertisement, calling on all the localities of Chartists and Irish Confederates to send one or two delegates to attend a meeting on the next Tuesday, at the Dispatch Coffee-house, Bride-lane, Fleet-street—

that was adopted—delegates from the Irish Confederates attended the Chartist meetings—it was announced by one or two that evening, that they were from the Irish Confederates—Dowling was one of them—I have not got the names of the others—a resolution was then passed that 10s. should be brought hy every delegate—I have no note of it, I speak from memory—the meeting adjourned to the following Friday, July 25th, at the same place—fourteen persons attended—Ferdinando, Page of Tothill-street, Westminster; Brewster, Rose, Mullins, Payne, myself, and Hopkinson and Fay, Irish Confederates, Flannagan and Home—I believe it was on this occasion that a resolution was passed that 10s. should be brought by every delegate, to pay to the committee for their purposes—a report was given in by the new delegates of the feelings of the members of their localities, and of the number of fighting-men that could be depended on—some new delegates joined at that time—we adjourned, to meet at Cartwright's on July 30th—I attended there—there were twenty-eight persons present, the prisoner, Payne, Rose, Dowling, Fay, Bassett, and others—Bassett was a new delegate, and also a person named Stevenson—reports were given in from the new delegates, as before, and the committee of five, the plotting committee, resigned, in consequence of a charge being brought against Rose and Mullins that they were spies, and Mullins stated that they thought the committee had better consist of nine; they thought they would be better able to carry out the objects of the committee, and each member was to draw up his plan of operation—nothing was said on that occasion as to what sort of men were to be added to the committee—Payne, Rose, Mullins, Bassett, and Dowling were then elected on the committee, and the other four were to be elected at the next meeting—Rose and Mullins were re-elected, notwithstanding the suggestion that they were spies—the general body of delegates were to elect the—other four—on the evening that the five were elected the committee was called the ulterior committee—a resolution was passed that they should meet, if necessary, on the following Monday, at Cartwright's; but there was no meeting, to my knowledge—the next meeting I attended was on Tuesday, Aug. 1st, at the Dispatch coffee-house—there were thirty-four delegates present—the prisoner, Rose, Brewster, Dowling, Bezer, myself, Fay, Thompson, and Donovan—it was Bezer's first appearance—that is the same man I have spoken of as having given me my credentials—Lynch was there, and I have put down Fussey, or Fusson, Warry, and Allnui—returns were made on this occasion similar to the former ones—Bezer returned the number of fifty from our locality—I knew a club or society at that time called the Irish Felon-club; it was held at Cartwright's; Fay was secretary—I do not remember that there was a Star Club—there might have been a club called the Davis Club at Cartwright's; I have heard it spoken of, and the Star Club, too, and the Emmett Brigade, the Wat Tyler, and the Tom Paine localities; I have heard them spoken of at various times—delegates from those societies attended our meetings—at this meeting some conversation took place about a feeling of jealousy prevailing on the part of the Irish Confederates, and some of them said they thought it was not fair that the committee should be composed of Englishmen alone—after a discussion, Fay, Thompson, Donovan, and Lynch, were appointed—they were all four Irish Confederates; they were added to the five to form the ulterior committee—there was then a discussion about sending a delegate to Limerick, or' Cork, and some of them made some objections to it, and said it would be a waste of time and money; it was impossible to send a delegate there to obtain any news, on account of the disturbed state of the country, and the authorities had set such a strict watch,

so that no person could come away with any information—the proposition was abandoned—a proposal was made by Douling that there should be a demonstration by the Chartists and Confederates on Primrose-hill at two o'clock on the following Sunday, 6th Aug.—that was lost by a majority of five—instead of that it was resolved that the delegates should return to their localities, and ascuitain how their members were for regulanty of conduct and preparation for the coming event, and they were to ascertain if they were ready to be called out at an hour's notice—money was paid in in pursuarnce of the previous resolution—I paid 7s. 6d. in—Mullins said he had seen Mr. kydd that day, and he had said if the people came out for physical force he would not be backward in heading them—Mullins said that Kydd said he had entered the executive only as a moral force man, and on that ground had taken office—that statement was received by the meeting with satisfaction and surprise—I knew Kydd as a member of the executive that sat in John-street, Fitzroy-square—we then adjourned to Friday, the 4tb, at Cartwright's—I attended; there were thirty-two present, Payne, Rose, Brewster, Gurney, Mullins, Donovan, Lynch, Dowling, and others—there had been a meeting of the committee an hour before that, at which the prisoner was, present, and Rose, and Bassett—it was said at that committee that Kydd had received a circular from Manchester, requesting to know how far the committee of delegates were disposed to send a delegate to Manchester, and that they had also received similar circulars at the Northern Star-office—the committee determined to send a person, and Lacey's name was mentioned—Bassett was proposed to wait on Lacey, for the purpose of his going to Manchester—I saw Mullins give Bassett the money into his hand for that purpose—there was some conversation about the scarfs that should be worn, as signs of officership, by the committee; and it was decided that it should be a red calico sash—the thirty-two delegates were then admitted, and reports were then given from the new delegates the same as before, and monies paid in by different delegates—a resolution was passed that the whole of the delegates should submit to the determination of the ulterior committee—there was some conversation about an advertisement put into the Northern Star by a person named Dwaine, calling a meeting at Kennington-common; that was objected to by the Chartist body in general; it was considered that that meeting was not called by a real Chartist, and a resolution was come to that the delegates should call on their respective localities, and request the members to meet at their localities on that afternoon, and they were to wait until the return of the delegates from the meeting at the Dispatch coffee-house, and they were to take care to secure their members from attending at Kennington-common—the delegates were to be at the Dispatch coffee-house—a resolution was passed that each delegate should select four men as telegraphs, to be stationed from Bride-lane to kennington-common on the following Sunday—they were to be stationed at intervals, to keep up a communication between Kennington-common and the Dispatch coffee-house, in case of any conflict between the police and the people—I attended the meeting at the Dispatch coffee-house on the Sunday—I have made no memorandum of the number present, but I believe it was about twenty-four or twenty-five—I was appointed to station the men as telegraphs—I was occupied nearly all the afternoon in arranging them; we could not get them to work—when I returned the business in discussion was just on the close—Page of Tothill-street, Mullins, Rose, Brewster, and others, were there—Page was speaking about giving Mr. Bond Hughes, the Government reporter, a good thrashing for what he had reported—it was arranged to meet on Monday night, 7th Aug., at Denny's coffee-house, Seven

Dials—I attended; there were about thirty present—all the members of the ulterior committee were there—Cuffey was present, and Ritchie—there was some conversation about the reports in the newspapers of Smith O'Brien's arrest in Ireland, and a feeling of jealousy on the part of five of the ulterior committee in not having seen the plans of the other four—Mullins explained that he had some doubts and want of confidence in the other four; he had not seen their plans; and some others expressed a similar opinion—there was then a resignation of the ulterior committee—they then proceeded to elect another committee, and five only were appointed, Rose, Mullins, Brewster, Payne, and Bassett—there was a vote taken to furnish a salary of three farthings a head, by every member of the localities, to pay a president—one or two asked who this president was—a proposition was made by a delegate that there should be a president, and that one of the five of the committee that had received the lowest number of votes was to retire, and the president take his place—a question was asked who he was, and it was answered he was neither in London nor out of London; he was a sort of visionary president—on future occasions there were many questions asked who he was, and what was his name—it was conceived by some of the delegates as well as myself that he was to be a visionary president, we could not find out whether he was a person or who he was—we could get no information about him—a letter was read by Mr. Payne at that meeting, and the words used in it were "Trade is very good, and you will soon receive a good order"—he stated that it was from Lacey, at Manchester; that was received by the meeting with some degree of satisfaction, because that was the first we had heard of Lacey since he had been sent—a resolution was passed that they should meet on Wednesday, 9th Aug., at the Lord Denman beer-shop, in Suffolk-street, Blackfriars-read—I attended—there were twenty-eight persons there—Mullins was there, Rose, Donovan, and others—reports were given in from the new delegates of the feelings of the members of their localities—Payne was in the chair—Mullins was vice-chairman, at least he acted as such—he was chief spokesman on that occasion, and generally acted as vice-chairman—I think he sat at the head of the table, facing the chairman—Mullins was on all occasions chief spokesman—at this meeting Mullins called on the different delegates there to declare their allegiance to the determination of the committee to risk all for the good of the people; and all with the exception of one delegate gave in their adherence to the committee, that they were determined to risk all for the cause, for the good of the people—another letter from Lacey was read by Payne—he had the letter in his hand, and read it—I cannot remember what it was about—a question was asked how long Lacey was to remain in the country; and it was answered that he would continue there as long as necessary—I believe it bad been asked whether they had heard from Lacey; and Payne said he had received a letter from him; and he read it—a man named Gurney was there—he Has a wardsman of the Cripplegate locality—he was formerly in the artillery—he gave in his return of fighting-men as 100—a wardsman or warden has 100 men under him, and there were class-leaders over every ten men—I am not certain whether it was nine men and himself, or ten men and himself, or whether the warden was over 100 besides himself, or with himself—we adjourned, to meet at Perry's coffee-house on Friday, 11th Aug., in Church-street, Shoreditch—I went there at eight o'clock, the time appointed—I found no meeting—I was informed by a person there that there was no meeting—a was a person I well knew, but not his name—he was not a person stationed there—he appealed to me to be occupied by packing up some chairs—he had been stationed with me as one of the telegraphs on a former occasion

—he told me that there was no meeting; that it was all up—the police had been to Hose's house, and seized all his papers—on hearing that, I returned home—the next meeting I attended was at the Orange Tree, Red Lion-square, on Monday night, 14th Aug.—there were about twenty-five persons there, there might be one or two more—Payne was in the chair—Mullins was there, Cuffey, Brewster, Gurney, Fay, Ritchie, and others—reports were given in by the new delegates as before—a return was given in of the number of ball-cartridges that each delegate in his locality had prepared, or that he knew of—it was Mullins that asked us to give in that return—I do not remember the number—the number of fighting-men were given in, and put down by Payne—Mullins looked over the list, and stated the number as 5000—some one asked the number of Confederates, and they said about the same number—nothing was said about the number of other persons—Mullins proposed that each delegate should select four or six men from each locality for a particular purpose—some delegate asked what they were for; and Cuffey, who sat on the left of Payne, said that it was to set fire to houses, railway premises, trains, or anything—Mullins said, "If I look up at the gas, you will know what I mean"—Mullins asked every one the number of men they could find—he asked me—I said I could find two—each gave a number, but I forget it—it was proposed that as there Was come dispute between the North Western Railway engineers and the Company, that a deputation of two should wait on the engineers to ascertain their views, and how far they were disposed to come over and assist the Chartists in the movement—Ritchie and Scurry were named as delegates, and left for that purpose, and 1s. 6d. was given them to get refreshment—I am not sure whether that was Scurry's first night there, but I believe not—he was a delegate—a resolution was passed to meet at the Lord Den man on the following Tuesday—I went to that meeting—the prisoner was there—Payne, Brewster, Cuffey, Ritchie, Fay, Gurney, Lacey, and others, about forty altogether—I remember Lacsy, in the course of conversation, telling some of us, in a corner of the room, that the men of Birmingham and Manchester, and I think he said Liverpool, were up, or would be up and doing that night—he said that the police had been watching him all day, and that on his coming out of the street door, a boy came up to him and told him that the police were watching him, and that he had been watched for about two hours, and gave the police the double, and reached that place in safety—there was a distribution of tri-coloured wristbands by Brewster, to be worn on the left wrist, that the members of their locality might distinguish their leaders—I think Mullins distributed some, but I am not positive—he was present at the time of the distribution—some of the ulterior committee came in, and as the room up stairs was occupied by a singing party, there was a question raised where they could have a room convenient for the ulterior committee to consult and come to their resolutions—Lacey said, "There is a friend of mine, a coffee-house keeper, in the neighbourhood, I think we can get a room there, and I will go and see if we can have it"—he left, came back in about ten minutes, and said they could have a room, and then he left with the ulterior committee—Mullins was one of those who accompanied him, and Cuffey also—they were gone about three-quarters of an hour—they then all came back but Lacey—Cuffey was at that time acting as secretary to the committee, and on their return he said, addressing Mullins, "Now, Mr. Chairman, you had better give the instructions"—Mullins then took up his position at the head of the table, stood up, and addressed all present, "Gentlemen, as the Committee have retired, and come to certain resolutions and decisions, they

have requested me to give you the following instructions; and as our friend Mr. Laeey has informed us, and we have no reason to doubt the correctness of his statement, that the men of Birmingham and Manchester are up and doing, or will be up am) doing to-night, to-morrow night you must come out to fight and strike the blow; it is necessary you should speak out honestly and boldly, for there must be no flinching in the matter"—Cuffey then said, "Mr. Chairman, you had better put the question round the room, and let them answer yes or no; my time is short, my men are waiting; I take the western division"—Mullins then asked the delegate sitting next to me whether he would come out to fight—he said, "Yes"—he then appealed to me, and I said, "Yes"—he appealed to all rour, 'd till he came to Ferdinando, who rose up and made a sort of speech, and gave an explanation why he would not, and said he would not, and also another one who sat next to Allnut—with those two exceptions they all said yes—after that had been gone through, Mullins said every delegate must assemble the members of his locality at their localities at eight o'clock to-morrow night, and they were to come armed—a question was abked, how were they to come with their poles and pikes? and Mullins said, "I can only say they must get them there the best way they can"—he said, "We shall take up four positions; Mr. Brewster will take Clerkenu ell-green, Mr. Payne will take the Tower-haralets, and myself and Mr. Bassett will take the Broadway, Westminster, and Seven-dials"—I am not certain which of the two was to take either—Mullins said the delegates were to come armed, and every delegate was to be with his members at their respective positions, at twenty minutes past nine to a second—he also proposed that Ritchie should be the man appointed to superintend and direct the men for firing; and it was put and carried that he should he the person—Ritchie was present—he did not object to it—I do not think he said anything—it was proposed that they should meet at the Orange Tree, at five—that was carried—a question was put, how were these men to know Ritchie? and some delegate proposed the words "Frost" and "Mitchell" as a pass-word—it was afterwards proposed that the word "Justice" should be the pass-word; and that was carried—that pass-word was to be used by every man when he went into the room and opened the door, and Ritchie was to ask "Who do you want? What do you want?" and they were to make use of the word "Justice," and by that word Ritchie would know them—Mullins then asked every delegate round the room how many fire-men he had selected—I think the person next to me gave in his number—he appealed to me, and 1 said two—I had spoken to one—he then went round the room, and Payne put down the number on a piece of paper—forty-six was the number—almost the last words Mullins said were, "May God's bitterest curse hang on the soul of that man who shall betray any one of us"—the ribbands that were distributed were exactly like this (produced)—I was at a meeting next day, Wednesday, 16th Aug., at the Crispin, in Milton-street—it was arranged on the Tuesday evening, at the Lord Denman, that the different districts should meet their respective leaders; the City district, the Finsbury and Cripplegate locality, and some other districts, were all included in one, and were all to meet Brewster at the Crispin at twelve in the day, to receive further instructions: that was what was called the Clerkenwell district—I got there about a quarter to one, and found eight or ten there—Brewster was there, and Fay and Gurney—Brewster said that he meant to attack the Artillery-ground, and if possible to take it—he said that they would have to fight b—y hard; and he also said that Ritchie said he would shoot the first man that flinched from his duty—he said we should know by four o'clock

whether the Government had any intimation of what was going on—there was a man there with Brewster who I had seen before; he was packing up the chairs, and said there was to be no meeting—Brewster pointed to him, and said, "That man will come to you and bring you instructions; he is to be your attendant on Clerkenwell-green; you need not be alarmed at not seeing the signals for half an hour or so; they are to be bonfires."

Cross-examined by
MR. PARRY. Q. Have you used the word "bonfires" before? A. I do not remember—I believe I am thirty-four or thirty-five years old—I went by the name of Johnson in the Chartist body from the time I entered, which was shortly after April 10th—I do not remember whether I had any communication with the police before I entered—I may have and forgotten it—it was about the time I joined—I entered, to ascertain what was going on, and to communicate it—I communicated with the police from the beginning—I do not think I did before I entered—the only other name I have been called is Robinson, and I said, "Call me what name you like"—it was indifferent to me—I may have said, "My name is not Robinson, it is Johnson"—before 1 joined, I was working for Mr. Smith, my brother-in-law—the week before, I worked for a gentleman who wanted me to complete a roof—I have worked for Mr. Smith ten or eleven years, except when I had a job occasionally—I have attended a race-course—I was an apprentice, my master asked me if I should like to go to the races, and said it would be a holiday for me—I went by his inducement—I went into a gambling-booth—I was there three or four days—I went out of the booth several times to see the races—I was paid 30s. for it—I played, but it was only pretence—I was never at a race before, and was quite ignorant of the nature of it—I was getting 14s. a week from my master, to the best of my memory—it was rather a good job, for I was not out of my time—I acted as a decoy—my master's brother accompanied me, and invited me to go—I was not quite twenty-one years old—that is the only time I haveattended a race-course in any capacity—there is a game called thimble-rig—I have never played at it—the game at the booth was a round ball with coloum on it—I was in ignorance of it—it was a ball put into a sort of box—I pretended to bet—half-crowns were given to me, and I was nodded to now and then to put the half-crowns on the colours—I knew that I was not betting in reality—I never had anything to do with thimble-rig tables—I do not consider that I have been a sporting character—I never speculated one penny about anything—I have gone by the name of the Welsh Novice—it was done more to see the country—it was about eight years ago, at Wimbledon—I walked against a pedestrian, to draw custom to the house—I believe I got some refreshment for it from the landlord—I have also walked in the same way at Woodend, near Croydon—it was partly to bring business to the house, and partly to amuse some cadets there—bets were not laid—it was to try my capabilities—I have also done so at Hounslow—I have not walked a match since that—I have been to New York, because I was ill, but there was some difference between my wife's uncle and me—I left her behind me—she had one child—I was to receive something from my father, and she was to receive it while I was away—I was absent better than three months, and returned—my father never charged me with forgery—I never was guilty of it—I took my own money out of the Bank before I went—to the best of my remembrance it was about 125l.—my father presented me with it—he bad heart of a bargain, three or four houses in the city, and was about to leave that money which he had saved to buy them, on my coming out of my apprenticeship—but instead of my having the bargain, my brother-in-law purchased the houses, and my father put the money he had into the East Anglian Mine, and allowed

me to have it in my own name—it was not in his name as well—I did not mention to my wife that I was going to America, or to my father—I did to one or two private friends—I had a family on my hands, and was mentally and bodily ill—it preyed on my spirits—I know Henry Watson—I do not remember meeting him on my return from America—I do not think it likely that I asked him if he knew what bad taken me there; it was a private matter—I do not believe he said he heard I had gone in consequence of a forgery on my father—I do not think I said that was the reason, and I wished it had been for doable the sum—I should think it a waste of time to enter into conversation with a person of that description—he robbed my brother-in-law of a whitewash brush a little time ago—I was in connection with the police seven years ago—I have come forward as a witness before, on public grounds, as I have on this occasion—some of the swell mob, from Seven-dials, picked a gentleman's pocket of a purse, in St. Paul's-churchyard, I watched their movements, and had them apprehended; and at the same time there were three other parties, for stealing an umbrella from a pawnbroker's shop in Coleman-street—I watched them, and had them taken—I have never been with the police to watch persons passing bad money—I do not believe I met Watson near Hoxton, and told him I wanted him, as some one had been passing bad coin, nor when he declined, say, "Oh! you will get 3s. 6d. a day for your time if you do "—I do not remember what I got for my time as a witness, it is so long back—I do not know whether this is my ribbon—I gave mine to a gentleman I was in communication with—I know Alfred Carr; he was one of my shop-mates, but was discharged by my brother-in-law—I recollect his carrying me to a Chartist meeting at Temple Bar—I never said if I had a chance I would rip the police's b----y guts out with a chisel—I did not show Carr how I would do it—I had no tool of the kind at all—I was not a Chartist at all—my mind was differently occupied—that was some years back—I did not in Carr's presence have a quarrel with my father because he refused to give me some money—my father struck me, I pushed him back to preserve myself, and my brother-in-law came and separated us—Carr came here and assailed my character, and he is a most infamous character, he was discharged by my brother-in-law; my sister's life was in danger through him—I did not in Carr's presence exclaim to my father, "You old b----r, I will murder you," and rush at him, strike him with my fist, and knock him on the bench—Can did not catch hold of me, and drag me away—I made some observations to him, and he went to bis bench to work—I know Thomas Osborne—I never talked to him or any one about a Chartist rising—I pointed out to him a man who would make him a pike; I do not believe I urged him to join the Chartists—there was a meeting at Birdcage-walk on a Sunday morning, and a man named Smith, who frequented Cartwright's locality, was there, who made pikes—I told Osborne he did so; another man, named Hook, had paid him 18d. for a pike, and had not received it; and the conversation sprung up so—I know Richard Pennell—I have not said in his presence that I would swear anything if I was paid for it, or that when I was a witness here I was afraid they would get hold about the thimble-rigging, and I would not go as a witness again, for I only got 3s. 6d. a day from the police, and that was not enough, for I could get more money from the thieves—I did not show him three or four half-crowns, and say, "This is what I made out of them last night"—I never asked him to meet me at Cartwright's, or say that delegates would be chosen in about a fortnight to agitate the country, and he could propose me as one, and I could get 2l. or 3l. a week, which would be better than starving at Smith's—I would not

enter into conversation with him, or with any of the men in the shop, because they are such bad characters; I considered they would talk any nonsense by way of wasting time—he did not say the Chartists would never get the Charter by force—I did not reply, "The Government is a weak and b----Government, and we will send Lord John Russell and Sir George Grey to the devil in about a month"—I did not urge him again to join the Chartist movement; I did not say, "Look at the Queen, with her hundreds of thousands a year, spending in waste and idleness, while we are obliged to work from morning to night to get a mouthful of bread"—I never swore I would blow the Queen, the b—y foreigner, and his b—y family to hell; such words never were uttered from my lips—I never asked Pennell to call at any house on Sunday morning, and I would show him materials sufficient to blow London to hell in halt' an hour; I never used the words—I did not threaten him if he did not join with us when the Chartists turned out I would point out where lie lived, and he should have a ball put through him—he was one of my shopmates about eighteen months ago—I was never called Lying Tom to my face, by my shopmates; I should have resented it as an insult—I know James Bennett; I may have attended a public meeting with him in Holborn, and walked home towards Hoxton—I do not recollect asking him whethe he intended to go to Kennington-cornmon on 10th April—I do not think I asked him whether he intended to go armed, but my memory is so deficient—I do not think, when he said, "Certainly not," that I replied, "You area b—y fool if you do not, as I shall go armed;" that sort of language is not likely to proceed from me at all—I may have said something about grenades—I do not remember saying I had been making hand-grenades, on the Monday previously, that would go half through an inch board—I do not remember saying they were easily made; a blacking-bottle was as good as anything, half filled with powder, mixed up with stout nails, and a fusee put into it; and by lighting it, and throwing it among the police, it would break the b—rs' legs, or anything about a blacking-bottle—I would state it at once if I knew it; I do not think I used such words—I do not think I had been making grenades; if said so it must have been a lie—I do not believe I said to Bennett that I had ten men, and with four or five more I could easily take the Artillery-ground, as I had prepared a plan, and my men knew how to spike the artillery—I cannot swear I did not; I should rather think I did not—I know there is such a thing as perjury—I do not recollect Bennett feeling my pockets before I went to Kennington-common to see if I was armed; I cannot swear he did not—I know John Westmoreland I do not remember meeting him at Cartwright's between April and Aug., and talking to him about a project of organization—I do not think I met him at Cartwright's, and said I had a project of organization which I thought would be most desirable for taking London, and carrying out my plan—my memory is not sufficient to enable me to swear—I have no recollection of showing him this rough sketch of a plan (produced)—I swear it is not my drawing—I do not remember meeting George Thurston on the Monday before the 16th Aug.—I do not think I said to him, "I shall want you on Wednesday; you must bring something with you;" or his saying, "I do not understand you"—I swear I did not offer him a pair of pistols for sale; I do not recollect a person of the name—I had not a pair of pistols, and could not offer them—I did not ask him 6s. for them, and offer to give him half a pound of powder into the bargain—I had not a single pistol—I do not know Henry Green—I do not know whether 1 attended a meeting at Birdcage-walk about the middle or end of April; I was there at one or two meetings—I do not recollect going among the people

at the meeting, and asking whether they had got arras—I do not think I asked Green whether he had any arms, nor did he say he did not know the use of arms; nor did I reply, "You are not worth a d—n, as a Chartist, if you have not got arms," I do not believe such words were uttered by me—I cannot swear they were not—I do not believe that after saying that, I went among the crowd, and put the same question to several others; I will not swear it—I do not remember meeting a man outside Cartwright's on Wednesday evening, 16th Aug., inquiring what was the matter, and my saying", "Do not take any notice of me I think it a botched job of these milk-and-water b—rs;" I do not think such words passed my mouth—I do not remember his asking the meaning, and my saying "We expect to have a turn-out to-night"—I remember walking with a man that night, who I spoke to on the subject of firing—I had a pistol with me, and a sword in my side pocket—I was not in the habit of carrying a sword—I did occasionally—I could not tell what parties I might meet with in the public streets of an evening—I carried it to protect myself—I was not in the habit of carrying a pistol—I do not believe I had a pistol or sword as early as 10th April—I cannot swear I had not—I had sixty-eight ball cartridges on me, which I made up for Gurney—I cast the balls, and he made the cartridge-papers—I cannot say how many I made—it may have been ten or twelve dozen—I received 3s. in the presence of Mr. Fowler, one of the council, for getting powder—I had a tin box of percussion caps which I pulled out, and showed to the man I was with—I never said I had 200 fire balls to throw into people's houses—when I showed him the pistol, I may have opened my coat, shown him a sword, and said, "You see I am well prepared, are you?"—I do not think I asked him for his address—I did not know it—I remember making a spike—I believe this is it—(produced)—Brewster produced two of them at one of our meetings—I asked what they were for—he said to cripple infantry and cavalry—he threw it down, and showed me the action of it—when it is thrown this point sticks upwards—I made one like it, showed it to Mr. Mayne, and showed him the action of it—I cannot say whether I said "This is the thing to spike the horses with"—I made it, to ascertain who the parties were that made such things, as a sort of trap—I did not ascertain that any parties were making such things at Cartwright's—I went to Gurney in his cell at the Police-station, and asked him to come and give evidence for the Police, and if he did, he would have one guinea a week for life, or words to that effect—I had no authority to say so—I did it to get him to come forward, on my own account—he was taken out of one cell and put into another that I might communicate with him—I have received 1l. a week—I did not enter into any arrangement as to what remuneration I was to get—I come forward on my own responsibility—I do not expect to get anything—that is as true as everything else I have said—I have a little property to live on.





THOMAS WILSON
. I am landlord of the Black Jack, Portugal-street, Lin-coln's-inn-fields. I know a person named John Rose, a currier—the Curriers' Society, of which he was a member, was held at my bouse every Monday—Rose lived at 9, Clare-court—on Monday, 17th July, Rose came to my house and asked for a room for the Thursday evening following, 20th July—I asked him for what purpose, and he said for a meeting of a Trades Committee—I let him have the room—he came on the Thursday about eight o'clock—he did not bring anybody with him—two other persons came a short time afterwards—in all I think there might have been a dozen came—he said he expected upwards of seventy—I asked why the meeting was to be held so late?

and he told me some of the members had a long way to come, some is far from Greenwich—I saw the persons who came—I knew the members of the Trades Committee that Hose spoke of—not one of them came—Rose said it was for either a meeting of a Trades Committee, or of the Trades Committee, but I understood him to mean of the curriers trade, the members of which I knew—they went up stairs about half-past nine, and they stopped till about eleven.





JAMAM HEATH
. My husband keeps the Temperance coffee-shop, Great Suffolk-street. Borough. The Lord Denman is in the same street—I have known Lacey three or four years—I recollect the day my house was searched—I cannot say whether Lacey was there the night before—he was there about that time either the night before, or the night but one before—four cups of coffee, I think it was, were ordered by him on that occasion—I do not know how many persons came in with him—I do not think that they all Went out together—Lacey remained behind, down stairs—I cannot say how long—I saw him sitting in the front room after the others came down.

THOMAS PRONGAR
 (policeman, A 237). I was appointed with another policeman to watch Lacey, the day before he was taken—he came out of a house in Stratton-ground, and went to the house of a neighbour, named Constable—he left there and went home again—he came out again shortly after, went down Stratton-ground towards Orchard-street, and when hewas about half way between his house and Orchard-street, Constable's boy ran to him, and spoke to him—Constable's boy knew that I was a policeman—I was in plain clothes—when the boy spoke to Lacey he turned round, and looked towards me, and went down Orchard-street into Cooper-street, and New Tothill-street, and I then left the other constable to watch him—that might be a direct way to the Lord Denman.





GEORGE DAVIS
. I am a boot-maker, at Straits Mouth, Greenwich. I joined a Chartist Association, called the "Wat Tyler Brigade there, on—24th May, I think it was—it was held at the Druid's Arms in Straits Month—I attended a meeting at the George in the Old Bailey, on 10th July—I did net attend as a delegate, I was merely up in the Old Bailey to hear the trials—it was the day when Ernest Jones was tried—there were about twenty persons in the room—thirteen of them were delegates of a former conspiracy that had been formed on Whit-Monday—Mullins was there, and rose, Payne, Lacey, Brevvster, and a person of the name of Smith of Shouldham-street—Mullins asked if there were any delegates belonging to the Old Committee present, and I being one answered, "Yes"—he said the delegates were to go on one side of the room, and those that were not members of the Delegate Committee were to go on the other; which we did, and sat there and he and Pavne addressed us and said, it was a shame the prisoner should go to prison without a struggle to rescue him—he said the van would go through Cow Cross-street on its way to Coldbath-flelds, and that would be the best place to attack it, and a friend who I understood from a person in the room to be Daley, would lead the Irish to assist them—Mullins wrote credentials out for each of the delegates present to take to his locality to be filled up by the Scretary of the locality, and to be returned at a meeting on the following Thursday'night, the 13th—I was not present at that meeting—I had two credentials to take, one to Deptford, and one to Greenwich"' I delivered them—a person named Morgan was elected for Deptford,

Bremerton for Greenwich—they went and attended a meeting at the Lord Denman—I attended the meeting at the Black Jack on 20th, as a delegate from Greenwich—the prisoner was there, and Payne, Rose, Brewster, Dowling, Powell, and others whose names I forget—I then knew Powell by the name of Johnson—I believe Dowling was a Confederate belonging to the Davis Club—he said he came at the invitation of Mullins—at that meeting a Sub-Committee was formed to draw up a plan of attack on the police and troops—that was said at the time—it consisted of five, Payne, Mullins, Brewster, Rose, and Dowling—I subsequently attended meetings of Chartists in different parts of London—I did not take notes of what took place at them—I made communications to inspector Marks of what had taken place within two hours at the furthest after every meeting, and he wrote down, from my dictation, what I stated to him—some he read over to me, and some not—I signed them all—this is my signature to this paper—(looking at one)—Marks read that over to me before I signed it.





KINGSTON MARKS

I was from time to time in communication with the witness Davis, at Greenwich—I did not then know anything of Powell—Davis made reports to me of all that occurred at the different Chartist meetings he attended, both at London and Greenwich—he gave me the reports on the evening of the meeting—I took down the purport of what he stated, and framed it as a report—I did not take the very words—I read them over to him, and he signed them—these are the reports (produced)—this is Davis's signature.

Cross-examined by
MR. PARRT. Q. You did not take down Davis's words? A. Not exactly the words that fell from his lips, but the purport of what he said—these are a sort of reports which I send to the authorities—I signed my reports so-and-so took place, but I took from him what took place—I made a report to the authorities on what he said—it is in the nature of an ordinary Police report which I, as an inspector, make—I did not condense it—I gave the exact purport of what he stated—I gave the words as never as possible, with the exception that I began "I beg to report"—to the best of my knowledge I read the whole of them to him, but he sat close by me while I was taking it—he bad an opportunity of seeing what I wrote—I think he read them over as well, because he sat by my side, and could see what I wrote—he read many of them—I do not know which.

MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL. Q. Did you read to him correctly what you bad written? A. I did.





GEORGE DAVIS

re-examined. Mr. Marks read some to me, and I read some myself—I cannot tell what I read myself—I read some myself, because Mr. Marks was busy very often, and he put them into my hand, and at other times he would read them—when he read them over to me I sat by him—I very often saw what he wrote—I did not see all, because I did not look over—I sometimes looked over his writing—I signed them all. (MR. PARRY
objected to the witness being allowed to refresh his memory from these papers, as they were not written by the witness himself. The COURT
was of opinion that the accuracy of the papers being ascertained, and being adopted by the witness at the time they were made, he might as properly refresh his memory by them as if he had written then himself.)—I was at a meeting held at Denny's coffee-house, Great St. Andrew-street, Seven Dials, on Sunday, 23rd July—this (looking at one) is the report I made to Mr. Marks of that meeting—by it I see that Mullins, Brewster, Allnut, Rose, Dowling, two from Cartwright's, whose names I do not know, Johnson, Gurncy, and others, were there—it

Cross-examined by
MR. PARRY. Q. I believe you were not originally examined before the magistrate? A. No; I came forward suddenly on the last trial, owing to the bad character of Powell—I was described by the Attorney-General as a shop-keeper at Greenwich—I am thirty-four years old—I know nothing of Powell only since he has been in Court here—(The witness, at Mr. Parry's request, read the following passage from the paper, containing his account of the meeting of 30th July.)—"Each delegate was called on to describe the feeling in the locality. Bassett stated the men of the Wallace brigade of Chartists at Westminster, were impatient for the fray, and he wished to tell the Committee they need be under no trouble in making any plan of attacking the prison where their friend Ernest Jones was confined, Tothill-fields, for the men of Westminster would undertake that business themselves: they had good auxiliaries in the men of Duck-lane, and the parts adjacent, for they had forty or fifty of their comrades in that prison, and they would be as equally glad to release them as the Chartists would Ernest Jones"—the expression "auxiliaries" is my own language—I cannot remember whether "the parts adjacent" was the term used by Bassett, but "auxiliaries" was—I swear that the sentence I have read is the language word for word for I delivered it to Marks—I was not a Chartist—I did pretend to be one, to defeat their plans—I did not enter with the intention of serving myself—I had not the slightest idea of doing myself a service—I went there entirely from motives of public good—I thought the Government did not know what was going on, and there would be an outbreak and destruction of life and property, and if I could save it, I was entitled to do so—that was my motive—I have asked people to come up to the meetings, but not to join the Chartists—I have sold arms in the way of my trade—I am a broker and dealer in old boots, and what arms I have sold, I have sold in the way of trade as a broker—I am not a marine store-dealer—I make new boots, and am a translater as well—I have sold two guns and one sword within the list six months—I have tried to sell a pair of pistols, but I did not—here they are (producing them)—I tried to sell them for 16s., and I brought them to prove that I did not sell them—I never offered to sell any more arms than these pistols—I never unged men in the neighbourhood of Greenwich to buy arms of me to join the Chartist movement, and to break out in insurrection against the Government—the Druids' Arms, at Greenwich, is where the meetings were held—I first began to be a Chartist about 24th May—I was the cause of removing the meeting from Deptford to the Druids' Arms—the landlord of the Druids' Arms paid me for it—he left me out money when I wanted it—I had half-a-crown, sometimes five shillings, and sometimes half-a-sovereign of him—I believe that was because I lost my time, and he made me a remuneration for it—I only once got half-a-soverein; generally speaking it was rather less—I do not believe I had altogether more than 30s.—

during the time I was employed by Inspector Marks I was not paid by him—I was paid my expenses for going up to London, but nothing else—sometimes I had half a sovereign to pay me from Greenwich to London and back, and expenses incurred—the fare was 4d.—that half-sovereign lasted me a week very often, until I wanted more—when I asked I got it—I have had money from the Chartists, but I returned their money back to the Victim Fund, which is a fund for the relief of the wives of prisoners—I once got 2s., and once 1s.; that was all—I never attempted to make victims—that is all the money I got from the Chartists, to my recollection, except 5s. 4d., which I had in hand as treasurer—I was treasurer of the locality—I have not been in the habit of playing cards at the Druid's Arms for the last three years; I have played a game of cards there, and bagatelle, frequently; that was to bring custom to the house—I employed men to work for me—I did not play to draw custom; I played to amuse myself—I did not get up the Chartist Association at Greenwich—I knew a man named Paris, a blacksmith, at Greenwich—I did not tell him two or three months before Aug. that I had bought a lot of guns at a sale cheap; I told him I had bought two, which I had with a sword, for 4s. 6d.—I do not remember saying 1 had got them cheap, and would sell them cheap, as I thought guns were wanting—I told him I had got them cheap, and would sell them cheap—I might have added that I thought guns were wanting, but I do not remember—I will not swear I did not; I might—I met Paris on 16th Aug., about one in the day—I think I said to him, "You are the very man I want to see;" I wanted to see him, to tell him to stop at the Druid's Arms—I had sold him a gun—he said to me, "What's up?" and I said, "This is the night the blow is to be struck"—I did not ask him to go up to London with me; that I swear—I told him to stop at the Druid's Arms till I came back* from London—I told him that London was to be set on fire—I did not put my hand to my breast, and say, "I am ready, I am armed"—I was armed with these pistols, but they were not in my breast-pocket—I was in the habit of carrying them about with me loaded and capped; that was for the protection of my own life—I offered to sell them to get a profit on them—I might have offered them for sale fifty times; I might have bought another pair if I had sold them; the party I bought these of had a dozen pairs—these were in my window—I never offered them for sale at a meeting—I know Robinson; he was the first man that got me to join the Chartists.

Q. I thought you said you joined them yourself, for the purpose of protecting life and property? A. So I did, but he was the first man that urged me on to join them—I was protecting life and property before I joined the Chartists, and giving information to Government, from the month of March—I wanted a great deal of urging to join them; I did not want to join them—I did it to protect life and property, and inform against the parties—I am what is called "a spy;" I am not in the least ashamed of it—I remember meeting Robinson early in Aug.—I did not offer him a pair of pistols if he would go up and attend a Chartist meeting to be held on Whit-Monday—I had not a pair in my possession then—I never offered him a pair; I swear that—I never, in his presence, urged people at Greenwich to arm—he has—I did not tell him that I was a witness in a suit at the County-court, at Greenwich: he knew it—I was a witness there in an assault case—I never said to him that if I had known there had been such hard swearing I would have sworn any mortal thing to have got the better of those by wretches, meaning the plaintiffs in the suit—I offered to raffle these pistols nothing else—I know John Ward, a furrier—I asked him on Whit-Monday

whether he was going to a Chartist meeting at Bonner's fields—I did not tell him I should go there armed, nor ask him to go armed—I said I should go, and asked if he was going; not if he would go—I attended that meeting and advised Ward to stop at home for the sake of his wife—I was armed with these pistols—I never offered to Ward to get up a ratile for arms, nor ever told him I could supply him and others with plenty of arms—I did not say if a club were formed, and each party paid a sum per week, I could supply them with plenty of arms through a Mr. Dowson; I never said anything of the sort—I did not ask Ward, on 16th Aug., to go up to London; I did not see him on the 16th—I have often told him that I was going up to London—I have often seen him—I did not tell him I was armed; he knew it—I do not tell him I was going up to London to reconnoitre the town and ascertain the points of attack—I never told him that before the 16th Aug.—f was never in the habit of making cartridges, except for my own pistols—Ward once saw me at my shop, tearing up some old books, or book covers—I told him I was going to make them a present to the landlord of the Druid's Arms for his fowling-piece—I did not tell him I was going to make gunwadding—he went out with me with them in my hand, and saw me go into the Druid's Arms with them.

Q. Did you not, on one occasion, oppose the association being dissolved? A. There was no regularly organized association of Confederates; they merely met to make speeches, and read the papers—I told Ward and Robleson that to dissolve the meeting for the small matter they were going to do it for, looked very cowardly on their part, after they had been the violented men in the meeting—I called them cowards for it—that was the meeting of the Brian Boru-club, a Confederate club—I did not tell the police I had prevented that—the police were in the room at the time—every one in the room knew they were policemen—I never told Robinson that I had been into a room in London that was nearly filled with ball-cartridges, and that parties coming up to London could be supplied with any quantity they wanted—I know Joseph Monday—I do not know an Irishman named Fadey—I know one named Sheedy—I think I tried to sell him a musket—I tried to sell it to anybody—it was at the door—Sheedy works at the gas-house—it was not my business to inquire what he wanted it for—he might want it for any purpose—I tried to sell it for the purpose of getting a profit to keep myself—Monday did not persuade Sheedy not to buy it—I swear that—I did not urge him to buy it, he was standing at the door, asked me the price of it, and I told him 8s.—I did not tell Monday he ought to be ashamed of himself for preventing Sheedy from buying it as he knew that the Chartists were arming in London—I swear nothing of the sort took place—I often met Monday at the Druids' Arms, sometimes at the meetings and sometimes in the parlour—sometimes I had the pistols with me, and sometimes not, probably—Monday is a Chartist—I did not offer to sell him these pistols at the Chartist meetings, at the Druids' Arms—I offered to sell them at my own shop, but never exposed them at a Chartist meeting—I never, to my knowledge, offered to sell him a brace of pistols at a Chartist meeting there about June—I have several times said that I had a pair to sell—I was not constantly in the habit of offering them there, nor guns, or swords, or other arms—Monday did not ask me whether they were good ones to fire, nor did I say, "I should like to have the b----old Duke of Welington before me. to try them;" I swear that—he did not buy them, they were too much money for him, or else he would—I know John Norman, he lived at Greenwich, he volunteered to come up to the Orange-Tree

—I never asked him to do a little secret service work, and join the Chartists—I do not know a baker's apprentice, named Collett, at Lewisham—I know a young man that used to work for a baker, but not his name, he lived opposite me—I asked him to be one in a raffle for a brace of pistols—he promised to become a member, but did not—he did not give me 1s.—there were to be sixteen members—I know Martin, a carpenter's apprentice—I never told Collett that the pistols were not raffled for because there were so many detective police present—I swear that—that was not the cause—there were only one or two members willing to subscribe to the raffle, and I would not wait—I never asked Collett to join the Chartists—I never told him or Martin that I was a Chartist—I never spoke sis words to young Martin—I never told them that I v, as a Chartist, and would wallow knee-deep in blood for my fellow-creatures—I swear that—I did not recommend Martin to read a tale called "The Croppy; or, a Tale of the Irish Rebellion," but he came and bid for it three or four times when I had it—I did not tell him that a Chartist Society was forming, and endeavour to persuade him to enroll himself as a member—I swear that—I never kept company with Boys, and did not enter into conversation with him sufficient to ask anything of the sort—he did not decline, and say he would have nothing to do with me or the Chartists, for he believed they were a set of rascals—I never tried to entrap him, or Collett, or anybody into joining the Chariists—I never offered to supply Martin with arms, and say if he could not pay me at once, he might pay me so much a week; I would not trust my own brother—I did not ask him to raffle for a pair of pistols—I know John Matthews, a bricklayer's labourer, and a petty master as well—I never in his presence urged parties to get and buy arms—I never asked him to call at my shop, nor said I would get him into the police force, as I had influence with the heads of the police—he asked me to write a letter for him, and I promised to do it—I might have asked him to raffle for these pistols—I did not know any sporting gentlemen, to whom to sell them, or any officers—they never came to my shop—I know John Hanks, a broker and dealer in old clothes—I never asked him to go to the Chartist meetings at the Druids' Arms—I never said to him, in my shop, that half-inch chisels would be very serviceable things to run into the bowels of the police—I did not ask him if he would not fight for his country for a fair day's wages for a fair day's work; a man named Bligh did—I did not say to Hanks, pointing to a musket in my shop, "These are the things that will settle your special constables"—I know William Blackmore, a tailor—he was one of the council—I never, in his presence, urged people to join the Chartists, and to arm to obtain the Charter—I never produced my pistols on the table at the Druids' Arms, nor was I censured for bringing them there—I told Blackmore that they were going to get up an insurrection in London, and I was going with them to do so—I was bound to tell the council what transpired—I did not say, if I could get the consent of the Chartist body, I did not care about the funds—they wanted to send 5s. up to the secret meeting, and I opposed it, and they only sent half-a-crown—I know John Stanton, he was formerly a policeman—I never asked him to join the Wat Tyler Brigade—I did not offer to sell him a pike—head for 2s. 6d., neither did I have one nor a handle; nor did 1 say, if they would suit him, I had a brace of pistols, and plenty of powder and ball"—I did not offer to go to London to fetch him a pike; nor tell him that the police were going to arrest all the Chartists, and he had better have a pike—I did not say to him that I had a place to Practice firing in, and I would serve out those b----blue devils—I know Henry John Heath; I lodged wiih him some time ago—I owed him 4s. when

I left, but he knew where I went to, and I left a dressing-case and work-box behind, worth 12s., which he wished to keep, and I let him do so—I never told him that I was in the habit of going to London to purchase arms and furnishing them to the Chartists in the neighbourhood—I know William Dow, a tinker and chair-bottomer—I never urged him to join the Chartists, or to go to the Druids' Arms and be enrolled—I did not show him my pistols in my shop last June, and say I should take them up to London with me, or the meeting at Bonner's-fields, and use them—I did take them, as I always did—I did not ask Dow, or any man, to go up to that meeting with me—I did no task him whether he had a sword, nor say he ought to have fire-arms, and I would supply him with them—I did not ask him if he knew any one that had old muskets, guns, or pistols—I did not ask him to join the Chartists, and persuade him to bring his friends to join also—I did not tell him I would do my best to destroy the present Government, for they were bringing the people to starvation, and he ought to join the Chartists on his own account and on account of his children, nothing of the kind—I know Josiah Pinegar—I did not say to him, at the time Mitchell was sentenced in Ireland, that I would be one to go to London to blow up both Houses of Parliament, with every b—in them, and the b----Queen—I stopped him from coming up to the Orange Tree on the 16th—I never said anything of the kind to him.

Q. Did you first communicate with the police, or did they communicate with you? A. I first communicated with them—I have never before been in connection with the police—I used when a boy, some years back, to run of errands for the officers at Lambeth-street—I expect to get a compensation for what 1 have lost—I have lost the whole of my trade and my property, and I have expended money in it—my shop was not a very handsome one—it suited me for seven years—I do not live there now—I object to say when I live—I am not living with the police—I have been paid 2l. a week—I do not know what Powell is paid—I have read his evidence—I have sold part of my stock at Greenwich; I have got some of it now—some boots were sold for 19s. that cost me near upon 4l.—a person named Wright sold them for me—I sold another part for 12s.—I do not know how much property I have left, it is not 100l. worth, it is above 5l. worth—there are fixtures—I have not cleared out everything from my shop—I still rent my shop, and there are some of mv tools there—I have not made any arrangement as to the actual sum I am to get—I did not do so with Inspector Marks when I first went; I never said a word to him about compensation; I leave it entirely to the generosity of the Government—I expect to get remunerated for my loss, and no doubt I shall.

MR. WILSBY. Q. Who is this Ward that you have been asked abort? A. He was the leader of the Irish Confederates at Greenwich, and used to preside at their meetings—Robinson is a shoemaker—he is a Chartist, and a very violent physical-force man—Bligh was chairman one Sunday evening, and made a very violent speech in allusion to Ireland, and wished they would burn the police-stations; and at the conclusion of his speech he called upon the persons present to subscribe towards the benefit of Looney's family, and stated that the officer of the club, Mr. Ward, would receive the subscriptions—at the same time there had been some arrests at Manchester of the officers of a club, and Ward said, "Why do you call me an officer? they will arrest me;" and Robinson stated the same; and I called them cowards for that.





JOSEPH THOMPSON
 (police-sergeant, F 11). I searched the premises of a man named Rose on 11th Aug., about eight o'clock in the morning—he lived at 9, Clare-count, Drury-lane, or Clare-market—Rose was with me, and

showed me the place—I found these plans, these receipts for making combustible matters, and these papers with pencil-marks on them—there is a map of the City-road among them, a sketch of Seven Dials, Aldersgate-street, and Gray's-inn-lane, and a blank plan of Clerkenwell; five altogether.

MR. ATTORNEY GENERAL
to
GEORGE DAVIS. Q. Did you receive this note (produced) from Mullins? A. A similar one—I gave it to Mr. Marks—it came by post—Mullins's name is signed to it.





EDWARD EAGLE
. I am a collector to the Chartered Gas Company. I know Mullins—I have seen him write once, and have had letters from him on which I have acted—I believe this plan to be his—this letter is a copy of one of his letters; I mean in the same writing as those letters—I have corresponded with him, and have seen him write his signature—I consider this is his writing.

Cross-examined. Q. You have only seen him write once? A. No; that was three or four months since—I have not compared this paper with any others—I never saw it till five minutes ago—I have received four or five letters from him in different writing—one that I have appears to have been written with a steel-pen, and the other with a quill—I have kept but two of them—there is a slight difference in the two—this is more like one than the other—I have not sufficient knowledge to swear positively—I believe all this dark writing, these corner pieces are his, and this first line and the bottom one—here seems to be a small writing here, but still it seems to be his—the corners are the same writing as the letters—I believe it all to be his, but the words "New Oxford-street"—there seems a difference there, and different ink—I should doubt very much the word "Seven Dials" being his writing—I believe the numbers of the streets to be his.





EDWARD HENRY EAGLE
. I am son of the last witness, I know Mullins—I have not seen him write—I have seen letters from him, acted on them, and seen him on the contents—I believe this plan to be his writing.

Cross-examined. Q. Are the letters you have seen, what your father has been speaking of? A. Yes; I have been in the habit of opening them—he has never addressed a letter to me—to the best of my belief the whole of the plan is his writing, but I would not swear to it—(Letter read—"Mr. Davis. Aug. 12, 1848. Dear Sir, I shall feel obliged by you or your partner meeting me at Hopkinson's eoffee-house, Little Saffron-hill, on Sunday, at half-past ten, as I wish to see you Yours, truly, G. B. Mullins.")—(the papers found at Hose's being read, contained various names contracted, with numbers placed against them, among which were the following—"Wall. 80; Bass, and Nas.—Lamb, lo 150 Ped.; Ber. 50; Dean. 250; Cuff. Thom.—Star. 50; Pear.-War—Irish, 50; Rich.—Carts. 50; Fel. 100; Mitch. 30; W. Ty. 20;—Fuzz." &c.





GEORGE WILSON

re-examined. I have seen Rose write—I believe this paper to be his writing, but the word "John" is not similar—(read—"Aug. 4th, 1848. Received of the Wat Tyler Brigade, No. 1, 2s. 6d. John Rose, Secretary").





NICHOLAS PEARCE
. I am superintendant of the F division of Police. On 16th Aug. I went with a party of police to the Orange Tree public-house, Orange-street, Red Lion-square, and got there about five in the afternoon, or a little after—I went to a room on the first-floor, and found eleven persons sitting round a table conversing—I told them to keep their seats—I had a pistol—my men were armed—some of them followed me in—I requested each constable to take one in custody—one man attempted to leave the room—we secured them all—they were Ritchie, Gurney, Abel, Shepherd,

Snowball, Richardson, Greenslade, Small, Scadding, Burn, and Martin—Ritchie was sitting on a bench when we went in—I found under that bench three balls and sonic old rag in a handkerchief—I have opened them and found some rag tied round with tow very tightly, which was covered with turpentine—some printer's type was in the centre—I searched Ritchie and found these knives in his coat-pocket—his hat and coat smelt very stronglv of turpertine—he was asked his address at the station, which he declined to give, and said he had lately returned from France.





JAMES DOWSETT
 (policeman, F 136)). I know the house where Ritchie lived on 16th Aug.—it was 2, Cross-court, Russell-court, Drury-lane—I accompanied Sergeant Thompson there after the prisoners were arrested at the Orange Tree—he occupied the underground kitchen—I had seen him there that morning—we found there 170 rounds of ball-cartridge of different sizes, four loose bullets, four bullet-moulds, and in a cupboard by the fire-plase, three combustible-balls wrapped up in brown paper, also a bayonet, a quantity of tow, a bottle with a quantity of gunpowder in it, a quantity of percussion-caps in a paper, a horn of gunpowder, this paper, and some printed books.

Cross-examined. Q. Did you search the room again? A. No; I brought away all I saw—(paper read—"This is to certify that Joseph Ritchie and John Manley have been duly elected as delegates for this locality, Seven Dials and Drury-lane.")





JOSEPH THOMPSON

re-examined. I accompanied Dowsett to Ritchie's, and found some tow, some ladles for melting lead, and on the nest morning this tri-coloured band amongst some rags in a corner, which Ritchie termed his bed—he was in a very destitute state.

Cross-examined Q. How came you not to look into the corner where the rags were the first time? A. Because I found a flannel shirt all over vermin, and I was rather particular then—I considered they were all dirty rags—I turned them over, and seeing the band by daylight next morning, it struck me he had been to France, as I had heard him say so—I went again to be more particular—I think no one was with me the second time, except the landlord's daughter—the landlord was with us the first time—one time was bout nine at night, and the other between ten and twelve next morning.





ANTHONY RUTT
 (police-superintendant, L). On Wednesday, 16th Aug. I went with a party of constables to the Angel, Webber-street, Blackfriars-road, and found fourteen persons in the tap-room, Taylor, Cox, Herbert, Winspeare and utners—we took thirteen—I saw this pike—head under Conway's coat.





WILLIAM COCKERLLI
. (policeman, L 108). I went with Rutt to the Angel—took Conway, and found two pike—heads under his coat.





SAMUEL HARRIS
 (policemen, L 6). I accompanied Rutt and took Herbert—he was sitting down when we went in—I found seventy-five rounds of ball-cartridges under his seat.





HENTRY BAKER
 (policeman, L 111). I went with Rutt, and took Prowton—I found on him a dagger, a pike—head, with a iruard to the handle, and a screw-wrench to serew the nut and fasten it on the pike.





ROBERT SMITH
 (policeman, L 21). I went with Rutt, took Winspeare, and found a breast-plate under his waistcoat, and over his shirt; also a pick—head.





JOHN COLLINS
 (policeman, L 184). I took Morgan, and found upen him a pike—head. and fifteen ball-cartidges in his pocket. (The various articles were produced.)





JOHN HAINES
 (police-inspector). On Wednesday, 16th Aug., between nine

and ten o'clock, I went to the Charter coffee-house, Strutton-ground, Westminster, kept by Lacey, who was tried last Session—I took him with me into the club-room; the Wallace Brigade branch of the National Chartist Association met there—I found there a list of members, a treasurer's fund-book, a victim fund-book, and a contribution-book—I found a man named Thomas Jones down stairs—he was searched in my presence, and two pistols, loaded with powder and ball, with flint locks, taken from his pocket, a bayonet from the breast of his coat, a one pound cannister of gunpowder from his hat, and a box of gunpowder from his pocket, and some ball-cartridges for pistols (produced).





EDWARD KENDALL
. I am a Sergeant of the detective police—I took Jones at Lacey's, and afterwards went to his lodging with Inspector Walker, and saw him find a cup containing seventy bullets, and a stick two feet long, with part of a bayonet on it—I found about ten pounds of white metal, with the handle of a pewter pot in it, and three pounds of lead.





JAMES RUSSELL
 (police-inspector). On 16th Aug. I went to 4, Blue Anchor-yard, Westminster, and took Young, who was tried last Session—as 1 went up stairs I heard a noise, as of people running up and down stairs, putting something away—I went up, but found nothing—I came' down and found a pike in the yard, with this staff to it—I saw no window open, and had not heard anything fall outside—I found six bullets in the workshop, one flattened, as if it had been discharged, a canister of powder, and several truncheons, one loaded with lead; also the screws of a mangle, or carpenter's bench, which had been smoothed for the hand to grasp them without pain-in the cow-shed at the bottom of the yard I found a pistol, and in the yard, under Young's window, this combustible ball, and in a cupboard in his bed-room a canister, with forty or fifty bullets in it.





JAMES LEWIS ASHMAN
 (policeman, E 1). On 17th Aug., about one o'clock in the morning, I was on duty in Bow-street, and saw two persons pass—I stopped one; it was Argue, and after some conversation I Look from him a gun—I searched him at the station, and found twenty rounds of ball-cartridge, and a card of the Irish. Felon club, with his name to it.





JOSEPH THOMPSON

re-examined. On 18th Aug. I and West took Cuffey at 11, Hollins-street, Wardour-street—on my telling him the charge he went to a drawer, put his hand in, and took something out—I caught hold of his hand, we had a struggle, and this pistol dropped from his hand on the floor—it was loaded with ball, and primed—he tried to secrete it, but I took it from him—I also found this banner.





WILLIAM WEST
 (policeman). I was with Thompson at Cuffey's, and found this pike-handle (produced) in the cock-loft.





THOMAS BARRETT
. I am a shoemaker, and live at 17, Charles-street, Lisson-grove. I was a member of the Chartist association last summer—I joined it on Whitsunday last—I belonged to the Robert Emmett brigade—they held their meetings at Morgan's beer-shop, Praed-street, Edgware-road, and at Breedon's beer-shop, in Shouldham-street—I know Mullins—I have seen him on two or three occasions at the meetings at Breedon's—there was a Chartist meeting there on Sunday, 13th Aug.—I saw Mullins there during the day—there were two meetings; one was a private meeting—Mullins was at the latter meeting in the evening—I was not at the earlier meeting—he addressed the meeting in the evening—(he had addressed meetings once or twice before that)—he said it was necessary for every one to prepare for the crisis that was coming, and that it was necessary for each one to make a small sacrifice to aid the committee of progress in their undertakings—I was

at a meeting at Breedon's on Wednesday evening, the 16th, about eight o'clock—Mullins arrived about half-past eight—there were about thirty persons in the room—they were members of the locality, chiefly Chartists and Irish confederates—when Mullins came into the room, a man named Smith clapped him on the shoulder and said, "I was afraid you were taken"—Mullins replied, "No, they will only take me with my life"—I know a person named Cruikshank; I saw him there that night, he followed Mullins into the room; he placed a musket on the table—I had only seen him once before; that was at a meeting—I saw two or three pikes and two pistols in the hands of the men in the room just after Mullins came in—Mullins, Smith and some others went out of the room—Smith came back again—Mullins came and looked into the room, and Smith said they were to prepare to go to the Seven Dials and Crown-street, Soho—they were to be there by ten, and their leader would meet them there—a question was asked in what way they were to take their arms, and the reply was in the best way they can—their arms were called toothpicks—a question was asked if they had got their toothpicks ready—after that the people left the beer-shop by twos and threes—I afterwards went to Crown-street, Soho—I got there about ten—I saw twenty of thirty persons about Crown-street, Soho, whom I recognized—about half of them had been at the meeting at Breedon's that night.

Cross-examined by
MR. PARRY. Q. You are not working at your trade now, are you? A. I have not lately, not for this last month; I may say, except a few little jobs—when I go out, a policeman goes to protect me—I might walk with two policemen occasionally, but there is no necessity for two—I first communicated with the police on 16th Aug.—up to that time I held with the principles of the Chartists—I will not say I was downright sicere with them—up to 16th Aug. I had no thoughts of coming as a witness—I did not join them for the purpose of betraying them—I went to the police to tell what I knew—I went to offer myself to the police—I did not ask anything for my evidence, and did not receive anything—I did it entirely for the good of my country—I have bad 1l. a week since I have not been able to work at my trade—about six weeks or two months before I joined the Emmett Brigade, I had been in Cold Bath-fields prison, for the unlawful possession of a pint pot—I had not stolen it—the publican did not charge me with stealing it—he did not charge me at all—it was the policeman that charged me—he was fetched to the police-office, and his wife, Mrs. Thorn, also—I had a month—I was also in prison about four years ago, for taking some bread out of a baker's cart, with three more, in a drunken spree—they ran away; I did not, and I had to suffer—I cannot remember how much bread I took, because I was intoxicated at the time, but I think it was three half-quarterns—it was taken from a baker's cart, standing in the high road, and the loaves were stuck together in one lot—I had four months—I was tried at Clerkenwell Sessions—I had no friends, or any means of getting a defence up, or, otherwise, there is not a doubt I should have got off—I knew the men that I was with very well—I was living at Wilsden at that time—I was never found in a wine-cellar at Wilsden—I was in gaol when I was an apprentice—I might have been nineteen or twenty years of age at that time—I am now twenty-eight—I was fined 23s., or a month's imprisonment, and I had no means of paying that money—it was for trespass in search of game—it was not called poaching—my master would have paid the money, but I wished him not to do it to distress himself—I was never in prison at any other time—I know Robert Russell—he never charged me with stealing the cape of a dress, nor anything of the kind—I never stele one—I sole a cape

for 6d., which I picked up in a crowd going up the stairs of the Princess's Theatre—I made no inquiry about it—I sold it to a parly I was intimately acquainted with—Russell did not charge me with stealing it, nor with stealing a coat—I know Charles Jones—he never took from my neck a handkerchief which belonged to him—I never had anything belonging to him—I never had any arms, and never attempted to instigate any one to arm—I never asked any one to arm—I never made any cartridges—I know William John Garrett—I saw him on the evening of 15th Aug.—I showed him a pistol and a lot of ball cartridges—I did not tell him I had made them—I do not believe I did—I will not swear it, because I might and have forgotten it, but I believe I did not—if I had told him so, it would have been a lie—I might have told that lie—I did not tell Garrett that I expected a turn up with the police that evening—I never said anything to him concerning the police—he well knew what was going on—I did not tell him, to my knowledge, that I had been engaged all day making ball cartridges—I could not have stated it, because I never remember telling him any such thing—I swear I did not tell him so—I had not been making ball cartridges—I have been where I saw them made, but I had nothing to do with the making of them—I was not at this time in communication with the police—I did not wish Garrett to go to the meeting at Seven Dials—I did not know there was to be a meeting there—I know William New—I recollect seeing him about the middle of Sept.—I saw him on the day Mullins was apprehended—I went to his lodging—I had about me 12s. at that time, for which I had sold some shoes that I had made on my own account—I did not get that 12s. from the police or the Government—I did not tell New that I was not going to work again—he is in the same trade as myself—I gave him some leather to make up for me, to have the proceeds of it when it was done, because 1 could not make up the work" myself, as I had to leave home—I did not tell him I was not going to work again, that I had got 1l. a week, and was to have it as long as I lived—no such promise has been made to me—I told New I should go down to Southampton, where I should get work, and be able to earn 1l. a week at my work, as wages—I do not know that I know a lad named Gustavus Thomas, the son of a carpenter—I never employed him or any boy to make cartridges for me, and pay him 2s. a day—I did not employ Thomas or any one on Sunday 13th and Monday 14th, to make ball cartridges for me, and pay him for it—I know a young man named Procter—he went by the name of Hell-fire Jack, or young Bombshell, among the Chartists—I did not employ him to make cartridges, and say they were for some gentlemen who were going to emigrate—I do not know Procter's father—I never left a pike or pike—head for Procter, at his father's house—(looking at a broken one) I have seen Procter show that at the meetings to show that he was prepared—I never had it in my hand—I swear, positively I never left this, wrapped up in paper, for Procter, at his father's house, after 13th Aug.—I never left anything of the sort—I was not in the habit of being armed—I never carried arms before 16th Aug., but on one occasion, and that was the pistol and cartridges when I went to Garrett—I had no arms in my house, only on the afternoon of 15th—I swear that.

MR. CLERK. Q. Hew did that pistol and cartridges come into your possession? A. Procter had been making some cartridges, and he thought the police had got a clue to what he had been making—he met me in the street, and asked me to take them to my house, in case the police should find out where they were, and I did so—I had seen Procter make some of those

cartridges—I have seen this pike—head in Procter's possession, on several occasions before 15th Aug., as early as Whit-Monday, and several others of the same description—I have seen him at the meetings of the locality pull them from under his coat and show them.





CHARLES BALDWINSON
. I am a tailor, and live in Webber-street Black-friars-road. In May last, I became a member of the Chartist Association at the South London locality—I became a class leader about a fortnight of three weeks afterwards—I had nine men under me as a class leader myself making ten—our locality met at the South London Chartist Hall, Webber-street—I know Mullins—on the day that Ernest Jones was tried in this Court, I was at the George Inn in the Old Bailey—Mullins and about nine or ten others were there—I heard them say that they wanted the secretaries and delegates to meet together that day at the George—they did meet—I went, and they would not let me assemble with them, because I was neither a secretary or a delegate—I saw Mullins write something on several pieces if paper, and hand one to each of the men that sat at the meeting, to each secretary and delegate—one of those pieces of paper was afterwards brought to our locality by Pedley, and on the production of that Pedley was elected our delegate to the secret meeting—on the following Wednesday evening, 12th July, Mullins took me and Pedley round to several streets, courts, and alleys, and said they would be the best places to fire on the police and military as they were passing by—he took us into one of the courts, and asked a woman who stood there if there was any entrance to that court—she said "No," and he said, "That will not do, you must have a thoroughfare to it"—we afterwards went to the Milton-street Theatre, where there was a meeting that evening—on 15th Aug., the day before the people were apprehended, I met a person named Morgan, and went with him to the Peacock in the Westminster-road—it was about eight o'clock in the evening—I found a man of the name of Chester and Collins there—Pedley came afterwards—there were about a dozen there, all Chartists of that locality—Pedley said there was a delegate come from Manchester, and he was told to tell us that they were up and doing there—he asked us if we were ready to come out and fight, and they all answered yes, if he meant it—he told us we were to come to the Peacock on the following evening, and to bring all our men with us, armed or not armed—he said we were to meet at the four different quarters—our locality was to meet at the Broadway, Westminster—the other three quarters mentioned were Clerkenwell-green, Tower Hamlets, and the East-end of the town—in consequence of that I told my class-men what Pedley had said—Conway was one, and Prowton another—I went to the Peacock on Wednesday evening, about eight—Pedley came afterwards—Morgan and Conway were there, and Winspeare—Pedley brought several ribbons of different colours—red and white were two of the colours—there were three—he said the delegates were to wear them that they might be known by the men—I saw Pedley with some cartridges that evening—I had a pistol there, and a pike—head—Pedley gave me some cartridges for my pistol—I loaded it with them—that was at the Peacock—I went to the Angel for the pike—Pedley came afterwards—it was there that I saw the cartridges, and I saw him load other men's pistols—Pedley had left two or three minutes before the police came, with two men with loaded pistols—I had given information to the police that afternoon, about half-past one or two, or from that to three.

Cross-examined by
MR. PARRY. Q. When did you first think of giving information to the police? A. Not till the afternoon of the 16th—I was as

accomplice up to the 16th—I was arrested, and let go—I swear I was not on friendly terms with the police till that afternoon—I swear I bad no communication with the police before that—I bad not been at the Angel that afternoon placing some of the cartridges that were afterwards found under the table—I had no cartridges—I had a pistol and pike-bead—I did not always carry them about with me—I did not act with them with the intention of betraying them—I intended to work with them, and did so—I remember about Tuesday, giving a pike to Conway, one of the men who was taken at the Angel, with it on him—I did not give it him for the purpose of its being found on him—he had one—that was after I had been in communication with the police—I had bought it about June last—I get my living by hard work, by tailoring—I was working with a man of the name of Gwynn at this time—I worked with him about six years, off and on, up to this time—I have not got anything for this—I have ll. a week to support my wife, through being thrown out of bread—I did not make that arrangement with the police before I gave any information—I do not expect anything else—I do not want anything else—I should not object to any more money if it was offered me—I got about 4s. 6d. a day regular wages, if I earned it—I am paid by the piece.





HENRY JONES
 (policeman, 138.) On the morning of 17th July, I was on duty, and went into Clerkenwell Churchyard about half-past four o'clock—it is part of my rounds—it adjoins Clerkenwell-green, and is enclosed from it by an iron railing—there is a passage through the Churchyard to three houses that are in it—that is accessible to persons at all hours, night and day—behind a wooden paling, underneath a bookbinder's window, I found a basket containing 280 rounds of perfect ball cartridges, and about fifty imperfect ones—this handkerchief was lying over the basket (producing them.)





JOSIAS CHILTON
. I live in Crawford-street, Bryanston-square, and know Breedon's beer-shop in Shouldham-street. On the night of 16th Aug., I went there between eight and nine o'clock—there were about eighteen or twenty persons there, chiefly labourers, and I should rather think from their dialect they were Irish—I heard something said about leaving there, and going to Crown-street to meet their parties—I saw a gun unfolded from a wrapper by one of the persons that brought it in—it was in two parts, stock and barrel—I saw on the table, near the door, a sword blade, and a handle—the people were desired to disperse two or three at a time—they went away on that two or three at a time—I was there about an hour altogether.





THOMAS MALLISON
. I live in Shouldham-street, next door to Breedon's beer-shop—from my room I can see into Breedon's—on 16th Aug., about half-past seven o'clock, I was at my window, and saw about fifteen or sixteen people arrive at Breedon's—they appeared to come in threes and fours—when I first looked there were six or seven persons at the door—the number increased—I should say eighty or a hundred came in threes and fours—they went in—there were not more than sixteen outside the door—I could see into Breedon's room from my window—it was crowded—I should say there were forty or fifty there, or from that to sixty—while looking, I observed the bright blade of a pike jerked up by some party or other above their heads—I saw from four to six inches of the blade—I went round to the station, and gave information to Mr. Walker—previous to that I had seen a cab arrive, with three persons in it, and a bundle three or four feet long, was handed out, tied round with a lightish cloth and a piece of string, which excited my suspicions—the bundle was taken into Breadon's—I could not see what it was.





JOHN BAMBRIDGE
 (policeman, D 105). On 16th Aug., about nine o'clock

in the evening, I was in Shouldham-street, and placed myself in a yard, and also on a roof, from which 1 could see into Breedon's beer-shop—at a few minutes after nine I saw about sixteen people in the room—one person was keeping the door—the window was opened, and one party addressed the others, and told them to come themselves, and bring as many other friends as they possibly could with them.





JOSEPH HOYLE
 (policeman, V 95). In Aug. I was stationed in and about Seven Dials—on the evening of 16th, about a quarter to nine o'clock, I saw about twenty people assembled, standing in twos and threes, in the Seven Dials—the number increased to about forty—I have been on the beat some time, and have a general knowledge of the persons that live in the neighbourhood—the people assembled appeared to be strangers—about half-past nine the number had increased to about sixty, and I thought it right to inform my inspector.





WILLIAM ROBERT BLACK
 (police-inspector F). On the evening of 16th Aug., about half-past nine o'clock, I went to Seven Dials with a party of police—I found from 100 to 150 people assembled, standing, talking, in twos and threes—the greater number appeared to be strangers in the neighbourhood—we dispersed them.





ROBERT WARRINGTON
. I am chemical operator to the Society of Apothecaries (looking at the two receipts found at Rose's)—the first of these is pounded berytes of copper, wrapped in tinfoil, sprinkled with water, and wrapped in paper—that is a mixture which is commonly exhibited in lectures on chemistry, for the purpose of showing spontaneous combustion of tinfoil—when put in contact with nitrate of copper, and moistened, the tinfoil becomes red-hot and bursts; combustion would take place in between two and five minutes—the whole being wrapped together, it could be thrown anywhere, and would exhibit no appearance of its combustible nature until it burst—the other is steel filings and sulphur paste, woollen rags dipped in naphtha, sprinkled with nitric and sulphuric acids, vegetable pitch—there seem to be two mixtures here—the first is a mixture very often made for the purpose of producing intense heat, but no ignition would take place—the second would form a very powerful combustible mixture; directly the acids were poured on the woollen rags so steeped, they would burst into flames—then follows, "Nitrate of silver inclosed with a few pebble stones"—I cannot conceive that that would produce any action at all—if it means "fulminating silver," that is a very common mode of exploding pebble stones, but it would produce no effect—it is what is called "lunar caustic"





WILLIAM RANDALL
. I am a firework-maker. I have examined these balls—they contain about 2 1/2 oz. of gunpowder mixed with small tacks or nails—there is a small piece of cotton which goes inside the ball, which I suppose would burn about half a minute before the ball exploded—there is no string; it is merely bound round with brown paper seamed with pitch—there is what is called a slow match, which communicates with the powder—if you lighted the slow match, probably half a minute would elapse before it exploded.





JOSEPH THOMPSON

re-examined. I apprehended the prisoner on this charge on 18th Sept.—I found him at 4, Tatham-court, John-street, East-street, Old Kent-road—I had been searching for him for some time—I went there about nine o'clock—he was on the first-floor—I got into the house by a little stratagent, and he came down stairs, with a bonnet and shawl on, and dressed apparently as a female—I suspected he was a female until he spoke—he

held out his finger, and said, "I will surrender," and he surrendered quite guietly.

Cross-examined by
MR. PARRY. Q. Did he say, "Here I am?" A. I do not think he did—the first words he spoke were, "I will surrender."

Witnesses for the Defence.





GUSTAVUS THOMAS
. I know Barrett, who has been examined here as a witness—on Sunday and Monday, 13th and 14th Aug., I was employed by him to make cartridges for a person going abroad—he told me they were to be sold to the blacks—by cartridges, I mean bullets and powder put into paper, and screwed at the end—I was to make as many as I could—I cannot tell how many I made, there was such a quantity, and he made some himself—there was about half a bushel altogether—it took me part of Sunday and Monday evening—he paid me 2s. for the Sunday, and 1s. for the Monday evening—they were made in Barrett's house—I live with my father, at 16, Harrow-road—Barrett's house—is 17, Charles-street, James-street, Edgware-road—Barrett was there part of the time—he saw me make some of the cartridges, and made some himself—a person named Procter was there, doing the same thing.

Cross-examined by
MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL. Q. What business are you? A. A carpenter—I had known Barrett I dare say six weeks before 16th Aug.—the first time I met him was in the Edgware-road—he was talking to me, and invited me to have half-a-pint of beer with him—that was the first time 1 had seen him—that was about a fortnight before I made the cartridges—he invited me down to see him—he spoke to me very friendly—I never saw Procter before I saw him at Barrett's—I do not know whether he is the person they call "Hell-fire Jack "—I have never heard him called so—he made as many cartridges as he could, as I did—I suppose he was paid the same that I was, by Barrett—he left before I did on the Sunday evening—there was no one else there—I do not know what became of the cartridges—I was here at the last trial, but was not examined—my father brought me here—he was reading the paper, and I told him it was a man named Barrett who employed me, and he said it was no more than right that I should come to state it—my father is not a Chartist—the solicitor knew I was here at the last trial.

MR. PARRY. Q. How many times had you seen Barrett before you made the cartridges? A. About three times—he spoke to me first—he entered into friendly conversation with me, and asked me to take some beer—that was the beginning of my knowledge of him.





CHARLES PROCTER
. I live at 8, High worth-place, Marylebone, with my father, and am a painter by trade. I have known Barrett, who has been examined here, about five months—I was employed by him on Sunday, 13th Aug., in his kitchen—I was out of employment, and he came to me on the Saturday, and told me if I liked to come and work for him he would pay me 2s. for my day's work—he did not tell me what I was to do till I got there—I went on Sunday, and Barrett, me, and a youth that 1 saw there, were making some ball-cartridges—I had seen that youth frequently with Barrett, six, seven, or eight times; I am positive of that—when I went into the kitchen, Barrett told me to make some ball-cartridges—he said they were for a gentleman emigrating—I did not know how to go about it, and he showed me—I saw a pistol in the room, and an iron railing bent at one end, and sharpened up at the other—my father showed me a thing similar to a pike-staff—this is it (produced) it was sharpened—the handle was not then broken—my

father did that in my presence, and threw it aside, and forbade my speaking to Barrett again—I have never, to my knowledge, been called "Hell-fire Jack "—I should have remembered it if I had—I am a Chartist—I never saw this pike before I saw it in my father's hands—if Barrett says I was in the habit of using it at the localities of the Chartists, it is false.

Cross-examined by
MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL. Q. Did you attend the meeting at Kennington-common? A. I did not; I was not a Chartist then—I became one after that—I was at the Bonner's-fields meeting—I was not there when the people attacked the Church—I went home when I heard the meeting was forbidden—I was not at the meeting when the people walked round the town—I have attended about thirty meetings since I became a Chartist in John-street Convention Rooms, Mr. Morgan's, in Praed-street, Cartwright's, and Breadon's; not at Webber-street—I belong to the Maryle-bone locality—I never had a class-leader—there were a great many class-leaders in that district, one for every nine men.

COURT. Q. Were you a class-leader? A. No; I do not know what I was any more than a Chartist.

Q. What is a Chartist? A. Why, it is an individual that wants a fair day's pay for a fair day's work.

MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL. Q. And how are the Chartists to get it? A. By peaceable and social means; by petitioning, I suppose; not by fighting, or using such things as these—I am not a physical force Chartist—I do not know a person of the name of George Procter, a bomb-shell maker—I am a painter by trade—I never saw a bomb-shell—I never made any—I never made cartridges before I made them for Barrett—I had known Thomas, I should say, about three weeks, or it might be a month—I do not know whether he is a Chartist—I have seen him in Breedon's, in Shouldham-street—I never saw him at Cartwright's—I have seen him at Morgan's, in Praed-street, with Barrett—I do not remember seeing him anywhere else—the Emmett Brigade met at Morgan's—it was established for social petitions—it was named after Robert Emmett, a man that was hung some years ago—I do not know what it was for; I suppose because they were the strongest, and were able to do it—I have seen Thomas, at Barrett's house, two or three times, I should suppose—we used in general to meet every night at Cartwright's—I have not seen Thomas there every night; about twice—I was a member of the Emmett Brigade—I heard the people were taken at the Orange Tree on 16th Aug., but I had nothing to do with it—I was not at Breedon's that night; I was at home with my father—I did not know there was to be a meeting on the 16th—I never heard of it—I did not hear they were taken till the next day—I did not attend that night, or I should have known it the same night—I had some work, and thought it better to attend to that—I never had any pistols—I saw one in Barrett's kitchen on the Monday evening, as we were finishing the cartridges; I had never seen it before.





THOMAS PARIS
. I am a blacksmith, and live at Greenwich. I know Davis, who lives at Greenwich—he is a boot-maker and broker, and keeps a general sort of shop—I never saw him work—whenever I saw his shop, it was composed of shoes, guns, swords, and such like—I did not pay particular attention to it; that is what I did see—I was only once in the shop—there were a great many second-hand things—there was an old stool—I bought a gun of him, not very long before the 16th of that month that the conspiracy broke out—I do not know whether it was Aug.—I recollect meeting

Davis on 16th Aug., about one o'clock, as near as possible—he said to me, "You are the very man I want"—he said, "This is the night the blow is to be struck "—he asked me to come up, and put his hand on his breast, and said, "I am all right," or, "all ready," and turned up his coat, and showed me the tri-coloured ribbon.

Cross-examined by
MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL. Q. Are you a Chartist? A. I do not know whether I am a Chartist or not—I am a man for equal justice—I do not know whether you can make that a Chartist—I belong to that body—you may turn principles into anything you like—the Chartist principles are founded on justice and truth—I belong to the Wat Tyler Brigade—I do not hold any rank; I am not a class-leader—Davis was my class-leader—I do not know who my warden was—I do not think Mr. Ward was; Bligh was—Davis was not my class-leader; Young was—I have never been in a Court like this—I am a stupid fellow—I think Davis was a class-leader; he was the head one altogether, I believe—he was a man over 100, I believe—he was the delegate sent up from Greenwich, but he elected himself—I knew nothing about the tri-coloured badge before I saw it on his coat—I do not know whether it was in his coat or hat, but when he said, "He was all right," or "all ready," he showed it me—I bought the gun, because Davis told the locality there was to be a fight or revolution, and 1 thought I ought to be ready as well as the rest—I said there would not be a revolution; no one else but Davis told me so—I said it could not be, because I did not see the people were prepared for it—I bought the gun because I considered it was cheap, and I could get the money for it any day—he had the gun in his shop for sale—I only saw that and another one—I saw an old sword, and some very good pistols—he always had plenty of pistols—I always saw a pair of pistols in his custody when he came to the meeting—I never examined them—there was an old sword, and another sword—I do not know where he bought the guns—mine was an old Queen Anne piece, a real rum-un—I gave 6s. for it—it is a little short piece—I know it to be a Queen Anne piece, because I was informed, when I was a little boy, when I saw an old piece, that it was a Queen Anne, and it was the same sort as this; it was very old-fashioned.





REUBEN COLLETT
. I live at Mr. Taylor's, in the Kent-road—I am a baker—I am in my 21st year—I am not a Chartist—I have never been asked by Davis to become one—I know Davis's shop—I have seen pistols there—I did not raffle for them—they were not raffled for—I did not invest a shilling in a raffle and have it returned to me because it did not take place—I did not invest any money at all—I remember a raffle being proposed—Davis told me the reason it did not take place was because he could not get members enough—I know Martin—I was at one time with him in Davis's company—I have heard Davis say he was a Chartist—I did not hear him say he would wallow knee-deep in blood for his fellow-creatures.





FREDERICK MARTIN
. I am apprenticed to a carpenter and live at Green-wich—I am twenty years old—I know Davis—he asked me to enrol myself as a member of the Chartists—I declined—he asked me to raffle for a pair of pistols—I know Collett—I was with him on one occasion in Davis's shop when Davis said he was a Chartist, and would wallow knee-deep in blood for the rights of his fellow-creatures—I am quite sure of that.

MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL. Q. Collett was close by? A. No; he was not there at the time.





JOHN MATTHEWS
. I am a bricklayer's labourer. I have known Davis about eighteen months—I have seen him at the Druid's Arms in Greenwich, at the Chartist's meetings there, and have seen him urge the people present

to get arms—I never heard him ask them to get arms—I have seen him with pistols in the room, offering them for sale, or to be raffled for.

Cross-examined by
MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL. Q. Are you a Chartist? A. No; I do not attend the Druid's Arms frequently—I go there sometimes after my work—I do not belong to the Wat Tyler or Emmett Brigades.

COURT. Q. How came you to be at the house? A. I have used it there years—these were not private meetings of the Chartists—I have been in the parlour and have gone up-stairs, and sat down as other people might.





JOHN HANKS
. I am a carpenter, and live at Church-passage, Greenwich I know Davis—I remember being in his shop about the latter end May, or the beginning of June, when he said half-inch chisels would be very serviceable to run into the bowels of the police—he asked me if I would" fight for my country for a fair day's wages and a fair day's work—I was passing when he pointed to a musket—he said, "These are the things that will settle the special constables"—I was one myself—I have known Davis near eight years—from what 1 know of him I would not believe him on his oath.

Cross-examined by
MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL. Q. He knew you if were a special constable, I presume? A. Yes; he knew that, at the time he talked about the hall-inch chisels and the gun—he invited me several times into the room where they met, and when he began to talk about pistols and guns I said it was disgusting to me—I never beard him examined on his oath—I would not believe him on his oath, because he tried to draw me in and put me into difficulties, and I was satisfied it would not be carried out because I knew very well that the Government would overpower such a movement—it tvas beyond all reason that any such thing would take place in this country as burning and assassinating the people, which was spoken of when I was in the shop—the reason I did not join was because I did not approve of their transactions—I did not go to the police and give information—there were more people present than Davis talking about it—there was a man named Blagden—I do not know Bligh, Robinson or Ward—I was satisfied that a dangerous meeting was going to take place—at that time there were a great many depredations committed on the shopkeepers, and I joined the special constables to protect my own property—I did not go to the police, I had enough to attend to my own business—I was satisfied it was very well known to the police, because the police were round about the house where the meetings were continually—that was at the Druid's Arms, in Straits-mouth—I thought it was not my duty to give information—I keep a broker's-shop—I deal in old clothes—I am a carpenter by trade, and keep an old clothes'-shop as well—I do not deal in guns—I have never had any.

MR. PARRY. Q. It was Davis talked about assassinating the police and burning the houses? A. Yes; he wanted me to come to the Druid's Arms and join them on several occasions—he asked me about three times.





JOHN STANTON
. I am a labouring man, and live at Greenwich. I know Davis—I have known him the last two years, when he lived at Mr. Hanks's house—I was a Chartist at that time, I am not now—Davis asked me to become one about four months ago—he asked me to join the Wat Tyler division—he offered to supply me with a pike—I was to pay for it by instalments—he said he would fetch it from London, as he was in the habit of going to London every day—he said he had a pair of pistols, and was going to raffle them, but if I liked to buy them I might do so—he said I had better provide myself with arms, because I would not know when I might be attacked by the b----blue devils—I saw him at the Druid's Arms several times—he was there every meeting-night—the meeting of the Confederates was on Sunday, and

the Chartists on Tuesday—he said he wished we had a place at the back of his bouse where we could practise firing, for the purpose of getting us into organization.

Cross-examined by
MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL. Q. Were you examined on a former occasion? A. I was; I then gave nearly the same story—I am a labouring man—I was formerly in the police—I left it to go to work on the Greenwich Railway—I was not dismissed—I was fined on several occasions before I left—I got 18s. a week on the railway and my overtime, and as a policeman I got 19s. a week, not my clothes—my overtime sometimes came to 10s., and sometimes I worked eight days and sometimes nine days in a week, early in the morning and late in the evening—ten hours makes a working day—we used to work overtime till ten at night, sometimes—I joined the police when they first went to Greenwich, about seventeen years ago—I was reported two or three times—I do not know about being reprimanded—I might be reported early in 1832, by police-sergeant Parry, for being absent from my duty—I do not know that I was again reported in the same month for being absent—I was not, that I know of, reported for being in a public-house, and taking a pensioner to the police-station to sleep—I was not fined 5s.—I was not dismissed for being drunk—I gave in my resignation, and the superintendent sent Sergeant Herring to take my clothes, that was in 1835.

MR. PARRY. Q. In addition to having overwork, had you your Sundays to yourself? A. Yes; and Saturday night as well, and only one master; I had five or six in the police, and I was not up all night; at least if I was, I was paid double for it—there is one thing that I forgot to mention, and that was after Mitchell had been sentenced, Davis took up the newspaper and read, and said "What do you think of this, Stanton?"—I said it was a bad job for the family—he said, "Mitchell was transported for fourteen years; I wish I had my wish, I would go to the Houses of Lords and of Commons, and blow all the b----s up into the heavens!"—I forgot to explain that last time I was here.





JOHN PINEGAR
. I live at Greenwich, and know Davis quite well. I remember hearing of Mitchell being convicted in Ireland—I saw Davis about that time—he had not quite done reading the paper when I went in—I asked what they had done with Mitchell—he said they had transported him for life, or something of that sort, and proceeded reading the paper—he did not say anything more that day—at another time I heard him say that he would be one to go to London to blow up both Houses of Parliament, with every b—r in them, and the b----Queen too—that was some weeks before, at the Druid's Arms, not at any meeting.

Cross-examined by
MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL. Q. Did he say that to you privately or generally? A. Privately—simply to me, no one else was in the room at the time—he treated me to a pint of half-and-half at the time—I bought a gun of him—he told me things were coming about, and we should all want a gun, and if we did not get a gun we should all get killed—I innocent like gave him 6s. for it—I bought it, because if any one was coming to take my life. I was in duty bound to protect myself—I did not know who were coming—I was a member of the Wat Tyler Brigade—I did not expect they were coming, or the Emmett Brigade, or the Felon Club—I have shot sparrows in my own ground—I bought the gun to shoot, it did not matter what, if they came to take my life—Davis told me we should all be fetched out of our beds, and I said if that was the ease I should want a gun to protect my wife and family, and to protect my garden—I have shot cats, and a dog as well—I bought it to protect my wife and family—it was too long to take in the streets; it was five feet long I could not load it—I had not got anything to take into the

streets—I do not recollect at all where I was on 16th Aug.—I recollect the day the persons were taken up at the Orange Tree—I was in town on that evening; I heard something was going on in the evening, and walked up to London-bridge, and round some of the streets, I cannot say which; I am a stranger in London; some man showed me where to go—I met him in Church-passage, Greenwich—Davis did not advise me not to come up, he advised me to go up—I did not go to the Orange Tree—Davis did not tell me not to go—next morning he said, "It was a very good job you did not take my advice, and go to town"—I heard something was to take place, I did not know what—I heard of fires and other things from Davis, not from any one else—I do not know who it was that I met—he said be knew me well, and I said if he was going up to town I would go—we met two or three on the road—I left my gun at home—no persons that were with me had anything that I am aware of—I did not see anything—when we got to London, we called in Bermondsey as we came, and had two pots of beer—there was no one else there, but a man singing songs—we staid in the public-house till half-past eleven, and then came to London-bridge, and where we went then I cannot be positive—I do not know the road—I did not go into any other house till 1 got to my own house—we went over London-bridge, and came over another bridge—I do not know what bridge, I believe it was the next one—this person took me—these were three of us altogether—I do not know Webber-street—I then went home.

MR. PARRY. Q. What time did you start to see what was going on is London? A. After ten o'clock—I met another man just as I had started—I had been at work all the afternoon, not the whole of the day—after I left off work, at half-past five, I went home and had my tea—nothing was to be seen when we got up to London—we got up about twelve or one o'clock.





WILLIAM DOW
. I live at Blackheath—I know Davis. Between May and Aug. he asked me if I was a Chartist—he has asked me to become a Chartist, and to go to the Druid's Arms—I never did—he has frequently pressed me to do so—on the Saturday before Whit-Monday, I saw Davis with a pair of pistols—he told me he was going to a meeting at Bonner's-fields, and should take his pistols, and use them if it was required—he asked me whether I had any arms—he did not to my knowledge offer to sell me arms—he said I ought to have arms—I do not remember his offering to supply me—I remember his saying, on one occasion, something about that he would do his best to destroy the present Government, as they were bringing the people to starvation—not those exact words—he said the country was in a sad state, and we were all coming to poverty—he did not say anything to my knowledge about doing his best to destroy the present Government—he said it would be better for me and my family if I joined the Chartists—I declined it.





WILLIAM JOHN GARRETT

Cross-examined by
MR. CLARKSON. Q. You have been a Chartist a great number of years? A. I have—I belong to the Marylebone Locality—that is not the Emmett Brigade—I attended the demonstration on 10th April—I

went from my own house—I called at ray locality, and the principal part were gone, and I went with the remainder to Kennington-common—I did not reach the procession till they were turning into Holborn, and I joined it there, and we all marched arm-in-arm, three or four abreast, and then went to Kennington-common—there were a great many, sixty or seventy thousand—we went to take the national petition—I do not know that before that I saw notices in the street warning people from attending that meeting—I do not know that I swore at my last examination that I did—I do not know whether I did or not—it was given out at the locality that no man was to carry even a stick, and I do not know any man that did—I tried to get over Westminster-bridge on my way home, and could not—I waited, 3nd tried to get over Vauxhall-bridge, and was told it was all blocked up with police—I waited till the police left, and then caroe over Westminster-bridge.

MR. PARRY. Q. I dare say you saw a great many well-dressed people at the meeting as we'l as working men? A. I did.





RICHARD PINNELL
. I am a carpenter, and live at India-cottages, Hoxton Old-town. I have known Powell for the last twelve or thirteen years—I recollect his speaking to me, between April and August, about the Government—he said it was a weak and b----Government, and "we (meaning the Chartists) would send Lord John Russell and Sir George Grey to the devil within another month"—that was a week or two before 10th April—he alluded to the meeting that was going to take place at Kennington-common—he had asked me to go to Cartwright's, and become a Chartist—I declined, and said I would not have anything to do with them—I recollect his saying, "Look at the Queen, with her hundreds of thousands a year, spending in waste and idleness, while we are obliged to work from morning to night to get a mouthful of bread"—he said, "I will blow her and the b—foreigner and the b----family to hell"—I suppose he was alluding to Prince Albert—he said if I called at his house next Sunday he would show me materials sufficient to blow London to hell in half an hour—I have beard him express his opinion on religious subjects many times, and from what I have known of him I would not believe him on his oath—I have heard him called Lying Tom to his face, scores of times—he was never known by any other name.

Cross-examined by
MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL. Q. Are you a Chartist? A. No—I was found out as a witness by one of the men in Mr. Smith's shop—I do not know his name, he called on me, and told me to go to some gentleman's house at Dalston; I do not know his name—I never made any inquiry about it—that man wrote a letter which I signed, and it was published in the Northern Star—a card was left at my house for me to go to a street in Dalston—I have not got the card here, I have lost it—the number of the man's house, and the name of the street was written on it; that was all—I live about a mile and a half from Dalston—no further message was left with the card, than that this party wished to see me at nine o'clock that night—what I understood was, that this stranger had been at Mr. Smith's shop, and the men there told that stranger that I had worked with Powell a length of time, and they thought it was likely if he would call on me that I might give some information, and I went—I do not know the man's name—he was a shoemaker—at least I saw some shoes in his house—I was not examined by an attorney—I do not know Mullins, I never saw him—I never knew Cuffey, or Lacey, or any of the men—what the man wrote and I signed was all correct, I believe—I would not believe Powell on his oath, because I have heard him swear that he would swear anything if he could get paid for it—that was in the shop, times out of number within the last thirteen

years—it is about nineteen months since I worked with him—that is not my only reason for not believing him—I would not believe him on account of his bad actions respecting religion—I have heard him call Jesus Christ a thief, and the Virgin Mary the biggest wh—that ever walked—I have seen him break up certain portions of Scripture and put them into the fire—when I was last here I gave as a reason for not believing him on his oath that I had seen him take the New Testament from his box, and wherever the name of our Saviour occurred cut it out and burn it—I have seen him do so on several occasions—he did not have fresh books—I have known him go out of a morning to buy a rasher of bacon, and he would bring it wrapped up in a piece of the New Testament, and as he was reading it he would break it, and I have seen him do it in a book—he tore out the part where Christ's name was—he did not throw the whole leaf into the fire, only that part—he would break off that part, and throw it into the fire—I did not on the last occasion say he cut it out—he broke it off, not the whole page—he only broke out those portions, and also wherever the name of the Apostles occurred—I have seen him take the book out of his chest for the purpose—I do not think he was in the habit of reading it—he kept it in his chest, but he made all sorts of sport of it—I never associated with him—I did not dare to complain to his brother-in-law, Mr. Smith—I have worked with him twelve or thirteen years, and in that time it may have happened once or twice in twelve months, or it might not happen once in three years, but I know it did happen in many instances during the time I was there—I cannot say how often—perhaps it might have been a dozen times in the whole time—I should say it was—I would not believe him on any account, because I know he is capable of anything that is bad—he never did a good action in his life—I believe he would hang his wife and family for 4d.—he would do it for anything in the shape of money—that is my belief, on my oath.

MR. PARRY. Q. Did he tear the part out with his hand? A. Yes—I have seen him do it more than once, and when throwing it into the fire he said, "We will burn that b----"—always when he got into conversation about religion he would use that and other opprobrious expressions in reference to our Saviour—I have heard him say, speaking of his father, if he could get at the old b---—he would get hold of his bones, he would pull them out of the grave and strew them about the streets, and he hoped and trusted his old soul was in the middle of hell burning—I have heard him swear that scores of times, with his eyes rolling about, and his arms shaking like a madman—when I say I have heard him swear, I mean I have heard him say "So help me God!"





JAMES BENNETT
. I live at 9, Leonard-square, and am a shoemaker. I know Powell—I met him at the National Hall, Holborn, on 3rd April, and walked home with him—he asked me what I was going to do on 10th April—I told him I intended to go to Kennington-common—he asked me if I intended to go armed—I said, no, certainly not, I considered any man an injurer to the cause that went armed—Powell said I was a b----fool if I did not; he should, and every man ought, or something to that effect—he said he had been making hand-grenades, and that they had penetrated halfway through an inch-board—he had tried the experiment in his own back room—I did not ask him how they were made, but he told me—he said a ginger-beer bottle, or any kind of bottle, half filled with powder and half with hard nails, or any kind of substance, I think it was ginger-beer bottle he mentioned, and by throwing them among the police they would break the b----s legs—he said they were to be corked up, and a fusee put to them—I met him

a week afterwards, and he asked me how the Chartists were getting on—I said the country seemed in a very agitated state—he said he had ten men, and he wanted five more good men as they were, and he could take the Artillery-ground easily—I asked him how it was possible that so small a quantity of men could take the Artillery-ground—he said the men he had understood spiking the artillery—I do not know what he meant by it, but I believe those were his words—he said he had a plan for taking London, or something: to that effect.

Cross-examined by
MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL. Q. What society do you belong to? A. The Whittington and Cat—I am a Chartist—I have been so nine years, and shall be to the day of my death—I am not a physical force man; I go by Feargus O'Connor's instructions, who I understand is a moral force Chartist—I was at the Kennington-common meeting—I did not go armed; I should have been a fool to have done so; the executive issued orders that the people should not go armed—if they had issued other orders I should not have done so—I cannot say who are the executive—I obeyed them, because they were elected by the people—they were to govern the people—I understand the six points of the Charter—I do not know what the executive were elected for—I obeyed them, because I considered them a moral set of men—I obey any moral set of men, although I do not know them—they give their orders by issuing an address—the address is not communicated to the wardens of the different localities—I learn them from reading the pamphlets—they are printed; they are not sent round to the Chartists—the orders are published in the Northern Star, which I have taken in for nine years—I would as soon go without my dinner on a Sunday as go without my paper—I read the Northern Star, and of course if there is an article in it that I approve of, of course I take notice of it—I have got it impressed on my mind, there are nothing but moral orders given there—there are no orders, but an address, or something of that kind—if an address is issued by the executive I expect to find it in the Northern Star, and no doubt the Chartists look in it for their orders.

MR. PARRY. Q. Is the executive the governing body of an association formed for obtaining the six points of the Charter? A. Yes; it is formed for obtaining the Charter by peaceful and constitutional means—I am a member of it, and shall continue so—I subscribe to its funds, and have done so for nine years—the executive is elected by the members of the association, and they act accordingly.

COURT. Q. Will you just say what the six points of the Charter are? A. Universal suffrage, vote by ballot, triennial parliaments, no qualification of members, payment of members; upon my word I forget the sixth at present—this is the first time I was ever in a Court, and I am rather put about.

MR. PARRY. Q. Equal electoral districts? A. That is it—I think that was a point when I first joined it, and I consider it one of the grandest points.





DANIEL BYRNE
. I live in Shoreditch, and am a sofa-maker. I know Powell—I remember his showing me some pistols on or about the 10th April—he told me he intended to arm himself before going to Kennington-common—I have heard him talk repeatedly about assassinating the police, at the coffee-shop where I take my meals—he said he hoped the people would assassin-ate the police and fire the houses—I remember his saying on one occasion, when he showed me a pistol, "These are the things that will do for them; I wish to sec all the police assassinated, and to have some good fires in

London"—I have seen him with pistols twice—I have repeatedly heard him, at the coffee-house, urge men to arm.

Cross-examined by
MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL. Q. Were you not at the Milton-street Theatre in April? A. I was on 28th July—it was a Chartist meeting—Mullins was there—I went up to him, and cautioned him against Powell, knowing him to be a dangerous man, knowing what he had done to other men—I cautioned Mullins, Rose, and Shaw, and other men on the platform, against Powell, because I believed him to be a spy—I cannot mention the other persons names; there were a great many—I did not take particular notice whether Bezer was there; he might, or might not have been—Shaw is the man who was convicted—I did not see Brewster there, or Ritchie—I do not know Gurney or Lacey; at least, I never saw Lacey before he was in the dock—there were a great many there, but I do not know their names—I have been a Chartist since 1839—I went to Kennington-common by myself, not in the procession—I was caught in the trap at the bridge, and will never go to a Chartist meeting again over the bridges—I thought I had no right to be prevented going to my house—I found 1 was prevented going to my house, and that is the reason I will not go over there again—when I cautioned. Mullins against Powell, he said, "That is not Powell, it is Johnson;" and I denied that his name was Johnson—I had always known him by the name of Powell—I heard him answer by that name—I never heard him called Johnson before that.





JOHN WESTMORELAND
. I am a tailor, carrying on business at Watling-street, City. I am a real six-point moral-force Chartist—I remember Powell coming to me and saying he had a project of organization that he thought would be most desirable to act on for taking London, and carrying out his physical force operations—he gave me this paper (produced)—on one occasion he showed me the drawing of a plan—he did not give me that—he introduced himself to me—I never saw him before.

Cross-examined by
MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL. Q. How long have you been a Chartist? A. Upwards of forty years—I am a moral force Chartist—I have been in the habit of attending Cartwright's, and speaking occasionally—I do not know about being ill-received when I spoke my moral force doctrines: I spoke what I conceived to be the truth—I have heard my doctrines applauded very much by certain respectable men who attended there—till this miscreant came among us we were all real moral force Chartists, and nothing else—he made impressions on some unfortunate individuals, but not on many: I am sorry to say many became victims to his insinuations—I heard something of a meeting where the people paraded, but I know nothing about it more than hearsay—I never made a speech out of window in my life; it is all a mistake—I have subscribed to the defence of these prisoners, because I considered they deserved to be supported from the villanous conduct of this miscreant—they were unsuspectingly lead into the mischief they hare been guilty of—I do not know any of the prisoners personally—Mullins was not a member of Cartwright's meeting, to my knowledge—I never saw him before—I presume he was lead into it by Powell—I know nothing of it from my own knowledge.





THOMAS CLARK
. I am a Chartist. Some months back I was connected with the executive, but am not now—lam still a member of the National Charter Association—I believe there are at present in that association what are called class-leaders—I know the rules of that association—this is a prospectus of the association (looking at it)—I believe it was formed on the plan

of the Wesleyan body—I was at the drawing up of the rules—as far as I know its objects are peaceable and lawful.
(George Thurston, Thomas Oaborne, Henry Watson, and Alfred Carr, were called upon their subpœnas, but did not attend.)
(Peter Nugent Kingston, M. D.; George Frederick Knox, cupper, of Westminster Hospital; and Henry Cattell, tailor, 10, Perceval-street, Clerkenwell, deposed to the prisoner's good character.)




GUILTY. Aged 22.—Strongly recommended to mercy by the Jury, on account of his youth, and his being led away by some bad associates.

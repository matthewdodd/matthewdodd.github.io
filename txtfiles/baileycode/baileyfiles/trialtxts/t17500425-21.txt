            . I live in Savage-gardens, Tower-hill. I was coming home about twelve at night, and the prisoner came up to me, and addressed me in these words: Sir, Sir, for all you have got, by God, and presented a pistol to me. I gave a spring to a watchman that was near, and the prisoner run away. In the middle of Poor Jury-lane he was taken, and had another man by him, which I supposed to be an accomplice ; I believe he gave the pistol to him. I had a perfect view of him, it being at a lamp.
The two watchmen that took him confirmed the above, one hearing the very words of the prisoner. The prisoner's defence was, that he heard the cry, Stop Thief, and ran to find him, so fell down, and they laid hold of him.

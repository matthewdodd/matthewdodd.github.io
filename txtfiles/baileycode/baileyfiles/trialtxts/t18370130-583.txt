I keep a shoe shop in Playhouse-yard, St. Luke's On the 25th of January the prisoner and three more came into the shop and looked at some shoes—I told them I did not want their custom—they went away, and 1 missed a pair of shoes—they came a second time, in about an hour, and I said I would thank them to go away—one said he wanted a pair of shoes—I said, "I dare say you do, but I don't want your custom—they turned away—I looked and saw the prisoner bad got on his feet, the shoes I had lost—I followed them—they mended their pace, and I could not catch them—I went to the end of the yard—I stopped there, and said a boy had gone away with my shoes—the policeman came up and went and brought the prisoner back with my shoes on his feet—they are marked inside.

Prisoner. I bought them the day before in Petticoat-lane—how can the know they are hers? Witness. There is my mark inside—my husband repaired them.

Prisoner. When the shoes were taken off there was no mark on them—I bought them of a Jew—there were six more pairs much like them, and they all had yellow linings.

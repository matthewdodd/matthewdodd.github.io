MARGARET LOVETT
 and 




ELIZABETH AVERN, alias
 Avery,






were indicted for stealing, on the 
11th of Nov.; 1 boot, value 2s. 9d., the goods of. 



John Matthews; and that Avern had been before convicted of felony.






RICHARD GUT
. I am shopman to John Matthews, a shoemaker, in Black-friars-road. On the afternoon of the 11th of Nov. the two prisoners came to the shop with another female—the other one asked for a pair of clogs, but bought none—they were about five minutes in the shop, and left together—I saw Lovett take a boot off a form, inside the shop; and when they got out she handed it to Avern, who put it into her basket—I followed and gave them in charge—I have the fellow-boot here.

Lovett, I did not take it. The other girl asked us to go in about the clogs. He could not see me take it, because I was standing up; the other girl sat on the form. Witness. Lovett took it, and it was she sat on the form.

Cross-examined by
MR. CHARNOCK. Q. Was the other female rather older than the prisoners? A. Yes—I am certain this is the boot—Avern was a very short distance from Lovett—she was persuading them to come in and look at the things, before they came in—she said to the others, "Go in, and try them on"—they had got two or three yards from the shop when I came up to them.





CHARLES THOMAS GAYLES
. I am a policeman. I took the prisoners, and received the boot from Guy.





BENJAMIN PARSONS
. I am a policeman. I produce a certificate of Avern'a former conviction, which I got from the office of the clerk of the peace for Surrey—(read)—I was present at her trial—she is the person.

Cross-examined. Q. How many trials have you been at since that? A.


One—I have not had a female in custody since—I have seen Avern in company with thieves and prostitutes.

LOVETT—

            . I live in Brunswick-place, City-road


. On the 11th of November, in consequence of information, I examined the roof of my brew-house, belonging to my dwelling-house, and found the lead takenoff. The officer produced some, which matched with what was left. I found a chisel behind the premises, and part of a case knife, which had cut the lead. I had seen it all safe on the 9th.

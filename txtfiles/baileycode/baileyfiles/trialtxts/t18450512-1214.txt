1214. 




JOHN JONES
 was indicted

 for stealing 1 watch, value 3l., the goods of 



James Brooks; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






ANN BROOKS
. I am the wife of James Brooks; we live in Devonshire-street, Lambeth. On the 19th of Nov. the prisoner, whom I knew before, came and dined with me—I went out, and asked him to remain while I went out—I came back in about ten minutes, and he was gone—I heard something, and went into the back parlour—my husband's watch was gone, which had been safe when I went away—this is it.





EMILY SNELGROVE
. I saw the prisoner come out of Mrs. Brooks's

house—he had the watch in his hand—I saw the chain, and knew it was Mr. Brooks's.





JOHN MELVILLE
. This watch was pawned with me on the 20th of Nov., I believe by the prisoner.





JOHN WILLIAMSON
 (police-constable G 198.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got at Westminster—(read—Convicted 28th Jan., 1845, and confined three months)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 18.—


Transported for Seven Years.

            . I keep the Barley-Mow in Chick-Lane


; on the twentieth of last month, between eight and nine at night, the prosecutor, prisoner, and another woman, came into my house and had a pint of beer; the prisoner snatch'd something, I can't tell what it was, out of the prosecutor's hand, and said, she would have a pennyworth of oysters, and went out at the door. When she came in the prosecutor ask'd her for his money; then the woman that was with them call'd me, and said, the prisoner had taken a piece of gold out of Haddon's hand.
Q. What is that other woman's name?
Marg. Jones. Her name is 
               
                  Mary 
                  Pearce 
               



            .
Q. What were her words?
Jones. She said Dolly had taken a piece of gold out of this man's hand, and would not give it him again. Then said I, Poh, Poh, she is only playing the rogue, I dare say she will give it him: come, Dolly, give the man his money. She said she would not give it him 'till such time he had given her a shilling.
Q. What did she pretend that shilling was for? did he owe her a shilling?
Jones. She said it was for oysters and beer some time ago.
Q. Did you know them both before?
Jones. I had seen the woman before, but did not know the man; I knew both the women.
Q. How long have you known the prisoner?
Jones. I have known her about eleven years, ever since I have been in that neighbourhood, but were no ways acquainted.
Q. What is her business?
Jones. She sold fruit and oysters, and things of that sort about the street. The man said, he never owed her a farthing in his life. After some-time we perswaded him to give her a shilling. She was going to take it. Stop, said he, perhaps you will take the shilling as you did the gold; then he gave the shilling into my hand to hold 'till he had his piece of money. Then she said, he should not have the money at all; and I had no business with it. I endeavoured to perswade her very much to let him have it; but she said, it was no business of mine. I told her, it was my business, because it was done in my house. She bid me to mind my house, and not busy myself with that. Then I told her, that she must abide by the consequence of it. Then he went for a constable and she was taken up.

                  Haddon 
               



            . I live with Messieurs Edmund and 
               
                  Joseph 
                  Woods 
               



            , Distillers in Warwick-Lane; I am a yearly servant, a porter. I have known the prisoner upwards of three years; I have seen her selling fruit and oysters about with a barrow. On the twentieth of September I met with her in Chick-Lane, she was standing in the street with another woman, named 
               
                  Mary 
                  Pearce 
               



            . One of them call'd Will, will you give us a pint of beer, I answer'd I would. We went in at Mrs Jones's, which was not above twenty yards from where they were standing. I never stopp'd in the street with them a moment; nor was I with them in any other house. I call'd for a pint of beer and we drank once a-piece. I pull'd out some half-pence to pay, and by chance pull'd out a 3 l. 12 s. piece. The prisoner snatch'd it out of my hand, and said she would look at it. She said she had not seen such a piece of money a good while. I did not pretend to catch hold of it at that time, thinking her honest. She went out at the door; I expected she would return and bring it me. She came in again; I asked her for it; she denied having it, and said she knew nothing of it. I thought she was joking, asked for it again, and said, Do not play about with the money and lose it; it was a great deal of money to me. At last she began to swear that she knew nothing of it, and did not know who had got it; she got up, I catch'd hold of her, and stopp'd her from going out. The people of the house wanted me to search her. She swore vengeance bitterly against any person that should offer to touch a rag of her cloaths; and said, she had a sore breast, and let any body put their hand in her bosom if they dare. I did not search her, but got a constable: when he came he said he had no business to search her, but took her in charge. She was carried that night to Clerkenwell-Bridewell, and from thence to Justice Welch. I heard her examined. She denied having it. The Justice ask'd her, how she came to offer to produce it, in case I would give her a shilling? but I do not remember her answer. I never saw my money since.
Q. Had you any other dealings with her?
Haddon. I never had any other dealings with her in my life.


                  Mary 
                  Pearce 
               



            . I saw the prisoner take a piece of money out the prosecutor's hand, but I can not say what piece. She went out twice at the door after that; and she said, if he would give her a shilling she would give him the piece of money again.
Prisoner's Defence.
All I have to say is this, I was coming down Chick-Lane, 
               
                  Mary 
                  Pearce 
               



             and he were talking together: she said she was going to Mrs Jones's to have a pint of beer together; she ask'd me to go and have some with her; I went and sat down by the side of her, and the man on the other side; presently a woman came in with oysters, I said I could like a pennyworth, he pull'd out a piece of money, and said, how could you like such a piece as this to go to market with? I said, Do you think I never was mistress of a crown in my life? I went out to buy a pennyworth of oysters, the woman opened me five; I ask'd her to change me that piece of money, she offered to throw it in the kennel; then she took it up again, and a man took it out of my hand and look'd at it. I brought in the oysters, and gave him his money again, and said, Here, they will not give me change for it. 
               
                  Mary 
                  Pearce 
               



             was there; I said I could like to have them with some vinegar. I said, William, you owe me a shilling, some I lent you, and some I trusted you. 
               
                  Mary 
                  Pearce 
               



             went out at the door, and when he could not find the money I was taken to Clerkenwell, and before Justice Welch, and there stripp'd, and if any body had the money, that woman (pointing to 
               
                  Mary 
                  Pearce 
               



            ) must have it. God Almighty bless every body, I am but one.
For the Prisoner.

                  Dennison 
               



            . The prisoner came out of Mrs Jones's house to me for a half pennyworth of oysters, I opened her three, she gave me this piece of money to change; I gave it my husband to look at, and he said it was a three pound twelve shilling piece, but it wanted something of weight, and he gave it her again; and I saw her put it into her bosom, and she went back into the house.


                  Daniel 
                  Dennison 
               



            . I am husband to the last witness; I took a three pound twelve shilling piece out of my wife's hand, and said it wanted something of weight. The prisoner came out first for a half-pennyworth of oysters, and then had three, I gave her the money again. She came out a second time for a half-pennyworth more; then she pulled that piece out of her bosom, and said, Daniel, Here is the piece again; that was all she said; she had two oysters for that half-penny: now said she, I have had five for my penny: I saw her put the piece of money into her bosom a second time, and she went in again.


                  Mary 
                  Woolington 
               



            . I have known the prisoner six or seven years; I never knew her to wrong man, woman, or child, in my life. I have shared fish with her this six years. I have lent her many a crown, and she always paid me honestly; and, I believe in my heart she is a very honest woman.
Isabella Mason. I live in George-yard Field-lane, and sell fish; I have known the prisoner upwards of three years; I never knew that she ever wronged me, or any body else; she lived on Saffron-hill.


                  Elizabeth 
                  Barley 
               



            . I live in Black-friers; but I did live in Field-lane; and have known the prisoner nine years; I never knew her to wrong any body in my life; I have shared fish with her at the Gate.
Q. What do you mean by sharing of fish?
Barley. That is, putting our money together to buy fish. I always took her to be an industrious body.


                  Sarah
               


             Neither. I sell fruit in the New-Market; I have known her fifteen or sixteen years; I have sold her many bushels of fruit; I never knew her to wrong any body in my life; she always paid me justly.


                  Elizabeth 
                  Harris 
               



            . I have known the prisoner about six years; she is as honest a person as ever was in the world.


                  Ann 
                  Bigshine 
               



            . I have known her about seven years; I deal in fruit; I never knew her to wrong man, woman, or child, but to labour daily and hourly, as other poor women do.

SAMUEL PHILLIPS. My father keeps a china-shop in Queen-street. On the 25th of October, at twelve o'clock at night, I was in King's Head-yard


, returning from my father's stable, where I had been racking up the horse - I met the prisoner, who was a stranger; she spoke to me, and asked where I was going - she put her hand into my pocket; I said, "Let me have none of your nonsense," and was going to pass her - I found her hand in my waistcoat pocket, where I had 5s. 6d.; I said nothing to her, but called for the Police-man - she had taken four shillings and three sixpences out of my pocket; when I called for the Police she gave me back 4s. 6d. - she was searched, and two sixpences found on her; I am confident I had the money in my pocket when she came up to me - it had not been long in my pocket.

            . I am a Police-constable. The prosecutor called me, and I went up - he was very much frightened, and said the woman had robbed him, and given him back 4s. 6d. when she saw me coming; I took her to the watch-house, and found two sixpences on her.

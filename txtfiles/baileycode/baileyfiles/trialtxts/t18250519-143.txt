. The prisoner was brought from the workhouse to assist my wife, who has been ill ever since Christmas; I missed the articles stated in the indictment: she went away without giving me notice on the 21st of April; she went to the workhouse, and got her discharge. I never saw her again till she was taken into custody.

            . I live with Mr. Wadmore, pawnbroker, Tottenham-court-road. I have a book, pawned on the 19th of April, in the name of Smith - I believe by the prisoner.

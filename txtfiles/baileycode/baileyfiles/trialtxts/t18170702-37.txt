WILLIAM HOUSEMAN. On the 23d of May, about two o'clock in the afternoon, during the fire at Mr. Mist's house, I was passing up Fleet-street


; I pressed my handkerchief down in my pocket, and occasionally felt to see that it was safe, soon after I missed it; and saw it found on the prisoner, Miles.

            . I am an officer. I saw the prisoners in the crowd, and saw them attempt several pockets, they were watching Mr. Houseman; at last I saw the prisoner, Douglas, make a motion which induced me to suspect them. I seized them, and found the handkerchief upon Miles, and Houseman claimed it.

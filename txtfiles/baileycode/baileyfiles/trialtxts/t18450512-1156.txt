JAMES WILLIAMS
 was indicted

 for stealing 1 purse, value 7d.; 1 sovereign, 6 shillings, 3 sixpences, and 4 groats; the property of 



John Hunter, from the person of 



Mary Hunter.






MARY HUNTER
. I am the wife of John Hunter, a tailor, in Maddox-street. On the 3rd of May, about two o'clock in the afternoon, I was at a concert at the Hanover-square Rooms—I had in my pocket a handker-chief, a vinaigrette, and a purse with a sovereign atone end, and some silver at the other—it was safe, and when I returned it was gone—this is my purse.





ROBERT WILLIAM OLLIVIER
. I am a music-seller, and live in Bond-street. I walked into the Hanover-square Rooms on the 3rd of May, between four and five o'clock, with a friend—the prisoner stooped between my friend and me, and was about to put his hand into my friend's pocket, but he turned, and the prisoner went away—I watched, and saw him try from twenty to thirty pockets, everybody that he could get at—I saw him pass something under a coat to another one who was with him—I went and told Mr. Whall and a private constable, that there were two thieves in the room—the officer took the prisoner, and this purse was found upon him—I caught the other one.





JOHN WHALL
. I am the officer. I found another purse on the prisoner, which I cannot find an owner for, as well as the prosecutor's.

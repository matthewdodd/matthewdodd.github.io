WILLIAM VENNING
. I live in Cleveland-street, Fitzroy-square. The prisoner's father-in-law, John Moreau, lodged at my house—the prisoner lived there with his father and mother—on Sunday evening, the 3rd of May, I saw the prisoner go out with a large bundle—I ran down stairs after him, and overtook him in Southampton-street—I asked what he had got—he said nothing belonging to me; it was his mother's property—I said, would he go back with me—he threw the bundle down at my feet, and said, "Take it back yourself"—I gave him and the bundle to the officer—these are the articles.





CELLA MOREAU
. I am the prisoner's mother. These things are my husband's property—the prisoner lived at home with us—he has lived in very respectable places, but turned out so wicked, he could not keep them—he has wronged me, and then gone away for three or four days—I left him locked in my room on the 3rd of May, while I went after my little girl, at five minutes after eight o'clock, and when I returned, I found my door broken open, and the prisoner and these things were gone.

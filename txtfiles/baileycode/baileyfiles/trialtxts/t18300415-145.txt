. On the 19th of March the prisoner came with another young woman to look at some bonnet ribbons - the young woman who was serving them left the drawer of ribbons before them, and went to the window to get some others; I saw the prisoner take one piece out of the drawer - I went to the door and stood till they were coming out; I then said I wanted to speak to them - they said for what; I said if they would come back I would tell them; they walked backwards towards the counter, and the prisoner tried to drop the ribbon on the counter, but it fell on the floor.
Prisoner. He knocked it out of my hand when the lady asked 8d. a yard for it. Witness. I never touched it - she took it, put it under her shawl, and was going out with it; this is the ribbon - there are eighteen yards of it; it is worth 10s.

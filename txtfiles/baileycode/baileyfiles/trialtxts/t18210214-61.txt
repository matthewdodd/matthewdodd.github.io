            . I am a cabinet-maker
, and live in Tottenham-court-road


; the prisoner was my servant
, and entrusted to receive money for me. On the 23d of October
, I sent him to Mr. Lance, to receive 1 l., the balance of an account; he returned, and said it was not convenient for him to pay it. Nine days after I discharged him, but afterwards had him apprehended. He gave an account of the money received on my account, which I found correct. He never accounted to me for this money.

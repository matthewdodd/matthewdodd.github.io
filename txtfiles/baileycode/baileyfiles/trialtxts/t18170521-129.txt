            . I am a baker
, and live in Crawford-street. I left my basket and barrow in Northumberland-street


, while I went into a house, at half-past nine o'clock in the morning, when I came out it was gone. I found it again between one and two o'clock, at St. Pancras watchhouse.
EDWARD LOWE. On the 13th of May, about eleven o'clock in the morning, the prisoner passed my door witha sack on his back, with somthing in it, which I took to be bread, I was going to stop him, when a Jew came up, and said he saw him fill the sack with loaves, from a barrow in Howland-mews. I followed him, and stopped him in Foley-street, and insisted on his taking the sack back to where he got it from; when he got to the place a great mob assembled, and endeavoured to rescue him. I detained him, and kept him there for sometime, thinking the man would come back, and then took him to the watchhouse, with great difficulty. At twelve o'clock I found the property belonged to Dix.
HENRY HOWARD. I took the prisoner into custody; he said a man told him he might take as many as he liked.

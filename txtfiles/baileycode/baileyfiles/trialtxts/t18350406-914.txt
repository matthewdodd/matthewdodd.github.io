MARY BIRBECK
. I am the wife of William Birbeck—we keep the White Swan, in Coleman-street—I never saw the prisoner till the 29th of March, when he came to our bar and inquired for a lodging—I let him one—the articles stated were in the room he slept in—on leaving my room the next morning, at twenty minutes before 9 o'clock, I met him coming out of the room he had slept in—I begged him not to shut the door, but he did shut it—I went in and missed a sheet—I called over the balustrade for him to be stopped—he had got out of the house, but was followed and brought. back—this sheet was found round his body, the coat on his back, and in his hat this shirt.





WILLIAM BIRBECK
. I am the prosecutor—I took the prisoner—what my wife has stated is correct.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
The prisoner pleaded poverty.

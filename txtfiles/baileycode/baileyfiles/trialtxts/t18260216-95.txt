PETER SMITH. I keep an earthenware-shop
, at No. 61, Earl-street, Manchester-square


. The two prisoners came into my shop one evening, I was in the parlour, and my son in the shop - he called me out, I went and asked the prisoners what they wanted; Wright said, "A black-lead pencil;" I laid them on the counter - they seemed to want some more, and I got some; Mr. Allen then came in, and said, "Don't let them go, they have robbed you of a glass;" the watchman was sent for, but before he came I heard Wright let something fall - I looked and saw it was a salt-cellar, which he dropped at his feet - and I saw it lay broken; I said, "That has fallen from you;" he said, "No, it fell from a shelf;" the witness then said, "He has got another" - and I immediately heard another fall;" I said,"There is another;" Harris said, "No, it is not a salt-cellar, it is my top.'

            . I saw the two prisoners in the shop. Wright took the salts out of the window - I went in and told Mr. Smith of it.
WRIGHT'S Defence. I went into the shop to buy a pencil, the man came in and said I wanted to steal a glass - I stepped back and trod upon a glass - and he said I had dropped it.

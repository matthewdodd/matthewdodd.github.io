             the 27th of February
 last.
It appear'd by the Evidence, That the Plank of the Prosecutor's Cellar-Window was broken, and the Door unpinn'd, and that some Person had gotten out of the Cellar into the Shop, through a Hole cut in the Floor to let down Coals, and that the Maid hearing a Noise, gave Notice to her Mistress and the Apprentices, who going down into the Cellar with a Watchman, found the Prisoner lying upon the Coals, cover'd with one of the Workmen's Coats, and he being searched, the Scissors were found in his Pocket, one of the Points of which was broken, and the Piece of it in the Money Drawer.
The Prisoner pretended he was shut out of his Lodging, and as he was going along, the Plank being open, he fell down into the Cellar, and being shut out, lay down to sleep there; but this not availing, the Jury found him 


               guilty to the value of 10d.

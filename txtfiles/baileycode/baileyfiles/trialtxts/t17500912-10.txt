            , was indicted for 


               stealing one silver quart mug, val. 39 s.
             the goods of 
               
                  
                     William 
                     Humphreys 
                  




               
            , Aug. 11
.


                  William 
                  Humphreys 
               



            . On the 11th of Aug. the prisoner was at my house (I keep a public-house in Elbow-lane, near the three cranes
) he was in company drinking and singing. One 
               
                  William 
                  Rogers 
               



             came to me, and told me, they missed a tankard, and desired I wou'd come up, and make search; accordingly I did. I found none. The prisoner was searched as well as the rest. I knew all the company very well except the prisoner, which gave me a suspicion of him. I challenged him with knowing what was become of it. When he found he must go to the Counter, he owned he had taken it out of the house, and carried it to Dowgate-hill, and hid it behind a spur of a door to an empty house. I took Mr. Lazure and 
               
                  Samuel 
                  Woodward 
               



            . We found it according as he had said, with a parcel of lavender upon it.
This testimony was confirmed by 
               
                  Samuel 
                  Woodward 
               



             and 
               
                  Charles 
                  Lazure 
               



             ; and also that the prisoner had been out of the Room at one time for about ten minutes.



               Guilty
            .

WILLIAM THORN
. I am shopman to Mr. William Davies, of Chiswell-street, a linen-draper. The prisoner came there on the 24th of September—I watched, and saw him take this lawn from the counter—I left him alone to see what he would do—he concealed it in his trowsers, and went out—he was brought back, and I saw Mr. Davies take the lawn from him.

MARY ANN SMITH
 was indicted

 for stealing 2 handkerchiefs, value 4s.; 1 shawl, 6s.; 1 towel, 1s.; 1 shift, 3s. 6d.; 2 sovereigns, 2 half-sovereigns, and 4 half-crowns; the property of 



Thomas Watson; and that she had been before convicted of felony.







HEPHZIBAH WATSON
. I am the wife of Thomas Watson, we live in Radnor-street, St. Luke's; the prisoner lodged at our house. On the 28th of Sept. I missed all the property stated—the money had been in a drawer, which was always kept locked—the things that are here are mine—the prisoner had not left, she was still there—these things were found under her bed—they had been taken from two different drawers in my sleeping-room, which is adjoining to her room—I lost two sovereigns, two half-sovereigns, and four half-crowns; 2l. 7s. has been found.





JAMES REDMAN
. (police-sergeant G 20.) I was sent for, and found this property concealed under the prisoner's bed—the prosecutrix owned it—the prisoner had denied having any property at all.





HENRY REDMAN
. I found a sovereign, eight half-crowns, and seven shillings, in the prisoner's room—she said it was given to her by a gentleman last March—in going to the station, she said, "You will not find the bedgown; I have not got it"—I said, "You said so about the other things"—she said, "The door was open and 1 went in and took them."

Prisoner. I acknowledge taking the other things, but the money was given to me.





JOHN BROWN
 (police-constable N 180.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 40.—


Transported for Seven Years.

EDWARD HORN
. I am assistant to Messrs. Walker, pawnbrokers, Waterloo-terrace, Commercial-road. On the 3rd of November a gentleman alarmed me—I went out into the street, looked about, and saw the prisoner running with the coat on his arm,—I pursued him, and took him in a gateway with the coat, which belongs to Robert Walker and others—it hung outside the shop. I had seen it safe half an hour before.





THOMAS GODFREY
. I am a policeman. Horn called me, and I took the prisoner.

Prisoner's Defence. I was coming from the West India Docks, and found the coat on the pavement—as soon as the gentleman came to me I asked him if the coat was his?—he said said, "Yes"—I gave it to him instantly and went with him as freely as if I had done nothing.





WILLIAM OSMOND

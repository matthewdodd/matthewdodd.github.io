            . I am a widow. I wash and iron, or any thing that I can get to do. On the 9th of October, the prisoner met me in Oxford-street


, about eleven o'clock at night. It rained very hard; and he offered to hold the umbrella up. I refused him, and he took the umbrella out of my hand, and ran away with it. I ran after him, and cried out, stop thief. He was stopped with the umbrella, in Stratford place.
Q. He committed no violence to you, did he - A. No. He was tipsy at the time, or else I believe he would not have done it.

            . I am a constable. About twelve o'clock, I heard somebody cry out, stop thief. I saw the prisoner running, and Mrs. Cannon running after him. I turned up Stratford-place, and stopped him; he hit me once with the umbrella. I took the umbrella out of his hand. At the watch-house, the prisoner said he had been out of place three months. This is the umbrella.
Prosecutrix. That is my umbrella.
Prisoner's Defence. I asked Mrs. Cannon to let me carry the umbrella, she gave it me. We walked down Oxford-street together; she hollowed out stop thief. I did not mean to steal the umbrella.

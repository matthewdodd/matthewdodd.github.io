            . I am an officer. On the 9th of July I was at a sale-shop in Norton-faldgate, about four o'clock in the afternoon. The prisoner came in, and offered the spoon for sale-the man refused to buy it. I asked him how long he had had it? he said two years, and his father had it before him. I took him to a public-house, told him I did not believe him, and asked him again how long he had had it? he said, three years, and he bought it of a sailor in the street for 9s. I took him into custody. After advertising it, and not finding an owner, he was discharged. I afterwards found it belonged to Mr. Deacon, and took him again on the 12th. I am sure he is the man; I knew him before.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I bought it of a man for 9s.

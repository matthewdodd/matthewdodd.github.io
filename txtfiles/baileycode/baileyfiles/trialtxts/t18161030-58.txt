            . On the 10th of October, I left my cart at the end of Salbot-court, in Gracechurch-street; it was at about seven o'clock in the evening. I went to the White-lion booking office to see if there were any parcels for Blackwall, where we look every day, and there were two boxes; one containing the articles in question. I bought it out first, and when I was coming with the other, I saw the prisoner take this one from the cart. I immediately ran after him, and collared him; he threw the box of his shoulders, and struggled with me, and knocked me down. I ran after him again, as far as East-cheap, and then I saw another man run and pick the box up, and I took it to the cart again. I did not pursue the prisoner myself after that.
- MORGAN. I pursued the prisoner crying stop thief, and he was stopt, and I secured him.

JOHN TILLEY. On the 26th of June, between three and four o'clock, I was in Dean-street, Soho,


 and felt the prisoner's hand at my pocket - on turning round he dropped my handkerchief, and ran away; I saw it in his hand, and followed - I did not lose sight of him till he was taken - he had gone up two streets, near to Soho-square.

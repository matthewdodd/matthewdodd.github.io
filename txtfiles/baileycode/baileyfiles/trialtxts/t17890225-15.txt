            's, and so was the house; about five or six o'clock in the evening of the 26th of January I had been out, and came in just before the prisoner; the lodger's bell rung, and I went up stairs for five or ten minutes, and I left nobody; when I came down I found the prisoner in the shop, the windows were down, and the door on the latch; when I came down I saw somebody going out of the shop; and I went into the shop, and found the window was cleared; I immediately went out, and I saw the prisoner crossing the way; I walked on the right hand side of the way, and he on the left; I went rather quick, and crossed over, and I met him face to face; I took him by the collar; he had a bundle; I said to him, you have robbed my shop; he said, no, he had not, he saw a man run; I said, you are the man; I took him to a publick-house; here are two pair of tie shoes, with the name of Mr. Welgen on them; we bought them from

                   Newcome
               



             to sell again for ourselves: he got away from me at the publick-house, and ran off; here is a velvet pump, our own make; it is the property of 
               
                  Titus
                   Newcome
               



            , I am sure of that.
Was the window broke? - It was not broke.
Prisoner. Was there any light in the shop? - No.
Was I walking or running when you saw me? - He was walking on the left-hand side of the way:

             sworn.
I know no more than hearing the cry of stop thief, and seeing the prisoner running, I tript up his heels, and held him till the last witness came up.

             sworn.
I heard a noise in my passage, and I went and desired them not to make a noise there, but to get out in the street; and I heard the prosecutor say, the man had robbed him.
PRISONER's DEFENCE.
My father is a carpenter by trade, and I went to carry a table home; I pickt up the bundle; they took me to a publick-house, and used me very ill; the man I saw running had a black coat on.
Newcome. I saw the man go out of the shop; there was no light in the shop; I never lost sight of him from the time that he left the door till I brought him to the publick-house from whence he made his escape, and was afterwards taken by the witness Spark.

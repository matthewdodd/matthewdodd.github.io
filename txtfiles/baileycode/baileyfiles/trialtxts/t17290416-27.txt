                     James

            . It appear'd-by the Evidence, that while the Prosecutor was gone out, the Prisoner took the Goods out of his Room; but being seen to carry them out, by a Neighbour, was pursued and taken with the Goods upon him. The Fact being plainly prov'd, the Jury found him 


               guilty to the Value of 4 s. 10 d
            .

            . I live in Hatton-Street


, I returned to town upon the fifth of this month; I had been absent from the beginning of August; I was informed my house had been broke open: 
               
                  Mary
                   Kimber
               



             had the care of my house. Some suspicion had fallen upon the two prisoners as they had been employed to mend and clean my windows. I got a warrant at Sir

                   Fielding
               



            's against the prisoners; I went with a constable to the house of the mother of the two prisoners; they were not there; I was told they had not been there the whole day: at night I was told one of them was with his mother; I went there, I found Joseph and another brother in the kitchen, but not Edward: I asked him how he came to serve me so; he said at first he knew nothing of it; afterwards he said, if you will shew me mercy I will tell you all about it: I made no promise, then Joseph told me where the things were; the constable came in soon after; I asked him if that brother was with him; he said no, but he would send for the other brother who was with him: the boy returned who was sent and said, he was not to be found; this Joseph said he would go and fetch him; the constable would not trust him to go by himself; we went with him to a house he cohabited with a woman in; we could not find him; we were going away, but afterwards we searched the cellar and there we found the prisoner Edward; we took them to the watch-house, and they were carried to two different prisons; in consequence of directions given by the justice, I went and found several things at different pawn-brokers.

            . I am servant to the prosecutor. I kept the house in his absence. The prisoners were backward and forward cleaning the windows several times. On Wednesday fortnight I missed the waistcoat and gown; and saw the bureau broke open. I mentioned this to the painters. I told them I suspected the glazier

s. They had come to the house at times when other people were not there, and had neglected to come afterwards, according to appointment. I acquainted my master's brother-in-law of what had happened.

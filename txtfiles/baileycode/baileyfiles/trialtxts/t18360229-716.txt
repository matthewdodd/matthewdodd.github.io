JOSEPH KINSLEY
. I keep a clothes shop in Marylebone-lane. On the 18th of February, between five and six o'clock in the evening, the prisoners passed up and down my door two or three times, close together, in company—Buckley then stole the shoes, and they both ran as far as corner—I ran out immediately after them—Buckley turned round to see if I was following, and dropped the shoes at the corner—I took them up and followed him round three streets, and lost sight of him, and on my return met Sheedy—I asked him where the other lived—he said he did not know any thing about him—I said if he did not tell me I would give him in charge, which I did—he told the policeman where he lived.

Sheedy. Q. Did I not come round and ask you if you had caught him, and did not you run round the square to catch the boy? A. I did not see you till I returned home, and then met you.





EDWARD EAGLING
. I am a policeman, Sheedy was given into custody by the prosecutor, in Wimpole-street—I asked him if he knew the boy who took the shoes—he said he did not, and had never seen him before; but he was accidentally passing, and saw him take them—after locking him up before I took him to the Magistrate, he said he was sorry he had ✗the boy to go with him, for it was him that stole the shoes—that his

name was Buckley, and he lived at No. 3, Calmell-buildings—I apprehended Backley there.

SHEEDY—


GUILTY
. Aged 16.—Both 



Transported for Seven Years.

Before Mr. Justice Park.

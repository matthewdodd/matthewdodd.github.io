 was indicted

GEORGE FRANKLIN COLLINS
. I am a farmer. On the 23rd of Dec., at half-past four o'clock, I was in Bloomsbury—I received information from a coachman—I went and took the prisoner—I said, "Come back, you have taken my handkerchief"—he

said he had not—I brought him back—my hand kerchief was found, but not on him—this is it—I had missed it on that occasion.





JOHN BATEMAN
. I am a coachman. I saw the prisoner deliberately put his right hand into the prosecutor's pocket, and take out a silk handkerchief, which he put into his left-hand pocket—it was found in a shop just by where he was—I did not lose sight of him till the policeman caught him.




GUILTY

Mendes Decosta. As I was passing along from Merchant Taylors-hall in Threadneedle-street


, a person came up to me and told me, the prisoner had picked my pocket of a silk handkerchief: I felt and missed it. I ran to him and collared him, and said, deliver me my handkerchief; he told me he had it not; at last he took it out of the wasteband of his breeches, and delivered it to me. The handkerchief was produced in court, with the letters L. M. No. 10. upon it as he had before said.

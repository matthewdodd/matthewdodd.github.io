 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
26th of October, 1 bag, value 1s.; 2 handkerchiefs, value 2s.; 17 keys, value 5s.; and 1 sovereign; the goods and monies of 



Alexander Young, from the person of 



Patty Young.






PATTY YOUNG
. I am the wife of Alexander Young, of Compton-street, Regent-square. About twelve o'clock at noon, on the 26th of October, I was walking in Great Queen-street, and had my reticule on my left arm—some one suddenly tore it from my arm—there were two pocket-handkerchiefs in it, seventeen keys, and one sovereign—it was opposite a passage, and the person ran away—is the bag, and these are the contents.





WILLIAM ANSELL
. I reside in Great Queen-street. I was standing at my front door, and saw the prisoner dart from a passage and snatch the lady's reticule, and break the string—I followed and overtook him—my shopman took him—in turning a corner he threw this reticule down an area, but I did not see him do it—it was thrown down the instant I turned, and he was running just before.

Prisoner. There were several running between me and him. Witness. No, not a creature—I took the bag up, and desired my servant to take him, which he did.





GEORGE EVANS
 (police-constable D 94.) I took the prisoner into custody.





PATTY YOUNG

re-examined. I should not know the person who took the reticule—he was about the size of the prisoner.

Prisoner's Defence. I was going home—I did not know they were calling "Stop thief," after me, there were several persons running.




GUILTY
. Aged 20. 


Transported for Seven Years.

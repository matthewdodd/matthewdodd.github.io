             sworn.
I am a single woman. I live at No. 24, Chesterfield-street. I was going to carry a shirt home to Swallow-street, and a linen handkerchief. My mother takes in washing: and the two prisoners followed me in Wimpole-street; as I was going along Great Marybone-street


 they both looked very hard at me, and I at them; then Thomas Clarke snatched the shirt from me, but never said a word to me, not laid a hand upon me; I struggled with him till he almost pulled me down; then they left me; Baylis did not do or say any thing to me; but they were both in company; I saw Clarke's face, and know him again very well; as soon as Clarke got the shirt he ran away; in a few minutes after Clarke was stopped in my sight by the patrol; he threw the bundle down, but I did not see him do it; it was found on a dunghill, at a very little distance, where Baylis was taken, which was in Little Welbeck-street, up in a corner; Baylis must have picked it up, and taken it to the dunghill: I never saw the prisoners together after I was robbed, till at the justices.

             sworn.
On the 11th of February I was coming up Wimpole-street, I saw a gentleman's servant had hold of the prisoner Clarke; he delivered him up to me; I then pursued after Baylis up Welbeck-street, and found him in the corner of the street; I took him to the watch-house; then I went to look for the handkerchief and shirt; I found it just by where I took Baylis.
(Produced and deposed to.)

I am patrol of Mary-le-bone parish; between six and seven, on the 11th instant, I was going my rounds, I heard a terrible cry of murder and stop thief, and Mrs. Read came up and told me she had been robbed, and a gentleman's servant brought Clarke to me, and we took him to the watch-house, and Baylis was taken immediately after, and brought to the watch-house.

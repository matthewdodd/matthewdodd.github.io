WILLIAM PATISON HUNTER
. I am a Commoner of Magdalen Hall, Cambridge. On the 13th of November I came out of Paternoster-row, and walked on to opposite Foster-lane—I felt a fumbling at my pocket—I turned, and saw the prisoner with my silver snuff-box in his hand, which had been in my pocket—I seized the prisoner and another with him—we struggled some time—I saw the snuff-box several times in his hand—he threw me into the gutter, and then I lost sight of the box, but I kept him some time, and then he got from me, ran up the lane—I pursued, and he was taken, but my box was gone—it was a large one, with a silver chasing—I was about two feet from the window of a large umbrella shop—I saw this plainly by the gas-light.

Prisoner. Was it like this box?—(producing a tin box.) Witness No; it was a large silver box, with peculiar chasing—I saw the box several times in your hand, till you threw me.

Prisoner. I was going along; and had this box in my hand, taking bit of tobacco out, and then this gentleman turned and took me.





GEORGE HAZLEWOOD
. I am a police-constable. I searched the prisoner—he had no snuff-box on him at all that night at the Compter—I found this duplicate on his person, also a comb, and some money, which I left with him—he had no box on his person then—I suspect it was given him the next morning by a person who called on him.




GUILTY

Transported for Ten Years.

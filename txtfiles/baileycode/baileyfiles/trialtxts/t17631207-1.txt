            . I am watchman at the steel-yard, and am there pretty much in the day time, except some time to sleep, to prepare me for the watching on nights; I saw the prisoner on the 4th of Nov. between 2 and 3 in the afternoon, walk backwards and forwards, several times in the yard, and then made up to where this iron was, took and concealed it in her petticoats, and walked off with it. I went after her, and took it from her, and carried her to Mr. Greenwood. She was taken before my late Lord Mayor, and committed.

Prisoner's Defence.

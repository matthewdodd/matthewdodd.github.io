. On the 14th of November, about nine o'clock in the morning, as I came into the shop, a man was looking at some handkerchiefs. Miss Gould called me, and said he had run away with one piece. I pursued, calling out
"Stop thief!" He was taken in Broad-street.

            . I am shopwoman to the prosecutors. The prisoner came into the shop, and asked for a particular pattern handkerchief. I showed him some different; he objected to the price. When I was folding up one piece, he took up a piece and ran off. I gave the alarm, and he was brought back.

            . On the 14th of November, about half-past nine o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner run down Threadneedle-street, with his right arm under his coat. He appeared agitated. I heard the cry of
"Stop thief!" and stopped him. Just before I got to him I saw him draw his hand out and throw the piece of handkerchiefs down.

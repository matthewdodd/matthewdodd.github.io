1639. 




JOHN JOHNSON
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
23rd of May. 1 pair of shoes, value 10d., the goods of 




Susan Minchington, and that he had been before convicted of felony.






SUSAN MINCHINGTON
. I keep a sale-shop in Orchard-street, Westminster. About five o'clock in the evening on the 23rd of May, I received information, and missed a pair of shoes, which I had seen safe at the side of the door at ten o'clock that morning—these are mine (looking at them.)

Prisoner. Q. How far does your stool stand from your door-way? A. I have no stool—there was a board close to the door.





MATTHEW M'CARTHY
. I am a policeman. I was on duty, and saw the prisoner in Gardiner's-lane, drunk, and found these shoes on him—I asked how he came by them—he said that was his business, and not mine.





WILLIAM ANNANDALE
. I am a policeman. I have a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from the Clerk of the Peace for Westminster (read)—the prisoner is the person.

Prisoner's Defence. I bought the shoes while I was in liquor, not knowing what I was about at the time—my former charge was the only time I was ever in prison, and that was owing to my being in want of bread.




GUILTY
. *Aged 26.—


Transported for Seven Years.

            . I was at St. Peter's church, Cornhill


, at morning prayer, about 11 o'clock, on the 17th of November. I laid my hat on the seat in the pew where I was, and it was taken away; I know not by whom.
John Butler. I am parish clerk of St. Peter's, Cornhill: I saw the prisoner take the prosecutor's hat, as he was in a pew behind the prosecutor, as the people went on their knees. I had observed him take hats, I may say, twenty times before, and had many a run after him, but never could catch him; he came again on the 23d of March; then I secured him.
Prisoner's Defence.
I had nothing about me when I was taken in custody.

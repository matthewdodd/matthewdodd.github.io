ROBERT SMART
. I am a servant out of a situation. On the 8th of May, I was in Smithfield—I felt something at my pocket—I turned and saw the prisoner close behind me—he walked away—I went up to him, and said "Young man you have picked up my snuff-box"—he said he had not—I said "You have; I insist upon you giving it to me"—he put his hand into the flap of his trowsers, and gave it me, and said he had picked it up—I am positive it was safe in my pocket not half a minute before—this is it.

Prisoner's Defence. I picked up this box—the gentleman came after me, and I gave it him.




GUILTY
. † Aged 19.—


Transported for Seven Years.

WILLIAM ASTON
 was indicted

 for stealing, at 
St. Marylebone, 1 watch, value 6l.; 1 watch-ribbon, 1 ring, 6d.; and 1 watch-key, 1d.; the goods of 




Charles Francis, in the dwelling-house of 



William Gethen.






CHARLES FRANCIS
. I am a physician, and live in the house of Mr. Gethen, No. 14, Henrietta-street, Cavendish-square, in the parish of St. Maryle-bone. On the morning of the 11th of Aug. I left home, and left my watch and watch-ribbon safe—I returned about five o'clock, and they were gone—these now produced are mine.





CHARLOTTE GETHEN
. I am the wife of William Gethen, of No. 14, Hen-rietta-street, Cavendish-square. On Tuesday last the prisoner came to hire our apartments—I took him up into the drawing-room, the room above where Mr. Francis lodged—we went up to the second floor—he came down into the drawing-room, and asked for a pen and ink—I went to get him one, and heard him go up stairs—I came back, and saw him with the watch in his hand—I said, "I will fetch you a larger sheet of paper,"and went and fetched a policeman.

Prisoner. Q. How far was I from you when you saw the watch in my possession? A. Two yards—I will swear it was the watch—it was found in Mr. Francis's room, but you ran back while I was waiting, and put it in its place.





ADAM HENRY NEWMAN
 (police-constable D 122.) I found the watch on the mantel-piece, removed from its original position.




GUILTY
. Aged 29.—


Transported for Seven Years.

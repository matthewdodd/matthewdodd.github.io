            . I am a baker
, and live at Pleasant-place, Holloway


. The prisoner was my servant
 nine months - he was entrusted to carry out bread and receive money
. Mr. Williamson used to pay his bill once a week, the prisoner always received it and gave receipts for me. On the 5th of February, I sent him out with bread, he was to go to Williamson's but never returned. I did not see him again till he was apprehended. He paid me no money on account of 
               Williamson
             that day.

            . I live in Whitecross-street, and sell bread which I have from Barton - I generally paid the prisoner the bills. On the 5th of February, he brought me some bread. I asked if he had brought a receipt from his master? he said No, but he would fetch one. He went out, bought a stamp, and I gave him 2 l. 15 s. all in silver, and 4 d. in copper. I produce the receipt, which he wrote in my presence (read).

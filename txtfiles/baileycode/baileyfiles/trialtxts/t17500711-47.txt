            . The night before these things were taken away, Hutcherson and 
               
                  Robert 
                  Bragg

                  Vername 
               



            , into Mr. Jupp's ware-house, about nine o'clock, we took three casements, and the night after, we went again and took three casements more; Hutcherson went to Goswel street, and sold them to Bullons for fifteen pence.

            : I had these casements in my care, I know them to be my master's property, they were taken out of the ware-house; we lost a great many.
Bullon's Defence. I bought the casements of Hutcherson, and gave him a penny a pound for them, I did not think but he came honestly by them. Bullons had a character given him by five persons of his being an honest industrious man.

               Guilty
            , Bullons 

               acquitted

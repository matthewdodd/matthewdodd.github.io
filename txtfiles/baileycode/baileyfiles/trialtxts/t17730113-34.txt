Turpin Barket. On the 17th of last month, I heard my geese cry; I ran out and saw the people that had taken them away; they had carried them about a quarter of a mile; Green had two of them in the sack; he was putting another into the sack; I struck him down several times with a poker; he himself said he had put two of them into the sack.
Q. from the prisoner. Was it not dark?
Barket. It was light enough to distinguish him; I saw him take the geese out of the goose house.

Prisoner's Defence.
He struck me with the poker, and hurt my head very badly. I did not take his geese.

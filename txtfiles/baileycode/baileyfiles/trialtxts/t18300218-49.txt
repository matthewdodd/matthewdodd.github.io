MICHAEL DEVEREAUX. I am a ballast-heaver
. On the 12th of February I was at Shadwell


, at past twelve o'clock at night, and fell in with the prisoner and another young woman; they crossed the street, and came to me the other took me by the arm, and the prisoner put her hand into my waistcoat-pocket - she took out half a crown, a shilling, and two sixpences; I took hold of her, and held her fast - the Police-constable came up, and took her; I saw her searched, and 2s. 1d. were found on her, but at the time I gave her in charge, she hove part of the money away - there were near a dozen girls came round her at the time; I could not have held her if the officer had not come up - I was sober.
FRANCIS FELTHAM. I heard the girl cry out Murder! and ran over - the man had hold of her hand in his right hand, and his arm was round her waist; I saw her throw out her hand, and something flew out of it - I could not see what it was; the girls were scuffling about - I found one shilling and sixpence in silver on the prisoner, and 7d. in copper; the man was sober.
Prisoner's Defence. When I met him he had a youngwoman with him, and he accused me of robbing him of 5s.; he took hold of me, called the officer, and said if I would give him 4s. he would let me go, and have no piece of work - when he was down at the Thames Police he said he had found 6d. in his pocket.

            . I am a cheesemonger
, and live in Whitechapel-road


. On the 7th of November, between nine and ten o'clock at night, the prisoner came to my shop. I was very busy. She waited about ten minutes; the bacon was near to her. While my head was turned, she went out, and I missed it. I could not follow her. On the Monday morning she came again for some butter; I said nothing to her, but got a warrant and searched her house. She produced the bacon, and said she had taken it.

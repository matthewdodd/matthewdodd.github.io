            . I gave the prisoner on the same day a gold watch, worth forty guineas, to take to Northampton-square, to have my masters' names engraved upon it. He never returned - he was sent to a variety of places.

            . I am a pawnbroker. The prisoner pawned this watch with me for 6 l. 10 s., on the 18th of January.
Cross-examined. Q. If he had asked for 10 l. would you have advanced it - A. Yes.
The prisoner in his defence stated that he could not find Northampton-square, and pawned the watch in a state of intoxication.

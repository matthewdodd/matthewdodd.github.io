            . I am a carpenter
. On the 22d of March, about twelve o'clock, I met the prisoner in Charles-street, Drury-lane, and went home with her. I was quite sober - We had some drink - I awoke in about an hour, and found the place quite dark, and the prisoner gone - I missed my watch and 1l. 3s., from my breeches pocket - I am sure the prisoner is the woman - I went in search of her, and found the watch and note on her

JOHN COLEMAN
 and 



JOHN JONES
 were indicted for

stealing, on the 
14th of February, 1 pair of boots, value 12s., the goods of 



Thomas Wilton; and that Jones had been before convicted of felony.






THOMAS WAKE
. On the 14th of February, at a quarter past four o'clock, I was in Goswell-street, and saw Coleman take a boot from Mr. Wilton's shop by the side of and door, and give it to Jones—Coleman then walked away—I went and gave an alarm to Mr. Wilson, and kept sight of Coleman—Jones ran away—I told the policeman, and he was taken first, and Coleman was taken in about three minutes—I can swear to them both.

Jones. Q. Did you see me take one boot? Witness. Yes, I did—I did not know you had a pair till you were taken.





JOEL CHANEY
. I am a City-policeman. I was told to follow Jones—he ran round Charter House-square—I cried, "Stop thief"—a gentleman made a hit at him with his stick, and then Edgar stopped him—I saw him throw the boots down.






JOHN EDGAR
. I heard the policeman call "Stop thief"—I saw the prisoner running round the square—a man made a hit at him, and I caught him in my arms.





WILLIAM EDGAR
. I am in the service of Mr. Thomas Wilson, who is a boot maker. These are my master's boots.

Coleman. I was going along Aldersgate-street—Wake came and tapped me on the shoulder, and asked what I knew about the boots up the street—I went back, but I knew nothing of them.

Jones. I was coming round the square—a person ran by and threw down the boots—they caught hold of me.





JAMES STEWART
. I am constable of Wilsden. I produce a certificate of the prisoner Jones' former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the same person.

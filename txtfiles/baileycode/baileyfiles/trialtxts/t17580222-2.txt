                  Stephen 
                  Stanmore 
               



            . I was servant to justice Keeling, who is a brewer
, and lives in Clerkenwell



. The prisoner Stevens keeps the tap-house to the brewhouse
, and the prisoner Holmes was my fellow-servant
, and belong'd to the same walk that I did.
Q. Explain what you mean by walk.
Stanmore. There are two walks, one in Southwark, and the other in the city, which are appointed to certain servants.
Q. In which walk is Stevens's house?
Stanmore. That is in the city walk.
Q. Was Holmes and you in the city walk?
Stanmore. No; we had no business to deliver beer to Stevens. Holmes and I took two firkins of ale, about thirteen or fourteen weeks ago, from out of our master's ale store house, from out of a tun; he carried one firkin and I the other, and put them into Stevens's cellar.
Q. Had you any authority from your master so to do?
Stanmore. No.
Q. What time of the day was it?
Stanmore. It was between six and seven at night, after dark.
Q. Did you see Stevens at the time?
Stanmore. He was in the cellar along with me.
Q. Did he know how you came by it?
Stanmore. He must know how we came by it.
Q. Had you any previous discourse with him about it?
Stanmore. No, I had not.
Q. Then how came you to carry it there?
Stanmore. Thinking he would take it in.
Q. Why did you think so?
Stanmore. Because we had heard he had taken some in before.
Q. Did you tell him what it was?
Stanmore. I told him it was ale, as we were taking it down the cellar stairs.
Q. Did he pay you for it?
Stanmore. He did; he gave me five shillings for the two firkins.
Q. What is that ale worth a firkin ?
Stanmore. It is worth 7 s. and 6 d. a firkin.
Q. What did you do with the money?
Stanmore. I gave Holmes half a crown of it. After that I was informed Holmes had swore something against me, so I went away, for five weeks or more; after which I returned back, and sent my master word of it, and beg'd my liberty. I met Mr. Cox, our clerk, in Leather-Lane, and told him of it.
Q. Was this before you was in custody?
Stanmore. It was. I had not then been charged with the offence.
Cross Examination.
Q. Was Stevens a customer to Mr. Keeling?
Stanmore. He was, for barrels of ale.
Q. Did he sometimes have small beer of your master?
Stanmore. Sometimes he had.
Q. Did he pay the men for the ale, or was it book'd?
Stanmore. He paid the clerk for that, and he paid the men for the small beer, as they carried it.
Q. Did not he complain of the badness of the small beer sometimes ?
Stanmore. Yes, once or twice.
Q. How much small beer did he bespeak at a time?
Stanmore. One firkin.
Q. Did he never bespeak two at one time?
Stanmore. No, never.
Q. Did he receive these two for small beer?
Stanmore. No; I told him it was ale.
Q. Did you never carry him ale to make him amends, when there has been a complaint made of the badness of the small beer?
Stanmore. No.
Q. Did you say it was all ale, or as good as ale?
Stanmore. I said it was ale.
Q. Did you taste it?
Stanmore. No, I did not.
Q. Did he put it in the publick cellar?
Stanmore. He did; he set it in one corner, and put a bag over it.


                  William 
                  Cox 
               



            . I am clerk to Mr. Keeling. Stanmore and Holmes were partners in the small beer, as draymen. Holmes was foreman in that walk.
Q. Had either of them any business to deliver beer to Stevens?
Cox. No, that was the business of other servants that belong'd to the city walk; they frequently used his house, as he kept Mr. Keeling's tap-house.
Q. Did Stevens know that Holmes and Stanmore did not belong to the walk he lives in.
Cox. He certainly must know that, because he knew all our men. I heard Holmes confess before justice Welch that he took away one of the firkins of ale, and Stanmore took the other; but that he carried it no farther than Stevens's cellar door, and Stanmore took it of him, and put it into the cellar.
Cross Examination.
Q. Has not Stevens been a customer to Mr. Keeling some time?
Cox. He has several years.
Q. Do your men ever interfere in one another's walks?
Cox. No; we don't allow that.


                  Samuel 
                  Billings 
               



            . The prisoner Holmes lodged with me. I perceiving him several times to be very uneasy, asked him the reason of it. He would not give me a satisfactory answer. Perceiving him one time to be more so than ordinary, I took him into another room, and asked him again. He said, he chose to leave his place. I said, why? He said, if he did not he should be ruined, for it was a practice among them to take beer out when the clerk and the rest of the people were out of the way, and to make away with it. I asked him why he did not tell his master or Mr. Cox of it? He said, he could not, and that he rather chose to go away, for they would brand him with the name of a tell-tale. Then I said I should be blameable if I did not tell, as I knew of it. He said he should be obliged to me if I would, for he could not.
Q. Who did he say were concerned with him?
Billings. He said Stanmore was concerned with him for one. I sent to the brewhouse and desired Mr. Cox to come to me. He came, to whom I related the account Holmes had told me, and so the matter came out.
Holmes's Defence.
I never took away any ale in my life. Please to ask Mr. Billings my character.
Billings. I never heard any thing amiss of him before this.
Stevens's Defence.
I generally have one firkin of small beer after another, for our own use. When I have found fault with the beer the servant has put his finger into the hole, tasted it, and said it would be very good. I have sometimes thrown half a vessel away when it has been bad. I always paid half a crown for a vessel of it, and never knew that it was stolen.

For Stevens.

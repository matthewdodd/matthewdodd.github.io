             were indicted for 


               stealing, on the 4th of April
, 2 fishing-nets, value 2l., the goods of 
                     
                        
                           Moses 
                           Gibson
                        




                     
                  , being in a certain boat upon the navigable river Thames
            .

                  GIBSON
               



            . I am a fisherman
, and fish in the river Thames. I left my nets under the stern of my boat, facing the Ship public-house, at Hammersmith


, on Sunday-night, the 4th of April, and missed them on Monday morning; I know the prisoners - they are fishermen, but seldom work on the river Thames; I saw my nets on the Wednesday - I heard the prisoners were about the river.


                  WILLIAM 
                  PEARCE
               



            . I am a fisherman. The officer set me to watch one house, while they searched another - I saw 
               
                  William 
                  Armitage
               



             come out of his own house with two nets, and before I came up to him he put them down;he went back, put on his hat, and went out; the officer took him - I said they were my brother's nets.
Cross-examined by MR. DOWLING. Q. Then he came out and went in again? A. Yes.


                  JOSEPH 
                  DICKENSON
               



            . I am a constable. On the 7th of April I went and took 
               
                  Joseph 
                  Armitage
               



            , and searched him: I then went to take 
               
                  William 
                  Armitage
               



            , and placed Pearce to watch, who said he saw him come out of his house, and put down the nets; I said to William Armitage, "I want you" - he said, "For what?" I said,"For some nets;" he said, "There are some I have put down, and you may look at them;" I said to Pearce,"Are these your brother's?" he said, "No, but I believe they belong to Gibson, of the Godspeed;" Joseph Armitage came down, and I asked who they belonged to- Joseph Armitage said they belonged to him and his mate, and that they bought them of a donkey-man that morning.
Cross-examined. Q. You found nothing on Joseph? A. No - I went into the room where he was in bed; I told him what I came for, and he afterwards came to his cousin's house (the other prisoner) - William Armitage said he had some nets there, and they stated how they got them before the Magistrate; they said they paid 12s. for them.

            . This is a flounder-net, and this a smelt one - they are worth about 2l.; I am licensed by the Lord Mayor.

                  Armitage
               



            's Defence. We all work nets alike up and down the river - we have been brought up to fishing as he has.


                  MARIA 
                  ARMITAGE
               



            . I am sister of Joseph Armitage. I was at the top of the alley with him on Wednesday week, when he bought a net like one of these of a man who had a donkey and two hampers - I lent him 12s.; I do not know what he gave for them.
COURT. Q. How much did they pay a piece? A. They were to pay 6s. a piece - I did not know the donkey-man; they bought them not half a dozen yards from my brother's door; the officer came about twelve o'clock I went before the Magistrate, but I did not speak - I had never seen the man before; it was about half-past eight in the morning when they bought them - I am usually in service, but left my place last Saturday fortnight; I lived with Mr. Avis; the donkey had two baskets - one had the nets, and the other something-else; they came to search for Pearce's nets - they were taken out to dry, I believe; I do not know whether they were opened when they were bought - the donkey-man said they belonged to some one who was dead, and he could sell them cheap.


                  William 
                  Armitage
               



            's Defence. The man said he had them to sell for Martin's people, who were dead - we leave our nets out, and lose none.

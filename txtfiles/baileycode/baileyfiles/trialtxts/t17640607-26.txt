                  Chantry 
               



            , I lived at the Cheshire Cheese in Parker's-lane


, when the watch was taken away: the prisoner was a lodger to me; the watch was the property of 
               
                  John 
                  Williams 
               



            , who had lodged in the same room, and lay in the same bed: he left the lodging about a fortnight before the prisoner came in, and his things were in the room in a box, and he delivered this watch to me, and I put it into the box in that lodging-room. I cannot swear whether the box was locked or not; the wearing apparel in the box was all safe.
Q. When did you miss the watch?
Chantry. I missed it about the 17th or 18th of May.
Q. How long had the prisoner lodged with you?
Chantry. About eight or nine weeks, and went away the very day I missed the watch. When I said I would go and fetch it down, then he ran away, and I found him in Broad St. Giles's on the 20th of May: I asked him how he came to take the watch? he said, he did take it, and had sold it to Mr. Cox's brewer, or cooper, where I found it. (Produced in court, and deposed to by 
               
                  John 
                  Williams 
               



            , the owner.)


                  John 
                  Walker 
               



            . The prisoner came to my house with this watch, and asked me if I would buy it; he asked me 50 s. for it; I bought it for two guineas: he said he sold it for need, wanting to buy some cloaths: this was two or three days before the prisoner was taken up. I heard him own before Justice Welch, that he took it out of a box.
Prisoner. I did take it.

            . I live at No. 3, Field-lane; I came down, and saw the prosecutor sitting at my door; I offered my service to take him home; we were going along Saffron-hill together, when the prisoner put his hand into his pocket, and took out the money; I pursued him, with a constable, and he was taken - I did not lose sight of him.

            . I was assisting the prosecutor home; the prisoner met us on Saffron-hill, and followed us about five yards; he then hustled up against the prosecutor, put his hand into his pocket, and took his money out. I ran after him, and never lost sight of him.

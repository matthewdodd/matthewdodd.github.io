            . I took the Prisoner into my house some time ago, as an object of distress (he had been abroad some years for such unhappy doings as this) out of regard to his family, hoping he would not do so again, and trusted him with the key of my chamber. But thought he was very poor, all on a sudden he had money, silver buckles, and other things. Said I, Jacob, you have committed a robbery, not thinking of myself; but my wife missed a cambrick apron, and upon that I looked farther, and missed thirteen pound. Then I told him he had robbed me. He was very much surprised at first, but some time afterwards he said, If I am hanged there's an end of me, for I can die but once; and if I am transported, I shall go from whence I came, and you may do your worst. He owned he took the goods, but did not own he took the money.
Gentlemen of the Jury, I hope you will consider him. He has a very honest family, and a good honest old mother.

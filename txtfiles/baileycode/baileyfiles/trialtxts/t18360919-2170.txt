GEORGE ALLEN
. I am shopman to Mr. James Gideon, of Stafford-street, Lisson-grove, a pawnbroker, On the evening of the 12th of September, a boy came to the shop and gave me information—I went out and stopped the prisoner with this coat in his possession, which had been hanging inside the railing outside the door—I asked where he got it from—he said he had bought it, and had been in the shop to pawn it, and they could not agree—I told him he must go back—I looked at it, and ound our private mark on it—I took him back to the shop—it is worth 17s.


Cross-examined by
MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Are there two doors to the shop? A. Yes—I am sure he did not say it was all right, that he had bought it, and was going into the other door to pay for it—he was about twenty yards from the door when I caught him.





JAMES MORAN
. I live in Great James-street. On the evening of the 12th of September, I saw the prisoner at the prosecutor's door—he jumped up and caught hold of the things at the side, and dragged this coat down—I had seen him walking about in the afternoon—I did not go into the shop, but another boy did.

Cross-examined. Q. Was he looking at the coat? A. No, he rumpled it up under his arm—he could not get it without jumping up—he could without going into the shop—he did not speak to any body about it.





CHARLES CLARKE
 (police-constable D 117.) I took the prisoner, and produce the coat—he said he had bought it, but he was very willing to pay Mr. Gideon for it.

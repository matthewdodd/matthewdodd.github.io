            . I am a laundress
, and live at Edmonton


. On the 5th of February, my things hung on a hedge in a field, adjoining my cottage. I went into the field and saw the prisoner taking the things off the hedge. I told him to put them down, and he run away with them. I missed the articles stated in the indictment.

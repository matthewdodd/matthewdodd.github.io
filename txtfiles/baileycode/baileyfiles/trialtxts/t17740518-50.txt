            . I am a smith and farrier
 at Hockley in the Hole


; the prisoner lodged about three weeks in my house; when I missed the things I charged her with stealing them; she owned it, and said she pawned them at different pawnbrokers; they were kept in boxes and drawers; I had not seen them a long time before.
Several pawnbrokers produced the different articles, and they were deposed to by the prosecutor.
Prisoner's Defence.
I hope the court will take it into consideration; they extorted my confession from me with a promise of forgiveness; Mr. Mahoney said he did not want to hurt me, he only wanted to know where his things were.
Prosecutor. I never made her any promise.

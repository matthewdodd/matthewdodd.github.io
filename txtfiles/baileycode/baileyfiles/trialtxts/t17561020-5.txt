            . I lost my great coat, and the prisoner was taken with it upon him, and carried before a magistrate, and there in my hearing said he found it. Mr. Barringer can give the court a better account.

            . Mr. Harvest serves me with liquors, and he was at my house at a treat. The coat was tied on the saddle of his horse in the stable. I missed it, and suspecting the prisoner, my little child directed me which way he was gone. I persued, and took him with the great coat upon him, and he delivered it to me (the coat produced in court, and deposed to.)
The prisoner had nothing to say in his defence.

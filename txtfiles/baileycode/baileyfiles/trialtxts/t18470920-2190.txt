JOHN DEAN
 was indicted

 for stealing 1 half-crown, and 4 shillings; the moneys of

HENRY HOWARD.
 I live at Bushey, in Hertfordshire. On the 2nd Sept., I was in the King's Head, Knightsbridge—the prisoner was there—we were standing at the bar together—there were others there—I was the worse for liquor—I was going to pay for what I had had—I missed four shillings and half-a-crown, which was safe when I went there—I had not been there ten minutes.

Cross-examined by
MR. HORRY
Q. Did not you draw the lining of your pocket out, and let the prisoner search for your money? A. No—he did not go away.





ELIZABETH NORRIS.
 I am a servant at the King's Head, Knightsbridge. On the 22nd of Sept., near twelve o'clock at night, I was coming down stairs, and saw the prisoner turning Mr. Howard's pocket out—I did not see any money.


Cross-examined. Q. You saw the pocket out, did not you? A. No, I saw his fingers in the pocket—I took no notice, supposing them to be friends.





WILLIAM LOCKHART
 (policeman.) I was called to the King's Head about twenty minutes to twelve o'clock—the prisoner was given into my charge—I asked him if he had any money—he said 3 1/2d. was all he had—I searched him, and found three shillings, half-a-crown, and five pence—he said he did not know how he came by it—Howard was the worse for liquor.

Cross-examined. Q. Did not the prisoner look as if he had been drinking? A. Not at all.





MAURICE MULCAHY
 (policeman.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction—(read—Convicted Dec., 1846, and confined three months—I was present at the trial—he is the man.




GUILTY.—


Transported for Seven Years.

ALEXANDER WILSON
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
11th of February, 1 handkerchief, value 1s., the goods of 



John Picart, from his person; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






JOHN PICART
. I live in Alfred-street, Bedford-square. On the 11th of February I was walking with a friend in Broad-street, Bloomsbury—I felt my coat tugged behind me, and at the same time I saw the prisoner, who cast away my handkerchief, which was in my pocket some minutes before, and I found it was gone—this is it.

Cross-examined by
MR. PAYNE. Q. What countryman are you? A. A Frenchman—I turned round immediately on feeling my lose—I am quite sure he had it in his hand when I turned back—I am sure I saw him throw it away—I took it from the ground, and took him—he was at my side when I saw him throw it down, but the handkerchief was thrown three or four yards off.





CHARLES SCHWARTZ
. I was with Mr. Picart—I saw the prisoner throw the handkerchief away—Mr. Picart took it up, and took him by the coat—I called the policeman.

Cross-examined. Q. Did you see it in the prisoner's hand? A. I saw it on the ground.





CHRISTOPHER NORTH
 (police-constable N 17.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person who was then convicted.




GUILTY
. Aged 19.—


Transported for Ten Years.

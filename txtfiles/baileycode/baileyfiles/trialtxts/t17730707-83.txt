            . I keep a house in Great Newport street


; my house was broke open the 21st of March; I went to bed last at night; the doors were all fast; they wrenched open the hinge of the cellar door; I did not hear any noise in the night; my maid, 
               
                  Ann
                   Hanby
               



            , got up first in the morning, and the door below stairs was broke open, and the door belonging to the bar; the alarm was given me between six and seven o'clock that the house was broke open, and I lost the things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them).


                  Ann
                   Hanby
               



            . I rose about half after six, I found the house broke open.


                  John
                   Priestman
               



            . I am a pawnbroker: I took in three handkerchiefs to pawn (producing them) of 
               
                  Ann
                   Williams
               



             the 22d of March; I lent 4. on them.
Prosecutor. The handkerchiefs when lost were in one piece, I think these are mine; there was a fray in the muslin the same as this has.


                  Ann
                   Williams
               



            . I have known the prisoner nine months, he kept his brother company who was convicted last sessions for this robbery; I received three muslin handkerchiefs from the prisoner I pawned them with Mr. Priestman, for I think 3 s. and 6 d. I think they were in three pieces when I pawned them; I received also four neckcloths from the prisoner, his brother pawned them and brought back the duplicate.
Prosecutor. I cannot swear to the neckcloths.
Williams. On the same day I received from the prisoner three silver tea spoons, I pawned in Princess-street, and received 4 s 6 l. on them; I cannot swear positively that these are the same I pawned, but I received these spoons at Justice Fielding's from the gentleman I pawned them to; in order to know them again, I made three marks on the edges of the spoons.
Prisoner's Defence.
I know nothing of it; it is very natural she should accuse me to save my brother she lived with; I am a callico printer
; my friends come out of the country; they are not yet arrived.
Thitchener. These spoons are my property.




               Not guilty of breaking and entering the house, but guilty of stealing the goods
            .

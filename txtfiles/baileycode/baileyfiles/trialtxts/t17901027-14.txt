             sworn.

. The prisoner 
               
                  Mary
                   Hipwell
               



             was left in care of the house, with a strict charge never to leave the house; I left town the 2d of August; on the 9th, I received a letter that my house was robbed; the fastenings are so good, that I am sure no person could get into my house without being let in; I haveno suspicion of the servant
 being concerned in the robbery, any farther than quitting her charge, and basely going to Sadler's Wells: the plate she had never seen, was not taken; the winter clothes that she had not seen, were not taken; there are not half the things in the indictment, which I lost; I am able to swear to these gloves; when the patrol gave them to me, she said, they are not yours, madam, they are a pair you gave me; no, says I, Mary, these are mine most certainly; they never were worn; they are marked with the maker's name, and the initials of mine; I know them to be mine; I left them in the cabinet, locked up in a drawer; there was a pillow-case found in her box; there is no mark on it; but to the best of my belief it is mine; I saw the gloves the day before I went out of town.
- GRANT sworn.
I am the patrol belonging to Bow-street: I went to Mrs. Tyndall's house about a quarter before one; I took charge of the two prisoners; the woman prisoner told me nothing was lost but plate; the woman gave me the key of her box; and in searching her box, I found the pair of gloves and the pillow-case.
Prisoner Hipwell. Had not my mistress three honest characters with me? - No.
The prisoner called two witnesses who gave her a good character.

34. 



JOHN KEEFE
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
5th of November, 8 shillings, 4 sixpences, and 10 pence in copper; the monies of 



Edward William Kemble Turner.






ELIZABETH BROWN
. I am servant to Mr. Turner, a publican. About five o'clock on the evening of the 5th of November I was coming down stairs, and saw the prisoner leaning over the bar, with his left hand on the counter, taking the money out of the till with his right hand, and putting it into his left—he was quite a stranger—he had not had any refreshment, but just came in at the door—I was not dressed—I stood about half a yard from him and called out to master—I ran outside, and watched the prisoner till the witness came, and caught him—only fivepence were found upon him—he had thrown the rest away.





THOMAS HEWITT
. I am a painter. I heard the alarm given, and stopped the prisoner, who was running away—I could not find any of the money.





EDWARD WILLIAM KEMBLE TURNER
. I keep the house. I had left the till not half a minute previous, and to the best of my recollection there were eight or nine shillings in silver, four or five sixpences, and about one shilling's worth of halfpence—I lost the whole of it—fivepence in copper was found in the prisoner's hand—he said he had taken the money out of the till.





GEORGE CRAWLEY
. I am an officer. The prisoner told me he had taken the halfpence, and it was through distress.

Prisoner's Defence. I went to get a pint of beer, and had the money in my hand—I called at the bar, and could get no answer.

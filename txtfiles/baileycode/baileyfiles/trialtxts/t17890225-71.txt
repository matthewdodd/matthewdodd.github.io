I am a brazier
 in Ratcliffe Highway


, on the 14th of February, between seven and eight in the evening, I was in the shop, and I saw a coal scoop go from out of the door, which I suppose must have been taken out by a hand; I did not see the prisoner, then I ran out, and found the prisoner in custody of two men.

             sworn.
I saw the prisoner open the door, and put his hand into the window, and take out the coal scuttle; the door was not quite shut, and he pushed it open, and took it out.
The Coal Scuttle deposed to.
PRISONER's DEFENCE.
I was walking along, and I saw a boy coming out of the shop, and he dropt the coal scuttle; they took me, and used me ill, and beat me.

THOMAS GOLBURN
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
27th of April, 1 canvass bag, value 1d.; and 5 half-crowns and 10 shillings; the property of 



Thomas Richard Harrison and another, his masters.






THOMAS RICHARD HARRISON
. I have one partner, and we carry on business in St. Martin's-Jane. The prisoner was our errand-boy—in consequence of circumstances, I had five half-crowns and ten shillings marked and put into a canvass bag, which I locked in the iron chest, in the counting-house, on the 26th of April—on the morning of the 27th I watched and saw the prisoner come into the counting-house with a key in one hand and the canvass bag in the other—he unlocked the chest, and put the bag into it—I then went from the place where I was concealed, and took hold of him—I said, "I have been waiting for you, and have caught you at last"—he said, "What for? I have done nothing"—he then produced this key, and said he had found it in the dust—I went to the bag, and found that a portion of the marked money had been restored, and was in the bag—this is it, but two half-crowns were gone out of it and ten shillings, the rest is in the bag now—this bag has never been out of my possession since—I had put the key of the chest into my pocket when I locked the bag up—the key the prisoner had was a false key.





THOMAS COPE
. I am in the prosecutor's employ. I marked the money on the 26th, and it was put into the chest about six o'clock—the bag and money were gone about nine o'clock.

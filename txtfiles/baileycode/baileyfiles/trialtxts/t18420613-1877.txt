1877. 




CHARLES TOOMBS
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
4th of May, 2 trowels, value 2s., the goods of 




Benjamin Hawkins.






BENJAMIN HAWKINS
. I keep a beer-shop in Pierpoint-row, Islington. On the 4th of May the prisoner was there with another man—I had two trowels in my ground—I missed them—these now produced are them—I can swear to one of them particularly, and I believe the other to be mine.





JOHN WHITHEY
. I am a pawnbroker. The two trowels were pawned with me—I cannot tell by whom—these are the duplicates I gave for them.





HENRY CORNISH
. I bought these two duplicates of the prisoner.

Prisoner's Defence. I bought the duplicates of a young man for four-pence; I was going down Islington for some rosewood about a fortnight afterwards; the prosecutor met me, and asked me about the trowels; I told him where the man lived that I bought the duplicates of, but he was gone away.





BENJAMIN HAWKINS

re-examined. He took me to an empty house.




GUILTY.** Aged 20.—



Transported for Seven Years.

Sixth Jury, before Edward Bullock, Esq.

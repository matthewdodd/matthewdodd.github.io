CHARLES KHENRY PADDON
. I live in Waterloo-road, Lambeth. The prisoner was in my service, and left without notice, on the 5th of June—I found her again on Friday the 12th of June—I missed a pair of boots, and these other things—these are them—(looking at the property.)





WILLIAM PRICE
 (police-sergeant L 11.) I took the prisoner on the 12th of June—I asked what she had done with these things—she said some she had pawned, except the boots—I found some things at the pawn-broker's, and some things were in a bundle she had sent, to her mother, who would not take them in—it was brought to the station-house, and the prisoner picked out Mr. Paddon's things there.





RICHARD FISHER
. I live in Westminster Bridge-road. I produce a petticoat and shift which were pawned with me on the 6th of June, by the prisoner.
(Property produced and sworn to.)





WILLIAM PRICE
 (police-sergeant L 11.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got at Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person.

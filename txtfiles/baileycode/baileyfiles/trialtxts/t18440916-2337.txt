 and 




ELLEN EDWARDS
 were indicted for

 stealing one pair of clogs, value 1s., the goods of 



William Joseph Barwick.






WILLIAM JOSEPH BARWICK
. I keep a rag-shop in White Lion-street, Pentonville. On the 10th of Sept., about six o'clock, Cubbage came to my shop, and asked if I had any stockings—I said I had none that would suit him—he had not been in the shop many minutes before he said, "Go on"—I went, and saw Edwards at the door—I suspected she had got something, and looked, and missed a pair of clogs—I followed her, and she went down a court in White Lion-street—I had left Cubbage in my shop—I saw a policeman—we went round, and met both the prisoners together coming out of the court—Edwards had a basket in which were this pair of clogs, which are mine.

Cross-examined by
MR. PAYNE. Q. How do you know them? A. By this string, which I tied round them to hang them at my door, and I know them by purchasing them, and having them—they have been used—they are a second-hand pair—I had four or five pairs—this pair was hanging close to the door.





THOMAS TYLER
 (police-constable N 275.) I went with the prosecutor, and found both the prisoners in the court—I asked Edwards what she had got is her basket—Cubbage said, "Nothing but her own;" and he said to Edwards, "Don't let him look"—I said, "I shall," and I found these clogs in it—I took both the prisoners into custody.

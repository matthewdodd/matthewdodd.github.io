MALCOLM CURRIE. On the 17th of May, about ten o'clock at night, I was opposite to Messrs. Coutts, in the Strand


. A person asked if I had lost my handkerchief. I felt and it was gone - he said they had run up a court. I gave him my address, and next morning he brought my handkerchief to me. I found the prisoner at the office.(Property produced and sworn to.)

ANGELIOUS BERTRAUN. On the 17th of May I was in the Strand, and saw the two prisoners going after several gentlemen; they then met the prosecutor nearly opposite Round-court, and I saw Wilkinson take the handkerchief from his pocket. I told Roberts (who was with me), to tell the gentleman; I watched them up a court. I saw them looking at the handkerchief under a gas-light, and McAndrew then put it into his hat.

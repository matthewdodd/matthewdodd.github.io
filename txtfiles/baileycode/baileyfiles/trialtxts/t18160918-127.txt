            . On the 12th of August last, about twenty minutes past nine in the evening, I was in Russel-street


. There were three men before me; I passed them. After I passed them, they made a Bolt at the end of the street; they wrestled, and immediately ran up towards me, and then made a snatch at my veil, and snatched it off my head, and the one in the light jacket came up to me. The moment I missed my veil, they spoke something, which I can't repeat; one of them was taken immediately.

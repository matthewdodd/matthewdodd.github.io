MARTHA JAMES
. I am servant to Thomas Morton, living in the parish of St. John, Hampstead. On the 24th of June, I went to bed about eleven o'clock at night, and shut the house up—I was the last up—I came down at a quarter before six o'clock the next morning—the kitchen shutter was then broken, and an entrance had been made—I missed these towels and other things produced—they are my master's—I can swear to them, and these other things are mine.





HENRY HOBBS
 (police-constable S 174.) About five o'clock in the morning of the 25th of June, I met the prisoner in Edgeware-road with the bundle—I asked him whose it was—he said it was his—I took him into custody, and on the way to the station he escaped—I pursued—I did not lose sight of him—the bundle contained these things—he said a man gave them to him in the fields.

Prisoner's Defence. I was coming along—I saw two men with a bundle—they offered it me, and I took it.





RICHARD NEALE
 (police-sergeant S 3.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 20.—


Transported for Ten Years.

SARAH ROBERTS
. I am servant to Gerrard Hay Robinson. On the 3rd of Nov. the prisoner came for a bag of biscuits that had been left in the morning by mistake—we had none—after he was gone I missed a walking-stick and umbrella from the hall—no one else had been there between the time of my seeing them safe and missing them—I went down stairs to inquire about the biscuits—the umbrella was my master's—the stick belonged to Mr. M'Nish, a friend of my master's.





DAVID M'NISH
. I left a stick at Mr. Robinson's, and it is lost.

Prisoner's Defence. That was one of the houses that I went to; I stood there till she came; I did not go out of the place, nor take them.




GUILTY
. † Aged 18.—


Transported for Seven Years.

            . I live in Barbican


, and am a silver-smith
: on the 12th of March my apprentice called me down stairs, and said the prisoner had been behind my counter; he had stopped him; the prisoner said he came into the shop to sell a top of a button, which he shewed me, and that he had chucked it on the counter, and it fell down on the other side, and he went behind in order to take it up. I turned about and miss'd three silver shoe-buckles: I tax'd him with taking them, he denied it; I sent for my man and another boy, out of another shop, to be witnesses. Then I bid the prisoner unbutton his waistcoat; there I saw a corner of a buckle appear, in his left hand breeches pocket; then he took them all three out, one at a time. (Produced and deposed to.)

I was going into his shop, and found three silver buckles, going in at the door, just in the shop.

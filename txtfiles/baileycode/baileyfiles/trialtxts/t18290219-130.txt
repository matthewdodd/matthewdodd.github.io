            . I am a private street-keeper of Holborn. On the 3d of February I was walking at the end of Drury-lane, in Broad-street; I met the prisoner with this part of a stove on his back, and knowing that it belonged to where the fire had been at the Six Canns, I stopped him; I had seen it lying in the ruins for three weeks- he had got about two hundred yards from the place with it; I said he must go back - he said he was going to take it further; as I was taking him back, he said some man employed him to take it to Monmouth-street, and was to give him 6d.
Prisoner. I said if you would accompany me to Monmouth-street, I would show you the person. Witness. No, you only said then you were going further; it was not till afterwards that you said you were going to take it there.

            . I was the occupier of the Six Canns; this stove belonged to me - my premises were burned down, and this lay in the ruins.
The prisoner put in a written Defence, stating that a stranger had employed him to carry the stove to the corner of Monmouth-street.

GEORGE LAWRENCE. I am mate of the Britannia
. On the 29th of last month I belonged to the Lord Melville; I dismissed the prisoner from the ship for misconduct - he had nothing to do with the Lord Melville - she was laying in the West India-docks


. I went ashore the night before the prisoner was apprehended, and left my trunk all safe; it contained forty-three sovereigns, four half-sovereigns, and a piece of foreign coin; I had two locks to my trunk. I returned to the ship next morning, and found my money gone; I left the carpenter and two men on board; I saw the prisoner on the morning of the 29th, in the docks - I suspected him, because no other person knew where the money was - I gave him in charge of an officer, and said I thought he was the man who had broken open my chest; he said he would give me back the money if I would let him go; I found upon him all the money I had lost. He was born at Quebec.

William Buckstin.






CRAWLEY BRITNELL
. I am shopman to William Buckstin, a butcher in Exmouth-street. On the 18th of February, about a quarter-past eight o'clock in the evening, I missed St. s. of pork from the window-board out-side the shop—the prisoners were brought to me with the pork, and I gate them in charge.





JOHN BIRD
. I live in Exmouth-street, nearly opposite the prosecutor's—I was standing at my door about eight o'clock that evening, and saw the two prisoners—I was watching them about half an hour—they were talking together as if acquainted—I saw Conner go near the shop, and Stacey look over his shoulder—Conner took this piece of pork, and walked away—Stacey walked after him—I went and laid hold of Stacey, and my young man took Conner with the pork, and brought them back.
(Property produced, and sworn to.)

Conner's Defence. I did not have the pork, I was not with this boy.


Stacey's Defence. I was coming down from the Angel, and this man laid hold of me, and soon after this boy was brought back.

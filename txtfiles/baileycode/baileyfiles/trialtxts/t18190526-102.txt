            . I am a timber-merchant
, and live in the Commercial-road


. On the night of the 21st of May, my case of drawing-instruments were left in the counting-house - at three o'clock in the morning the watchman alarmed me; I found the prisoner in custody - the case of instruments were found in the yard. I found the counting-house door and desk broken open. They had tried to open the iron safe, but did not succeed. An instrument was left behind.

            . I am a watchman. I heard a great noise in Mr. Plunkett's yard, but could see nobody. At half-past two o'clock I heard somebody in his counting-house, and looking towards the door, saw the prisoner creeping out under the gate on his hands and knees; two men lay concealed under the paling - I sprang my rattle, and kept the prisoner in sight till my fellow-watchman took him - the others got away.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

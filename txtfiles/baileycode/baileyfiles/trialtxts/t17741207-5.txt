            . I am a goldsmith and jeweller

, in partnership with Mrs. Cortall; the prisoner came to the shop with apples, she bought as many of him, as came to 3 s. and put the money down for them, the spoon lay by the money, as he was taking it up, I went with her to the door, she was going out, when I returned, I missed the spoon, I went after her, and asked her if she knew what was become of the spoon, she said she did not, then I said the man has got it, he was then at the door, I brought him in, and charged him with it, but did not find it upon him, I desired my man to follow the ass, I thought it might be in the panniers on the ass, my man went, and came back with the spoon; when it was brought in, he said he did not know that he took it; there was another boy with him, but he was never in the shop.

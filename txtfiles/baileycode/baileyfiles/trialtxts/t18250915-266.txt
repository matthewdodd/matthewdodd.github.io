            . I am the wife of George Shepherd. On the 15th of September, about half-past seven o'clock in the evening, I was in the New-road


 - the prisoner came suddenly by me, and snatched my reticule out of my hand, which contained a bunch of keys, a handkerchief, and a pair of gloves; he left the chain in my hand: I did not see his face till he was brought back by a man, but by his figure I knew him to be the same.
Prisoner. Q. Did you see me running? A. I saw the man who took it - he took off his shoe, and threw it at me, which I gave him again.

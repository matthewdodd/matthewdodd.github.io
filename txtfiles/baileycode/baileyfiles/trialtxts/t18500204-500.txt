JOSEPH PARKER
. I am foreman to Mr. Dicker, a pawnbroker, of Lower Marsh, Lambeth. On 22nd Jan. the prisoner came to my shop with this silver sugar-basin bent up—he said he picked it up in the Blackfriars-road—I gave him in charge—it is nearly two hundred years old—the date is on it, "1686."





JESSE DIBSDALOW
 (policeman, L 150). I took the prisoner—he said he found it in the Blackfriars-road.





ELIZABETH FLOWERS
. I am the wife of Page Flowers, an engine-driver, of 7, Walnut-tree-walk, Lambeth. The prisoner's brother lives in the kitchen—I have seen the prisoner two or three times—on 21st Jan. I went out at

ten o'clock at night, and was not home till twelve—next morning I missed this sugar-basin—it is my husband's, and worth 25s. as old silver—my parlour-door was not locked—a person must pass it to go to the kitchen.

Prisoner's Defence. On the Monday evening, I left my brother's to go home; as I came out, I found this, and thought it was a bit of tin.

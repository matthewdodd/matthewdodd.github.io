1979. 




HENRY JAMES GARDINER
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
31st of May, 1 plank of wood, value 7s. the goods of 



James Fyffe, and another; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






DONALD STEWART
 (police-constable E 35.) I was on duty on the 31st of May at Deptford. At a quarter past ten o'clock at night, I met the prisoner carrying a plank about one hundred yards from the prosecutor's—I asked How he came by it—he said he had taken it from a beer-shop, and was taking it to Old King-street, that it belonged to Mr. Sanders, and had been kept in a house in Butcher-row—I took him.





THOMAS WALEDGE
. I am a shipwright. This plank is mine—I purchased it and worked it in a barge that belonged to Mr. Fyffe, at the Pier wharf, Deptford—I left it safe at half-past eight o'clock in the evening of the 31st—I knew the prisoner, but he did not work there.





JAMES FYFFE, JUN
. I am in partnership with my father—this plane belongs to us—the prisoner was not in our employ.

Prisoner's Defence. I met a man who said he would give me 6d. to carry it to King-street—I said I would carry it for 9d.—he said, "Who are you working for?"—I said, "Mr. Sanders"—he said, "If a police? man stops you say it is your master's, and I will give you 1s."





BENJAMIN LOVELL
 (police-sergeant R 15.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the man.




GUILTY
. Aged 17.—


Transported for Fourteen Years.

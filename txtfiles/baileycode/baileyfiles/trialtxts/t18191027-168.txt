            . I am a watchman. On the 20th of October, between one and two o'clock in the morning, I met the prisoner and another man; the prisoner said,
"I'll be b - g - d if I don't put this over my shoulders now." I took hold of him, and asked him where he got the things from? - he had the curtain and shawl; he said he found them. The other escaped.

Digory Masters. On the 29th of August the two boys

 at the bar, Leveredge and Cook, came into my shop under pretence to buy a pair of shoes. I shewed them a pair, but they said they would not do. I turned my back to see for another pair, and I suppose then they took my watch. I know it was hanging up in its place when they came in, and I missed it in about a quarter of an hour after they were gone. About three weeks after Mr. Wright, the keeper of Tothillfields Bridewell, brought Leveredge to me, who confessed that they took it at that time.

            . I took in this watch of a woman that lives with Mahan; on the 13th of September she fetched it out again, and Mahan brought it again on the 15th.

            . I am going in my fifteenth year of age. Leveredge and Cook went into the shoemaker's shop to buy a pair of shoes. I stood without at the corner. Cook came out first with the watch, and said, I have got the watch, let us run away. We did. After that Leveredge sold it to Mahan for fifteen shillings.
Q. Did Mahan ask you how you came by it?
Rimer. He knew how I came by it; he used to be always buying of things. He has bought other things of boys.
Q. What is he?
Rimer. He is a shoemaker
 by trade.
Q. What is Leveredge?
Rimer. He is a plaisterer
.
Glyn. The boy Rimer told me it was sold for twelve shillings.
Rimer. Mahan bought two watches of us; he gave twelve shillings for one, and fifteen for the other.
Q. What is the watch worth?
Glyn. I lent sixteen shillings upon it.
Leveredge's Defence.
I went into this man's shop to buy a pair of shoes: he had none that would fit me. Cook was gone about five minutes before me. He and Rimer ran away. I did not see them till the Monday: then they asked me to go with them to sell a watch, but I had none of the money.
Rimer. We sold the watch the same afternoon that we took it.
Cook's Defence.
Rimer met me coming out at the door: he had a watch, and he went and sold it. I had none of the money indeed.
Mahan's Defence.
Last Saturday was a month this young fellow came up to me, that is, Leveredge. I never saw any body but him. He asked me to mend his shoes. I said I had but six-pence about me to buy leather. I said, If you will give me a shilling, I will go about them on the Monday morning. He said he had no money. He had a watch, and desired me to go and pawn it for him. I went and left it with Mr. Glyn for sixteen shillings. I never saw him after till before Sir

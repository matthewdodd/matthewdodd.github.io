             sworn. - I am servant to Mr. Stelfox; I saw the prisoner come into Mr. Stelfox's shop, take out a pair of stays, and give them to a man at the door; he came in again, was leaning over the counter, and reaching after something else; he did not see me coming; I came out directly upon his back; the other man saw me, and ran away; I immediately secured the prisoner; my master has lost 100l. worth of stays lately in that way.
Prisoner's defence. I went into the shop to buy some silk; I never meddled with any stays at all.
Jury. Q. Do you sell silk? - A. No, nothing but stays.

The prisoner called his master, who gave him a good character.

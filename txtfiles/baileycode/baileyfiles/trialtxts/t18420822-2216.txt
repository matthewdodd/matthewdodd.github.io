WILLIAM HOWELL
. I live in Stonecutter-street, Farringdon-street, next door to the prosecutor. On the morning of the 6th of August I saw the prisoner pass my shop-door, endeavouring to conceal something under his jacket—I went out, and he ran across the road into a house—I overtook him, and took these boots from his hand—he said, "Take the boots, and let me go"—I dragged him out—he kicked my shins, and tried to throw me.

Prisoner. I was going through Farringdon-market; a young man asked me to buy a pair of boots; I bought them, and went home with them.

Transported for Seven Years.

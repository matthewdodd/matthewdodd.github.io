RICHARD TIMLOCK
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
16th of October, 1 pair of trowsers, value 7s.; 1 waistcoat, value 4s. 6d.; and handkerchief, value 6d.; the goods of 



James Bristow.






JAMES BRISTOW
. I work for Mr. Shearbourn, at Bedfont. These trowsers and other things produced were taken from the room where I sleep, on Mr. Shearbourn's premises—they were safe on the 16th of October, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon—I missed them between nine and ten at night—the room was not locked—I suspected the prisoner, and found him in an outhouse, and found the things close to him—he does not work for my master—he lives in the village—he had no right to be on my master's premises—when I found these things, he said he intended wearing them the following day—I had never given him permission to do so.





DANIEL COX
. I went with Bristow into the room, and missed the property—I went to where the prisoner was asleep—the goods were found close to where he laid—I asked how he could think of taking them from a Poor lad like that?—he said he was going to a place the next morning, and he intended to wear these things.






THOMAS BRAY
 (police-constable F 200.) I received the prisoner from Cox, who gave me the property—there were several other articles of another person's, which he is not indicted for.




GUILTY
.* Aged 17.—


Transported for Seven Years.

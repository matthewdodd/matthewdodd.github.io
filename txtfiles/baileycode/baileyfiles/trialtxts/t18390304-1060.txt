SUSANNAH KEEFE
. I am the wife of William Keefe. I live with Mr. William Backley Hutchinson, of Guildford-street, Russell-square. On the evening of the 6th of February I was in the kitchen, and heard a knock at the street-door—I went, and saw the prisoner—he said he came few Goodge-street, Tottenham Court-road, about some chairs, and he begged me to inquire if the chairs would do on Saturday morning—I went up to the drawing-room, and left him at the door—when I was coming down I heard him run from the entrance door, and shut the door; and on getting down, I missed my master's great-coat from a peg in the hall—it had the hanging there when I left the prisoner—I am quite certain he is the man—the coat has not been found.




GUILTY
. Aged 22.—


Transported for Seven Years.

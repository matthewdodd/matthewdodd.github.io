RICHARD OVER. I am a constable of the East India Docks


. Webster delivered the prisoner over to me, with this coffee, which I weighed; he said the dock master ordered him to deliver him to me, and said, in his hearing, that the coffee was drawn from the prisoner's pockets; the prisoner said, he drew the sample to oblige the merchant; he was foreman of a warehouse - it weighed 3 lbs.

            . I am a warehouse-keeper; the prisoner was foreman under me on the coffee floor; he has no right to take samples without my orders - I did not order him to take samples; sometimes a sample weighs 2 lbs., and occasionally 3 lbs.; if there are many bags, we take a little out of each, tie them up in paper, and mark the weight outside - that produced was in a handkerchief.
Prisoner. Q. Have you not often authorized me to draw a sample to oblige a merchant, without an excise order - A. I have, but they are never taken out in a handkerchief, or hat; if a merchant's clerk wants coffee, to shew his employers, we allow him to take a 1/4 lb. - it is done under the excise officer's notice, but we ought to have an excise order to draw them.
Q. Did you not authorize me to draw larger samples for my brother - A. His brother is clerk to the owner of the coffee, and I have done such a thing, but never allowed him to draw a regular sample for his brother, without the leave of my superior.
RICHARD OVER re-examined. Webster said that the coffee was secreted in the prisoner's hat, and without paper - the prisoner did not say whom he drew the sample for.

            . I am clerk to Meyers and Co. I saw the prisoner at the East India Docks, on the 24th of April. I gave him no orders about samples, I only asked him to get some coffee weighed, which my employers had bought. I was present before the Magistrate on the 28th April. I do not know whether what the prisoner said was taken down - Mr. Langley was the Magistrate; the prisoner heard what I said, and denied it. I said, I gave him no orders for samples; he said, I did - I did not. I wanted no samples of any coffee in the East India Docks.
Prisoner. Q. Did you not in March last, ask me to draw samples of coffee, which were coming by the Providence - A. I do not know.
Prisoner. Q. Did you not say you would call for them if I could get them - A. I said, I would call for weights, but not samples; samples are always delivered in paper by an order - I never asked him to draw me samples without.

            . I am an Excise surveyor. Samples must not be delivered without an Excise order; they generally take about 2 oz. from each package - it may amount to several pounds; we do them up in paper, and make them up in square parcels, and mark them outside. I saw the prisoner stopped by Webster, as he was going out to breakfast, at half-past eight o'clock; he was searched in the office, and nothing found on him, but upon taking off his hat, there was about 3 lbs. of coffee in a handkerchief - he had said he had nothing about him; he said it was samples which he was going to take to some person, he did not say whom - it was not the regular way to carry out samples.

            . I know the hand-writing of Mr. Langley the Magistrate, this deposition is signed by him, (reads) The prisoner says
"I persist in saying, Mr. Ansley asked me for parcels, and said, if I could not get them that day, I must next morning, and take them to Great Winchester-street."

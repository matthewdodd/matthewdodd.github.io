. On the 6th of February, about a quarter-past eight o'clock at night, the prisoner called and asked for a character, she had left my service about three weeks before. I said she should have such a character that would get her a situation, she thanked me, and left the bar; about five minutes after, the chambermaid went to my bedroom, and found her there; she had stripped the bed of two blankets and one sheet. I sent for an officer.

, the 20th of May
 last.
It appear'd by the Evidence, that the Prisoner came into the Prosecutor's Shop in the Morning before he was up, and the Boy having combed his Wig, he sent him up Stairs to ask his Master if he could make him a brown Wig by Saturday Night, and while the Boy was gone up, the Prisoner went away with the Wigs and Hair.
The Prisoner afterwards being so daring as to pass by the Prosecutor's Door, the Boy espying him, gave Notice to his Master, then standing at the Door, who immediately pursuing him, took him, and the Goods were part of them found near New-Prison , with the Prisoner, and one Wig where he had sold it. The Fact being plain, the Jury found him 


               guilty to the value of 4 s. 10 d.

, and live in Watling-street. On the 4th of April I bought nine legs of pork of Mr. Hubbard, but never received one of them: I do not know the prisoner - I never authorised him to receive them.

            . I am a servant to Mr. Hubbard, a salesman, of Newgate-market, Mr. Collins purchased nine legs of pork and twenty-seven pieces of meat; two of his men took the meat away; they left the legs of pork in my care, and in five minutes the prisoner came and asked for them for Mr. Collins, of Watling-street; I immediately delivered them to him, supposing he was his servant.
Prisoner. Q. How came you to let me have them? A. Because you came with a tray across your arm, and asked for them - I had seen you on the Friday, but never before.
WILLIAM HUBBARD. I am a salesman. I sold Mr. Collins nine legs of pork, among other meat; I never authorised the prisoner to go and fetch them - I never saw him before.
The prisoner, in a long address to the Court, positively denied ever having had the property.

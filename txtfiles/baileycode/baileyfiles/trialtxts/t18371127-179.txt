 for stealing, on the

SAMUEL WRIGHT
. I am a policeman. I was on duty in Covent-garden on the 17th of November, between eleven and twelve o'clock at night—I observed the prisoner try several gentlemen's pockets, by going behind them and feeling them—he was alone—I saw him go behind one gentleman at the end' of Bow-street, and take from his pocket this silk hand kerchief—he folded it up, and tucked it under his waistcoat—I took him, and sent my brother officer to bring the gentleman back, but I have not seen him since—I do not know his name, nor where he lives.

Prisoner. Q. What did the gentleman say? A. He said it was his property, but he refused to give charge of him—he would not go with me, and I have not seen him since—he said the handkerchief was his.





JOHN SPENCER COLBPEPER
. I was with my brother officer, and saw the prisoner take the handkerchief from the gentleman's pocket—my brother officer took him—I ran after the gentleman—he said he had lost his handkerchief—he came back and said it was his handkerchief, but he would not go to the station-house—I asked his name—he would not tell me—he wanted us to give him his handkerchief.

(George Atkinson, a watchmaker, of Ironmonger-row, gave the prison a good character.)

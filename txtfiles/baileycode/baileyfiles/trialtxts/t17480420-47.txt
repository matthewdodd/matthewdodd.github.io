                  Martin 
               



            . I am a barge master

. I lost three bolts of copper out of my barge, two were lost in February, and one the eighth of March.
Q. Is it your copper?
Martin. No, but I am answerable for it. One bolt weighed one hundred and a half, and three pounds, and I charged it at 8 l. 8 s.


                  Daniel 
                  Wright 
               



            . This single bolt was stole the 8th of March, it weighed one hundred and a half, and three pounds.
Q. Who took it out of the barge?
Wright. I did. 
               
                  William 
                  Prosey 
               



             and Taylor asked me to go with them, and there was one 
               
                  John 
                  Placket 
               



             with us; Taylor and I took this cake of copper out of the barge when the men were asleep, and I, Prosey, Taylor, and Plackett, sold it to William Peachey, at Cow-Cross, and shared the money. Lawrence was not with us then.
Q. When was you taken up?
Wright. The 11th of April, with six bolts of copper, offering them to sell.

                  Weale 
               



            . I am a brasier in Wood-street. I had a search-warrant about the copper, and that discovered this affair; this piece was cut by a smith to deface it, and it was brought to me quite hot, and I knew it to be stole. I found these four fellows at an alehouse called the Twopenny house, in Chick-Lane; it is called so, because they sell strong beer for two pence a quart; they buy their malt at six shillings a quarter. When the Prisoners were before Justice Hole, he asked them what they had to say, and they said they had nothing to say, for he knew too much already.


                  Elizabeth 
                  Bragg 
               



            . I keep a publickhouse, at the Turk's Head in Turnmill street. The Prisoners lodge at my house. I do not know that they ever wronged any body. I had two keys, and they commonly went out at nine or ten in the morning. I never knew them to lie out, nor never knew them to bring in any thing.
Q. What did they say they did for their living?
Bragg. They all said they went to empty West-country barges of malt and other things.
Lawrence 

               acquitted
            .
Prosey and Taylor 

               guilty
            .
They were a second time indicted for 


               stealing six bolts of copper, value 18 l.
             the property of

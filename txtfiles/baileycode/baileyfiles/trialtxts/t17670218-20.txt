            ; we keep the Bull and Butcher in Smithfield




; I had been washing all day; the prisoner came in, and called for a pennyworth of beer; he drank it, and called for another, and after that a third, and changed a shilling to pay for them; I went into the tap room, and hung a wet shirt upon the horse, and bid the maid go and take her supper; she went into the tap-room and said, the shirt and man are gone; I ran out, and found the prisoner almost at the end of Hosier-lane; I took hold of him with one hand, and the shirt with the other, and brought him back; my husband got a constable; (the shirt produced and deposed to.)
Prisoner's defence.
I was in great necessity, almost starving and perishing on the earth; I do not deny the thing; I am within six weeks of 66 years of age.
To his character.

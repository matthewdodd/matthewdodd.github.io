MARY ANN BOYCE. I am single
. I lost my caps and calico off the top of my bedstead, on the 16th of December - I caught the prisoner coming out of my house with a latch in his hand, between ten and eleven o'clock; I asked what he wanted - he said, "Wood, a shoemaker;" and he said, "If you think I have robbed you, you had better search me" - I said, "I don't suppose you have, my good man;" but I took him two doors off with these articles.

(Property produced and sworn to.)
THOMAS AMES. I am an officer. I took the prisoner.
Prisoner's Defence. I was passing the door, and a sailor gave me these things; the man ran down the street.

            . I keep a boot-shop
 in Baldwin's-gardens


. On the 30th of March the prisoner and another came to try on some shoes; they said they were a little too long - they then asked the price of these boots, which hung on a nail; I did not bid any money for the shoes - two other persons then came in, and took our attention; the prisoner went away, without buying any thing - I missedthe boots soon after, and the officer came in about half an hour - I found the boots at the watch-house.

            . I am an officer. I was on duty on Holborn-hill about five o'clock; I saw the prisoner come out of Brook-street, and go on to Fetter-lane; I followed - he saw me, and ran down Norwich-court: he threw these boots and this apron into a milk-house - a gentleman stopped him in Castle-street, and I took him.(Property produced and sworn to.)

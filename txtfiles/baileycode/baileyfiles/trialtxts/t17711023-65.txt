            . I am a servant to Mr. Redman, the prisoner was a servant
 to Mr. Redman, he had received warning to quit his service three weeks before this was done. I lay on the same floor with him. On the 28th of September, about 5 o'clock in the morning he knocked at my door, and told me there had been somebody in the house, and asked for a light; I had never a one to give; then he went down a lower room, and got a light of another of the servants. I came down stairs into the place where the bureau was broke open, about a quarter of an hour after him: I saw the windows open in the back parlour, the window shutters were both open, and the sash of the biggest was up; the shutters of the little window were cut with something, and the bureau was broke open; the prisoner said there had been a man in the garret, with a pistol, where he lay, and told him if he did not lie still he would blow his brains out, and then all the family came down; this was towards six o'clock; the prisoner then took us into the garden to see if he could any way trace the thieves; he said, before he went into the garden, he believed the rogues came in at the little window; we went into the garden directly; we went down first to the alcove in the garden, and looked over, and one of the maids saw the silver spoon, just over the ditch, in the field, opposite the alcove; the prisoner went first; when we saw the spoon he was a going to jump over to get it, but he went round into the field, and we went into the middle of the field; the prisoner said we will go quite cross the field; to see if we can find any more; the cook found another in the middle of the field; we went across the field and found a pair of old black buckles, them he picked up; then we came into the garden and found the china snuff box. The prisoner said he believed a little boy got in at the little window; the glass of the window was broke; it did not appear as if any body had got in; a man could not get in, it must be a small boy to get in; the windows were both towards the garden.
Q. Do you recollect any expressions made use of that led you to suspect him.

Wood. The night before he said he believed somebody had been in the garden; I said it was never attempted to be broke open; he said that was no reason it never should.
Q. from Prisoner. Did I go first to the alcove?
Wood. Yes:

                  John
                   Redman
               



            . I live in Mile-end, in the parish of Stepney


. The prisoner was a servant of mine; he had been five months in my service, within a week. I went from my house, on the 26th of September, to go into Essex, and returned on Saturday the 28th; the first person I saw on my return was the prisoner; he informed me a man had broke in at the little window, and went out again at the large one; and that the thief stood by his bed-side near an hour before he went to the maid's room for a candle, and he said he was dressed in a light blue coat. I thought it impossible for him to know the colour of a coat at five o'clock in the morning; this is what passed at the door, going into the parlour; and examining the window, in company with the witness 
               
                  Edward
                   Wright
               



            , I found the sash glass broke, but it was broke on the inside, because the glass was on the outside. On examining the window shutter there appeared three small cuts, as if it had been done by a case-knife; the cuts were not opposite the hole in the glass; they were below; and there was a screw, a turn buckle, and an iron bar that were not brok e at all; so that it seemed impossible for any body to come in at that window; the hole in the shutter was not large enough for a child to get his finger through, and the vine that grew on the outside of this window, was not damaged; it could not be opened on the outside. I looked further, and found my bureau was broke open; I lost a large pair of silver shoe buckles, and a silver stock buckle; I could not tell particulary what I had lost. I am not sure the silver shoe buckles were taken out of the bureau; the stock buckle was, the table spoons were on the side board; there were four of them in the same parlour; I left them in the house when I went, and I missed them when I came back; I lost a china snuff box; I can say, for certainty, that the silver stock buckle and the china snuff box were in the bureau. The prisoner was taken up the day the robbery was commited. Before I came home Mrs. Redman suspected him; at first she went to a friend, and he advised her to take him up; he was taken before justice Sherwood, and committed on Monday. On the Friday after, Mr. Sackler, a publican, in the neighbourhood, came to my house, just as I returned from the justices, and told me where the prisoner said the things were buried, and that the magistrate had consented he should come into the field, in custody, and if I would go the things should be delivered to me; so I went into the field; there was the prisoner, in custody, with 
               
                  Edward
                   Wright
               



            , and another officer, and this Sackler was with me, and the things were delivered to me by one of the officers. These are my buckles that I advertised, and this is my stock buckle, and these stone sleeve buttons are mine; the prisoner was present when these things were delivered to me; the officers said they found them in my fields, near the pales, the snuff box was given to me the day I returned home, by the servants; it was found in the garden.
Q. from the prisoner. He said I was in custody when he came home; whereas, he said before, I came to the door and told him of these things.
Redman. The officer came to the door as I did.
Q. from the prisoner. My master swears this screw was on the window; how does he know that it was on that night?
Court. There is no positive evidence arising from that.
Q. to the former witness. Was this screw secured that night?
Wood. I did not take notice.

            . I live at the Red Cow, at Mile-end. I know the prisoner; the day the things were lost I saw him, and asked him it was; then he said a man had broke open the house, and came up to his bed. I enquired after the man, particularly, because I had been robbed myself; On Friday I went to the justice, and I went to a publick house where the prisoner was, and two men had him in custody, we went into a private room, and taxed him with knowing of this robbery: we said to him, you must know of this robbery; he said he knew nothing at all of it; we all stuck up to in that the must know, and he had better confess; then he confessed that they were hid in the field, but he could not tell where, without going. I acquainted the justice with it, and I and the two men, Wright and Farrel, went to this field, by Mr. Redman's; when we came to the field, we went round to let the squire know of it, and left the prisoner with Wright and Farrel; I was not present when the things were found.
Q. from the Jury. Did the prisoner confess the robbery?
Sackle. Yes.
Q. What had he said before of this field, at the public house?
Sackle. He said he would own it if we would send a particular person to him, he said he would not tell where they were, unless he was to go.
Q. from the Prisoner. He said he was the person that came into the field with me, and the officer; then he said he went to my master, and came in with him, and two other gentlemen.

                   Wright
               



            . I am a servant at Mr. Sherwood's office; I took the prisoner; the second time he was brought to be examined he confessed this 'robbery, he said if you will take off my handcuffs and come along with me, I will shew you where the field is; then we went with him into the field, he shewed me the bag, and I gave it to Mr. Redman, it was in high grass under the pails; I picked it up, I never opened it, but gave it to Mr. Redman.
Q. From the Prisoner. He said that he and I were both present at the picking up the things, that I picked them up, and then he picked them up?
Wright. He shewed me the things, and I picked them up.


                  John
                   Farrel
               



            . I went into the field with Wright and the prisoner; we went over two fields with him, and jumped over a bank; he put down his hand and took up the bag, and gave it to Wright; his master came out, and two gentlemen; he gave them to Mr. Redman; I stood close by him when the purse was tken up; Wright was stooping at the same time he was.
Prisoner's Defence.
On Tuesday morning my master went into the country; the next morning a man came into my chamber and held a pistol to me, and said if I stirred 'he would blow my brains out; I believe he staid about an hour; then I went down to this young woman's room, and asked her for a light, she gave me one; then I went to my mistress, and knocked her up, and said, I believe somebody had been in the house; I went down and found the little window open; it was broke, and the shutters cut, and the great window was open; then they all came down, and after a little time we all went in the garden, and the cook maid picked up a spoon; then we went round to several places, and by the wall she picked up the snuff box; then my mistress called me in, to go with her to a gentleman's, where she was going, at Stepney; as I came back she desired me to see, if I could see any thing dropt; so I went round the field and saw the things lie there; then I opened the bag and saw what was in it; I left it there, because I was afraid to mention it; least my mistress should think I had some hand in it; how it came there I do not know, but there I found it.

MICAIAH REED
 (policeman, E 108). On 9th Jan., about half-past six o'clock in the evening, I saw Anderson in Tottenham Court-road, in front of a shop, with his back against some railings—Tracey walked by on the opposite side—he crossed over and spoke to Anderson—they remained in conversation two or three minutes—Tracey then crossed the road, and Anderson followed him—they both went towards Mrs. Moore's shop—a wagon passed, and I did not see them—I saw them come away from the shop together—Tracey had this picture in his hand—I collared him, and said "What have you got here?"—he said, "You have got roe this time, Mr. Reed, and I am glad of it, because I am quite tired of the life I have been leading lately"—I took him to the station—I afterwards took Anderson at the Adam and Eve, Hampstead-road, and told him the charge—he said he knew nothing about it, and had not seen Tracey.





JAMES MASON
 (policeman, S 168). I saw Tracey in Reed's custody. I met Anderson a few yards off—he went to the Adam and Eve—we took him.

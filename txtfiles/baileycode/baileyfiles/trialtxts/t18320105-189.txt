            . I drive for Mr. Norris, of Sion-hill, my waggon was in Marylebone-street


 on the 8th of December - I was unloading some potatoes, and my coat was on the waggon; I did not take any notice of the prisoners, but they might have been there; the officer brought me my coat - this is it.

            . I am an officer. On the 8th of December I was coming along Great Marylebone-street - I saw the waggon, and the coat on the sacks of potatoes; I saw the prisoners pass, and look at it - I hid myself, saw Field get on the wheel of the waggon, take the coat, and give it to Jones; they ran one way - I pursued, ran past Field, and took Jones with the coat; a man came up, and I told him to take Field, which he did.

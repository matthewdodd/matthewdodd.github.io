            .
Q. to Lerttia Pearco. Do you know the prisoner?
Pearce. Yes, Sir, she came backwards and forwards to assist me; and about the 11th of September last I mist the goods; I lodged at one Mr. Jones's in Newtner street


, I lost two checkt aprons, a silk handkerchief, a holland shirt and a shift. The goods were in different places in my lodging, I know it must be the prisoner, for there was no body else there; the apron was taken off her side, I found nothing else upon her, I took her up, and had her before Justice Burdus.
The prisoner swore she borrowed the apron of the witness.




               Guilty 10 d.

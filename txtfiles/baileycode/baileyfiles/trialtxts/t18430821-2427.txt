WILLIAM KIBBLE
. I am shopman to John Wells, a pawnbroker, in Broad-street, Bioomsbury. On the 5th of August I missed a coat, which I had seen safe about an hour before—I saw the prisoner scuffling with a man about two hundred yards from my master's—I went up, took the coat from bim, and gave him in charge—when he got about fifty yards, he slipped out of his coat, and got away from the policeman, and was not taken till a week after—this is the coat—it is my master's.

Prisoner. I was not the person. Witness. I took it from him—I have not the least doubt of him, as a week before he was in our shop redeeming some articles.




GUILTY
. † Aged 18.—


Transported for Seven Years.

Thomas Lateward. I was at the Cock and Hoop in Holborn


, last Tuesday evening; I call'd for a pint of beer in the tap-room, where these two prisoners were sitting; I had been drinking a little before, and had the hickups, and they began to make game of me; they insinuated themselves into my company, and said, come, will you give us any thing? I treated them with six pennyworth of rum and water; I took out my bag with money.
Q. How came you by so much money about you?
Lateward. I am book-keeper
 to Mr 
               
                  John 
                  Anson 
               



            , who keeps a tea ware-house, the Green Cannister, just above Middle-row Holborn.
Q. How much money had you about you?
Lateward. I had 28 l. 10 s. they seeing this, one kept talking to me, while the other took it.
Q. Which pocket had you it in?
Lateward. In my coat pocket.
Q. Which took it?
Lateward. I was in liquor and can't tell; that will come out by the next witness. Lovet was gone out, I ask'd Cox after it; presently she wheedled me out to some house to see for Lovet; when I came there, I miss'd my bag with the money.
Q. Where is the house you went with her to?
Lateward. It is in Tennis-court, No. 2. I ask'd Cox for my money, she said she knew nothing of it, and said the other woman Lovet had got it.
Q. Did you undress yourself?
Lateward. No, I did not; I do not know that I sat down in the house. She got from me and went away; on the Wednesday evening, being the day following, I went in at the Magpye and Horse-shoe in Middle-row, and call'd for a pint of beer, and was complaining of my loss; the maid-servant of the house told me she could inform me about it.
Q. What is her name?
Lateward. Her name is 
               
                  Susanna 
                  Edwards 
               



            ; she said she was in at the Cock and Hoop at the time I was there, and she saw 
               
                  Mary 
                  Lovet 
               



             take the bag out of my pocket; then we went to the Cock and Hoop, and found Cox, and had her secured, and carried her before Justice Fielding. There she acknowledged she had five guineas of my money; she was searched, and five guineas, one shilling, and two-pence, found upon her; which is now in the hands of the constable. In the afternoon I found Lovet, and took her before Justice Welch, and she was committed.
Q. What did Cox say before Justice Fielding?
Lateward. She said I throw'd my bag on the floor, and said to her, she might pay herself, and she took out fifteen guineas for a k - g bout; but I had no criminal conversation with her. She had equipped her self out very fine with my money, as I suppose; silver buckles, cardinal, gold necklace, shifts, and other things.


                  Susanna 
                  Edwards 
               



            . I was at the Cock and Hoop drinking a pint of beer with a friend, at the time that the prosecutor was drinking there; the two prisoners were sitting at a table when he came in; he was in liquor; this was last Tuesday was seven-night, at night; he had got the hiccups, the two prisoners made game of him; he call'd them bitches, and curs'd them; at last they had some rum and water. I heard Lovet say to the other, By G - d I have got a sigh out of him. I saw him pull out a dun-coloured canvass bag and take out a shilling to pay for the six pennyworth of rum and water; both the prisoners sat on his left-hand side.
Q. Which sat nearest to him?
Edwards. 
               
                  Winifred 
                  Cox 
               



             did, at last they mov'd, and one sat on his right hand, and the other on his left.
Q. What did you see him do with the bag after he had taken out the shilling?
Edwards. I saw him put it into his left-hand coat-pocket; he call'd for a pint of beer afterwards. Soon after this he said his bag was lost, and made a great many words about it. Then I saw it in Cox's hand, Lovet had taken it out and handed it to her; she said by G - d here is money enough in the bag.
Q. Were the two prisoners both with him at that time?


                  Susannah 
                  Edwards 
               



            . Yes, they were: then Mary Lovet went and sat on his right hand side; she had sat on the left side before, but they shifted sides; soon after this Lovet got up and went out at the door. My Mother came to call me home, and I went away and left him and 
               
                  Winifred 
                  Cox 
               



             together in the Alehouse; on the Wednesday night, being the day after, the prosecutor came to the Magpye and Horseshoe in Middle-Row, where I live, and was talking to the company of his loss; I hearing of him, said I could tell him who were in the house at the time he was robbed, for I was at that Alehouse at the same time; so I went with him to the Cock and Hoop.
Q. from Lovet. Was I in company with the prosecutor at that time?
Sus. Edwards. Yes: you was.

                  Hilton 
               



            . I am a Constable belonging to St Andrew Holborn: on Thursday last I was sent for to the Cock and Hoop in Holborn; the prosecutor was there; he gave me charge of 
               
                  Winifred 
                  Cox 
               



            ; I carried her before Justice Fielding; the prosecutor charged her with taking his money; the Justice ordered me to search her; I was going to search her, and she took five guines, one shilling, and two-pence out of her pocket, and gave it to the Justice, and the Justice gave it me in my hand, and bound me over to come here and give evidence; she acknowledged that money to be the prosecutor's property.
Lovet's defence.
I met 
               
                  Winifred 
                  Cox 
               



             at the corner of Leather-lane that night, and asked her if she had any money; she said no she had none; she gave me her handkerchief to pawn; I took and pawn'd it, and then we went in at the Cock and Hoop, there came in this gentleman; he sat down and had the biccups; we made game of him; he was very much in liquor, and winked with his eyes; he called for a pint of beer; he asked 
               
                  Winifred 
                  Cox 
               



             to let him sit by her; she asked him to give her something to drink; he called for six-penny-worth of rum and water; there came in an oyster-woman; he had three-penny-worth of oysters; he sat in our box; presently he said he mi ssed his money; the landlady said, no body had been near him: then he took a bag out of his pocket, and took out a shilling, and paid nine-pence for the rum and water, and the oysters, and said here is money enough; 
               
                  Winifred 
                  Cox 
               



             and I went out together; I never saw her 'till the next morning, then she called me out to go along with her to redeem some things of her's out of pawn.
Cox's defence.
I came out of the house with the prosecutor; he asked me to bring him to a house where we could go to bed together; I brought him to No. 2 in Tennis Court; I asked him what he would give me; he said nothing 'till he had seen my commodity; the landlady being willing to take money bid me show him, which I did; he pulled out his purse and said, my girl, here is money enough, and flung it down on the floor, and said pay yourself. I took out fifteen guineas, and he laid me down and -, I took the money and put it into my pocket; after that he said he had a five pound note, which he would give me to be concerned another way.
Both 


               guilty of felony only

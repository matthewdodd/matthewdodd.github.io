            . I am a coach-proprietor
 at the Boltin-Tun, Fleet-street


. The prisoner was a clerk
 in my office, and received money from passengers, and from Eastland particularly; he did not account to me on, or after, the 19th of June
, for fifty sovereigns received from Eastland.
Cross-examined by ADOLPHUS. Q. He had settled with you for other monies? A. Yes; he was about leaving me - I had given him notice about a fortnight before; he enters in a book all the money he receives; there is none entered to Eastland after the 16th; Eastland is joint proprietor of the coach, and part of the loss would be his.
Cross-examined by Mr. ANDREWS. Q. Was the prisoner your servant exclusively? A. Yes; the payments are made to me, and I divide the profits afterwards.

            . I am one of the proprietor's of the Tunbridge Wells coach. On the 19th of June I paid the prisoner 50l. in sovereigns and half-sovereigns; the proprietors settle at the end of the month.
Cross-examined. Q. You drive and collect the money? A. Yes, and pay to Gray; I told the prisoner to make a memorandum of it, but he has not.

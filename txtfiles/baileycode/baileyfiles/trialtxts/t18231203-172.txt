. On the 18th of November, the prisoners came to my shop to look at some damaged china. These things were on a night-table, by the door. They were about a quarter of an hour in the shop, looking at china, but bought nothing; and in two hours the officer called, and produced an opera glass and a box of weights, which I am certain are mine. I had not seen them myself that day.

            . I am street-keeper to the Foundling estate. On the 18th of November I stopped the prisoners in Spelder-street, and took them to the watch-house. Johnson wished a woman to search him, and the woman found this opera glass and weights in a large pocket which she had before her. She said the weights were brought from the East Indies by her brother, and the opera glass was her own, and she was going to sell it. Lawson said they did belong to her, and that she knew her brother gave them to her.
Cross-examined by MR. GORDON. Q. Was Lawson searched - A. Yes. Lawson said Johnson told her she had them from her brother.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
JOHNSON'S Defence. We were both together - one is equally as much in fault as the other.

. On the 18th of November, the prisoners came into the shop to buy some bonnets - looked at some, but the price would not suit - they left without buying anything. This table-cloth was on the table with the bonnets. Cadby brought it to me in half an hour.

            . I found this table-cloth in Johnson's apron. Lawson said it was her's, and she was going to pawn it.

LAWSON'S Defence. I stood outside the door, and did not know that she had anything; when she came out she shewed me a time-piece.
MRS. DAVIS. They both came into the shop. Lawson handed the bonnets to Johnson to look at.

. On the 18th of November, between one and two o'clock, the prisoners came and asked if we had any damaged plates - I said No; and they looked at some damaged crockery; and in about a quarter of an hour after they left, Cadby brought this time-piece stand, which I had not missed. It was safe half an hour before.

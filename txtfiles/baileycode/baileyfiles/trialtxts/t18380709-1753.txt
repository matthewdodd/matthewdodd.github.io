MICIHAEL DAINTRY HOLLINS
. I Jive in Calthorpe-street, and am a medical student. I went to Woolwich to see the Review on the 5th of july—I perceived something at my pocket—I turned, and the prisoner was immediately behind me—I accused him of having stolen my handkerchief—I saw him put his hands under his coat, as if hiding something—he said he had nothing of mine—he went off—I followed him, and found my handkerchief under his coat, at his back—this is it—(looking at it)—there is my mark on it, and one corner is torn off—I gave him into custody.






JOHN BRADFORD
 (police-constable A 76.) I was at the Review, and observed the prosecutor—I heard him say to the prisoner, "You have got my handkerchief," and I saw him take it from under his coat—I found four more handkerchiefs, a cork-screw, a penknife, and a pin was in the handkerchief, which was round the prisoner's neck—these four handkerchiefs were tucked in his breast—this cotton handkerchief was in his hat.

Prisoner. I went to the Review—two of these handkerchiefs I had got out of pawn the day before—I was behind this gentleman—he said I had picked his pocket—I said I had not—I was walking away, and he said, "Here is the handkerchief"—the policeman came and took me, and said, "This will do for a case"—I have a wife and two children, and my friends are at Brighton.





JOHN BRADFORD

re-examined. I did not say, "This will do for a case," nor any such thing—I said to the gentleman, "Can you swear to the handkerchief?"—he said, "Yes"—here is, "SC" on one, "8L," and "A G," and "C C," on the others.

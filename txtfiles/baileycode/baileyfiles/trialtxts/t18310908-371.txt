. On the 8th of September I was between the end of the Strand


 and the Admiralty


; I found the prisoner's hand in my trousers pocket - I took hold of the hand, held it fast in my pocket, and called for the Police, but none appeared; Mr. Smart came up, and assisted me in taking his hand out of my pocket, which had the four shillings in it; I had one sovereign and 9s. in my pocket - four shillings came out in his hand, and he dropped them on the ground.
Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q.Nothing was taken out of your pocket by the prisoner? A.His hand was in my pocket, and when we pulled it out the four shillings came out in it.

            . I heard Mr. Hooper call for the Police- there was a very great crowd - I went up, and saw the prisoner's hand in his pocket; I took him by the collar, and said, "Let go your hold;" he would not, and I pulled his hand out of the pocket, and four shillings fell on the ground.
Cross-examined. Q. Then you made him take the money, whether he would or not? A. I made him take his hand out; I would have forgiven him, but a soldier took him to the station.

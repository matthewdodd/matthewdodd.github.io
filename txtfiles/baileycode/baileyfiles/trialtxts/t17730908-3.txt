            : my partner and I found some of the things mentioned in the indictment on the 24th of July; one was brought to my shop to be sold on the 14th of July, by 
               
                  John
                   Millan
               



            ; I owned it, and stopped Millan; he said we might find more at

            's in Charter-house-lane; I got a warrant and went there, and there I found the remainder of the nails and a piece of copper; these are them (producing them); they are my property; no others of the trade have the same mark; there is C upon some of them. was committed by Sir

                   Fielding
               



            , and then he produced the prisoner; the prisoner voluntarily owned he took them from Mr. Whitebread's brewhouse where my son and I had been at work; they were made use of in our work there; they are worth about 16 s. The prisoner said he took them there thinking them of no use to any body.

            . I am partner with my father: we were at work at Mr. Whitebread's; we lost some things there. About a fortnight after my father brought Millan to me, with one of the nails he had brought to sell; I tried the nail with our marking tool, and am sure it is my father's and my property; as to the piece of copper produced I can positively swear that is our property.
Prisoner's Defence.
They were done working there pretty near a fortnight before I found these things; I found them in the rubbish. I have been a servant to Mr. Whitebread these ten years.
Cave. We left our work unfinished.
The prisoner called five witnesses who gave him a good character.

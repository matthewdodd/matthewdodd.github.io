, for feloniously receiving the said ustian, well knowing it to have been stolen; against the Statute, &c.






THOMAS NICKENSON
. I am a tailor, and live in Battersea-square. I saw these waistcoats and fustian safe on the 9th of Oct., and missed them on the 10th—I cannot swear to the fustian produced, but can to the two waistcoats—they were in my shop window.





EDWIN SOAMES
. I am a pawnbroker, and live in Paradise-street, St. Luke's. The male prisoner pawned these two waistcoats on the 11th of October.





FREDERICK LANGTON
 (policeman.) On the 9th of Oct. I saw the male prisoner lurking about Mr. Nickenson's shop—I afterwards went to the female prisoner, and took her—I found a piece of fustian at the pawnbroker's—I asked her how she came by it—she said her son gave it her to sell, and not having money she pawned it, and gave him the money.

Robinson's Defence. I found them under the boards of a new house.





WILLIAM WALKER
 (policeman.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner Robinson's former conviction—(read)—he is the person.

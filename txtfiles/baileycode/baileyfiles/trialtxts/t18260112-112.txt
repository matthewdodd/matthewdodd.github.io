            . I am the wife of Edward Mitchell, a butcher
, who lives in St. John-square. Clerkenwell


. About a quarter past six o'clock on the evening of the 2d of January, a lady said some meat was stolen - I ran as far as St. John-street, and saw the prisoner with two other boys - I caught bold of him, and a gentleman assisted me- the meat fell from him - I had seen it safe about three minutes before it was missed - he must have crept under the stall board.
Prisoner. Two young chaps said they would give me a penny to carry that meat for them as far as Smithfield - I took it, and the woman came and began to beat me.

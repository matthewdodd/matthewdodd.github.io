THOMAS BUNTING LEE
. I live at Daventry, in Northamptonshire. I was in Smithfield, a little before eleven o'clock in the morning, on the 1st of September—I heard something; I turned, and saw a gentleman in pursuit of the prisoner—I looked, and my handkerchief was at my feet—I took it up—I had used it in St. John-street—I saw the prisoner caught—this is my handkerchief.





CHARLES WOODHOUSE WOOLASTON
. I was in West Smithfield on this morning—I saw the prisoner lift up the prosecutor's pocket and takeout this handkerchief—I made towards him—he threw it down and ran through the market—I pursued, and took him in Long-lane, without losing sight of him.





STEPHEN SMITH
 (City police-constable, No. 254.) I took the prisoner, and have the handkerchief.

Prisoner's Defence. I was twenty yards behind the man when the gentleman laid hold of me.






JOHN BUCKLE
. I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 20.—


Transported for Ten Years.

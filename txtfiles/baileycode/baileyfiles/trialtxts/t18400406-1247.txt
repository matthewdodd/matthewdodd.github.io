WILLIAM OVERALL
. I am a grocer, and live in Green-street, Leicester-squar About a quarter before four o'clock on the 8th of April, the prioner came into my shop and took this bag of coffee from the box it laid on—he ran out with it—I ran, and overtook him—I never lost sight of him—I saw him throw the coffee into an area—this is my coffee.





GEORGE ANDERSON
 (police-constable C 85.) I took the prisoner, and got the coffee out of an area where the prisoner had thrown it.

Prisoner's Defence. I was coming out of Green-court, and heard the cry of "Stop thief"—a young man had just passed me—I was following him, and three gentlemen stopped me—it was nearly a minute and a half before this man came up—I know no more about it.

HEZEKIAH SHEPHERD. I am an assistant at a school
. On the 13th of September, about ten o'clock in the morning, I was in the Commercial-road


. A procession was going to her Majesty. I felt my watch drawn from my pocket, and saw the prisoner running two or three yards from me. I followed, called Stop thief! he ran about twenty yards off, without my losing sight of him, - he struggled to get away. The watch was dropped close by where I stopped him.

            . I am a ribbon-weaver, and live in Quaker-street. I was in the Commercial-road, and picked the watch up in the kennel, just by the prisoner, and delivered it to the prosecutor.

"You have got your watch, let me go."

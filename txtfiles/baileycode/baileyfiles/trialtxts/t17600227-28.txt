            . The 22d of February was my washing day; the prisoner at the bar lives below me. She has no other way from her apartment but through my wash-house. I left her in the kitchen when I went up to breakfast, and when I came down again I found her there. Upon missing one shirt, I asked, her if any body had been there in the time I was absent, and she said there had been nobody there. I took her before justice Fielding. I had lost one shirt the week before. She owned she had taken and pawn'd the two shirts; one at Mr. Gunston's, in Germain-Street; the other, at Mr Watson's, at the end of Coventry-Court, the last of which I found ( produced in court and deposed to.)
Q. from prisoner. Did not you lend me this shirt?
Prosecutrix. No, I did not.

            . I am servant to Mr. Watson, a pawnbroker; the prisoner at the bar pawn'd this shirt (here produced) with me, on the 23d of January.
Q. How much did you lend her upon it?
Stockdale. I lent her 7 s. upon it.
Prosecutrix. Mr. Gunston has got the other shirt, but he is obliged to attend at Hicks's-Hall on another affair, and cannot be here; I have seen it, it is my property, that is, it was in my charge; I take in washing, and am accountable for any things that are lost.
Prisoner's Defence.
I am not guilty.



               Guilty

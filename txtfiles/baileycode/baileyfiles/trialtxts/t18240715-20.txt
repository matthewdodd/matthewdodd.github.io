            . I am servant to Messrs. Ward and Co., hosiers
. On the 29th of June, at half-past seven o'clock in the evening, I was in Piccadilly


, and had my handkerchief in my right hand coat pocket - I did not miss it till somebody ran after me; it was produced by Mr. Woolley. The prisoners were about a yard behind me; they were charged with it, and both denied it.


                  JOHN 
                  WOLLEY
               



            . I am a haberdasher, and live in Piccadilly. I was standing in my shop, and saw the prisoners following Mr. Bottrell, who had a lady on each side of him. I saw one of them take the handkerchief out of his pocket - I could not see which took it, but they were in company. I ran and collared them, and found it on Wilson, in his breast pocket.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
JONAS'S Defence. I was walking by the other prisoner, and the gentleman ran out, and caught hold of me.
WILSON'S Defence. This man was three or four yards behind me. I felt something at my feet, stooped down, and put the handkerchief into my breast.

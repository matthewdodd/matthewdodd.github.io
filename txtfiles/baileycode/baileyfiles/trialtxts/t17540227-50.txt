William Fielder. I live with Mr. 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Hook 
               



            , a stationer, in Walbrook; I packed a large quantity of books on the 24th of Jan. bound in rough calf, in a hair-trunk, they were charged in the bill of parcels at upwards of twenty-five pounds value. There was a leidger and journal, two waste books, two envoice books, a cash-book, an order-book; the rest were for divers uses as Mr. Woodbridge pleased to apply them; paper, coarse and fine, pencils, sealing-wax, wafers, quills and pens; they were for him, and were to go to Barbadoes, he going to settle there: On the 25th in the morning I sent them to Bear-Key, after I had corded them up, by 
               
                  John 
                  Higgingbottom 
               



            , a carman, and helped to put them in the cart, directed for Mr. Woodbridge for exportation.

            . I am servant to Mr. 
               
                  John 
                  Meager 
               



            , a carman, I went to Mr. Hook's house in Walbrook, on a Friday, about one o'clock, I do not know the day of the month. I took up a trunk that was delivered to me by 
               
                  William 
                  Fielder 
               



            , it was a large one matted and corded, he helped me up with it into the cart, and gave me a note of the ship's name it was to go by, and also the captain's name, and directed me to carry it to Bear-Key, and to deliver it to 
               
                  Anthony 
                  Isles 
               



             the porter. I carried it down, and struck it on the key, and gave Mr. Isles the note; this I believe was between the hours of two and three in the afternoon.


                  Anthony 
                  Isles 
               



            . I am a porter at Bear-Key, and have the care of the goods for exportation; 
               
                  James 
                  Higingbottom 
               



             brought the trunk he has been mentioning to me there on Friday the 18th of January, he brought it in order to be left there till such time it was shipped; he delivered the note to me, and I ordered him to unload it on the key, but do not remember I ever saw it afterwards. In three or four days after Mr. Woodbridge sent word to me by his clerk to have that trunk shipped, with other of his goods; then I went to see for it, and found it was not there.


                  John 
                  Ford 
               



            . On the 20th of Jan. to the best of my knowledge, between two and three in the morning, I and 
               
                  Walter 
                  Nichols 
               



             went to Bear-Key with intent to steal what we could. We took a large trunk, I believe between 2 and 300 lb. weight, from off the key, and carried it into a small boat, and rowed down the river with it as far as Mill Stairs, (we are both watermen) there we broke the top part of the trunk, which was matted, corded round, and locked. We took all the goods out of it, and put them in the wherry, and flung the trunk over-board. There were almost all manner of stationary ware, large and small bound books, a great deal of paper, ink in two little stone bottles, sealing-wax, wafers, pens, and several other thing. I staid in the boat, and 
               
                  Walter 
                  Nichols 
               



             went and called 
               
                  John 
                  Joyner 
               



            , who came down with him, and brought two sacks, which we put the goods into, and they two carried them to 
               
                  Walter 
                  Nichols 
               



            's mother's house in the Folly. I went with them, we there took them out, and Joyner put them into his own chest, except a few which it would not hold, which were put into a sack, and Joyner carried them to Mr. Holmes's warehouse, which is the Duke of Cumberland's Head, just by Dock Head, and I carried the rest in the sack to the Blue Ball, a Publick-house, in Five-foot-Lane. After that they were moved out of the warehouse into an empty house; I was not there at the time, but was there afterwards along with 
               
                  Daniel 
                  Cutts 
               



            , 
               
                  John 
                  Joyner 
               



            , one Graham, and the prisoner at the bar; we went there with intent to burn all that was not sold: Some of them were sold to two Jews who were strangers.
Q. Who sold them ?
Ford. I did; I went to one 
               
                  Abraham 
                  Roberts 
               



             in the Minories, and related the case to him, and he said he would get two of his friends to come over and buy them. After which there came two Jews, I do not know their names, I sold the paper, sealing-wax, two bottles of ink, and wafers, for 12 s. and I, the prisoner, and 
               
                  John 
                  Joyner 
               



             divided the money between us, we had 1 s. 6 d. each, and the rest was spent in liquor.

                  Graham 
               



            . On the 24th of Jan. last at night I carried some beer to 
               
                  John 
                  Ford 
               



             at an empty house in Hickman's Folly, where was the prisoner, Joyner, and 
               
                  Daniel 
                  Cutts 
               



             : 
               
                  John 
                  Ford 
               



             began first to burn the books; they had four large books in a sack; they began to cut the covers off, and there was wrote on them in Turkey leather, Ledger Wast-book, and Envoice Book; they burnt them all.
Q. Do you know any thing of seeing these books before this?
Graham. On the 20th of Jan. in the morning I was called out of my bed by Joyner, he desired me to open my master's back door and he would bring in a chest. I went to the back door, where was Joyner, Nichols, and Cutts, and the chest. I asked Joyner what he had got there. He said it was stationary ware, and what was that to me. I told them my landlord was not up, and I believed he would not allow the things to be there. I saw four large books in a sack they had with them, they were not opened, but I saw the edges of the paper marbled, and covered with calf; and after that they came and carried them away to the Ship and Blue Ball in Five-foot-Lane, and from thence to the house where they were burnt.



                  James 
                  Leafe 
               



            . I live in Hickman's Folly, in the parish of Bermondsey, and as I was coming home on the 24th of Jan. between eight and nine at night, my wife standing at the door said, I am glad you are come home, there is a chimney on fire at that empty house: I went to the house, there I found a fire, and having my pole-axe in my hand, desired to be let into the room, or upon refusal I would break open the door. I spoke to them, hearing people there, four or five times, but had no answer. At last I got in, there was 
               
                  Walter 
                  Nichols 
               



            , 
               
                  John 
                  Joyner 
               



            , and Ford, and books were a burning. I said I see you have been doing what you should not have done, upon which they all went away, and gave me no answer. There was but little of the books left but what was burnt, only some small pieces of paper, the rest were burnt to a coal.
The prisoner in his defence said, he was drinking with the evidence Ford on a Saturday night; that Ford asked him to give him a cast over the water, and that he was rowing him to Billingsgate, but Ford wanted him to carry him to Bear-Key; which he did; that Ford got out and desired his assistance with that trunk into the boat, and he helped him in with it; that Ford told him he was to have carried it to a ship at Cherry-Garden Stairs the day before, but by mistake he had omitted it; that they shoved off the boat, and Ford said, You dog, now I have made you, for this is worth 3 or 400 l. being silks and velvets: Then he went on, and gave the same account how they proceeded with them as Ford had done before.
He called

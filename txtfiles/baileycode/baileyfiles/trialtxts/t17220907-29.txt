               feloniously stealing out of the House of 
                     
                        
                           Abraham

                  , a Damask Table Cloth, value 20 s. 2 Handkerchiefs 4 s. and a Suit of Lac'd Head Cloths 27 l.
             on the 4th of September
 last. It appear'd that Baker had been 5 Months Servant to the Prosecutor; that several things were missing, and that Grace and Mary Davis, were frequently at Mr. Lasons in Sermon time; the Suit of Head Cloths being lost, they examined Baker strictly, who after a stiff denial produc'd at last a Gown made of the Diaper Table Cloth, and 2 Handkerchiefs: and the Hangings were found at Davis's House. Grace Davis in her defence said, that Baker told her her Mrs. had given her the Hangings to make her a Petticoat. Baker was found 


               Guilty to the value of 39 s.
             but the Evidence not reaching the other two, they were 

               acquitted
            .

            . I was going to Billingsgate, I met Mr. Underwood and stopped with him a little; I had not parted with him a minute before he called and said, where is your handkerchief? I put my hand in my pocket and missed it, and said, don't be foolish, I cannot stay: he said, no, it is these chaps are foolish, pointing to the prisoner and a boy; he went and opened the prisoner's jacket, there was my handkerchief. (Produced and deposed to.)

            . I saw the prisoner at the bar at the prosecutor's pocket, and immediately clapped something under his jacket; I let him know of it, and took it out, and the prosecutor swore to it.

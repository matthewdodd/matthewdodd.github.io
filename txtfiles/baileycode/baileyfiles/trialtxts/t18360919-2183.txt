 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
6th of September, 41lbs. weight of lead, value 5s., belonging to

Philip Palmer and others.







ROBERT HINE
 (police-constable B 140.) I was on duty at half-past nine o'clock on the night of the 6th of September, in Vincent-square—I heard a noise at No. 44—I went there, and observed the prisoner on his hands and knees behind the house—the garden gate was locked—I asked what he did there—he replied, to ease himself—he came over gate—I took him to the station, and, with the sergeant, went over the premises—we found a quantity of lead taken from the porch, and we found this lead there—it seemed to fit exactly—there was a knife found on the top of the porch where the lead had been cut from, and two pieces of iron hoops.

Cross-examined by
MR. DOANE. Q. Was it not dark? A. It was rather dark—I could not have been mistaken in the prisoner's person, he was so near to me—I could see him on his hands and knees—I came up and looked through the paling, and saw him—I then went to the gate, and found it was locked—I called to him—the lead was about a yard from where I saw him.





PHILIP PALMER
. I have charge of this property under my father's executors—they are Mr. Abraham Harrison Dry and Mr. Stafford Dry.

Cross-examined. Q. The house was empty? A. Yes.

Prisoner. My clothes were down—I was taken very bad—I got over to ease myself.

Guilty.

(The indictment also charged a previous conviction.)





ANDREW TINLING
 (police-constable A 21.) I produce the certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from the Clerk of the Peace for Middlesex—(read)—he is the man.




GUILTY
. Aged 18.—


Transported for Seven Years.

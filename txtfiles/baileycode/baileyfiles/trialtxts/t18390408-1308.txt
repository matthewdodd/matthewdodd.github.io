MARY ANN EWINGTON
 was again indicted

for stealing, on the 
26th of March, 1 half-crown, the monies of 



James Perkins.






JAMES PERKINS
. I keep the Marquis of Wellington in Cornwall-street. St. George's in the East. The prisoner came into my service early in March—Mr. Newton gave her a character—we were dissatisfied with, her conduct, and on the 26th of March I marked some money, and amongst it tome half-crowns—I put it into the till—I missed some, and asked the prisoner to let me see her box—she went up stairs and shewed it—I then said, "Let me see what money you have?"—she pulled out of her pocket four half-crowns—three were good, and one was bad—one of the good ones was one I had marked, and put into the till—this is it—(looking at it)—I cannot say whether I lost any more.





SAMUEL HOOD
 (police-constable K 70.) I took the prisoner for the half-crown—on her way to the station-house, she said she was very sorry, but it could not be helped.




GUILTY
. Aged 19.—


Transported for Seven Years.

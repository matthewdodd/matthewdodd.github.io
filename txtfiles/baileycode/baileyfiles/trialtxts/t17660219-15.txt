            . On the 20th of January, about 9 at night, I was backwards, and nobody in the shop, I heard, I believe, the till strike against the door as they carried it out. I went to the door, and saw nobody: I went to see if the till was safe, and it was gone; then I desired a neighbour to call stop thief, he did, and the prisoner was taken in about a quarter of an hour, and brought to my shop by

            . On Monday night, the 20th of January, I was walking along Addle-street, at the end of Philip-lane, I saw the prisoner and another man running together, the other man had the till, or drawer; I looked very earnestly at him as he passed me: there came a little boy, and said they had stole a till; they turned up on the left hand, one went one way, the other another. I followed the prisoner, he went up Frying-pan alley, I took him in Staining-lane, and brought him back to Mrs. Dunbar. The other was a young fellow with his hair tied behind.

            . I am 16 years of age next April. I saw a couple of men at Mrs. Dunbar's door, she came to the door, and called stop thief, I have lost my till; I said to the last evidence, there they go; the prisoner, as I believe, and another man, were running together; he pursued and took the prisoner at the bar.
Prisoner's defence.
My father is a shoemaker, I work along with him. I was going to my aunt's at Westminster. I met a young man at the bottom of Grub-street, he asked me to drink; we went and staid till nine, then I was going away by myself, I ran up Philip-lane, and was going for Wood-street, and they took hold of me and brought me back.
He called William Hall, his father,

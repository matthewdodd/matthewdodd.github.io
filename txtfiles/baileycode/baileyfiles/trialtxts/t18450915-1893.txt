DANIEL PARKER
. I am a carpenter, and lodge at a public-house in Ropemakers-fields. On the 18th of Sept, I had two planes in some buildings in Abbott's-fields—I missed them within half an hour—I went to a pawnbroker's, in Stepney, to inquire for them, about ten o'clock in the morning, and found the prisoner there with the planes in his possession—he had one in his hand with my name on it—I did not know him before—I had spoken to Jarvis the policeman.





MARK JARVIS
 (policeman.) I followed the prosecutor, and saw the prisoner run out of the pawnbroker's shop, when the prosecutor went in—I ran after him, and caught him.

Prisoner's Defence. I did not steal them; I found them.





THOMAS WATKINS
 (policeman.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction—(read—Convicted 10th June, 1844, of larceny, and Confined nine months)—he is the man.




GUILTY
. Aged 20.—


Transported for Seven Years.

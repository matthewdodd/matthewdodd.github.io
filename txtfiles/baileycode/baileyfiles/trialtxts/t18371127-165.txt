JAMES PAYNE
 and 



WILLIAM WEAVER
 were indicted for

 stealing, on the 
18th of November, 1 work-box, value 1l. 5s., the goods of 




Charles Minton.






MICHAEL CANTY
. I am an apprentice to Mr. Charles Minton, of New Gloucester-place, Hoxton, a tailor. On the forenoon of the 18th of November I was in the passage, and saw the prisoner Weaver run out with a work-box between his hands—he came from the parlour, and went out of the front door—when he was a few yards off Payne joined him—Payne was stopped, and Weaver dropped the box, and made his escape—this is the box—I had seen the prisoners a few minutes before, lurking about the door.





FRANCIS MOLLAND
. I live at No. 7, New Weston-street, Borough, and am a town traveller. I was in Myrtle-street on the 18th of November—I heard the cry of "Stop thief"—I turned, and stopped Payne—Weaver dropped the box, and made his escape.






HENRY DUBOIS
 (police-sergeant R 14.) Payne was given into my custody—I afterwards apprehended Weaver in Easton-square, Clerkenwell.

Payne, I was coming out of Gloucester-street, and going down Myrtle-street I heard the cry of "Stop thief," and ran, and was stopped—I never saw the other prisoner before.





MICHAEL CANTY

re-examined. I am quite sure that payne joined the other boy—they were together previous to the robbery—they stood together at the door—I was taking some dung into my master's garden, and I saw them within a few yards of where I stood—they were there three or four minutes before Weaver ran out with the box—Payne was at the door—they ran off together, and he got the start of him—I did not see them speak together.

             wereindicted for 


               stealing, on the 7th of February
, one till, value 1 s.; one piece of foreign copper coin, value one farthing, and 2 l. 12 s., in monies numbered, the property of 
                     
                        Margaret

                  , in their dwelling-house
            .


                  JOHN 
                  HILL
               



            . I live at No. 1, Great White Lion-street, Seven Dials


, the house belongs to my sister Margaret Hill, and myself, we keep a shop

 there. On the 7th of February, about half-past seven o'clock in the evening, I missed my till - I was not in the house at the time; there was between 2 l. and 3 l. in it; I am quite positive there was more than 2 l., it consisted of silver and halfpence, and some farthings, there was one farthing which I remember.
Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. The house is your mother's - A. The lease is in her name; the rent is paid out of our profits - I may be mistaken in the amount in the till.


                  MARGARET 
                  HILL
               



            . I know there was about 3 l. in the till. I had not counted it, but speak merely from the bulk - there was a halfpenny in it, which I knew. We are bakers. The female prisoner brought me something to bake; I went down into the bake-house with it, leaving her alone in the shop. While I was at the oven, I heard a smash, and on coming up stairs, she was gone, and the till too - I thought she was turning out of the door, as I went down.
Cross-examined. Q. They deal with you - A. Yes, and have lived next door four or five months. I was not above a minute gone down to the oven, and heard the till fall while I was down stairs.


                  WILLIAM 
                  COLE
               



            . I am a musician. I know the prosecutor's shop. On the night of the robbery, I believe I saw the prisoners come out of the shop; I was about five yards off at the time, he had the till in his hand - I believe him to be the man, I cannot positively swear to it. I saw a woman who had fell down, getting up, she followed him into the house.
Cross-examined. Q. You never saw him before - A. No. He came out, and went quick into the house. Hill's shop gave a good light. If I swore to him, I should not swear false.


                  MARY 
                  BAILEY
               



            . I was in the wash-house of my own house, and heard something which appeared to come from the street - I went to look, and when I got to the shop door, I saw Mrs. Hill at her private door; somebody came into the passage at the time, shut the door, and went up stairs. I keep the house the prisoners live in.
Cross-examined. Q. Was it a moment or two after the noise, that somebody came in - A. Yes. I have eight other lodgers - the prisoners occupy the front room, first floor.


                  THOMAS 
                  IRESON
               



            . I am the patrol. I produce the till which I found in the cupboard, next to the window, in the one pair front room, in Bailey's house - the prisoners were both there; it was the same evening, about half-past seven o'clock. When we were searching for the halfpence, the woman seized three or four, which we found on the table. I found a pail of dirty water in the cupboard; I said
"The halfpence are here," she said,
"My dear Sir, they are nothing but shells;" Hill said there was about 7 s. worth; I found 7 s. 2 d., and two farthings - Hill said he could swear to one of the farthings. I asked the woman if she called these shells, she said,
"I did not say they were shells, but tea leaves." I saw the constable find nearly 1 l. in silver, on the man, and some silver was found in a drawer.


                  SAMUEL 
                  COLLINGTON
               



            . I am a constable. I found 23 s. 6 d., in silver, in the male prisoner's pocket, and 6 s. in a drawer. I also found what they call a jemmy, and phosphorous box, in his clothes drawer - the jemmy is used to break open places. I found the till going up on the second floor; we took them in custody, and found 2 s. 0 1/2 d., in the room afterwards.


                  JOHN 
                  HILL
               



            . Here is one farthing, which, to the best of my belief, was in my till, three quarters of an hour before the robbery. The till is mine - I had not a farthing like it in my till, for three weeks before.
MRS. HILL. I swear to the till, and a dumpy halfpenny, which I am certain was in it.
Cross-examined. Q. Did you give the woman any change that day - A. I cannot say - I am sure the halfpenny was in the till, when it was taken.


                  THOMAS 
                  KENDRICK
               



            . I am a street keeper. I was present at the search. The man was asked if any one had been in the room, he said No.


                  SARAH 
                  SYMONDS
               



            'S Defence. They searched the cellar; we were down stairs half an hour, and when we came up, my quilt was torn off the bed, and all in confusion; they asked what was in the pail; I said tea leaves, and he found halfpence - I said,
"That is the consequence of leaving the room with no one in it." Several people live in the house. I do not see why they should suspect us.


                  JOHN 
                  SYMONDS
               



            'S Defence. There was a shilling nearly one hundred years old in my room.


                  THOMAS 
                  IRESON
               



             re-examined. There was nobody in the room or passage, but the officers; we left the male prisoner in the room, while we went down, and found him there, on coming up; she asked him if any one had been into the room he said No. There is a shilling dated 1758, among the money.


                  MARY 
                  BAILEY
               



            . There were several people about the street door, but I do not recollect that any one came in. I desired nobody should be let out, as Mrs. Hill said the thief had come into our passage. I think three or four of my lodgers stood on the stairs.


                  JOHN 
                  HILL
               



            . I believe I was the first person that entered the room; we went out, leaving the male prisoner there, and found him still there; he said he had not left the room.

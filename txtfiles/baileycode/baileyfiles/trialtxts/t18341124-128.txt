JAMES JONES
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
10th of November, 2 shillings and 1 farthing, the monies of 



Edward Cuthbert, from the person of 



Hester Ann Cuthbert.






HESTER ANN CUTHBERT
. I am the wife of Edward Cuthbert—we live in Turville-street, Bethnal-green. On Monday, the 10th of November, I sent my little girl to the baker's shop at the corner of the street, for a four pound loaf—I gave her half-a-crown, which was wrapped in sugar paper—her name is the same as mine—a boy knocked at my door, and said that a boy had taken it out of her hand—I ran down the court, but

could see no boy—the prisoner was afterwards brought to the door—I asked him if he had taken the money—he said, No, upon his soul he had not; but if his mother had got as much money she would give it me, if I would go home with him—my child lost two shillings and a farthing—the loaf came to 5 3/4 d—she is four years and a half old.





JAMES MOSS
. I remember seeing the little girl coming up Turville-street—the prisoner took something out of her hand, but I do not know what it was—it was in a paper—I ran to her, and asked what the boy had taken—she said, "Two shillings and a farthing"—I heard the prisoner say to her, "Wait there till I come back I will not be a minute"—he ran up a court—I went and told the lady.





EDWARD CUTHBERT
. I saw the prisoner when be was brought to my house—I asked if he had got the money—he said, "No"—I took him to the station-house—in going along, he said he had bought a cap for 1s.6d., and given 6d. to his little brother.





WILLIAM BEDFORD
. I am a policeman. The prisoner was brought to the station-house between six and seven o'clock on that evening—he said he took the 2s., and gave 1s. 6d. for a cap, and 6d. to his little brother—I went to his father's, and found the cap—this is it.

Prisoner's Defence. I did not take it from her hand at all.

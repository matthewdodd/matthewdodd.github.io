            . I am servant to Alexander Wilson, who keeps a shoe warehouse
, on Holborn-hill


. On the 22d of February, between one and two o'clock, the prisoner came in with another woman, and asked to see some shoes- I took down three or four pairs - they said they were in a hurry, and could not stop to fit them; the other said she could tell by her hand what would fit her - they did not suit, and I got three or four more pairs; Mrs. Wilson came into the shop, and showed them some more; I kept my eye on them, and saw the prisoner put one pair across her arm, and gradually draw them under her cloak; nothing would suit them, and as they turned out of the door I stopped the prisoner, turned her cloak aside, and found this pair of shoes in her hand: she said it was a mistake, and she was sorry for it - I gave her in charge.

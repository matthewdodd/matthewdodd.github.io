            . I am a linen-draper
 on Holborn-Hill


, the prisoner came to my shop and asked to see some book muslin, my servant attended her; I had some suspicion of her, I thought I saw her put something into her apron; she came into a back room where I was; I felt in her apron and found this piece of muslin (producing it) which is my property; the prisoner said, she had paid for what she had bought; she had bought an apron but it was not delivered to her. I sent for a constable and gave charge of her.
Prisoner's Defence.
I went into the shop to buy an apron, there were a great many pieces of muslin on the compter, I was looking at; the witness came to me and said, don't take that away, you have not paid for it.

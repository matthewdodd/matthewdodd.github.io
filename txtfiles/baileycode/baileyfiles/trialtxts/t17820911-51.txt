             sworn.
My house was robbed on the 8th of August, I was from home; I left the house five minutes after four, and went to Mrs. Cotton with intention to spend the remainder of the day; about a quarter before seven a servant came from Mr. Kinder to inform me that something very bad had happened at my house. I went home immediately, and the maids were crying, by that time I found every thing in the greatest confusion, I went up stairs, I found every thing thrown out of the drawers, the drawers open and the locks broken and every thing thrown about the room, I then went into the room where the prisoner Charlotte was sitting on the bed in the back room, nothing had been touched in that room; the moment she saw me she clung round my neck and said, my dear mistress, and repeated it two or three times over, I said Charlotte do not mind for they have not hurt you; I staid some time with her, and casting my eyes towards the ground I saw the buckles were out of her shoes, why said I, 
               
                  Charlotte
               


             I see they have taken your buckles, she said, yes madam they have; I did not at all suspect her at that time: when I went to dinner I left the prisoner Charlotte and

                   Studd
               



             in the house; I lost some silk out of a trunk in a closet in my room, it is a dark closet, and some part of it goes quite back, in this closet the trunk was as far back as possible; and things hanging over it.
On opening the door could that trunk have been seen? - No it could not.
Were the looks of all the bureaus in your apartments broke open? - Only in the front room, only where things of value were, no other locks were touched; I lost the things mentioned in the indictment to belong to belong to me (particularizing them), and several things which Mrs. Trehearn will speak to.
Court. What was the value of all those things together ? - Two or three hundred pounds; the money was in the bureau in my chamber; the principal part of the place was in the front chamber, some of it in a closet in the chamber where I sleep, this cupboard was full of spoons and some silver salts, there was also below stairs some gravy spoons and a waiter, and some spoons which we have constantly in use, they were carried up in a basket every night, and brought down in the morning, the basket had been brought down in the morning with the plate, and carried up again, the plate was always kept there, there were several knife cases, the spoons were taken out; I have at different times lost many things; I had missed money out of my bureau: Charlotte lived with me at that time, the other servant did not; I suspected her fellow servant that then lived with me; Charlotte had lived with me almost three years.

                   KINDER
               



             sworn.
I went to the house of Mrs. Fortescue about six in the evening, before I went in, I went to the kitchen door and window to get the servants to come and open the door to me, being intimate in the family I did not ring; I went to the kitchen window, I saw no servants, I was going back to ring, I discovered the hall door was open, I had been a riding, I gave a smack with my switch; I heard a female voice or voices, which I thought to be fits, and seemed as though some woman was knocking her elbows and head against the floor; I was going up, and I discovered this hanger upon the harpsichord, (producing a hanger) that rather alarmed me, thinks I there may be thieves above, and they may be murdering either the ladies or the maids, I went to a neighbour and said, I wish you would let me have your servants to go back to Mrs. Fortescue's, there was nobody at home at this neighbours, but the footman I sent to Mrs. Courteen's for some some of his servants, I followed the servants in, they rushed up stairs, and then called to me to come up, I went up stairs, and found the rooms in the utmost confusion, things tumbled about, I went to the maids, in came Mr. Cotton, Mrs. Trehearn, and Mrs. Fortescue; Mr. Cotton and I agreed to take the maids, and examine them separate, we examined Charlotte first, we asked her in what manner the thieves attacked her, says she I was sweeping the room, and they came to me, one of them said, I will do for you, (I think she mentioned two or three) because you gave your mistress an account we intended to rob the house a fortnight ago, and hit her on the breast, under the left side, with the but end of a blunderbuss (her breast was not examined) and then tied her to the bed-posts on the floor, we asked her how happened the little spots of blood on her apron, I think she said, she believed that came from her nose, there was no blood, but a few drops on the bottom part of her apron, says I, how come you tied, she told me, the men tied her, where did they get ropes; she said they had master Fortescue's skipping rope, she said they had robbed her, she had a valuable pair of buckles, Mr. Cotton and me examined the other maid, and found their two accounts vary very much.
Court. In what particular did they vary? - The other said she opened the door, a man knocked or rung at the door, and said he wanted her mistress, she immagined he wanted to look at the house which was to let, he had no sooner got in but one or two others rushed after him, and got possession, and obliged her to go up stairs, and shew them where the valuables were, one said a little after four, the other said between 4 and 5.
Court. That is much the same? - One said they were gone about half an hour ago, and the other said they were gone an hour or two ago, when we had gone through their examination, Mr. Cotton and I privately agreed to secure them, as parties concerned.
Court. I do not observe, Sir, in this account you have given any material variation in the accounts of the two maids, did they tell you at what time they were tied to their bed ? - I cannot recollect.

             sworn.
I am servant to Mr. Cotton, I was at home in the stable about my business, the day the robbery happened, I went to the house, and went up stairs, and I saw Charlotte tied in one room, and Betty tied in another to the bedpost; this is part of what they were tied with (produces a cord and a pair of garters) I turned myself round, and picked up a blunderbuss from Charlotte's side, I cut the string from Betty's legs and hands, and cut the string from Charlotte's legs, coming down stairs I picked up this chissel. (producing a chissel.)

             sworn.
I went into Mrs. Fortescue's house with the rest of my neighbours, I found Charlotte sitting on the foot of the bed, I asked her if she had lost any of her clothes, she said she believed not, she had not been up stairs to see, I asked her if they had taken her buckles, she said they had, I asked the other, she said they looked at hers, and they were not worth their acceptance; Charlotte said Betty opened the door, and came to her in the dressing room, as she was sweeping it, she said there were two or three with her, and three with her fellow servant.

             sworn.
I examined Mr. Fortescue's house; I was at work there, and I found a pair of buckles in the drain, at the bottom of the sink, we opened the drain, and in the mud I found one, and the bricklayer found the other in my presence, (it was a long way they had gone in the sespool, under the sespool that went into the kitchen.
Jury. Was there no grate? - There is none at all, there is room enough to run your arm down. (The buckle shewn to Mrs. Fortescue who said she believed it to be Charlotte's buckle.)

Where did you live in August last? - At Mrs. Goodall's house.

Who lives there besides? - Mr. Edmonds and I went to live there together; I know nothing of the robbery: in the afternoon about two o'clock, there was a girl which called her by her name, Bet Simpson; I saw Mr. Simpson, Mrs. Simpson, and Edmonds, and Goodall, the old woman; nothing particular passed: Bet Simpson came there between one and two, and asked Mrs. Simpson to lend her these cloaths, for she was going to be dressed in men's cloaths, that great coat was a part of them; they went out between two and three; Edmonds was at home, he went out about half after.
I understand you was going to be married to Mr. Edmonds ? - Yes, I was, and he desired me to say no other but what I was his wife, on account of his sister.
Had he any money then? - none but what from me.
he return? - Between ten was much in liquor, and in my lap; and he went to a public-house and ordered some beer, and there I understand he threw some money about, so he did when he came in again, and I seven guineas, five gold, the piece of larger than a guinea, I took it to be a thirty-six shillings piece; in the meeting he told me had received 8 l. of his own money, and that the half-crowns and that piece of gold was not his property. On Saturday his sister was to come; he went and bought me a new hat, and Mrs. Goodall and he went somewhere, but where I do not know.
Had you heard of the old woman being at Tottenham before the robbery? - No, Sir, I had not.
When were the cloaths brought back? - Either on Friday or Saturday, I am sure they were Edmonds's cloaths, they were lent to Mrs. Simpson, to dress herself in, and were brought back after the robbery.
What is become of Simpson and his wife? - I do not know.
Was the old woman present when the cloaths were returned? - Yes.
Did she know who had them? - Yes, she was in the house when Mrs. Simpson was dressed in them, and when they were returned.
PRISONER's Counsel.
How long had you lived with Edmonds ? - About eight days.
And did you in the course of eight days get so far at the depth of Edmonds's pocket to know what money he had? - No, Sir.
I understand you just now that you said he had no money but what you had seen; do you know any thing of that piece of money (shewing her a medal)? - I believe that is the medal that was shewn to me last Saturday night.
Who shew'd it you then? - I do not know; a gentleman sent for me and shewed it me then, he asked me if I could swear that was the same piece, and I said I could not; (looks at the medal) I do not think it is any thing like what I saw; ( the prosecutrix looked at it and said she saw nothing like that.)

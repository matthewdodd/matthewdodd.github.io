            . I live with a linendraper, at the corner of Fleet-market


. On the 9th of June, I was placing the goods in the window, and observed the prisoner drawing a handkerchief from a gentleman's pocket, whom I have not seen since; he slipped it between his legs, turned round and saw me in the window; I held my finger up to him, jumped out, and slipped out at the side door, and saw him running along the market, I called out stop him; he was stopped. I brought him back and took the handkerchief either from his hat or bosom; he said it was his first offence, and made no resistance. I do not know the gentleman; he did not perceive it taken.

THOMAS WESTBROOK. I am a labourer. On the 20th of June, I was standing opposite the hustings, in Covent-garden


, and saw the prisoners in company. Boyce took a silk handkerchief out of Mr. Bates's pocket, and gave it to Ruffen. I told him of it, and pointed the prisoners out to the prosecutor; he took one, and I took the other to Bow-street - He gave them in charge to an officer, who found the handkerchief in Ruffen's breeches. I had seen them in company before. The prosecutor attended before the magistrate, and swore to the handkerchief in the presence of the prisoners, they said nothing to it. I know the prosecutor's name is

                  Cecil Bates
               



            .
WILLIAM WESTCOAT. I am an officer. The prisoners were brought to me by Westbrook and Mr. Bates, who gave them in charge. I searched them, and found one handkerchief in Ruffen's hat, and another in his breeches, which the prosecutor claimed - I produce it.

                  , from his person

WILLIAM WHENT. I am a labourer
. On the 17th of July, about two o'clock, I was at the Three Compasses, public-house; I saw the prisoner and three other women there - I had seen the prisoner before; I remained there about half an hour: I had some gin and porter - I then went home with the prisoner, to some street near the Commercial-road


, and had tea - I went to bed with her, having wound up my watch and put it into my trousers' under my head; in about three-quarters of an hour I was taken sick, and she called a young woman, who brought some water - the prisoner then got out of bed; she had her gown half-on. I saw her take my money, but not my watch; she went out - I then got up, and missed my watch: which I have not seen since - I lost 14s. I was about an hour and a half with her, and am certain of her; I was quite sober - I suppose the heat of the room made me sick.

            . On the 18th of July, I found the prisoner concealed in a house, in a court; she denied having seen the prosecutor.
The prisoner put in a written defence, denying the charge - and stating that the prosecutor was intoxicated.

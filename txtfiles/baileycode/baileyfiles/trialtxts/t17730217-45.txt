            . I lost my watch in One Tun Court, in the Strand


. This girl took me to shew me a lodging; she pretended she would get me one. When I came to the top of the stairs, at one Mrs. Wixes's, she snatched the watch out of my pocket.
Q. What did you do there?
White. We did a little business; she snatched it out of my pocket and ran down stairs.
Q. Was this the lodging she said she would shew you to?
White. Yes.
Q. What are you?
White. A cabinet-maker
.
Q. Where did you see this woman to ask her to get you a lodging?
White. At the top of Bedford-street.
Q. Did you ever see this woman before?
White. Yes, many times.
Q. Are you sure you had your watch at that time?
White. Yes, because I put my hand upon it at the top of the stairs.
Q. Might not you drop your watch?
White. No; I made search for it but did not find it; she ran away.
Q. When did she snatch the watch out?
White. To the best of my knowledge between one and two on Sunday morning.
Q. This was after you had had your gallantry together?
White. Yes, immediately.
Q. from the Jury. Was you sober?
White. I was not drunk: I had been in company with shop-mates.
Prisoner's Defence.
As I was going home I met this gentleman and two girls; they asked me to go and drink with them; I went; they began to quarrel and so I went home. Ask him if he did not say the other girl with him had robbed him the week before of some money.
Q. Did you say that?
White. No; one of the girls with her had bilked me of some money before.




               Guilty of stealing the watch, but not privately from his person

             - the prisoner was our porter
 for three months. On the 25th of August we had suspicion, and before paying the men their wages we called them all into the warehouse - I taxed the prisoner with having some property about him belonging to us; he hesitated, but at last pulled out a bottle of gin - we sent for an officer, and gave him into custody; I said it was mine, and he did not deny it - the officer found the wine on him.

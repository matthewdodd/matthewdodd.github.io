JOHN SQUIRE
. I am journeyman to John Richard Cook, living in Beauford-terrace. He has a summer-house at the bottom of his garden—he had a mirror there, and on the 14th of December I missed it—this is it—(looking at it)—the summer-house was not locked up—it is within the curtilage of the house—the persons must have got over the wall.





AMBROSE CHANNER
 (police-constable S 137.) On the 14th of December, at a quarter to eight o'clock at night I was at the Pine Apple-gate, and met three lads going down the road towards Kilburn—I knew them by sight—we prisoners were two of them—I turned back and watched them—they turned up Abercorn-place to the fields, at Kilburn—I lost sight of them for one or two minutes, and saw something black against the wall—I went and saw the prisoner Alexander against the wall, and Clarke was inside, lifting the glass over the wall to him—I saw another person in the summer-house—I got over and took Clarke—the other ran away—Alexander was afterwards taken.


Clarke. The wall was not low enough to get over—I was there, but what the policeman says is false—I did not have it in my hand. witness Yes, you had it.

Clarke. I know nothing of this boy at all.

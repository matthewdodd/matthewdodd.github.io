            . I live in Somer's-town


, and am a cheesemonger
. I missed a piece of cheese on the 2nd of December, at a quarter-past five o'clock; I looked out, and saw the prisoners in a court near my shop; and at half-past five Welsh came and took another piece; I ran out, and took Kelly at the corner of the court - this piece of cheese fell from his coat; I had seen him and Welsh in company together - I then took both the prisoners to the station-house.

            . I am a Police-constable. I received the prisoners, and have the cheese; I asked Kelly how he got it - he said Welsh took it, and gave it him.

SUSAN CORKING. I am the wife of 
               
                  William 
                  Corking
               



            ; we live in French-alley


. On the 12th of June, I went out for some herbs - I returned in about ten minutes, and saw the prisoner come out of the door, with my bonnet in her hand; I said, "You have got my bonnet," and laid hold of her, but having my baby, I could not hold her, and she went away; I saw her in the afternoon at the corner of Cow Heel-alley - she ran away; I fetched Hands, and found her in Fore-street-buildings - I am sure I had shut my door, but did not lock it; I left it on the latch - it was the street-door; she must have lifted the latch - I took the bonnet out of her hand; I lost a whittle at the same time.

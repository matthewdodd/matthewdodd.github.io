            . I am a coal-merchant
, and live at Belvidere Wharf, Lambeth. On the 23d of July, about half-past four o'clock in the afternoon, I was in the Strand


, and felt a pull at my pocket, I turned round, collared the prisoner, and took my handkerchief from his breast.
(Property produced and sworn to).

                  DAVIS
               



            . I am a constable. I was over the way, ran over and took the prisoner from the prosecutor; I asked the prosecutor if he had robbed him; he said No; but he found the handkerchief in his hand.
Prisoner. Q. Did not the prosecutor ask you only to lock me up for two hours, and then let me go - A. Yes.
MR. STAHLSCHMIDT. It is perfectly false. I did not say he had not robbed me; but that I could not swear that I saw him take it out of my pocket.


                  THOMAS 
                  DAVIS
               



            . When I went up, I said, has he robbed you; he said No; he said,
"Do you know him; lock him up, and then let him go;" I kept him till seven o'clock, when the office was opened. I did not think he would appear.



               GUILTY

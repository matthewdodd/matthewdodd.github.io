            . I live in the Strand


; the prisoner and another soldier
 were going handcuff'd by my door, he had a brick or a tyle in his hand; he dashed it against my shew glass, and beat the glass to powder; I happened to be by it, I got up, and took hold of him; I did not miss any thing then; he said, D - n the glass: the corporal that was with him said, if I could go to the officer on the Parade, for we must carry him there, he would do me justice. After this I went back and missed a gold watch case chased, with a diamond button : I followed them to the Parade, and found Captain Salter: I told him the case, and ordered the Corporal to search him, which he did, and found the case before mentioned. (Produced in court and deposed to.)

            . There were four of us going at that time to be punished; the prisoner's right hand was handcuff'd to another's left; he threw something against the glass, and took something out: I saw something shine, and he put it on his right side. When the gentleman came, he was searched, and the case found between the waistband of his breeches and his skin.

Prisoner's defence.
I was going to be punished, and I was vex'd in my mind; I had suffered a great deal of punishment; I leave it to the Court.

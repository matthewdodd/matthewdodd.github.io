            , Esq; The prisoner at the bar was my coachman: He went from me to Dr. Powell. I gave these cloaths to Ray, who is now my coachman. The stable was robbed, and they taken away. I advertised them as lost, and the stable broke open, then Mr. Powell sent me a letter. They were found in his stable.

Prisoner's Defence.
I bought them of a man that goes about the streets for eighteen shillings.

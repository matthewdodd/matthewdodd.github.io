            . I live in Middlesex-court, and am a coach smith - on the 31st of July, I was standing at Mr. Large's door, in Great Queen-street, and saw the prisoner go into Mr. Ingram's, the coachmaker
, and go on the near side of a chaise, and take a lamp out, then come round on the other side, and take the other - I followed him to Drury-lane; and then told him, I thought he had gone far enough, and to come back, which he did, and put them into the chaise.
GERRARD M'KEAN. I live with Mr.

                  Ingram
               



             - these lamps were fixed to a chaise in his shop.

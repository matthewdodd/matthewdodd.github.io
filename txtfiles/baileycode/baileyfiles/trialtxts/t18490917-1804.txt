Samson Wertheimer, her master: having been before convicted.






HELENA WERTHEIMER
. I am the wife of Samson Wertheimer, of Greek-street, Soho—the prisoner was in our service nine days. On 13th Sept. I came down about a quarter or half-past eight, and could not find the prisoner—I afterwards missed three sheets, two gowns, three shirts, three chemises, two pinafores, and other articles—I had her taken into custody—this sheet, shirt, two gowns, and one petticoat (produced) are mine, and were in the kitchen before I lost them—I had no other servant but the prisoner.

Prisoner. One of the gowns I bought of you, and you kept my wages in part payment. Witness. I never sold her either, or kept back part of her wages.





JAMES DOHERTY
 (policeman, D 51). In consequence of information, I went to Newnham-street, Edgware-road, and found the prisoner in her sister's room—I told her she must consider herself in my custody, for stealing some of her master's property that morning—I found two gowns in the room—she handed me the sheet, shirt, and petticoat, and said she was going to take them to the mangle—on the way to the station she said her master knew she was taking them, and he was to come and see her at her lodging.





SAMSON WERTHEIMER
. I knew nothing about the prisoner having them.

Prisoner. He knew I took them away, and he was to meet me that night, at the corner of Soho-square. Witness. I never heard of such a thing—I deny it, on my oath—I did not know the night before that she was about leaving—I saw her the night before—I did not know she was going to take the things.





THOMAS MORTON
 (policeman, S 194). I produce a certificate—(read—Ellen M'Namara, convicted June, 1848, confined six months)—I was present—the prisoner is the person so found guilty.




GUILTY
. Aged 19.—


Transported for Seven Years.

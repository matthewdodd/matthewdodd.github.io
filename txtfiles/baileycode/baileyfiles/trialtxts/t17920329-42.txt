             sworn.
On the 17th of March I was going along Fleet-street


, the prisoner picked my pocket; I saw him do it; I pursued him, and in the middle of the coach-way he dropped it; I saw him drop it; I picked it up; I gave it to the constable; I never lost sight of the prisoner.
(The handkerchief produced.)
The CONSTABLE sworn.
I received a handkerchief from the prosecutor, which I gave him back again; it was such a handkerchief as this, but I cannot swear to it.
PRISONER's DEFENCE.
I was going along Fleet-street, and hearing the cry of stop thief! I ran, as others did, and the gentleman struck me with his umbrella, and almost knocked me down. I am innocent.

Mrs. Bacon. I am wife to 
               
                  John 
                  Bacon 
               



            ; we keep a grocer's shop
 on Holbourn-hill, opposite Hatton-garden


; we had occasion to suspect the prisoner, who was our porter
, and lived in the house, of having done something wrong; my husband and I agreed that I should be concealed in the counting-house, on Sunday the 10th of May, to make observation on what passed; the counting-house is parted off from the shop, in which the key of the shop is always kept; we can see from the counting-house every thing that passes in the shop; the prisoner was left in the care of the house; I was locked into the counting-house; my husband went out, and fastened the door after him; in a few minutes after the prisoner came down, and took a view round; he went to the door, to see if it was fast; upon that, he went up stairs again, and soon came down with a chair in his hand, and set it down, and got upon it, and put his hand through a pane of glass that was broke, and took the key off from an iron bracket, where it hung, and went and unlocked the shop door, and went into the shop, and behind the counter to the till, and took out some money. I heard it rattle, but cannot tell the sum. Then he took down a large cannister of tea, and filled a large paper bag with tea out of it; when he had done, he replaced the cannister, and brought the bag, and set it down, while he placed the chair again, and got upon it, and hung the key on the bracket again; then he took the bag of tea in one hand, and the chair in the other, and went up stairs; he staid there a few minutes, and came down with his hat on, and went out at the entry door, and pulled the door after him; it has a spring lock; he was gone about half an hour, or thereabouts; then he came in again, and went up stairs, and was there some time; in the interim there came an acquaintance, named Lyes, and knocked at the door; he came down; the person enquired whether Mr. Bacon or his wife were at home; he said, no; she asked where we were gone; he said he did not know; he seemed rather willing she should not come in; she came in; it was then I believe, pretty near six o'clock, the maid-servant came home about seven; I had bid her come home about that time, in order to release the porter; in a few minutes after she came in, and was gone up stairs, the prisoner came down with the paper bag of tea tied up in handkerchief; I saw the paper bag in it, and believe it to be the same bag he had filled with tea; (I had observed he had nothing in his hand the first time he went out;) he carried the bag out.
Q. Did the maid see him go out?
Mrs. Bacon, No, she did not.
Mr. Bacon. I got a constable, and took the prisoner in my shop on the 11th of May; I charged him with taking the tea; he would not confess for some time; I ordered the constable to take him back to the counting-house; when he found we had such positive evidence, he confessed he took about six pounds, but he soon did acknowledge the whole to an ounce; there was eight pounds and upwards; he owned to whom he had sold it, and directed me to the man he had sold it to, where I went and found it; the man and tea are here now in court.
Cross examination.
Q. Was there any promise of favour in order to this confession?
Mr. Bacon. I made him none, he acknowledged it free and open.


                  Richard 
                  Strekon 
               



            . I am the constable that had the prisoner in charge; at first he would not acknowledge to any thing. His master suspected he had some tea up stairs; we went up stairs; there he confessed he stole the tea mentioned, and sold it for 3 l. 18 s. there was some money in his pocket; he acknowledged that was part of the money he sold it for.
Cross examination.
Q. Did his master make him any promise?
Strekon. There was no promise made by his master; I told him, the only way to receive favour from his master was to confess.



                  Joseph 
                  Gurney 
               



            . I am acquainted with Mr. Bacon; I was at his house at the time the prisoner was taken into custody; he would own to nothing at first; when we were up stairs, we told him the circumstances of his taking the tea, he hesitated a little; then he said he did take about six pounds weight; I asked him whether there were no more; he owned there was more, and that he had sold it for 3 l. 18 s. he said there might be eight pounds, bare weight.
Cross examination.
Q. Was any promise of favour made him?
Gurney. I told him, if he made an ingenuous confession, very likely his master might favour him, so far as to lay it only as a single felony, which he has done.
Prisoner's defence.
I have some witnesses here to speak in my behalf.
For the prisoner.

            . The prisoner has subpoened me, but I do not know for what, I live near Mr. Bacon; I was by at the time he was taken into custody; I heard him confess to the taking the tea, and selling it for 3 l. 18 s.
Q. Did you hear any promise of favour made him?
S. Young. I never heard any promise, any farther than what Mr. Gurney has mentioned.

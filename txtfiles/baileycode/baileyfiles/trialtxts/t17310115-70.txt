                     Nathaniel

            , of St. George in the East



, were indicted 


               for stealing divers wearing Apparel
            , the Goods of 
               
                  
                     Daniel 
                     Saffery 
                  




                
             , the 5th of July
 last.
The Prosecutor depos'd, That his Goods were stolen, and found in the Possession of 
               
                  Anne 
                  Sparks 
               



            ; they were produc'd in Court, and he swore them to be his.
Anne Sparks depos'd, That the Goods were brought to her by both the Prisoners, and she bought them of them.
Hall pleaded, That he had been admitted an Evidence, and therefore ought not to be try'd for this Fact, which was committed before; but it appearing that he had not put this Fact into his Information, his Plea did not avail; and it being plainly prov'd, the Jury found them both 


               guilty to the value of 4 s. 10 d. each
            .

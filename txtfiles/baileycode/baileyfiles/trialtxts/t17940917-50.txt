             sworn.
Q. What is the firm of your house? - Robert Peele, the elder, &c &c.
Q. Does any of the partners live in the house? - None of the partners. I have a servant that lives in this house, but the house belongs to the partnership, I should say rented by the partnership.
Q. None of your partners sleep there? - None of them.
Q. To Bradley. Was the house of Peele's and Co. broke open? - The door was shut on the latch, the 23d of July.
Q. Who were in the house? - 
               
                  Josiah

            , PhillisSmith, the maid servant, and my self; I don't recollect any more. I was in the counting house, which lays at the back of the warehouse; I did not hear the door open, but hearing the russling of paper, I ran forward, and see the prisoner go out at the outer door; the door was shut when I left it. As soon as I had got to the front of the warehouse, I see him go out at the front door, and see goods under his arm.
Q. What time of the day was it? - Between the hours of nine and ten in the morning. I called out stop thief! and ran after him, till I came to the Old Jewry; and when I came to him, he threw down the goods.
Q. How long had you been in the warehouse before you heard the rustling of paper? - I was in the warehouse, in the counting house.
Q. How long was it after you left your other part of the warehouse, to go into the counting house? - Not ten minutes. When he chucked the goods down. William Batty and I stooped down together to pick them up; William Batty seeing me so near to them, he chucked them down again, in order for me to take care of them. I took the goods up again, and William Batty ran after the prisoner; I did not see any more of him till he was taken.


                  Q. 
               


            Had the prisoner any connection with your house? - No, nothing to do with it.
Mr. Gurney. You was in the counting house behind the warehouse? - Yes.
Q. You see somebody run out; did you see the face of the person? - I cannot say I saw his face sufficiently to know him again.
Q. You lost sight of him, I take it for granted? - I did not lose sight of his head, I never lost sight of him till he turned the corner, to go up to the court.


                  Q. 
               


            You did not see his face before he was taken, therefore how can you possibly swear that the young man is the person that you see with the paper under his arm, in the warehouse? - By the colour of his hair and coat.
Court. You kept him in view till Batty came up? - I did.


                  Q. 
               


            Are you sure that the man Batty went in pursuit of, and who threw down the muslin, is the man that you saw in your shop? - I did not see him in the warehouse, I see him go out, and I saw the goods when I got out, I did not see it before, on account of the wainscot being so high. I am sure that the door was shut, and I heard the rustling of paper; and when I went forward I saw his head, and when I got to the door I saw the; muslin under his arm; and he still kept the bundle under his arm, till I see him in the Old Jewry, and see him throw it away.
WILLIAM BATTY sworn.
I know the prisoner; I was present when Mr. Bradley came out in pursuit of him; he had a bundle under his arm, he threw it down; I was close to him when he threw it down; I got the bundle immediately, and gave it to

                   Bradley
               



            .


                  Q. 
               


            Who went in pursuit of him afterwards? - I immediately went after him; 
               
                  John
                   Woodrow
               



             was rather before me, and I went up the next, close to him.
Mr. Gurney. Whereabouts did you take him? - In Church-alley, Ironmonger lane.


                  Q. 
               


            While you stooped to take up the bundle, he must be out of your sight? - I never stopped half a minute; I never lost sight of him at all.


                  JOHN
                   WOODROW
               



             sworn.
I know the prisoner; I was in pursuit of him before Batty; I overtook him just as he got to the bottom of Church-alley, just in ironmonger-lane; I laid hold ofhim, and he fell down on the ground, I dragged him two or three yards, before we could make him get up, and then we took him to Mr. Peele's shop, and downed on his knees, and asked him to forgive him.


                  FRANCIS
                   OSBORNE
               



             sworn.
I was at my own house when I heard the cry of stop thief! and I ran out and pursued the prisoner into Church-alley, and there was Batty and another dragging him along; I went with him to Mr. Peele's warehouse, and I had the charge of him and this parcel; it is what the prisoner had; I have had it in my custody ever since.

                   REES
               



             sworn.
I am the warehouseman; this muslin is the property of Peele and partners.
Q. What is the value of it? - Twenty pounds and upwards.
Mr. Gurney. How do you know it to be the property of Peele and company? - By the private mark.
Q. You have no patent for that mark, for ought you know your next door neighbour may make use of that mark? - They may; it has a pencil mark, a private mark of our own.
The prisoner called four witnesses who gave him a good character.

                  Johnson 
               



             , on the 20th of September, I lost a silver watch off a chest of drawers out of my bed-chamber; and when I came down, I found the back door open and upon the jar: I advertised it the next day, and Mr. Herring brought it to me, and told me he had bought it of 
               
                  John 
                  Morris 
               



            .
Q. Do you know the prisoner?
Johnson. I know him, because I saw him in Newgate.
Q. Did you know any thing of him of your own knowledge?
Johnson. No; Mr. Herring told me, he bought the watch of Morris, and that he told him he bought it at Chatham ; he said afterwards, he bought it of a man that was going to Chatham , and desired I would not do him any harm. Mr. Herring had heard of a man that was found concealed in a house at Wapping-wall, and he knew him to be the man he bought the watch of.
Prisoner. Did you ever see me before that time in your Life.
Johnson. No.
Q. Pray my lad what trade are you? [here the prosecutor was stopped.]
Mr. Herring . On the 22d of September, between 4 and 5 in the afternoon, the prisoner came to my house [by alderman Parson's brew-house] and offered to sell me a watch; I asked him where he had the watch from; he said he was a sailor just come from Guinea, and had money to receive, but he must sell the watch; and he told me he had some gold dust to sell; I told him I did not understand Gold dust, and would not look at it; I look'd on the watch, and asked him what he would have for it; he said it cost him 3 l. at Chatham ; I told him I would give him 45 s. for it; it was worth about that, for the watch was dirty, and the dial-plate was hardly to be seen; and I told him when he had received his money he should have the watch again for 5 s. more. When I found the watch was advertised, I carried it to Mr. Johnson, and he gave me the 45 s.
Q. Do you know the prisoner is the man?
Herring. I know he is the man, but I do not know that I saw him before; some of the people said he was a dangerous fellow; and that some Irish fellows would rescue him, he being an Irish man. When he came to my shop, he appeared very remarkable with his face scratched: he brought the watch to me the very same day it was lost.
Q. Can you give an account how you came by this watch?
Prisoner. I bought it of a sailor, at the three tuns at Greenwich.
Q. How long was that before you offered it to this Gentleman?
Prisoner. About 12 o'clock in the day.
Q. What was his name?
Prisoner. I did not ask his name.
Q. What ship did he say he belonged to?
Prisoner . He said he belonged to the Monmouth, Captain Harrison, a 70 gun ship.
Q. What day was it ?
Prisoner. It was upon a Thursday, last Thursday was a month.
Q. Are you sure it was upon a Thursday?
Prisoner. No, my lord, it was upon a Tuesday.
Q. What Tuesday?
Prisoner. It was a month yesterday *.
* The watch was not lost then, it was not lost till the 22d of September.

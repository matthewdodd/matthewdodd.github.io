                     John 
                     Ellis 
                  



                
             and 
               
                  
                     William 
                     Armstead 
                  



                
             , of St. Giles's Cripplegate



, were indicted, the former for 


               feloniously stealing divers Goods
            , the Property of 
               
                  
                     Dinah 
                     Hawks 
                  



                
             , the 16th of January


 last, and the latter for 


               receiving them, knowing them to have been stolen
            .
It appear'd by the Evidence, That the Goods were stolen by the Prisoner Ellis, and that they were found at Mr. Armstead's, where they had been pawn'd; therefore the Fact being plainly prov'd against Ellis, the Jury found him 

               guilty
             of the Indictment; but it not appearing that Armstead knew them to be stolen, the Jury 

               acquitted
             him.

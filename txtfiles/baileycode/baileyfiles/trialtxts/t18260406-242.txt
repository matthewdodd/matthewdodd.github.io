. On the 1st of April, about a quarter before four o'clock, the prisoner and another came in - I served them with a pint of beer - they drank it, and gave me half-a-crown to give change; I sent my wife up stairs to get it, and in the mean time the prisoner went into the yard; my man had some suspicion, and missed the gown from the yard, where it hung just before - he followed the prisoner into the tap-room, and said, "He has taken something off the line in the yard" - I collared him, took off his hat, and found the gown in it - he said he was very sorry, and it was his first offence.

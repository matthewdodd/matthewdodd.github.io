THOMAS YARROW. The prisoner came into my service last Saturday afternoon, and, before I was up on Sunday morning, she had decamped; the property stated in the indictment was missing, part of which was in her room on Saturday night; I saw the bonnet upon the drawers, at six o'clock on Saturday morning, myself.

            . I am a hair-dresser, and live in Piccadilly. On Monday evening I and a constable went with the prosecutor to a house in Wardour-street, Soho, to a second floor - the constable went first; the prisoner came out of the front room; the constable said, "Does Mary Ann Hale live here?" she said, "My name is Mary Ann Hale;" there was a person in the back room ill - the bonnet was there; another woman went in to fetch it; the prisoner went into the room once, and wished to go again, but the officer would not let her - the other woman brought us out the bonnet, and a pair of shoes; the prisoner at first said she had never seen Mr. Yarrow, and had never been near his house.

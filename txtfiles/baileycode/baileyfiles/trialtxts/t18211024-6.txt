 - I now live in Winchester-street, London-wall. The prisoner came into my service, at Phoenix-street, about Easter last. On the 30th of March, I left the house. I missed a great deal of property from the house, from time to time, in a trifling way.

            . I succeeded Humphries at the house, in Phoenix-street. On the 30th of June, when I took possession of the house, I paid him 23 l., among which was a 10 l., note, I wrote my initials, and the name of the man I took it of, in full length on it.

            , re-examined. I received a 10 l. note from Smith, I wrote his name at length on it, and thought I put it in my pocket, and in the morning I found the two 5 l. notes, which I received at the same time from him, in my pocket, but not the 10 l. I keep my bed-room door locked, I meant to put it in my pocket, with the other two but I am not sure that I did.
Cross-examined. Q. When you received it, you put it all in your pocket - A. Yes, and when I got into my back parlour, I took them out, marked them, and put them in again. I had not been out of the house before I missed it.

            . I am an officer, of Worship-street. In consequence of information, I took the prisoner in custody, at Mr. Fuller's, Islington; where she was in service - I asked if she had any pocket on, she said, No; she was going to put her hand down, I found she had one on, and three keys in it, I asked her what keys they were, she said, her aunt's, who lived in Vine-court, Spitalfields. As I brought her along, she said, she was innocent - she then said, the keys were those of her boxes, which were at her aunt's, but that her aunt knew nothing of what she had taken there. After taking her to the office, I went with Mr. and Mrs. Fuller, to Vine-court, Spitalfields - I opened one trunk first with this key, it contained a great quantity of linen; I found a tea caddy, a metal watch, a seal, a glove, a 10 l. note, and 14 l. 6 s. 6 d., in silver, shillings, sixpences, and half-crowns.

            . This is the note Smith paid me on the 30th of June. I lost a great deal of money - I first missed silver, and spoke to Holland, my bar-maid, about it. The tea caddy and watch are mine, I have had it twenty years, I lost it off my mantle piece in the bed-room, before the 30th of June.

             were indicted for 


               stealing 628 pieces of silk handkerchiefs, containing 4800 yards, value 800 l. the property of the 
                     
                        East
                         India Company
                     




                  , privately and secretly in their warehouse
            , Dec. 25.


A second Count charged it as a stealing on the 26th.
And a third Count as on the 27th of Dec. +
The witnesses were examined apart at the request of the prisoners.
Mr. 
               
                  Peter
                   Corbet
               



            . I am the keeper of the Bengal warehouse at the East India House.
Q. What is the use of this warehouse?
Corbet. It is solely appropriated for the reception of prohibited goods, because the crown does not suffer any other goods to be mixed with them. By prohibited goods are understood all goods that are painted or stained, and wrought silks; they are received into the warehouse, are shewn there to any buyers, and when sold are delivered to the buyers; from thence they are sold by auction, which all the companies goods are, which by act of parliament are sold at the East India House, by inch of candle.
Q. Is it the kind of warehouse that all buyers have access to at proper hours?
Corbet. Yes; from eight in the morning till two at noon; buyers or not buyers have access there; it is a common public show; samples are shewn of some goods; indeed all these particular goods are shewn open in chests; but these that were stole never had been shewn. The warehouses are open during the times of sale, which are in March and September, but are constantly open for reception from the ships and delivery to the buyers. I was informed on the 29th of December, that this warehouse had been broke open; upon examination I found that in the chest of bandannos, which are spotted handkerchiefs; under the No. 19 was invoiced 200; they were all gone. In No. 6, the same kind of goods, invoiced 138 pieces, 46 lost; of silk lungee romalls, which are a check handkerchief, No. 8, invoiced 200 pieces, lost 198; new o malls, they are a check handkerchief, a new fabrick, No. 17, invoiced 200, lost 184; in the whole 628 pieces lost; there were invoiced upon the whole 738; there are 110 remaining, that brings the loss to make up the full account of the invoice.
Q. What is the worth of the pieces?
Corbet. 246 pieces of bandanno which run about 1700 yards, the value of them at 20 s. a piece (they sold at the company's sales from 20 s. to 28 s.); the romalls I value at 30 s. they sold at the company's sale at 34 s. 6 d. the value in the whole is about 800 l. The company's resident at Bengal puts a ticket into the chest, of the contents of the chest; these two tickets (producing them) were found in the warehouse; they exactly correspond with the invoice of those chests.

            . I am a king's officer, and attend at the warehouse in the India-house; the warehouse goes all round the leather market at Leadenhall. I left the warehouse on the 24th of December, about a quarter after two o'clock; we never attend in an afternoon: there is a stair case goes up into the warehouse from Leadenhall-street; there is a lock of the company's at the bottom of the stairs; there is a door on the middle of the stairs, of which the Company has a lock and the king a lock; there is a door at the top of the stairs, which has the company's lock, and there are two locks more before you can come to where the goods were taken from; I saw the outside locks fastened; the folding doors on the outside had not been unlocked some time; they are only open to receive goods from shipping; the buyers go up stairs at another door; there are two other doors besides; we generally look at them before we leave the warehouse; on the 24th I locked the doors, and tried them and found them safe.
Q. When did you go to the warehouse again?
Mason. On the 29th at eight o'clock as usual. I saw the gunnies of these chests cut, and the boards wrenched off; gunnies are a coarse cloth put over the chest; I put my hand into one chest, and there were but two lungee romalls remaining; I saw the ticket that is put into the chest at India; the next chest had nothing in it; the next had I think about twelve or thirteen pieces of new romalls; the fourth was a chest of bandannoes; there seemed to be a good many out of it, I cannot justly tell how much might be taken out of it. I found one ticket in one of the chests and I left it there. All the goods in this warehouse are exported by certificate, and one of us is obliged to go down to the waterside with them.

            . I am one of the king's lockers. We leave this warehouse generally at two o'clock; I had been to the keys on the 24th of December; I returned before two; I fastened the outer door which comes down to Leadenhall-street, the door we go in at, that goes to the staircase; I went round the warehouse and looked at every one of the doors; the king's locks and the company's locks were on; the goods were all very safe then. On the 29th an alarm was given, while I was there, that the warehouse had been robbed; I went down and saw the padlock was broke off the door, and the other lock wrenched; I found one chest open; a little further I saw another chest with the gunnies cut, and the boards were broke off; most of the contents of that chest were gone; I cannot be particular how many pieces were remaining; I found, a ticket a little further on the ground which agreed with the marks on the gunney; a little further I saw the third chest which was broke open, and most of the contents were gone; and upon the left hand coming back there was another chest broke open, about one half of the contents of which were gone. I found the king's lock on the outside the warehouse safe, except these folding doors to the inner market; the company's and king's locks were both on; I went round and put the king's key to them and the lock was safe, but the inside fastenings of these two doors, two bolts, were broke off; the padlock was broke off, and the other lock strained and bent. There was a piece, I think it was of bandanno, upon the ground; I believe also there was a piece of bandanno between the door and this chest.

                   Gray
               



            . I am an extra-tidesman.
Q. Do you know the three prisoners?
Gray. Yes; I have known 
               
                  George
                   Armstrong
               



             very near two years, 
               
                  Robert
                   Armstrong
               



             about a year, and Cotterell not quite so much. I believe about two months ago, I was walking along Leadenhall-street, with Robert and 
               
                  George
                   Armstrong
               



            ; when we came to Creechurch-lane, there is a warehouse with a pair of gates, George said he could take off that lock; said he, do you know what warehouse that is? I said, no; he said it is the East India Company's warehouse; I said did you ever rob the India warehouse; he said yes, last year of some black tea; I said did you ever rob the bale warehouses; he said no; do you know which are the bale warehouses? I said I believed I did; they asked me to shew them I shewed them the warehouses that goes in at the great gate; I told him I saw a cart with bales, which I imagined to be muslins unload there: that is the warehouse that was broke open: George looked at them, then he came to me and said it shall be done; there were two locks on them; one with a broad R, one not; after that we had a pot of beer at the Woolpack, in Michael's-alley; then George said he had robbed the warehouse in that alley; and they said if they did this they would make me a present; I said I do not want any thing, only take care of yourselves: I take this to be about the beginning of November. I saw George on the 26th of December, about nine in the morning; he was just gone to bed. I came from Wapping Old Stairs; I called on him.
Q. Had you heard of any goods being stolen then?
Gray. No. He promised to come and see me; I saw him again on Thursday the 31st of December; I went to his house, having read the advertisement, that the India Company's warehouses had been robbed of 680 pieces, and that 100 l. reward was to be paid to any person that would discover the persons that did it. I went down to 
               
                  George
                   Armstrong
               



            's house in Gre at Garden-street, Whitechapel, between nine and ten in the morning; he was at home; he began to laugh, and said, Joe, it is done; I understood him; I said nothing but sat down to breakfast; then he sent his girl to tell Cotterell that I was there, and Cotterell came after I had breakfasted; we staid there about a quarter of an hour; then we went out. Cotterell left his stick behind him; he went back for it; then George Armstrong said to me, Joe, what is best to take for my share of the handkerchiefs? some are checks and some spotted, what they call bandannoes.
Q. Had he before that told you what had been taken?
Gray. No; I told him if he would let me look at them I could tell him; he said I am afraid that my brother and Will Cotterell will split against me, by which I understood him to turn evidence; he said they had shared the goods; I asked him how much they had a piece; he said six or seven dozen a piece, and that they had agreed with themselves for each to give me three pieces; I said I do not want any; he said I should; then George and I went to the Three Johns, in Fashion-street, to Robert's lodgings; we saw him a bed; he lodged there then, but removed that day; there was a pistol loaded to very near the top and primed; George scolded his brother Bob for having it in the room. I had no talk about the robbery till the Friday night (New-Year's-Day); then we were all together; we came away and left George behind us; then Cotterell said to me, D - n my eyes, Joe, George is the greatest blackguard that ever existed. I thought with myself here is a pretty set of you, you are all afraid of one another, and I shall come into a pretty scrape for shewing you the warehouse; 
               
                  William
                   Cotterell
               



             said George had the Doves; that I understood to be the keys we went to 
               
                  George
                   Armstrong
               



            's, and Cotterell went down and brought up a mug of wine as one would small beer.
Q. When had you any conversation respecting the robbery?
Gray. On Saturday morning the 2d of January I went to Cotterell's lodgings, and then he and I went to Bob's lodgings; we went to the Red Lion; some people were reading the news concerning the East India warehouses; George went away; Bob got shooting for some beer. I went with Cotterell to dinner; he said, Joe, George has bargained with 
               
                  Jack
                   Shurbut
               



             to let him have a 100 pieces for 100 guineas, for he said George had sold him a few pieces the week before; I replied, why you tell me some are worth two or three guineas a piece; he said Shurbut was a good one at planting them, therefore they let him have them; he said there was none concerned with him but George and 
               
                  Bob
                   Armstrong
               



            ; he said George wanted to take in another, but Bob objected to it; he said I will give you three pieces for me, and three for Bob. That night I thought I would clear myself of all of them; I went to Mr. Lycet's, a custom-house officer, to ask his advice; Cotterell told me a Jew had been at Sir 
               
                  John
                   Fielding
               



            's and pretended to know of it but did not, and Sir John sent him to gaol; Mr. Lycet advised me to go to Sir 
               
                  John
                   Fielding
               



            's directly; I went there accordingly, and gave the same account as I have given now; this was about six o'clock; I went at seven o'clock to 
               
                  George
                   Armstrong
               



            's; he was not at home; then I went to Cotterell's; he told me he would bring his and Bob's there, to the Cock and Hoop at the corner of Dunk-street; I went then and informed Mr. Bond of it; he sent Mr. Senhouse to the Cock and Hoop to watch; when they came to me I went there; 
               
                  Robert
                   Armstrong
               



             and Cotterell came there; Armstrong had the six pieces in a handkerchief: when Senhouse saw them he went out; we sat down in a box; Cotterell said, Joe, these are three pieces for each of us; Cotterell swore I should sing; I said I would not till after he had sung; he sung a song, and while I was singing one, Sir 
               
                  John
                   Fielding
               



            's people came in, and secured them; then we went and took 
               
                  George
                   Armstrong
               



            , at the Three Johns, in Fashion-street; then we went and took Shurbut at the Horse and Leaping Bar.

            . I live in Whitechapel: I know all the prisoners. On the 27th of December last, in the morning, 
               
                  George
                   Armstrong
               



             came to my house, and asked me if I wanted any handkerchiefs; I told him to bring a sample; he brought me four pieces about eight or nine o'clock; he asked me what I would give a piece; I said 24 s.
Q. How many in a piece?
Shurbut. Seven; of some sort more. He said if I would take a quantity I should have them for a guinea; at night he brought me eight pieces; I asked him how he came by them; he said he got them out of the India house in Leadenhall-street, by the Leather-market; I asked him who was with him; he said his brother and Cotterell, and no one else; I asked him how he got in; he said by a key which cost him 10 l. I agreed to buy them; he brought me six dozen pieces more in two separate parcels at twice. I saw two or three men at a distance when he went away; I was not near enough to know them; I asked him who they were; he said I had no occasion to be afraid, it was his brother and Cotterell; he came next night and brought me two dozen and one piece of striped handkerchiefs; I did not agree for them but he left them. On Tuesday morning he came and asked me if I had got any money for him; I said I had not; I had nine dozen and one piece in all; he came to me again on Saturday and wanted me to take a 100 pieces more; he said they had quarrelled and had parted the pieces among them; I told them I did not chuse to have any more.
Q. What became of those pieces you had?
Shurbut. I sold some of them; Justice Fielding's men had the rest.
Q. Did you pay any money for them?
Shurbut. No; I only agreed for them.
Q. Who brought these pieces?
Shurbut.

            . I am clerk to Sir 
               
                  John
                   Fielding
               



            . Mr. Gray came to me on the 2d of January, about five in the evening, accompanied by Mr. Lycet, an acquaintance of his, and made an information of the persons who stole the goods from the India-house; he said he had appointed to meet them that evening at the Three Johns. I ordered Gray to go with Mr. Lycet; I called 
               
                  Peter
                   Senhouse
               



             in, that Gray might know him again; I desired Gray to go to the Three Johns, and told him I would be at the Frying-pan, in the same lane, and I bid him, if they came, make some excuse to come out, and inform me of it; he came in about half an hour, and said he had seen Cotterell who had agreed to meet him at the Cock and Hoop, in Coverly's-fields; I then went to a public house near to it, and appointed 
               
                  Peter
                   Senhouse
               



             to stay at the Cock and Hoop, till he saw them come into the house and then come and inform me; he came to me in about half an hour; I went to the house and there I saw 
               
                  William
                   Armstrong
               



             and Cotterell sitting in the same box with Gray; I saw a handkerchief containing something by Armstrong's side; Mr. Clark who was along with me has got it; after some resistance we took them into custody; I secured George at another public house, where I found him asleep. Gray mentioned to me that Shurbut was to purchase an 100 pieces; I went after him and found him at the Horse and Leaping Bar, in Whitechapel, at about one in the morning, and took him home; he was examined before Sir John next morning, and was admitted an evidence. I went to Shurbut's house; there I saw Mrs. Cole, who lives in his house; Mrs. Cole came in soon after I was there; I sent her to find the handkerchiefs; she brought back ten pieces; I sealed them up by themselves as soon as I received the ten pieces. They described the house where the others were, in King Edward-street, not far from Armstrong's; there was a padlock on the door; I drawed the staple, went up stairs, and there I found 385 pieces, which I delivered to Mr. Corbet; Shurbut producing 94 in the whole, 15 and 79. I took care of the padlock. On their examination at Sir 
               
                  John
                   Fielding
               



            's, George said he had given that key to his wife which was then produced by Simmons or Smith; that key opened the padlock that was found upon the door.
Mr. Corbet. I saw this parcel made up by Mr. Bond.
Bond. Here is my seal upon it; this is the same as I delivered it to Mr. Corbet. (Parcel of lungees and romalls opened.)
Mr. Corbet. There is 16 handkerchiefs in this, 15 in the new romalls.
Q. Are these the sorts that were lost out of the India warehouse?
Corbet. They are; I know them by their colour, by their measurement, by their weight, and by every sign and token.
Counsel for the prisoners. These may be run goods for what you know.
Corbet. I cannot take upon me to say. (A parcel of bandannoes produced under seal.)
Mr. Corbet. Here is the East India Company's mark upon these pieces.
Counsel for the prisoner. If a sailor brings any from India, have not they the Company's mark on them?
Corbet That is a trade I know nothing about; I have seen a piece that was run, I did not see the Company's mark upon that.

                   Simmons
               



            . I found this key upon Mrs. Armstrong (producing a large padlock key.)

                   Smith
               



            . This padlock (producing it) I got from the door where Mr. Bond and I found the handkerchiefs. (The key is tried with the padlock, and fits it exactly.)

                   Cole
               



            . I went by Mr. Bond's desire to Mrs. Armstrong's on Sunday evening; Mr. Shurbut was taken on Saturday night; I told Mrs. Armstrong I came from Mr. Shurbut, who desired her to send him 10 or 20 pieces of handkerchiefs, which he wanted immediately for a person in the country; she took me with her to the house; the door had a padlock on the outside, which she opened, and gave me 10 pieces of handkerchief in a check apron. I brought the handkerchiefs to Mr. Bond at Mr. Shurbut's house.
Bond. I brought them home and delivered them to Mr. Corbet's deputy.

            . About six on Saturday evening the 2d instant, I went with Mr. Bond to the Frying-pan, I believe in Brick-lane; after waiting some time Gray called Mr. Bond out; we got into a coach and went to a public house in Spitalfields; Mr. Senhouse came there, and gave notice to Mr. Bond that the prisoners were at the public house; we went to the house; there we saw the youngest of the Armstrong's and Cotterell; we secured them; we found these six pieces of handkerchiefs ( producing them) in the box by Cotterell and Armstrong; they were all three singing when we went in. I searched them, and found six pistol bullets in Armstrong's pocket (producing them.)
The apron containing ten pieces produced.
Mr. Corbet. These are bandannoes and romalls; there are the Company's marks upon them.
Mr. Clarke. Mrs. Cole shewed us the house from whence Mr. Armstrong brought the handkerchiefs; we went there and broke the door open. We found five bags foil of handkerchiefs, containing I believe 360 odd pieces; we gave directions to Mr. Smith to search Mrs. Armstrong for the key of the padlock; we went to Shurbut's house on Monday night by his direction, and brought away 79 pieces more.

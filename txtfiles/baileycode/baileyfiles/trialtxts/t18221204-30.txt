            . I belong to St. Thomas's Hospital




. The prisoner was a patient there, and after being convalescent, he was employed to assist me in the surgery. On the 29th of November, about one o'clock, I went out leaving him there - this property was in my bed-room up three pair of stairs. I locked my boxes and the door, and put the keys in the surgery as usual. I returned home, at half-past one o'clock, expecting to find him there, but he was gone and did not return. When I went to bed at night I missed the articles mentioned in the indictment. I found him that night, at the Star, public-house, opposite the East London Theatre, and all my things were found on him.

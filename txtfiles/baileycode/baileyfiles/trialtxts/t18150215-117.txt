            . On the 9th of January, about six o'clock in the evening, the flannel was standing in the flannel rack in the shop, I was behind the counter; I saw the prisoner come into the shop, and lay hold of a piece of flannel and run off with it. I immediately pursued him, and took him, with the flannel under his arm; this is the flannel, there is twenty two yards of it, it cost my master twenty two shillings prime cast. I took the prisoner to the watchhouse, and delivered him and the flannel to

             the constable.

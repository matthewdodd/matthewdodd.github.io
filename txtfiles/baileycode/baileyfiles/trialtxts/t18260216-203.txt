GEORGE GARDNER. I live at Feltham


 - I lost some bundles of quick - I had seen them safe on Wednesday week, about six o'clock in the evening; six bundles were in the ground, and three in the cart. I missed them on the Thursday night.

            . I live at Teddington, three or four miles from Feltham. I bought eight bundles of quick of the prisoner on Thursday week, about seven o'clock in the morning; I showed them to Mr. Gardner the next day, who claimed them. The prisoner said he had not brought the quick according to the sample he had shewn me, as his father had sold all that, but he had brought some of a similar kind - he had sold it me by sample on the Tuesday evening.

            . I apprehended the prisoner - he said before the Magistrate, "All I have to say is I stole it from Mr. Gardner."

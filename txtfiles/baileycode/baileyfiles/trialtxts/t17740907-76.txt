            . On the 21st of July, about twelve at noon, as I was passing under Newgate


, I felt something at my pocket; I turned round and seized the prisoner with my handkerchief in his hand; he dropped the handkerchief, and as I was stooping to take it up, he got from me; I pursued and took him at the corner of the Old Bailey.
- Woodfield, the constable, who was charged with the prisoner, produced the handkerchief, which was deposed to by the prosecutor.
Prisoner's Defence.
There were five or six lads by; one of them threw a handkerchief, and it came against my breast. The prosecutor laid hold of me and said I had picked his pocket, and went to strike me with a stick, so I got from him.

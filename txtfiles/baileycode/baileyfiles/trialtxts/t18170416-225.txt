            . I am a patrol belonging to the Public Office, Bow-street. On the 2d of April, I met the prisoner, on Saffron-hill, with a bundle. I watched him into a house kept by Mrs. Kenton, on Mutton-hill - I went in there, and caught him offering the articles stated in the indictment, for sale. He said his sister sent him to sell them, and told me her name. I went into Lilley-street, and found a person of that name, who said she did not know him.

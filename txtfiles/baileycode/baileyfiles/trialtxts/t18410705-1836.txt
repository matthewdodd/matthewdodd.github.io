ROBERT POLLOCK DAVIDSON
. I live in Newport-street. On Monday afternoon, the 28th of June, about one o'clock, I was walking down Brick-lane, Shadwell—I felt two or three persons press against me twice or thrice—I stopped, felt my pocket, and my handkerchief was gone—I had had it safe four or five minutes before—the witness Page gave me information—I followed the prisoner, and gave him into custody—the handkerchief has not been found—I am sure the prisoner is one of those who pressed behind me.





JOHN PAGE
. I was in Brick-lane on the day in question, and saw the prisoner walking behind the prosecutor—he drew the handkerchief from his pocket, and gave it to a young man who was with him, and who stepped back and got away—the prisoner crossed the road—I informed the prosecutor, and he was taken—I am sure he is the person who took the handkerchief.

Prisoner's Defence. I was coming from the Docks, where I had been

to see if I could get any thing to do; he never saw me take the handkerchief; I did no such thing; I had no man with me.




GUILTY
.* Aged 18.—


Transported for Ten Years.

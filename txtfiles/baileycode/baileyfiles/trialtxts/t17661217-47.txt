; I saw the prisoner in it; I stood and watched him, and saw him take some tobacco out of a hogshead on board her, and throw it into his boat, which was fastened to the lighter; when he saw me, he jumped out of the lighter into his boat; I went after him; he said, d - n me, Sir, if you do not keep off, I will destroy you; upon that, I called for assistance; he tumbled over board; his boat being jammed in, he could not get her out; we took him out of the water, and put the tobacco into a bag; it weighed 25 pounds; it is the property of

             and I were comeing through St. James's-park


, when we met with the prisoner at the bar. 
               
                  William 
                  Hayman 
               



             gave her money to be concern'd with her.
Q. When was this?
Sise. It was on the 29th of Dec. about half an hour after 1 o'clock at night. After that I felt her hand in my pocket, and missed 1 l. 19 s. 6 d. out of my bag.
Q. Who did it belong to ?
Sise. It belonged to 
               
                  William 
                  Hayman

                  Woodard 
               



            , and myself, we being fellow servants. It was Christmas box money. There was in the whole 4 l. 16 s. but when I told it over there was only 2 l. 16 s. 6 d.
Q. Did you see any money in the prisoner's hand?
Sise. No, I did not; but as I was going to take her out of the park, I saw her put forth her hand to the centinel, as though she was going to give him money. The justice was not to be spoke with that night, so I took her to the watch-house at Covent-Garden, and the next morning before justice Fielding, to whom she owned she had pick'd my pocket of something; but could not say how much.

            . I keep the watch-house in Covent-Garden; I search'd the prisoner at her being brought in, and found some money upon her, and she produced some more from out of her bosom to the amount of 1 pound 8 shillings.
Prisoner's defence.
As I was going through St. James's-park I met with this man and another; they asked me where I was going: I answered, Home. They wanted me to take them with me: I said I could not. Then they asked me if I could take them some where else: I said no, I could not. Then this young man said, if I would let him go and lie with me, he would give me some money. He shew'd me some silver, and desired me to lie down on the grass: I said, no, I would not. He said if I would lie down he would give me some more: then I lay down, and he lay with me. When he had done he called for the other man to come and lie with me: He came, but I would not let him; then he pulled me down, and I call'd out. After that the man that is here said I had rob'd him; but he gave it me to lie with me.
Prosecutor. I did not lie down with her, neither did I give her any money. I believe my fellow servant was concern'd with her for his 6 d.




               Guilty of stealing, but not privately, from his person
            .

            . I am a watchman, in Short's-gardens, Drury-lane. I know the house rented by Duggin. A woman called to me, on the 13th of March, about a quarter past one in the morning; I opened my lanthorn, and crept into the passage; I saw the prisoner pulling the pipe up, it was cut at both ends, he was in the yard with the pavement up; when he saw me, he left the pipe, and attempted to get over the wall; I pulled him down, and secured him; he had not doubled the pipe up; I doubled it up to bring it here; the pipe came out of the dwelling-house, and ran along a wall to a water butt. I took the prisoner to the watchhouse. When I saw the prisoner in the yard pulling the pipe up, he was the only person in the yard.
Prosecutor. The pipe was affixed to the dwelling-house.

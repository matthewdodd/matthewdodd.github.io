            . On the first of May, about twelve at night, I picked up the prisoner in George-yard, Whitechapel


; I agreed what I should give her for the night's lodging, and went to bed with her; when I was asleep she got up and picked the rest of my money out of my pocket; there was nobody else in the room; I waked about ten minutes after twelve and she was gone; I took her about half after one in a passage, and took her to the watch-house; she was searched, and the money found loose in her pocket and the purse on the ground beside her in the watch-house. There was one shilling which had two dents in it that I can swear to.

            . The prisoner was brought to the watch-house and searched, and the money found upon her, and the purse lying by her. There was a new sixpence, and a shilling which had two knotches in it, which the prisoner said was his.

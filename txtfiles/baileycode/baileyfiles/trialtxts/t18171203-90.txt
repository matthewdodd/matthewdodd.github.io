            . I am an officer. On the 5th of November I saw the prisoners walking about Montague-street, and saw Conner go down the area; Reily waited at the top of the steps; he came up again, and spoke to Reily; they walked away, returned again, and Reily went down, he came up again, and gave the box to Conner. I secured them, and found three keys, three knives, and some wires and strings on Reily, which are used to hook things out.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

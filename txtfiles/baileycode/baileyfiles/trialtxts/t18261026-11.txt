            . I went down into the kitchen, leaving the boots in the parlour, about half-past seven o'clock; I returned in a very few minutes, and saw the prisoner go out with something. Nobody else was at home - I called out, Stop thief! and ran after him; he was stopped before he got out of my sight, with my husband's boots; he was a stranger to me.
Prisoner. Q. Did not another person give them into your hands? A. I took them from his hands myself.

Prisoner's Defence. Several people ran, I ran as well, and when I came back, she stood at her own door and said, "That is the man;" I had no boots in my hand.
MRS. WATTS. I never lost sight of him - I have a lodger - he was up in his own room.

            . I am a butcher, and live at Cowcross; I saw the prisoner go behind the Highgate errand-cart, and try to cut the baskets away; he left it, and went to 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Peters
               



            's cart, followed it, and tried to cut a hamper away; he then jumped on the shaft, and took a great coat out - Owen and I took him. The prosecutor claimed the coat in the prisoner's presence, at the watch-house.

            . I saw the prisoner in company with another, about a quarter before six o'clock, in St. John-street; he tried the cart, then turned round, and followed the prosecutor's cart - the man was leading his horse, as it was a foggy night; I saw the prisoner take the coat out of the cart, and secured him with it - he said it was his own. The prosecutor came to the watch-house, and claimed it in the the prisoner's presence - he described the coat.

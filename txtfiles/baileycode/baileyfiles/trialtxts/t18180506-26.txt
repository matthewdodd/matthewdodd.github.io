            . I am a tobacconist
, and live in Shoreditch. The prisoner was my servant
, and employed to carry out parcels and receive money for me. I always send a bill of parcels with the goods. I had him apprehended on suspicion. He sent for me next morning, and said he would give me an account of what he had received. He said he had received 13l. 15s., among which was 1l.9s. from Mr. Simmons - He had never accounted to me for it, but said it was not paid. The receipt is his hand-writing.

            . I live with Mr. Jones, a linen-draper
, in Oxford-street


; on Tuesday the 13th of November, about four in the afternoon a man informed me a person had run away with some cloth, and shewed him to me; I pursued him down Warner-street, and saw him drop the piece of cloth down an area; he was about twenty yards before me; I still pursued him; he went into a little court; there he stopped, and I took him; I never lost sight of him; the prisoner at the bar is the person; we went to the area and got the linen; I do not know the man that assisted me; he was a stranger; we have not seen him since.

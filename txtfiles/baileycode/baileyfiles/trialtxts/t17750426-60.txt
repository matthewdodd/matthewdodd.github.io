            . I keep a public house
 at Chelsea


. On the 6th of March, my wife who had been at London, came home in the afternoon; we went into the parlour, and missed twenty guineas out of the bureau; by carelessness, my bureau was left unlocked, and the key lay upon it. The house door was not locked, because it is a public house, and a thoroughfare; but the door of the parlour in which the bureau was, was locked up, and my wife had the key of it in her pocket; when she came home she missed the money, and asked me in a great fright what I had done with it. I advised her to make no noise about it, and we might probably hear of it again.

            , one of my lodgers, seeing a cloud upon our countenances, enquired what the matter was, and said considering what had passed the day before, she wished the chimney sweeper had done no wrong; upon which my wife and I went into the parlour in order to see whether there were any tracks of this chimney sweeper or no; when we came in we observed the tracks of a footy foot, from the chimney to the bureau. The chimney that was in the back building, that

             live in, had been swept the day before, and therefore I concluded it must have been the chimney sweeper's boy
 that had stole my money. I went to Sir 
               
                  John
                   Fielding
               



            's, and he sent after the boy, he was taken up, and made a confession; that confession was taken in writing, but it is not here.

            . I lodge in the back building in Mr. Parkinson's house; my chimney was swept the 6th of March, there were some peculiar circumstances attending the sweeping of it; this boy, the prisoner, came about two or three in the afternoon, and begged very hard for leave to sweep my chimney, in order to get the foot; he said, he had got but half a bushel of foot, and he was obliged to bring a bushel home, or else his master would beat him; he begged leave to sweep my chimney; I gave him leave; he went up once, and continued a long time, then he came down, and brought but little foot. I observed that, and said the chimney was not so foul as I thought it had been. Said he, the other part of the foot is lying up in a part of the chimney, I must go up again. I refused at first to let him go up, I said that as there was a slit in the chimney I was afraid he would burst it out; he said he would go up, and up he went; I put something on the fire to prevent his burning of his feet: he staid up a great while that time; when he came down again, a pretty great quantity came, and down tumbled this candlestick, (producing it) that astonished me. I thought it an odd place to find an iron candlestick in; I knew it immediately to be my landlord Parkinson's candlestick that they burnt a candle in their chimney, for purpose of watching a sick child.

             and another woman with me, let him go off, not in the least imagining at that time, he had been in Mr. Parkinson's room.
Prosecutor. This candlestick stood in our chimney ever since last Christmas, on account of a sick child we had in the room, therefore we burnt a light at night in that iron candlestick. I set it upon the hub of the chimney. It is all one stack of chimnies between mine and the back building, Simmonds lives in the two buildings joined, so that any one that goes up one chimney might easily get down the other.

                   Quickley
               



             confirmed the last witness in the former part of her evidence, but said, that they both went out of the room before the prisoners came down the second time.
Prisoner's Defence.
I am quite innocent of the fact.
Witness. He said, before the justice, that his master had got a great part of the money.
The prisoner called his master, and his master's wife, who deposed, that they never lost anything by him, that he had been a very serviceable boy to them, that he had brought home seven or eight shillings a day. They appeared in a very indifferent light to the court: they mentioned several suspicions they had laid under, from a great number of other people, of which they said they were innocent.
He called two other witnesses, who gave him a good character.




               Not guilty of breaking and entering the dwelling house, but guilty of stealing the money
            .

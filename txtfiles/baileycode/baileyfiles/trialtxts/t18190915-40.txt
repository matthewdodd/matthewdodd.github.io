            . On Monday last, the 13th of September, about half-past five o'clock in the afternoon, I was a few doors from Camomile-street


, when a young woman said I had been robbed. I looked round, and saw my watch in the prisoner's hand. I seized him, and took it from him, and an officer came and took him.

            . I heard a bustle, and went to Louis, who had the prisoner. I found the watch in his left hand.
Prisoner's Defence. I am sorry for it; I got into bad company - this is my first offence.

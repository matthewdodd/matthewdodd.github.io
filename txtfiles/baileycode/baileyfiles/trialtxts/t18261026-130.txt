FREDERICK HOPKINS. I am a linen-draper
, and live in Broadway, Westminster


; this cloak hung three feet within my shop. On the 14th of October, about a quarter to eight o'clock in the evening, I heard something torn from the door; I went and missed this cloak, and saw the prisoner about fifty yards off with it; he dropped it - a sweep jumped out and knocked me down - I lost sight of him; I saw him again next day, and believe him to be the man.

            . I saw the prisoner about seven o'clock, looking in at Mr. Jones, the pawnbroker's shop; I watched him to Mr. Hopkins's shop; he went in two or three feet, and took the cloak - I followed and saw him drop it; I took it up; I knew him before, and knew his name.

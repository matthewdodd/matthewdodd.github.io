. On the 28th of April, I was in my back-room and heard the cry of stop thief! I went out and saw the prisoner, Quin, in custody, and three pieces of my pork lying on the ground. I lost seven pieces.
ROBERT ATKINSON. I saw the prisoners, with a man, near Bell-wharf, attempting to rob a baker's shop - I followed them down to Fore-street; Kennedy had something in his apron, and said, "We will have some morepresently." One of the others went into the shop and brought something out, I laid hold of Quin, and three pieces of pork dropped between him and Owens. I secured Owens also. Kennedy was taken afterwards.

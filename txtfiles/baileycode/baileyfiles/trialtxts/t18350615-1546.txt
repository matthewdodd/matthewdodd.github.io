JOHN SADDINGTON
. I am governor of the Poor House, and vestry-clerk of Woodford. The prisoner was a pauper in the house for seventeen years, in and out—on the 22nd of May I made up a parcel, which contained a sovereign and a half-sovereign—I secured it upon a card, and inclosed it in a letter—I indorsed it," Parish money"—it was sealed up, and directed to Mr. James Pamphilon—I told the prisoner it contained money, and he was to take it to the Post Office at Woodford—he was not to put it into the box, but to give it into the hands of the post-master—I discovered, in about an hour and a half afterwards, that he had not delivered it—I did not see the prisoner again—when he was at Bow-street he asked me to forgive him, and said, he would never do so any more—he had been brought from Dover in custody.





JAMES PAMPHILON
. I never received the letter or money.





DAVID DERWARD
. I am assistant-overseer of the poor of Woodford. This money was the property of the overseers—the prisoner was sought after, and could not be found—his name was put in the Hue and Cry,

Prisoner. I went to Dover—I own what 1 have done.

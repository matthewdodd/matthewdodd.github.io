MARY KEMP
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
20th of Feb., 1 pair of shoes, value 4s., the goods of 



Joseph Ward, and that she had been before convicted of felony.






SARAH WARD
. I am the wife of Joseph Ward—he is waiter at a tavern—I keep a shop at Greenwich—I lost a pair of shoes from one of the shelves behind the counter—they were my husband's, but he has been confined, and not out for this month—the shoes were safe at eleven o'clock last Monday when I went out, and when I returned, about a quarter past eleven o'clock, they were gone—these are them—I never saw the prisoner till about ten that morning, when she came to ask for a ready-furnished apartment at my house.





JOHN DELINE
. I am a pawnbroker. The prisoner pledged these shoes with me last Monday morning, before twelve—I am sure she is the person—she came afterwards to pledge another article and was detained.





BENJAMIN PRIOR
 (police-constable R 194.) I went to the pawnbroker's and took the prisoner about two o'clock last Monday—I told her it was for stealing a pair of shoes—she said she was sorry for it.

Prisoner's Defence. Two persons asked me to go and pawn these shoes, which I did—they gave me 6d. and the ticket.





SAMUEL EDWARD FREEMAN
 (police-sergeant R 3.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got at Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 31.—


Transported for Seven Years.


Before Mr. Common Sergeant.

             sworn. - I live at Dog-row, Bethnal Green


: On the 26th of November last, I lost 40 fowls out of my hen-house in the yard; the prisoner has been a servant
 to me; I saw his smock frock bloody about two o'clock the next day, and feather down stocking upon it, and in his hair; I asked him where he had been working, he said with a cow-keeper at Bow, but could not tell his name; I told him about my fowls, and I said I could trace two people with nails in their shoes; I desired him to hold up his foot, he said he had no nails in his shoes, but I measured his shoe, and it corresponded exactly having nails in it; I asked him who was with him; he denied any knowledge of it; I got an officer, and he was taken; then we got to his lodgings, and found four fowls, but I cannotswear to them, as they were plucked; I had lost upwards of forty.
COOMBES sworn. - I am an officer, and apprehended the prisoner; when the fowls were found, he said he was very sorry, and owned he had stolen the fowls.
Prisoner. I have nothing to say.

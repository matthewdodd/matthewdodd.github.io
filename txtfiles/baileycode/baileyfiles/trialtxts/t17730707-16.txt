            . Before my wife came down, at six o'clock in the morning, the door of the area hole in my cellar was lifted off the hinge; the cellar joins to the tap house; by that means they got into the house; I found the bolt of the sash put back, and the till broke open, as I apprehend by the lock being pushed down by a pen knife.

            . I went to bed last, about twelve at night; I am sure I bolted the sash that night; as to the tap room door, that goes into the cellar; it is always left open; I am not sure the door of the area hole was bolted; that night I left five shillings in the till, and locked the door in the bar; in the morning the halfpence were lost.
- Porter. Vickers said before Justice Wilmot they got in twice by the cellar window; the two first times he said they took a quantity of halfpence, about 30 s. Read said he had been with him twice; he had about 8 s. in halfpence; he was very ill.
The prisoners, in their defence, denied the charge, but called no witnesses.

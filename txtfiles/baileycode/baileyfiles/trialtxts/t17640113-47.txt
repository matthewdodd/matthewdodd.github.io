            . I lodge in Channel-row, Parliament-street


, at the house of Mr. Evans. I went out on the 3d of January, and returned the next day, and then I missed the things laid in the indictment. The prisoner lay in the house.
Q. Was she a servant?
M. Holland. I cannot say whether she was a servant or not. Mr. Evans found her with my things on her, except one shift, on the Saturday following, in Half-moon-street; the other shift was found in her lodgings. (The things produced, and deposed to).
Prisoner's Defence.
This gentlewoman told me, I was very welcome to put on them cloaths every time I went out. I had been enticed away from my service in Tyburn-road, and she knew how badly I had been used, and she said I was very welcome to any thing she had that was suitable to go out in.
M. Holland. I told her she might wear them, if she asked me.
Q. What station was she in?
M. Holland. I do not know: I believe she has been but a very little time in the house.
Q. Had she ever borrowed any thing of you?
M. Holland. No, she had not; neither did I lend her these: I was not at home when she took them.

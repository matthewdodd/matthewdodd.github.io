 on Saturday the 10th of last month, between one and two o'clock, when I mist my handkerchief of my pocket; I had it there a few minutes before; I receiv'd it again from the hands of Mr. Butcher, who can give an account of the Prisoner's taking it.

            . On Saturday the 10th of November, I observ'd the prisoner at the corner of Swithins Alley, attempting to pick a person's pocket; I endeavour'd to watch him; the gentleman went through the Alley, the prisoner and another person followed him; they made several attempts to pick several pockets, at the north gate of the Exchange. I saw the prisoner put his hand into the prosecutor's right hand pocket, and take out this handkerchief: it was produc'd in court, and depos'd to by the prosecutor ; I took hold of him, and told him, I had watch'd him about five minutes, and now I had got him; he said, it was the first fact he was ever guilty of; I held the handkerchief up, and the prosecutor own'd it.
Prisoner's Defence.
I had been in the city about a little business; I came through the Change, and I saw that handkerchief upon the ground; I took it up, and was going away with it, and that gentleman laid hold of me, and said, I had pick'd a gentleman's pocket.

Stevens. Last Friday was Sen'night, the 14th Day of this Month, I went to Leadenhall-Market


 with some Pork to sell, and I sold six Pigs to Mr. Edge . In about five Minutes Time I turn'd to see it they were all safe , and I missed one Side. I was making Enquiry about it and Mr. Simson said, he saw a Man carry away a Side of Pork . We cry'd out, Stop Thief. The Prisoner turn'd round and threw it down.

            , Constable ) What have you to say against the Prisoner?
Hulse. On the 14th Day of February I was going off my Duty ; and hearing an Outcry , I turn'd back again. I look'd which Way the Prisoner should come, and saw him shoot the Side of Meat off his left Shoulder. He had got a Knot on his Head at the same Time. And we took him up directly and had him to the Compter.
Q. What Meat was it ?
Hulse. They told me Pork, but I did not perceive what sort of Meat.
Q. What became of him? Who took him up?
Hulse. I took him my Lord, and had him before Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Barnard 
               



            . He could make little or no Defence but that he was hir'd to carry it.


                  Q. 
               


            (to the Prosecutor) Had you sold this Pork?
Prosecutor. Yes.
Q. You had not deliver'd it.

Prisoner. When the Man that hir'd me heard the Cry of Stop Thief, he ran away and left me with the Meat.

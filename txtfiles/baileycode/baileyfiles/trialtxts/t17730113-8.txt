            . The prisoner was cook maid
 in our family; she was more particularly servant to Mr. Jones who is the house-keeper. When I searched Sumner's box, I entertained a suspicion of the prisoner; I thought there was a good deal of intimacy between them; I got the constable to search her box, and there we found the things mentioned in the indictment, (which were produced and deposed to by the different prosecutor.)

             the constable deposed that he assisted in searching the prisoner's box, where they found the things that were produced.
The prisoner, in her defence, called a witness, who deposed that Sumner told her a fortnight before the prisoner was taken up, that he was married to her, she called another witness who gave her a good character.

            . I am a bookseller
, and live in Tudor-street


. On the 9th of November I missed these books, about nine o'clock in the morning, when I came down stairs; I first noticed a vacancy on the shelves; they had been a good way in the shop, and had all been secure when I went to bed the night before - my boy, who was in the shop, said they must have been taken while he was taking down the shutters.

             (Police-constable H 1.) On the morning of the 9th of November I saw a hackney-coach come and stop by the toll-bar, in the Commercial-road - the prisoner got out, and went down Morgan-street; he came back, gave the coachman something, and took a bag out of the coach, containing these books - I followed him down the street, into a brothel; I asked what he had got- he said his own property; I looked, and found these books; I said he was my prisoner - he came with me some distance quietly, and then made great resistance; but with assistance I got him to the station.

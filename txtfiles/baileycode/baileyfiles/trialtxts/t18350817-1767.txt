JAMES DAVIS
. I am apprentice to Mr. William Wright; he lives in

Cobourg-road. I was holding his horse and gig in Mile-end-road, on the 18th of July, when the priosoners came up, and Whiteman asked me to take 1d. for my job—they then began to pull the horse about, and Baker ran behind the cart—I then missed the jackedt and apron from the cart—I said "I had been robbed"—Whiteman said, "If you say I robbed you, I will jump your b—y guts our" I had seen this jacket and apron in the gig—there were five or six others with the prisoners.





HENRY THOMAS DALLEY
 (police-sergeant, K., 23) I was passing Mile-end-road, and saw a crowd—I took the prisoners, and found the jacket and apron under Baker's arm.

Whiteman's Defence. I did not take the things—I was talking to some boys, and they said they had got something—one of them threw the jacket at me.

Bakers's Defence. I did not have the things, and should have had none of the money.
---- CASTLE. I have known Baker three years—he always bore a good character.

COURT. Q. Do you think you must have known if any thing had happened to him? A. Yes; I live about half a mile from him—I have seen him constantly three or four times a week—I have seen him once a week every week; and he has always borne a good character, and never was away for any time—I do not know that he was in the House of Correction.

Q. Have you not heard that he was there for a little offence. A. He was. (This witness was committed.)

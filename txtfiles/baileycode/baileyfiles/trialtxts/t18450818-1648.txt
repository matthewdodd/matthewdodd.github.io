ENOCH TAYLOR
. I am in the employ of Samuel Botson Aldred and another, woollendrapery Aldgate High-street. On the morning of the 14th of July, in consequence of information, I ran out of our shop to Houndsditch—I saw the prisoner carrying this piece of fancy tweed, containing twenty-one yards and a quarter—I called "Stop thief," and saw him stopped by the policeman—this cloth is my master's—it was in the middle of the shop opposite the door.

Prisoner. Q. How far was I from you when you saw me with this? A. About thirty yards from me.

COURT. Q. Are you sure he was the person carrying it? A. Yes—I recognised it under his arm—he was running.





ISAAC FLORY
 (City police-constable, No. 509.) At half-past eight o'clock that morning I saw the prisoner running down Gravel-lane, Hounds-ditch, towards me—I took him—he said, "Why do you stop me? I haw done nothing"—I took him back to the corner of Gravel-lane, and found this cloth in the direction which he had come.

Prisoner's Defence. I went to the London Docks to try to get work; I did not succeed; in coming down the Minories a boy broke a milk jug; I ran off, and was taken; if the man were here who gave him information that the shop had been robbed, it would not he said to be me; he roust have lost sight of me, and anybody else might have put the cloth down.





MICHAEL CONWAY
 (police-constable H 138.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, by the name of James Spencer, which I got at Mr. Clark's office—(read—Convicted 6th Mayt 1844, and confined six months)—he is the person, and he has been twice summarily convicted since.




GUILTY

Transported for Seven Years.

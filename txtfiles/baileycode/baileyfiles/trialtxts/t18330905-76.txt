. On the 6th of August the prisoner came and wanted to look at a lot of articles; she looked at four pairs of snuffers, some tea-pots, and other things; she bought nothing but left the shop; I then missed a pair of snuffers - she was afterwards brought back and the pair of snuffers was found on her; it is one of the pairs I had shown her - she said she hoped we would let her go.
Prisoner. I asked the price of a Dutch-oven; he said his father was at tea; I said I would take the snuffers, and return in a quarter of an hour. Witness. No, you did not; I did not know you were going to take them; I did not know you had them till Mr. Garton brought you back - she afterwards said she would pay for them.

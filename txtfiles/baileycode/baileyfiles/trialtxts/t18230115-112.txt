            . About the 31st of October, I lost a table cloth and two pillow cases from a drawer in my lodging, in Swan-alley, St. John-street


. The prisoner slept with me at the time; she came to live with me on the 5th of September. I told her I missed them; she said, another person in the house must have taken them. I found the duplicate of them in her purse.

Prisoner. I have nothing to say to it; she took a sovereign out of my pocket when she found the duplicate.

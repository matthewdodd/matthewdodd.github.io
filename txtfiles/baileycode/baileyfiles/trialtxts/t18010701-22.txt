             sworn. - I am a shop woman to Mr.

, No. 95, East Smithfield


: On the 12th of June, about seven o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came into the shop, and asked for some check; I went to shew her some, I suspected she meant to take something; she took the calimanco into her hand, it laid upon the counter; she did not know that I saw her take it, but I was looking at her at the time she went out of the shop, and I went after her, and called for assistance; I told her she had got some calimanco; she denied it twice, and when I insisted upon it that she had, she threw it down upon the shop floor, (produces it); I am sure it is Mr. Willymott's.
Prisoner's defence. I had been drinking a little; I sell fish in the street; it is the first thing I ever did.

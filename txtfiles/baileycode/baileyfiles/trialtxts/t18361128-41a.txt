REBECCA ALLEN
. I am the wife of James Allen, and live at No. 4, Star-court, Compton-street, Soho. The prisoner lived with me nearly three months—I have missed a petticoat and a sheet; being very ill, I could not search for it, but the prisoner being taken for another robbery, the officer found duplicates of my property in her box—this is my property.

Prisoner. Mrs. Allen never saw the sheet in her life. Witness. I know it by a large seam in it, which was made by a little girl in my bar—I know the work—the petticoat she owned to taking before the Magistrate—I missed it—the duplicate was found in her box.

ANDERSON. I am assistant to Mr. Sowerby, a pawnbroker This sheet was pledged by a person on the 6th of September, in the name of Ann Smith. I cannot say it was the prisoner.





THOMAS HERDSFIELD

JOHN EDWARD NEADES
. I am a pawnbroker. I produce the petticoat—this is the duplicate of it.

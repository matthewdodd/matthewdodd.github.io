            . I am the wife of William Corby - I keep a shop in Earl-street, Lisson-grove


. On the 30th of August I saw both the prisoners at my counter reaching over, as I was in the wash-house speaking to my daughter; I ran into the shop, and called out that I was robbed - I heard some halfpence rattle; I seized Grogan, but White had the halfpence - I found on White some halfpence and a wooden bowl; my daughter came, and opened the door; a person said, "You have thieves in your house, and another has ran away; I will send the Police" - the Policeman came, and down Grogan's trousers he found these books, which are mine - the bowl and halfpence had been returned to the till.
White. Q. Did you take the bowl out of my pocket? A. No, you took it out on my insisting upon it - you did not deny it.

GEORGE DARLING
. I am servant to John George Crook, a butcher, in William-street, Lisson-grove. At ten minutes past twelve o'clock on Saturday night, the 4th of May, I saw the prisoner take something off the block—I went after him, and asked for the beef he had taken from the block—he said he had not taken any—I took it from him—he tried to get away—I took him back, and my master gave him into custody—it is my master's, and corresponds with the piece I had missed.

Prisoner. Q. Was there any mark on it? A. No.

Prisoner's Defence. I picked it up on the pavement away from the door.




GUILTY
. * Aged 22.—


Transported for Seven Years.


Sixth Jury, before Edward Bullock, Esq.

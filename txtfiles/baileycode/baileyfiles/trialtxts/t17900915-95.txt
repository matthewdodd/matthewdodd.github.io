             sworn.
I am a leather-dresser, and servant to the last witness: I was at work in our back shop: and a young man gave me information of the prisoner, and I took him with three pair of leather breeches; I have kept them ever since: he had them in his cloth apron; (produced and deposed to.) I took him in Cornhill; I never lost sight of him; the breeches were folded up in the warehouse, to be cleaned; I missed them directly; one pair is marked R. O.
Prosecutrix. I can swear to them all; one is a very remarkable stout pair; the other a gentleman had mended himself.
PRISONER's DEFENCE.
Coming along East-cheap I saw a young lad a little taller than myself, with the breeches under his arm; and he gave them to me, and told me to carry them along; and he went another way directly; my friends are gone home.

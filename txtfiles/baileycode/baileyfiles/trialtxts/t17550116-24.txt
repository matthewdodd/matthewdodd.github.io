            . I am a linen-draper
, the prisoner was porter
 to me. On Monday the 23d of December, I was sent for to Mr. Clark's house, a linen-draper, in Cheapside, when he told me, Mr. Bolton, in his neighbourhood, had got some goods, which he supposed to be stolen, and he had sent to the printer which had printed some of them, to know whose they were, and they appeared to be mine; he then sent for 
               
                  John 
                  Bolton 
               



             to bring the linen, which he did, who informed me the prisoner was the man that left them with him. He also informed me that he was a married man, though I had hired him for a batchelor, and that he had a lodging in Little bell-alley, which made me think it necessary to get a search-warrant, to search his lodgings; we searched, but found nothing of mine, neither there, nor in his box at my house. I went to Mr. Bolton's house with the prisoner, the officer, and my journeyman. Mr. Bolton and his wife both said the prisoner was the man that brought the goods there. Mr. Bolton produced the goods, my journeyman, 
               
                  John 
                  Clark 
               



            , know some of them to be mine; but the names and marks being taken off, he could not swear to some of them. Then I asked the prisoner whose goods they were? he said, sir, they are yours. I then asked him if he had any more of mine than what were there? which he at first denied; but being informed by Mr. Bolton he had lost a piece of Irish cloth on the Sunday fortnight before, I asked him what he had done with that? After a little hesitation, he told me he had sold it to one 
               
                  John 
                  Evans 
               



            , who lives with Mr. Shuttleworth, opposite the Mansion-house. I asked him, if he had sold him any thing else? He said, no; but afterwards confessed he had sold him some linen handkerchiefs. We took the prisoner up Cheapside to my house, where he shewed us from what places and parts of the warehouse he had taken the goods. It is a shop, or warehouse (we call it either) under my house. The prisoner was then conveyed to Wood-street compter, and the officer went and found 
               
                  John 
                  Evans 
               



            , who is here, and will give your lordship an account of what he bought of the prisoner.
Q. Did the prisoner confess this voluntarily ?
W. Tapp. He did. when confronted with the goods; I made no promise at all to him, the officer said if there were other villains concerned with him, it was best for him to tell that I might be as favourable to him as the case would admit. On the Thursday morning we took the prisoner before my Lord-Mayor, with Evans, there the prisoner confessed he had taken the whole (before my Lord, Mr. Bolton, the officer, and myself) and sold part to John Evans (the goods produced in court, and deposed to, there were two parcels, one that was sold to Evans, and another parcel left with Mr. Bolton.) These are the goods laid in the indictment; there were other goods which the prisoner said were mine, but the marks being out of them, I could not swear to them.


                  John 
                  Clark 
               



            , the prosecutor's journeyman, and 
               
                  John 
                  Bolton 
               



             confirmed the evidence of the prosecutor, and



                  John 
                  Evans 
               



             deposed he bought a piece of flowered lawn, and a piece of handkerchiefs of the prisoner at the bar.


                  Richard 
                  Nash 
               



            , the officer, deposed to that of the prisoner's confession.
The prisoner said nothing in his defence, but called 
               
                  John 
                  Langley 
               



             who had known him a year and half, Robert Sidall, two years; 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Edwards 
               



            , nine years; and 
               
                  Edward 
                  Parry 
               



            , about three years; all which gave him a good character, exclusive of the present charge against him.




               Guilty 4 s. 10. d.

WILLIAM STEVENS
. I reside at the Rose Inn, Smithfield. Two coats were stolen out of a gig at my door on the 20th of September—from information, I went to the Half moon public-house—when I was inquiring there, I saw the prisoner—he must have heard what I said—he ran off, and some persons said, "There he goes, "—I pursued and took him—the officer found the coats—these are them—they are Mr. Edward Nicoll's.





JOSEPH STANTON
. I live at the Rose Inn. I saw the prisoner take the coats from the back of the chaise-cart—he ran into the Half Moon—I saw Copeland and his wife, who keep the Half Moon, in the bar.





FREDERICK PRINCE
 (City Policeman No. 79.) I took the prisoner at the Half-Moon—I found the two coats in the coats in the cock-loft—there was a door which was padlocked between where I went in and where they were found—the prisoner was not a servant there—Mr. Copeland was here, but was discharged this morning.




GUILTY

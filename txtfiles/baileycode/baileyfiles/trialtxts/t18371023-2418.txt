ESTHER PARKER
. I am the wife of George Parker, of Ship-street, Deptford New Town, a coachmaker. I have known the prisoner some time by coming to visit a friend of ours—on the 25th of July, about five minutes past eleven o'clock, he came to my house and wanted me to go and borrow half a crown for him at Mrs. Knowldon's of High-street—he said she would have it all ready—I proposed my little girl should go, but he said he would rather I went—I went, but did not get the half-crown—I was absent ten or twelve minutes—when I returned my little girl was crying—I was induced to go up stairs, and missed all this property—he was not there—he had said he would wait for the half-crown—they were all safe when I went out.





FREDERICK NORMAN
. I live at Mr. Nash's, pawnbroker, London-street, Greenwich. I have a pair of shoes which were pawned on the 25th of July by the prisoner.

Prisoner. I did not pawn any shoes that day.





GEORGE PARKER
. I am the husband of Esther Parker. These are my shoes—I found them at the pawnbroker's in about an hour—I took the prisoner on the 11th of this month at Brixton tread-mill, where he had been committed—I told the constable to take him—he asked him, "Do you know that gentleman?"—he said, "I have seen him"—I have found nothing else.




GUILTY
. Aged 22.—


Transported for Seven Years.

Before Mr. Common Sergeant.

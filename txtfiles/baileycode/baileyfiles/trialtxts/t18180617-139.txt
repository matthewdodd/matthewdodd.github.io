            . I am a linen-draper
, and live in Ratcliff-highway


. On the 1st of June, about nine o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came to my shop, and asked for a pair of knit stockings. I said I had none, and wished to shew him some wove ones. He would not look at them, but turned from the counter, to go away. I saw a shawl hanging from under his coat. I ran round the counter, and seized him at the door. Before he got out, a lady and gentleman who were in the shop immediately absconded. They had paid me a forged note, and given a false address. A man, dressed like a sailor, was near the door; I called to him to assist me, but he went away. The prisoner made considerable resistance, during which time the shawl dropped from under his coat. I picked it up.

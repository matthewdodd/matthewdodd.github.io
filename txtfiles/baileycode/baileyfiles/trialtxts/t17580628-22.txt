Q. Who do you work for?

Q. Where did your mother work?
Harris. She used to wind his silk at her own home, I used to assist her.
Q. How came you to carry it to the prisoner?
Harris. I had seen one Mrs. Acton go there with some, so I went with some.
Q. Did she ever desire you to bring it?
Harris. No.
Q. How much did you carry in the whole to her?
Harris. I carried about twelve ounces to her.
Q. How do you know it was about that quantity?
Harris. Because my mother has wanted that quantity in her weight.
Q. What did she give you for it?
Harris. Sometimes she has given me a penny an ounce, and sometimes three halfpence.
Q. How came you to know that you was to have money for it?
Harris. I saw her give the other woman money, and I thought she would give me the same.
Q. How much an ounce did she give the other woman?
Harris. I do not know.
Q. What did she use to say to you?
Harris. She never said any thing to me, only took it out of my hand, and gave me money according to the quantity I brought.
Q. Did she ever bid you come again with more?
Harris. No; she never used to say a word to me.

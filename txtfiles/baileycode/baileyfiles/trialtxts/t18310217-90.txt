JOSEPH HAINSWORTH. I know the house of Mr. 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Hannam
               



            , in the New-road


 - there is a garden in front. On the 12th of February, at six o'clock in the morning, I found the gate open - I walked in with my light; on looking round I saw the two prisoners laying, one on the other, under the garden wall, and two bags of coals near them, containing about three bushels - I called up the family, and Birch came down; I asked the prisoners what brought them there - they made no answer; I know one of them well.


                  WILLIAM 
                  BIRCH
               



            . I live with Mr. Thomas Hannam. I went to bed about eleven o'clock at night, on the 11th of February; our coal-cellar is in front of the house, but the door was not locked; the coals in the bags were all large ones, and appeared to have been taken off my master's heap - the gate had been broken open.
JURY. Q. Whose property are the bags? A. I do not know.

ARCHILAUS DODD
. I am in the service of Peter Ludgate and Charles Burt. On the 29th of June I missed some carpet from our house, in Carthusian-street, Charter-house-square—a boy came and gave information—Cain was brought back by a young man, and the carpet—I know nothing about Hallett.





JOHN MATTOCK
. I am a tailor, and live opposite the prosecutor. I was in my shop on the 29th of June, about half-past two o'clock—I saw Cain standing on the step of the prosecutor's door, and Hallett looking in

at the window—I saw Hallett make a motion with his left hand, and Cain draw back a little—then Hallett made a motion the other way with his hand, Cain went in and took the roll of carpet, end put it under his arm—he walked out, and as he passed Hallett, Cain smiled—I ran out of the shop, and caught Cain with the carpet—I know Hallett by the mark on his chin.

Hallet. Q. Where was? A. On the pavement, as I passed in the middle of the road—I did not see you when Cain was brought back.





JAMES BRANNAN
.(police-sergeant G 20.) I was in Old-street, in plain clothes, and saw Hallett rush into a mob where a man was dinging—knowing he was wanted I took him—he said, "Because I have been two or three times with Cain, I am to be taken every time he it in custody"—I said, "You are charged with being with him, when he took a roll of carpet in Carthusian-street."

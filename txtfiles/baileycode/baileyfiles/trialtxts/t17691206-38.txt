            . I am a linen draper
. I live in Tabernacle Walk, Moorfields


. I was not at home when the linen was taken away, but when I came home the three prisoners were all in custody in my shop, on the 2d of November.
Q. Did you go with them to the justice's?
Taylor. No: my wife did. I can only say the linen was my property.


                  Mary 
                  Taylor 
               



            . I am wife to 
               
                  John 
                  Taylor 
               



            . 
               
                  Elizabeth 
                  Cosgrove 
               



             and another woman, who was neither of the other prisoners, came into my shop; they wanted to buy a handkerchief; I let them see several; the other woman sat down by the window; she went out in a hurry and Cosgrove followed her. I soon missed a piece of linen. I ran out at the door, and saw they were running up the lane; there were four of them running. I cried, Stop thief. A young man ran after them, and took the three prisoners; the other got off: he brought them and the piece of linen back.


                  John 
                  Kitchen 
               



            . I heard my neighbour cry, Stop thief. I ran out of my father's shop, and stopped Cosgrove first; then I saw 
               
                  Catherine 
                  Smith 
               



            . I then went up to her, and said, I stop you for a piece of linen; she put her arm out with it, and said, Here it is.
Q. How far was she from Cosgrove?
Kitchen. After I passed Cosgrove, I ran about 100 yards, and then stopped Smith; when I catched Smith, I saw 
               
                  Susanna 
                  Thompson 
               



             a little way from her. I bid my father's journeyman lay hold of her, which he did; we brought them all three with the linen to Mr. Taylor's house. Smith said, she was willing to go with me any where, and that one 
               
                  Mary 
                  Palmer 
               



             took the linen and gave it to her.
Q. Why did you take Thompson?
Kitchen. I took her because they were all together. Thompson was between Smith and Cosgrove, and Mrs. Taylor calling out, They were the girls that robbed her.
Q. from Smith to Mrs. Taylor. Whether you saw me in your shop?
M. Taylor. Smith was not in my shop; they all went past my door together a little before.

            . I am a Cordwainer. I heard the cry, Stop thief! I went out and pursued. Mr. Kitchen took the piece of cloth from Smith, and I took hold of Thompson; and we brought the three prisoners back. When before the justice he asked them what they did for a living; they said they cried fish about. Smith said Mary Palmer gave her the linen to make her a gown.
Smith's Defence.
I had been to see an acquaintance of mine on the other side Moorfields; I could not find her. I met Palmer, she said, How do you do, Mrs. Smith? (Her mother lives in Water-lane, White-fryars ); she desired me to take this home to her mother's to make her a gown. The man came up and said, Young woman I come to you for a piece of linen. I said use me civilly and I'll go with you any where; and I delivered the linen to him.
Q. to Kitchen. Were they running or walking when you saw them?
Kitchen. They were walking; they were almost at Westley's preaching place going to Moorfields, about 100 yards from Mr. Taylor's; I ran as hard as ever I could.
Cosgrove's Defence.
I ran away from my father-in-law; a young woman named 
               
                  Mary 
                  Palmer 
               



            , took me to sell fish and things for her. That morning she asked me if I had a handkerchief. She said if I would be a good girl she would lend me money to buy one. She took me to that, and that must be the time she took it; they laid hold of me and let her go. They asked me where she lived, and I told them; but they did not go after her.
Q. to prosecutor. Did you not go after 
               
                  Mary 
                  Palmer 
               



            ?
Prosecutor. No, I did not, my business would not permit me.

                  , from his person
            .
STEPHEN BOSSY. I live in Lower Thames-street. On the 14th of September, between eight and nine o'clock at night, I was in Finsbury-square


, and felt my handkerchief going from my pocket. I turned round, and saw the prisoner, with three others much older than himself. I saw the prisoner drop my handkerchief - I immediately seized him, and said I would take him to the watch-house-the other three immediately made off. He resisted very violently, and said I should not take him, as I was not an officer - He denied the charge. Vann immediately told him he had been watching him, and he would take him, which he did.
THOMAS VANN. I am constable of the night. I took the prisoner in charge. I found a handkerchief on him, marked 
               T.S. 
            - he said it was his own.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. Several boys were behind him. I saw one of them take it, and throw it down.

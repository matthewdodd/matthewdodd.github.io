: my wife gave the prisoner eight-pence a day to help her to sell a few things in Bartholomew fair; she came from the fair, and said my wife sent her for me, and she was to stay with the children at home; I went to my wife and left the prisoner at home; when we returned she was gone, and the things and money also; she was taken some time after, and, before my Lord Mayor, acknowledged she took the things and money; I never got them again.

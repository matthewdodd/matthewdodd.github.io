            . Last Wednesday I lost a camblet gown, a bed gown, and a petticoat; they are all here. My wife sent 
               
                  Mary
                   Collins
               



             up stairs for a hat; she came down and said there was a woman in the garret ; the prisoner came down and asked if one Welsh lodged there; I said I knew him very well, and stopped her while I went into the garret to see if any thing was taken away; I went up and found the box broke open, and the things lying about the floor; the lock was broke; there was two towels hanging up in the garret; they were lying on the floor doubled up.

             . My mistress sent me into the garret for a hat; when the garret door is shut the stairs are very dark; I saw a light and asked who was there; when I got almost to the top she came out and shut the door after her; then I said again, who is there; the prisoner said don't one Mr. Welsh lodge here; I said, yes, ma'am, he is down stairs if you will come down; she came down into the shop; I told my mistress the woman had been in the garret; she was stopped while they went to see if there was any thing missing.

             confirmed their evidence, deposed to the things, and said that when she was searched, a bunch of keys were found upon her, and that when she made the bed a key fell off of where the prisoner sat, that locked and unlocked the garret door better than their own key.
Prisoner's Defence.
I went up to enquire for Mr. Welsh; I found the door open, and finding my mistake I came down again; the prosecutor stopped me, and said he had been robbed; there was nothing found upon me.

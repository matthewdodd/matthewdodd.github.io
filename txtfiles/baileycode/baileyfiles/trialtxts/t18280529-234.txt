            . I am the wife of William Anderson; he is a seaman
; we live in Bedford-court, Catherine-street


. I took the prisoner in out of charity - I lost the articles stated out of my room; I was ill with a bad arm; I gave a silk handkerchief off my arm, and asked her to give me a cotton one, which she did; my husband came to bed at half-past nine o'clock; I said to the prisoner, "Why do you stop up so late," as I am in the habit of going out at two o'clock in the morning - she made an excuse that she was going to wash some towels and asked me for some dirty linen, saying she would have them all ready in the morning - I laid still, with my arm up in bed; I heard no more of her till about eleven o'clock, when I saw her go out with a bundle - I said, "What makes you stop up so late?" she made no answer, but went out of the room, and never returned; I missed the property soon after - I did not see her again till she was at Bow-street; I never allowed her to take anything away.

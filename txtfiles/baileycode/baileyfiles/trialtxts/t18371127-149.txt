JOHN COUCHER
. I am a coachman. On the 30th of November I was at Mr. Malcolm's house, in Warren-street, Charing-cross—the prisoner came in, and sat by my side—I went out, looked through a hole, and watched—I saw him take a pint pot and put it into his hat—he came out—I followed him, and called a policeman, who took it out of his hat—this is it—he appeared sober.





HENRY HILLS
. I am a policeman. I searched him, and found the pot—he was not drunk.





ROBERT MALCOLM
. This is my pot.






RICHARD COLLER
. I am a policeman. I got this certificate of the prisoner's former conviction from Mr. Gilbert, the Clerk of the Peace for Westminster Sessions (read)—I know the prisoner to be the man—I have had him twice myself for stealing pots.




GUILTY
. Aged 23.—


Transported for Seven Years.

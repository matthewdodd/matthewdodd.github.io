            . I am wife of the prosecutor; I hung two shirts belonging to two gentlemen's servants on the line in my garden, and the finest by the rails; about ten o'clock, about an hour after I put them there, I found them wanting, and the line cut; I was alarmed by my daughter, who said thieves had been there; I went to look at the line and found it cut, and the linen gone; my husband and I pursued the person pointed out to us as the man that had taken them; my husband took the prisoner, and he dropped the shirts. (The shirts produced and deposed to by the prosecutrix.)
The prisoner said nothing in his defence.

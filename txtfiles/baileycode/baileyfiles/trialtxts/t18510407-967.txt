, stealing 1 waistcoat, value 3s.; the goods of 




Edward Bryan: having been before convicted.






EDWARD BRYAN
. I am a bricklayer's labourer. On 21st March I was working at an unfinished house in Ball's Pond—my jacket was hanging over a fence near—I missed it—I had seen it not five minutes before—I heard something in four or five minutes, went into a brickfield, and saw the prisoner at a distance wearing my jacket—I went up to him, took him, and asked him what he took it for—he said he bought it—he wore his own coat over it—this is it—it cost 8s.

Prisoner. Q. Did not another man stop me? A. Yes, and handed yon over to me—you had not time to buy it—there was not ten minutes between my missing it and finding it on you, and I had a very sharp run after you.





WILLIAM RISHBRIDGER
 (policeman, A 481.) Bryan gave the prisoner into my custody about a mile from the house where he had been at work—he said he bought the waistcoat.

Prisoner's Defence. I bought it; they did not see me near the house; I have been a bad character, but that is no reason why I should be so now.





WILLIAM STAFFORD
 (policeman). I produce a certificate of the prisoner's conviction—(read—Convicted at Clerkenwell, Aug. 1849, and confined six months)—I was present—he is the person.




GUILTY
. **†Aged 20.—


Transported for Ten Years.

(The prisoner was stated to have been eleven times in prison, and nine of his companions had been transported.)

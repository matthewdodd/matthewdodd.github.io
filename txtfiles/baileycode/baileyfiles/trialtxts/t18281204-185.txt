Prisoner's Defence. I was walking along Barbican, and met a person who I knew; he asked me where I was going - I said, "Towards Fleet-street;" he said he was going that way - I stopped on Snow-hill, to look into an eating-house window, and, on turning round, a handkerchiefwas thrown on my arm; I saw nobody, and put it into my pocket - I corssed over - this gentleman came, and said I had his handkerchief; I asked if that was his.

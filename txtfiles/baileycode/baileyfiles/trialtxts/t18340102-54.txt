RICHARD DAWSON. At the time in question I was living with my brother, John Dawson, who is a broker
 at No. 17, Old-street-road



, in the parish of Shoreditch. On the Sunday before the 14th of December I was left alone in the house, and went out about a quarter before seven at night- I left nobody in the house - I made the house fast - I did not look at the windows, but for what I knew they were fast - I shut the back door, and latched it, but did not bolt it - I shut and double-locked the front door, and put the key into my pocket - I was absent about a quarter of an hour - I then returned, and on getting to the front door, and putting the key in the lock to open it, the door flew open all in a moment - it opens inside, and two men came out - the prisoner, Davis, was one of them - I ran after him, and caught him before he got out of my sight - he never was out of my sight from the time he left the door- I threw him down - a policeman came up, and he was immediately apprehended - when I was going in at the door the first man struck at me with something in his hand, and Davis hit me in the face; and when I overtook him he struck me two or three times over the head - he was taken to my brother's house and searched, and two coats, two decanters, a shirt, a handkerchief, a timepiece, found on him, and a skeleton key - I did not try it to the front door; after searching him, I went up stairs to my brother's room, and found all his drawers open, and the things taken out - I observed no marks of violence on them, but two screws were forced from the lock of the bureau, and there were marks of violence on that - I went into the front room two pair: all the drawers were open there, and the things scattered about the room - a box, which had been under the bed, was drawn out, and the things taken out - the prisoner was taken to the station-house - Ferne took the property.
Cross-examined by MR. STAMMERS. Q. I think you said you don't know what parish the house is in? A. It is in Shoreditch - I don't know the name - the front part of the house is a broker's shop; nothing more - I was left in charge of the house - I went out for a quarter of an hour - I merely walked into the City-road, and thought it might be safe - I went out at the front door - I went out into the yard to the horse and fed it, and shut the back door, but did not bolt it - that was directly before I went out at the front door - I did not take any pains to secure the back door - I shut it - I did not turn back to look whether it was fastened - I can't swear it was fastened - it always latched when I put it too - I did not bolt it - I swear I shut it - I don't know whether I turned back to see if the door had latched or not - I cannot swear the back door was latched - I took and slammed it to, and cannot swear whether I did or did not turn round to see if it was latched - I went out directly after at the front door - I was not in a particular hurry - I was only going out to take awalk - I double-locked the front door, and took the key with me - I swear it was double-locked.
COURT. Q. When you came back you put the key into the front door - had you unlocked it before it opened? A. No, I had not.

            . I am a policeman - I assisted the last witness in apprehending the prisoner Davis - I searched him at Mr. Dawson's house, and produce the articles I found on him - here are two coats, which were both on his back over his own - he had three coats on - two decanters, which I found in his own coat pocket; one dial in his coat pocket; one skeleton key in his waistcoat pocket; and where he fell down, two or three yards from where he was struggling with Dawson, I picked up a crow-bar - I examined the front door of the premises, and perceived marks of a crow-bar - it had been forced open by a crow-bar - the box of the lock was forced off.
Cross-examined by MR. STAMMERS. Q.How far from him did you find this iron instrument? A.Three or four yards - I tried it to the marks - they corresponded exactly with it - it is impossible the marks could be produced by carrying in furniture or things.

            . I am a police-sergeant - I assisted in taking Dawson that night - he had no hat on - I saw a hat at the prosecutor's house when we took him; but that was in the hands of Dawson - the prisoner Davis, when he saw it, said, "That is my hat" - there was a handkerchief and shirt in it, which I produce - Richard Dawson said the handkerchief and shirt were his brother's property - I examined the house, and found it in a disturbed state.


                  JOHN 
                  DAWSON
               



            . I am a broker, and live at No. 17, Old-street-road, in the parish of St. Leonard, Shoreditch. These two coats are my property, and were safe when I went out on Sunday morning, and this timepiece I saw that morning - I had not noticed the other articles - they are my property - besides these articles I missed eight silver spoons, five tea and one caddy spoon, and two salt spoons - four necklaces, two of coral, and one of hair, and one of beads - seven gold rings - a silver watch - silver sugar-tongs, and various other trinkets, the value altogether would be about 12l. - I did not see 
               Davis
             that night- on the Monday morning I met Ballinger in New North-street, about eleven o'clock - he said he heard that I had had a loss - I said "Yes, I have" - he said, "How much do you think you have lost?" I said, "No great deal;" and I said, "I have just been saying to my boy (who was with me) that I was sorry such a thing should have happened, and if I could get my trinkets again, I should be very sorry to have any trouble about it" - he said, "I suppose you don't wish to prosecute" - I said, "I did not know anything about that, that the things taken were found on Davis, and I certainly must swear to my property" - he said, if I could get it put off at Worship-street till tomorrow, he thought we should have more time to talk about it, and I could receive my property - I said, "Certainly, I should like to have my trinkets again" - I had been to Worship-street, and was returning home - he asked how long I should be before I went to Worship-street again - he said, "I am only an agent in this business - I am employed by the father of the young man" - he mentioned the young man's name, but I don't know what it was - Davis was in custody - whether he meant the father of Davis, or the other, I can't say - he said he would go to the young man's father, and he asked if I was going home- I immediately said "Yes" - he said he would return to my house and see me in a short time, in an hour or so - I went home, and he came in about half an hour, and asked me how he was to bring the trinkets to me, and where - I said he could send them by some person, if he thought proper, and lay them in my shop - he said he would bring them himself, and give them to me - he asked if I could not go to some house and receive them - I don't know the sign - I said, "No; if I receive them, I will receive them at home" - he said he would go and fetch them - he immediately went away, and I went immediately to the station-house and asked what I was to do - I immediately returned and stopped in the shop some little time, and Ballinger came past, and thinking he had the trinkets I walked up the road, he appearing rather frightened to bring them in - he asked me again how he should get the trinkets to my house - I said he might send somebody with them - he went away and said again that he would bring them himself- I never saw him any more, till I saw him at the corner of Finsbury-square, where I went in consequence of a message, and there I saw Mr. Ballinger and his wife - I said to him, "Have you got the trinkets?" - he said, "Yes; my mistress has got them," meaning his wife - he immediately said to her, "Give the man his trinkets" - she took them from under her cloak and gave them to me, and the constable came and took him into custody, by an arrangement made beforehand with me - I immediately gave the trinkets to the officer - they were part of the articles which I lost on the Sunday evening.
Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. I believe you have known Ballinger some years? A. I knew him by sight - he has been a broker several years - I did not know where he lived at this time - he told me he was a mere agent, acting on the part of the father of the young man- after he had delivered the trinkets to me, I went to the Star public-house, as I delayed the time till I could see the officer - after receiving the trinkets, I went to a public-house with him - I don't know the sign - I had some drink with him, and I paid for it - we then went to the Star, and I said, as I had treated him he must treat me - I saw a policeman coming up, and gave him into custody - I have got all my property except a trifle.
Ballinger's Defence. I did enter into conversation with Mr. Dawson, but I was actuated by feelings of humanity and not gain, having known Mr. Dawson for some years - he knows I am a broker - I met him at sales - I saw him the first thing in the morning, and did not mention anything to him then, because I had not a knowledge of it.
JOHN DAWSON re-examined. I saw Ballinger on the Monday morning before I met him in NewNorth-road - he said nothing about it then, but hung about the door.
Davis's Defence (written)."I beg leave to say that this is the first time in my life I was ever charged with any offence against the laws of my country, which can be proved by several respectable persons in the court, that up to this time my character would have borne the strictest scrutiny as to honesty. Another circumstance I must state, in justice to the prisoner Ballinger: I can assure you that he was an utter stranger to me, until I saw him in custody in the prison of Clerkenwell. I now throw my case, and my future destiny into the hands of a merciful Judge and an enlightened Jury, who will be as lenient as the circumstances of the case will allow, for the sake of my wife and infants."

            . I know the prisoner Ballinger - on the 9th of December he lived in 9, Lower Castle-street, City Road - I was at his house on that Monday between eleven and twelve o'clock - he was at home - while I was there an old man came in - some conversation passed between the old man and Ballinger in the back parlour - After being in the back parlour some time, Ballinger came out and asked me to walk in - a reason was assigned for my being asked to walk in - the old man's son was mentioned.
COURT. Q. Did the old man direct Ballinger to do anything? A.He asked Ballinger to go and interfere with the prosecutor, as his son was in trouble - I think Dawson's name was mentioned.
MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did Ballinger agree to go and see him? A. He did - the old man stated about some property being returned to the prosecutor - I have known Ballinger five years - he is a broker, an honest and very industrious man - I never heard of a charge against him in my life.

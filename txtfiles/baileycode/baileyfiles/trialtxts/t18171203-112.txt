            . I am a clerk
 in a public-office. On the 21st of November, I had been visiting a friend, and was returning home about eleven o'clock at night; just before the Horse Guards, the prisoner, Thompson, accosted me, and asked for something to drink; I took her to public-house, and had some brandy and water - She drank rum and water. I went to her lodgings, in Dukescourt, in the Almonry


-the brandy and water got into my head; I was there a very short time before I perceived some person feeling in my pantaloons pocket; I put my hand to my pocket, and found my notes gone - She was the only person in the room; I jumped up and made a noise, she ran from the room, I pursued, and never lostsight of her. I accused her of robbing me, in the street, when the watchman came up and took us both to the watch-house; I was rather clamorns about my notes, and was detained in the watch-house. Early in the morning, after the constable of the night had left, the watch-house door was opened, and the prisoner entered with the constable of the night, who must have let her out. I was permitted to leave the watch-house. I went to the Bank and stopped the notes. I gave the officers the numbers of the notes. I have no recollection of the other prisoners.
Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. I met her at twenty minutes after eleven o'clock. If I had not drank too much I should not have gone with her.


                  JAMES 
                  GILMORE
               



            . I am an officer. On the 22d of November I was informed of the robbery, and that the prisoner, Jarman, had been detained for offering a 20l. note, in Oxford-street. I took him and Frith into custody; after that, I received information from Bluet, at Tothill-fields; I went to the watch-house to Jarman, and told him I understood he had a 20l. note about him, and asked him to give it to me. He said, he hoped G-d might strike him dead if he had. I said I was sure he had. He declared solemnly that he knew nothing of the 20l. note which was detained in Oxford-street, and that he went there with Bluet to buy a waistcoat accidentally. I found the 20l. concealed in the lining of his hat (No. 13,014). I asked him what he said now? he said he did not know how it came there. I told him I had information of another 20l. note, which was changed on Saturday morning, and asked him where he had changed it? he said he knew nothing of it, for he never received it. I found he had changed it at Mr. Emery's, the Coach and Horses, in Oxford-street - it was No. 13, 016.
JOSEPH COOPER. I am an officer of Queen-square. After the examination on the 22d of November, I searched the prisoner, Thompson's lodgings, No. 5, Duke's-court, Almonry, and there learnt that she had a servant of the name of 
               
                  Ann 
                  Frith
               



            , that went by the name of Jarman - I took her into custody, and found that Jarman had been stopped offering the 20l. note, No. 13, 015, at Mr. Bagley's. We found 18s. on 
               
                  Ann 
                  Frith
               



             - She said her husband gave it to her. I also found a letter on her from Bluet, directed to Duke's-court. We afterwards took Jarman into custody.
JOHN EMERY. I keep a public-house in York-street, Westminster. On the 22d of November, about eight o'clock in the morning, the prisoner, Jarman, came and asked me to give him change for a 20l. note. I asked him if it was his own? he said it was for a friend, who was waiting for it. I gave him nineteen 1l. notes and 20s. in silver, and indorsed his name on it-it was No. 13, 016.


                  JAMES 
                  GILMORE
               



            . After these notes were produced, I asked Thompson what she did with the other? she said she only took three.
JOHN BAGULY. I am servant to Mr. Dobree, who is a pawnbroker, and lives in Oxford-street. On the 22d of November Bluet, and the prisoner, Jarman, came to our shop. Bluet bought a silver watch for 2l. 16s. - Jarman approved of it. Bluet handed me a 20l. note. Jarman told him his father would be angry with him if he gave more than 3l., and said Bluet lived in the neighbourhood. I asked Bluet for his address, he gave me the name of"Burt, Swallow-street." He said he was the son of Mr. Burt, the builder. I pretended to go out for change, and went to Mr. Burt. I returned, and questioned him about it; he then said, he said Bird. I went to Bird in consequence of what he said, and detained him. The note was No. 13,015.


                  WILLIAM 
                  MILLS
               



            . I am a constable. A man told me he had information from Ann Frith, where I could find 17l. of the money. I went to No. 78, Peter-street, and found 18l. sewed up in a white gown, which belongs to Thompson.
HENRY BLUET. I am a bricklayer. On the night of the 21st the prisoner, Thompson, brought me three 20l. notes, which I did not think honestly come by - I formerly lived with her. I gave them to Ann Frith, she took them to Jarman, whom she formerly lived with. Next morning, Frith took me to Jarman's, where the money was produced. Jarman went out and changed one. She took me with her to Oxford-street, and persuaded me to go into Dobrec's to buy the watch. I tendered one of the notes there which Jarman put into my hand, and was detained.
Cross-examined. I was persuaded to go. I work for Mr. Want, and lodge at No.5, Duke's-court.
MR. ANDERSON. I know them to be my notes by the numbers and dates.
THOMPSON's Defence. The prosecutor said he would stop all night, and afterwards said he must go home. I asked him for some compliment, and he gave me the money.

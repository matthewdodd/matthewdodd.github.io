RICHARD BOND sworn. - I live at No. 19, High-street, St. Giles's


. and am a shoe-maker
: On the 7th of June I observed the prisoner looking at the shoes, as they hung up at the door, between three and four o'clock; I thought he was going to purchase a pair; in a few minutes he went away, and I instantly missed the shoes; I followed him, and took him with the shoes, about four doors off; my wife had ran after him before I did, and he was delivering the shoes to her; he said he would pay for them, but I had him taken into custody.
THOMAS WILLIAMS sworn. - I am one of the Bow-street patrol, and took the prisoner into custody, and searched him, but found nothing on him; he said you need not search me, for I was b-y pushed, or should not have done this. (The shoes produced and identified.)
Prisoner's defence. I am innocent of the charge; he said, what are you going to do with the shoes; I said, I was going to buy a pair. 

               GUILTY

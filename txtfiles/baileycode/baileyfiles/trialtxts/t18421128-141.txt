JAMES BULL
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
18th of Nov., 85 cigars, value 14s. the goods of 



Jane Elizabeth Miller; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






FREDERICK MILLER
. I am a cabinet-maker, and live in Globe-road, Bethnal-green. On Sunday evening, the 13th of Nov., I was at my mother's, Jane Elizabeth Miller, a tobacconist, in Foley-street, Marylebone—the prisoner came in between six and seven o'clock—he inquired the price of a pipe

that hung in the window, and I sent my brother up stairs to inquire—another boy came in, and asked the prisoner what he was going to give for the pipe—he said 1d.—they both went directly, and I missed a bundle of eighty-five cigars, which had been there before—no one had been in but the prisoner and the other boy—the prisoner did not buy any thing—he did not buy the pipe because I could not wax it—I had seen the cigars safe when the prisoner came in—they have not been found.





HENRY FOWLER
 (police-constable E 111.) On Sunday evening, the 13th of Nov., I saw the prisoner, about seven o'clock, run from the corner of Titchfield-street into Arabella-court, with a bundle of cigars in his hand—that is about 100 or 150 yards from the prosecutrix's shop—I am quite certain he had the cigars.

Prisoner. Q. Why not stop me with them? A. You know you cut into the court before I could get hold of you—you had a little bit of a handkerchief over one end of the cigars.





WILLIAM JAMES
 (police-constable E 146.) I took the prisoner on the Tuesday following—he was smoking a cigar—he gave it to another boy.

Prisoner. It is false; I was not; I had not these cigars at all.





JOHN JAMES ALLEN
 (police-constable E 150.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got at Mr. Clark's office—(read)—he is the person.

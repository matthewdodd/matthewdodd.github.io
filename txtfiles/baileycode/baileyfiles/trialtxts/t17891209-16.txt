                  EDWARD
                   BOWERBANK
               



             sworn.
I am a linen draper
 in Newgate-street


: I lost fourteen yards of callico, on the 4th of November; I cannot tell what day of the week; I was not at home: I was sent for immediately on the prisoners being detected.


                  JOHN
                   BOWERBANK
               



             sworn.
The prisoners came into the shop of Mr. 
               
                  Edward
                   Bowerbank
               



            , between five and six, the 4th of November, to buy a cotton bed-gown; I shewed them some prints for it; and 
               
                  Ann
                   Carlton
               



             took one of the prints off the counter; I saw her; it was a piece of callico containing fourteen yards; I had shewed it to her the first piece; she laid it on one side; and I saw her take it, and put it under her apron, and go to the door; in consequence of which, she says to the other that she left in the shop, make haste and buy; she made no answer; and while I was going to the counter, she made off; I took her about an hundred yards from the door; she had the property on her; till I brought her into the shop, it was under her apron; I saw her drop it in the shop; I picked it up; I gave it to my brother; and he and me have had the care of it: he locked it up; I am sure that piece belonged to my brother; it has our shop mark: when the prisoners came in, they looked at the prints, and discoursed together; I took her into custody.


                  EBENEZER
                   BOWMAN
               



             sworn.
I am a haberdasher; I was passing along Newgate-street, and happened to stop; there was a confusion of carriages, and I stopped opposite the door; and I saw the prisoner Carlton come out of the door with some thing in her apron; and she said to Holmes, make haste and buy what you want, and come along; Carlton was at Mr. Bowerbank's door; immediately after that, she ran; and then seeing Mr. 
               
                  John
                   Bowerbank
               



             come out, she ran very fast up the street; and 
               
                  John
                   Bowerbank
               



             caught her about a hundred yards from the door, brought her back, and said she was a shoplifter, and had taken a piece of print; she said nothing; I desired him to be cautious how she dropped it, because she might take it with others; and I saw the print under her apron, and on the step of the door; it was a small pattern, yellowish ground, two or three colours; it was opened, and I particularly looked at it; the cotton was taken care of by Mr. Bowerbank; Holmes was in the shop; I saw her doing nothing.


                  GEORGE
                   PIERPONT
               



             sworn.
I am a constable; I took the prisoners into custody at Mr. Bowerbank's; I left the property with Mr. Bowerbank; I searched them both, and found no property about them, nor any money, except a few bad halfpence; I examined their pockets compleatly.
(The cotton deposed to by 
               
                  Edward
                   Bowerbank
               



            .)
There is a shop mark in characters, in figures; it was made by me; the figures were a V turned the wrong way, and a cross; I had such a piece when I went out; I had no property but what was my own.
Prisoners. We have nothing to say; we have no witnesses.

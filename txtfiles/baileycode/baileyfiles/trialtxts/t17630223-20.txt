            . On the 21st of Jan. I lost two bank notes out of my chest where I lodge, in the house of 
               
                  Matthew 
                  Kilpin 
               



            , in Duke-street, Spittlefields



, I had seen them 5 days before. The prisoner and her husband were taken up on suspicion, they lived in the same house, she is sister to Mr. Kilpin; she told her sister where the notes were paid away, one I found accordingly at Mrs. Triquets, a Silversmith, in the Strand. The prisoner at the bar told me she had taken the two notes from me before I went for it; and said, nobody was concerned with her in it: the other note she owned she had paid away to Mr. Sharp, a Linnen-draper, in Cheapside. I went there, he said he had had it changed; I found that, by tracing it in the hands of Mr. Roaper in St. Martin's Lane. I cannot be so positive as to the particulars of that note; I cannot say that was mine, any further than the prisoner told me it was one of mine.
Magdalen Triquet. I keep a silversmith's shop in the Strand. I believe the prisoner is the person that came to my shop to buy some spoons, and changed this bank note. ( A note produced in court and deposed to by the prosecutor as one of the two be lost) this note never was out of my hands but one day; my eldest son, that lives in Craven-Street, changed it for smaller notes. When the prosecutor came for it, I sent my youngest son, that lives with me, to his brother for it.
Q. Are either of your sons here
Triquet. No, they are not.
Court. They should have been here to have identified it.



               Acquitted

She was a second time indicted, for 


               stealing one silver cream-pot, val. 10 s. one pair of silver tea-tongs, val. 5 s. 7 silver tea spoons, val. 5 s. one silver strainer, val. 1 s. 4 neckcloaths, 8 linnen handkerchiefs, one silk handkerchief, 3 towels, one canvass bag, one silk and silver purse, and 4 l. in money numbered, the property of

, Jan. 21. ~
The prosecutor deposed, that upon searching the prisoner's lodgings, there were one hundred and three pounds found which they could give no manner of account how they came by, except forty pounds which the prisoner's husband's father had sent him. Also the plate was found, and the same produced and deposed to by the marks on them.

            . I have a house rebuilding on Snow-hill


; I was informed some of the lead had been stripped off, and was before the magistrate; I was ordered by the justice to see if the lead fitted the place from whence my lead was stole; upon hammering it down, it fitted exactly.

            . On the 10th of November, about seven in the evening, I saw two or three men in this house putting something into a sack; I asked them what they did there; one said d - n you, what is that to you: I said, what have you got there? the prisoner said d - n you, take it, and chucked a large parcel of lead at my breast; I caught it; he ran away; I pursued him, and he was taken; I found a sack there, and a piece of lead that weighed two quarters of a hundred and ten pounds.

            . I heard the cry, stop thief! I saw the prisoner running, and Mr. Warner and Mr. Black following him; I joined in their pursuit and he was never out of my sight till the mob got round him and he was taken.

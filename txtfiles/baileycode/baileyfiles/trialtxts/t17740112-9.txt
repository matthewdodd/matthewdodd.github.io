            . Going up Cornhill


, about a quarter before seven o'clock, on the 30th of December. I felt something pluck at my pocket; I turned about and saw the prisoner with my handkerchief in his hand, as if just taken out of my pocket; I endeavoured to seize him as he was trying to convey it into the hands of another boy; I followed him, and afterwards took him, but never recovered my handkerchief.
The prisoner called a woman to his character.

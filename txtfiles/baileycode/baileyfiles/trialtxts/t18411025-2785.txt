JOHN BROWN
 and 




BENJAMIN MUNDAY
 were again indicted for

 stealing, on the 
25th of September, 1 brass cock, value 2s., the goods of 



Richard Palmer Roupell; and that Brown had been before convicted for felony.






MARIA WALKER
. I am the wife of William Walker, of Roupell-street, Lambeth. We missed a brass cock from our house on the 25th of September—it was the property of Mr. Richard Palmer Roupell—I had seen it safe on the 24th.





HENRY LATCH FORD
 (police-constable L 87.) I was on duty in York-road, on Saturday morning, the 25th of September—I saw the two prisoners coming in a direction from Roupell-street—they passed me, and I followed—when they got to the corner of York-road, they ran—I followed Brown—he dropped a cock from his hand, but not this one—I took him, and found another new cock on him, and nine pieces of leaden pipe in his pockets.





MARK WILLIAM GREEN
 (police-sergeant L 2.) I pursued Munday, and found this brass cock of Mr. Roupell's in the direction in which he ran—it was about five o'clock in the morning, on the 25th of September.

Browns Defence. I had been to the play the night before, and was too late to get in doors—I found this property in Pedlaraacre.





JOHN BISSETT
 (police-constable L 67.) I produce a certificate of Brown's former conviction, which I got from the office of the clerk of the peace of Surrey—(read)—he is the person.

MUNDAY—

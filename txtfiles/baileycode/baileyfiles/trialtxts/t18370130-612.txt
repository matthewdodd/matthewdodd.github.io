ARTHUR KNOX
 was again indicted

 for stealing, on the 
1st of January, 1 handkerchief; value 1s.; and 1 pair of gloves, value 1s.; the goods of 



Edwin Moses.






EDWIN MOSES
. I lost these things from the stable on the Tuesday after christmasday—the gloves have never been found—I lost another handker chief on the 1st of January—I lost my gloves out of my coat pocket—this it my handkerchief (looking at one)—I know it from the pattern and the way it is worn in the middle—I have had it eight or nine years—I am positive it is mine.






WILLIAM GLADMAN
. I am a police-sergeant. This handkerchief was farad on the prisoner's wife's neck, after leaving the police-office, as we were coming home—she was crying, and Moses saw her—she said, "Don't be hard with my husband"—he said, "I am sorry for yon; if you will have half a pint of beer, I will give it you"—she said, "Knox brought it home."





JOHN CHANT
 (police-constable 108.) I was present at the time—what has been said is correct.

Prisoner. I found that handkerchief when I was on duty in the Regentspark.




GUILTY
. Aged 24.—


Transported for Seven Years.

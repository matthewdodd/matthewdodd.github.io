Ganden. Howard is fourteen years old, Green thirteen and Wardens eleven.

            . I am a pawnbroker, and live at Shadwell Dock: Wardens brought a pair of shoes to pawn, last Friday was a week in the evening; he asked 10. 6 d. upon them; I said they were poor shoes, and I could not lend so much; I asked him who they belonged to; he said his sister, and that his brother was at the door; my man looked, and said there was another at the door; I lent him a shilling upon them.

            . I took the prisoners; I took Wardens first; he shewed me where the other two were in Shadwell Dock Yard. I found these two pair of shoes (producing them) among the ocum, about five or six o'clock; I believe it was on Friday.
Howard's Defence.
I am used to the sea; I had just left the vessel.
Green's Defence.
Howard took the shoes out of the window, I only held them.
Warden's Defence.
This boy took them; the other held them, and I went to pawn them where my mother used; they persuaded me to pawn them.

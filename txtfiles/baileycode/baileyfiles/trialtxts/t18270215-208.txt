WILLIAM COLLINS. I live at Enfield. On the 24th of January, I was near Warren's house, at Edmonton


, and saw the prisoner about ten poles from the house, with two shirts in his hand; I took him, and said, "Well, George, how are you?" as I knew him - he said, "I hope you won't say any thing about it, Will, but I have taken these shirts, and I think they are your brothers;" I said, "You shall take them back;" we went back, and my sister said they were Mrs. Warren's, who came up and owned them.

            . I am the wife of James Warren. I hung these shirts in the garden - I saw the prisoner pass the place twice while I was hanging them up; I saw him pass again afterwards - I then went out and missed them.

            . On the 8th of October, about four o'clock, I was at Ody's, the Red-lion, public-house, Wilson-street, Finsbury-square


. The prisoner came in, he came to my box and asked for the newspaper, which I gave him, he kept folding it about, and under his coat I saw a pot; I told the landlord, who came from the bar, and collected the pots; I then saw he had moved the pot on the table by his elbow from under his coat; I said, "Mr. Ody, that is the pot the man had under his coat," he abused me very much, and went out in a passion; I advised Ody to fetch him back, he was brought back, he had a bundle, in which was found another pint pot wrapped in a towel and another in his coat pocket.

            . I keep the house. Tribute charged the prisoner with concealing a pot under his clothes, he denied it, and abused him; he went out with a bundle, I followed and secured him, six yards off, and found a pot in his bundle, he fell on his knees, and begged for mercy, I said I had lost a great many, he said If I forgave him, he would bring back all - his coat knocked against the bench, and we found another in his pocket.

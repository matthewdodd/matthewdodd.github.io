GEORGE LAWS
. I am a shopman to William Broome, a hosier, in Oxford-street. About eight o'clock in the evening, of the 30th of March I saw these socks safe just inside the door—I saw them unusually working up and down—I ran to the door, and saw the prisoner with another lad run off—I followed, and saw the prisoner throw these socks up Marylebone-lane—I followed, and took him—they are called half-hose in the trade—some people call them socks.

Cross-examined by
MR. HORRY. Q. Where were you? A. Behind the counter serving a customer—I was three yards in the shop—I had to come five or six yards round to the door—I gave an alarm to a young man; and went round myself—a person outside might see me in the shop—it was about eight o'clock at night—I saw the prisoner and another lad running from the door—I saw the string was cut—I found they were gone before I ran out—I never said I ran out, and found the parcel gone—I could not miss them till I got to the door—the prisoner was about three yards from the door when I went out—I turned to see the parcel was cut, and they ran off directly—before I came out I saw the parcel was missing—the persons I saw were to the left—I pursued the prisoner, and he threw them from his hand up Marylebone-lane, which is three or four yards from the shop—I saw them while I was standing at the door—when I got out they were walking—I followed the prisoner to Welbeck-street, about a hundred yards—I did not lose sight of him—I was not more than two or three yards behind him—I slipped for a minute, or I should have caught him long before.

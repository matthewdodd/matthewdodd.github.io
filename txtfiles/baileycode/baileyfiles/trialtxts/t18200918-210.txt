            . I am a tailor
, and live at Bexley, in Kent. On the 3d of July I was with some friends in Portman-street


 at half-past three o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner and several more stood at the curb. I was stopped by the crowd, and turned to go back. Then the prisoner and two or three more, closed upon us, and forced us back into the crowd. I said to my friend,
"Stand back a few minutes, and we shall be able to get back." The prisoner came before us, and in an instant put his hand down. I felt my watch move from the bottom of my fob, and saw him take it out. I immediately seized him, and he gave it to one of the others. They tried to rescue him, but I kept him, and Gall took him.

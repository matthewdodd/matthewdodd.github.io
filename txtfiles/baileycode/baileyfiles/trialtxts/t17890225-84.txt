             sworn.
On the 26th of February I went into my parlour at half after five, or a quarter before six, I shut my windows quite close, and in one of the sconces of the glass I put a candle lighted; my boy came in and told me my glass was going out of the window, there were many people in the tap-room, sitting in the boxes, nobody could go into the parlour without my seeing them; there was a spring-lock to the door.

I saw the prisoner standing by the parlour window on the outside, and another man gave him the glass; I told my master; the one slipt and broke the glass; a man went after him and picked up the glass, he ran away; I knew the prisoner again, he had a leather apron on.

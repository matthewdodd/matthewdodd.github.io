            . I am a constable. On Sunday, the 10th of May, the brother of Mr. Caslick sent for me, to go and search his servant, for robbing him. I searched the prisoner's box, and found nothing. She went out of the parlour; I thought she had been and hid something. I went out in the garden, and found these knives and forks hid in the garden; in her box I found more plates than what are mentioned in the indictment.

            . I know the knives and forks to be my master's; and I know the cups and saucers and glasses. She lived servant with Mr. Parker a month.

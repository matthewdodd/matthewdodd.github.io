            . I live in Fleet-lane. On the 14th of September, about eight o'clock in the evening, I was in Holborn


, going home, just as I came to the end of Fetter-lane a person said my handkerchief had been taken away, and pointed a man out without a coat. I followed up the lane, and up King's-head court, which leads into Holborn again, and found the prisoner in custody at the end of the court with the handkerchief. He was without his coat.

            . I am servant to Mr. Ridgeway, of Newgate-street. I was in Holborn, and saw the prisoner take the handkerchief from the prosecutor's pocket, and informed him. I pursued, and Jones stopped him. I am sure he is the man.

            . I am a ticket-porter, and live in Chequer-square, Aldersgate. I heard somebody call to the prosecutor that his handkerchief was gone, and saw the prisoner running in his shirt sleeves. I turned back, and met him at the end of the court. He threw the handkerchief down as I caught him.

CHARLES HAWES
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
9th of May, 1 handkerchief, value 3s., the goods of 



John Curtis, from his person.






JOHN CURTIS
. I am in the employ of Mr. Walker, a bookseller and stationer, in Hospital-road, Chelsea. On the evening of the 9th of May I was walking with my sister in Aldgate High-street—a little boy asked me if I had lost my handkerchief, and a policeman afterwards asked me—I said no I had not, but I put my hand into my pocket directly afterwards, and found it was gone—I went with a policeman to the station-house, gave a description of the handkerchief, and it was shown to me—I am sure it was mine—this is it.





LEONARD MAGNUS
. I am errand-boy to Mr. Lloyd, a surgeon, in Basinghall-street. I was in Aldgate on Tuesday evening last between eight and nine o'clock—the prosecutor was walking with his sister—I saw the prisoner take a handkerchief out of his pocket, and put it into his own coat pocket—he then crossed over, and walked on the other side of the way—I am sure he is the man—I went and told the watchman of it, and he told the prosecutor—he at first said he had not lost it, but when he went

to the station-house with the policeman, he said he had—he described the handkerchief, and claimed it.





WILLIAM POOLE
. I am a tailor, and live in Peter's-alley, Cornhill. I was in Aldgate High-street, and saw the prisoner cross the road in custody of the policeman, and in crossing he dropped the handkerchief from his lefthand coat pocket—I picked it up, and gave it up.





BENJAMIN RICHARDSON
. I am a watchman of Portsoken ward. From information from Magnus I took the prisoner into custody.




GUILTY
. Aged 19.—


Transported for Seven Years.
1 Before Mr. Justice Park.

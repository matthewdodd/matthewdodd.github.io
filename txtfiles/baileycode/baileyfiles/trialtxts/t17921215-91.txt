                  BENJAMIN
                   PAINTON
               



             sworn.
I am servant
 to Mr. Millworth, he deals in corn and lives in Sutton-street; these girls picked me up the 8th of November between seven and eight in the evening; it was 
               
                  Elizabeth
                   Carter
               



            , she took me to a house in Sharp's-alley


; I have learned since that it is Macclew's house, otherwise mother William's; we went up stairs; I agreed with 
               
                  Elizabeth
                   Carter
               



             for six pence; I gave her a shilling as she wanted some gin, she gave it to Ford to get some gin, then we were going to the agreement and she picked the money out of my pocket; we were both laying on the bed; she pulled the money out of my pocket, and I felt her; it was in my breeches pocket, it was in a purse; I thought she had put her hand into my pocket; I caught hold of her pocket and pulled it off; there was nine Guineas in my purse and some silver; I am sure to the sum; I had not had any strong beer nor spirits, I had nothing but small beer that day; I am certain I had the money when I laid on the bed; I took the six-pence and shilling from the same purse in the same room, I got aside, after that I put the purse back again into my pocket, which was not above a minute or two before we laid on the bed; I found nothing in her pocket; after we had tumbled some little while 
               
                  Elizabeth
                   Ford
               



             came up and collared me and tore my shirt collar; after I had tumbled with them Mrs. Macclew came up and I was obliged to throw them down; they would have been too much for me if I had not looked sharp; mother Macclew came up and asked what was the matter; I told her they had taken my money; she asked me how much; I told her nine guineas and some silver, and then she persuaded this 
               
                  Elizabeth
                   Carter
               



             to give it up again; she said, she had not got the money; I told her she must have it or know where it was; she said, no; after that Mrs. Carter shewed me the purse laid down in the room just by a bed, not that bed we had been upon.
Q. From the situation you was in with respect to your clothes, was it possible for this purse to drop out? - It was impossible because the pocket was buttoned They were cloth breeches.
Q. Even if it had not been buttoned, could the purse have come to that place where you saw the purse lay? - It was from one side of the room to the other, one shilling laid down by the purse; they were searched in the watch-house but not in the room; I never got but one shilling.
Q. How long had you been earning this? - It was all that ever I got all my life long; I am quite certain as to the girl Carter, she was never out of my custody.
Prisoner Carter. I never saw him till he was in my room, and 
               
                  Mary
                   Williams
               



             gave me the purse.


                  MARY
                   WILLIAMS
               



             sworn.
Mr. Macclew is my man; I am not married to the man.
Q. Then this is 
               
                  Edward
                   Macclew
               



            's house? - It is.
Q. Was you there when this poor foolish fellow came in? - It was 
               
                  Elizabeth
                   Carter
               



             came in about seven o'clock in the evening, and asked me whether she could have a lodging there; I answered, yes, and put the light on the stairs, and she went up stairs; she had not been up stairs long before I heard a noise up stairs.
Court. Did any body come in with her? - I did not see any body; I putthe light on the stairs and shut the door.
Mr. Garrow. It is not polite to look at your customers. How long had she been up before you heard a noise? - About a quarter of an hour; I heard a man crying out that he had lost his money; I went up stairs and I found there was no light in the room; the man said, I will be obliged to you to bring up a light; I went down stairs and I fetched a light; I found the man and 
               
                  Elizabeth
                   Carter
               



             in the room, and I cannot say whether Ford was in the room or came up after me; I found the candle in the room that I put on the stairs, that was out; I took the light and the man said, he had lost his money; I asked how much; he said, a good deal; the man pulled at her pocket, and she strove to save it, and they were all three on the ground again, and then the candle went out again. The candle was on the window.
Q. How did it go out? - Upon my word I cannot tell, I was standing at the door; I think it was put out by their struggling in the room in getting at her pocket, and so I went for another light, and I came back and the man said, he would not leave the room till he had his money; I begged very hard for them to give the money if they had got it; I did not see the man pick up the purse nor the shilling at the bed; I really was frightened.
Q. Did not you see the purse picked up? - I cannot say I did.
Q. Can you say you did not? - Indeed I can say I did not; I did not upon my soul.
Q. How long have you known Mrs. Carter, Mrs. Macclew? - I have known her a good while.
Q. What was the expression you used when she asked you for a lodging? - I put the candle on the stairs and said, Bet you must not make any noise.
Q. What noise did you expect her to make, did you expect that a decent young woman would make a noise? - Because she had been in my place before and made a noise.
Prisoner Carter. When I was distressed for a lodging I goes to her and said, Mrs. Williams will you be so kind as to let me have a lodging; she gave me a candle and told me to go up into the two pair of stairs, and that man was in the room walking about.

             sworn.
I live near Macclew's house; the first that I heard of it, was that the man said, he would not go without his money; some of the neighbours said, why was not the patrole there; I went to the patrole and gave him notice to go to the house.

I am a patrole; I went in consequence of Mrs. Gray's information; I took them into custody; I did not search them; I did not see any thing of the purse. (The purse produced and deposed to.)
Prisoner Carter. I was distressed for a lodging and went to Williams's house; she gave me a light; I went up stairs and that man that is standing there, directly laid hold of me and said, I was the person he wanted; I asked him why; he said, he had been robbed; I called out for assistance, 
               
                  Mary
                   Williams
               



             came up; I told him not to ill use me, but call for assistance, and I would not go out of the house till a constable came, when he came I was directly taken to the watch-house and searched before that man's face that is standing there; this young woman was not in my company, I never had the money though I have been lying in prison ever since.

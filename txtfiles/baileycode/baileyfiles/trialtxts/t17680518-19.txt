            . My house is in Sackville-street; I have another on Haverstock-hill


, upon the road to Hampstead; on the 2d of May I went to that last mentioned, about four in the afternoon; all my goods were in their places there; I locked up the house about seven in the evening, and returned to my house in Sackville-street : on Tuesday the 3d I went again; upon opening the hall-door I saw the head of my clock-case standing upon the floor near the chimney, the clock was gone, with the pendulum, pullies, and winder; I missed a grey coat lined with black, black buttons and holes; in the parlour I missed a sussian frock, and a pair of dark dimity breeches; I went up into my dining-room, there I missed from over the chimney a pair of horse-pistols made by Barber, a powder-flask, a leather bullet-bag; out of a chest in my bed-room I missed three pair of Holland sheets, marked D. M. S. or M. R. a white cotton counterpane, a woman's cotton night-gown, printed red and blue, a cotton bed-gown, red and white, a flowered muslin toilet cloth, two bordered damask napkins, with flower baskets in the middle, a dimity waistcoat, a green silk bonnet; all these I advertised May the 6th: the following, which were taken out of the same chest, were not then recollected, a blue and white cheque-apron, a small table-cloth, a damask napkin, a silk handkerchief, and a linen ditto, and some pillowbears; I went up into the servants room, there I discocovered the thief had broke in by the help of some ladder thro' a back window of six squares of glass; it is about twenty-four feet from the ground: when in the garret they had free liberty of the whole house, consisting of five apartments; the chambers, closets, and cupboard doors were all left open, to admit of free air; the rooms I found were all over with tallow, candle droppings, and bits of candles, and pieces of matches scattered about; I found a candle had been stuck upon the bottom of a sash in the hall, it had burnt one of the bottom rails; there were candles, tinder, matches, steel, and flint in the house; whether they used them, or whether they brought candle with them, I cannot tell; I hired a man at Hampstead to be in the house, and then returned to town about seven in the evening; my house was robbed also a second night of a pair of sheets, a bag, and a pair of scissars; I know none of the prisoners.


                  John 
                  Noaks 
               



            . I am a constable, I had information that some of these things were at the house of one Pollard in St. Giles's, a cow-keeper; Mr. Marsden and Mr. Heley went with me, there I found some sheets cut up to make shifts of (several pieces produced in court.)
Shurel. I have compared these pieces with some sheets of mine at home, I think I could safely swear to them to be my property.
Noaks. We had information where the prisoners lived; the woman where we found this cloth sent one of her servants with us to Duck-lane, Westminster, there we found 
               
                  Susanna 
                  Stapleton 
               



            ; (a gown, an apron, a sheet, the clock, and a bonnet produced in court.)
Shurel. This sheet and clock are mine, the green bonnet is my wife's.
Noaks. I have some more things, which I found at a pawnbroker's; Stapleton said her husband had given her some of these things to pawn, and she would show me where they were pawned; she went with me to a pawnbroker in Stretton's-ground, there I found a gown, an apron, a pair of breeches, and a sheet (produced in court, and deposed to by prosecutor;) I know nothing against Curtis; the husband was taken, and I was sent for to Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            's to search him; I found this pair of scissars upon him (produced and deposed to by prosecutor.)


                  John 
                  Heley 
               



            . I went with Mr. Noaks to St. Giles's (be confirmed the evidence given by Noaks.)
Catherine Lane. The woman at the bar brought this grey coat to me on the 4th of May, and pledged it in her own name (produced and deposed to.)


                  John 
                  Leicester 
               



            . I live at Mr. Pollard's, a cow-keeper; Stapleton delivered three shift bodies cut out to me, to be made up for his wife; I think I saw something in the hands of the prisoner like a pair of pistols; the gentleman has got the shift bodies again of me.


                  Hannah 
                  Heley 
               



            . On the 4th of May I was in my own habitation in Nag's-head-yard by Monmouth-street; I heard a great noise about a robbery, the woman at the bar declared to her sister there were a clock, pistols and Holland sheets; said she, get away, for I am sure you will be all hanged; so the next day I went to Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            , and told him I had seen them cutting some sheets.
Thomas Stapleton's defence.
I am very innocent of it, I have not long been come from Hertfordshire from my grandfather; I gave my landlady the key, and went there; my grandfather gave me two fowls and twenty-three eggs; I came up again; then they took me up, and had me before Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            ; they tied my hands, I went up very contented; they had me down to the Gatehouse, there I staid; then they brought me to Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            's again, they sent me to the start *.

I found the things in the room.

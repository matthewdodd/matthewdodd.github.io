                  DANIEL 
                  BURGESS
               



            . I live in Duke-street, and am a licensed hawker
. On Monday, the 20th of October, I opened a stall at the Horse Grenadier, public-house, Oxford-street



, and in the evening, between five and six o'clock, I packed my goods up to take them home, and went into the house to leave my board and baize - I was not there above a minute, and on coming out, my box, containing the articles stated in the indictment was stolen. I found a pencil-case, a pair of ear-rings, a steel purse and clasp, on Thursday, and a few days afterwards two tortoiseshell combs,
Prisoner ASBURY. Q. Was the box locked - A. I forget.


                  THOMAS 
                  ASBURY
               



            . I am the prisoner Asbury's brother. He came to my room on Tuesday morning, the 21st of October, before nine o'clock, I was in bed - he threw a steel purse and breast pin on the bed, and said, "There is a purse and breast pin for you;" he did not say where he got them. The officer found them in my room on Thursday morning. I live in the second floor back room, in Jones's-court, Buckeridge-street; he lived on the first floor front room, at No. 3, in the court. I get my living in Piccadilly, by holding gentlemens' horses, and calling coaches.


                  ELIZABETH 
                  JENKINS
               



            . I live at No. 13, Buckeridge-street, with the last witness. Asbury came and threw a purse and pin on the bed - we were both in bed - I did not ask where he got them. I believe he got his living in the same way as his brother. The officers also found a steel clasp, a pencil case, some snaps, and a necklace in my room. 
               
                  Jane 
                  Bibbs
               



             had brought them to me on Wednesday night, and on Thursday morning the officers came. The two prisoners lodged at No. 3. I never saw Groves with the property


                  JANE 
                  BIBBS
               



            . I am servant at the same house as Jenkins. 
               
                  John 
                  Asbury
               



             gave me a silver pencil case on the Monday night - also two tortoiseshell combs, a steel clasp, a pair of ear-ring drops, and four snaps. I kept them in my room till Wednesday night, and then took them up to Jenkins's room, to shew to her. My mistress called me down, and I left them there. I sleep on the first floor. The house is let to men and women. The officers came and found them next morning. Groves lodged with 
               
                  John 
                  Asbury
               



            .


                  JANE 
                  ALDRIDGE
               



            . I live on the second floor front room of this house, and go out to work. On the 20th of October, between five and six o'clock in the afternoon, Groves came into my room, with a brown box in his hand - it appeared like mahogany - he wished to leave it while he got the key of his own room - he lives at No. 3; he returned in a short time, followed by 
               
                  John 
                  Asbury
               



            , who took the box up and carried it down stairs. Groves followed him - I had occasion to go to their lodgings to speak to the servant (Bibbs), who I found up in their room with them. The box was on a bed - there are three beds in the room; it was open - I saw several different articles, beads, trinkets, ear-rings, all in a heap.
Q. Did it not appear strange to you that they should have such things - A. I did not strike me; I said nothing about it; but as I was going out, Groves gave me a comb. He had been in my room on the Sunday, and I washed some things for him. I suppose it was for that; a young girl, who lived in my room, felt offended at having nothing given her, and asked me to give her the comb, which 
               
                  John 
                  Asbury
               



             gave me on the same night. I gave her the brooch and comb. She was taken up, and said she had bought them - the brooch has been produced.
Prisoner ASBURY. Q. Were not Groves and you in the room when I came home - A. Yes.
Q. Did not you hear Groves ask me to carry the box box while he fetched the key - A. No.


                  BENJAMIN 
                  SCHOFIED
               



            . I am a constable. On Thursday, the 23d of October, in the morning, Ballard, Wells, and I, went to this house, No. 13, Buckeridge-street - we got there before five o'clock, and found Bibbs in her room, and a tortoiseshell comb was found in a bandbox; on the second floor back-room were 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Asbury
               



             and Jenkins in bed, and in their room were a steel purse and two steel clasps. I enquired for a sailor, and was directed to the next room, where we found Groves on the bed, with his clothes on, with Aldridge, and another girl, named Thompson, was in the bed. We took the whole seven into custody. I charged Groves with taking the box - he denied it. I took him to the watch-house, and in going from there to the Office, he said voluntarily that he was determined to tell the whole truth, in consequence of Asbury cheating him and selling the goods; and that he had stolen the box. Asbury was not present - he was taken that morning.


                  JOHN 
                  WALES
               



            . I am an officer. I went with the witnesses - knocked at Bibbs's door; the comb was found in the bandbox; we went to the back room, second floor, and found 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Asbury
               



             and Jenkins, and in a small box were two pairs of ear-drops and rings, four clasps. In the next room I found Groves on the bed with Aldridge and Thompson. Groves denied his name, and denied the robbery. I think he gave the name of Jones. Bibbs gave me a ring off her finger. I took them all to the watch-house, and about eleven o'clock that morning I took Asbury in St. Martin's-lane. He denied the charge. When we got to the Office, I told him the other prisoners were in custody, he then said he did not steal it, but knew something of the robbery.


                  WILLIAM 
                  BALLARD
               



            . I am an officer, and went with the witnesses. I was the first who entered Groves's room, and asked if he was not known by the name of Sailor? He said his name was Groves. I have a brooch, a clasp, and a pair of ear-drops, given me by Thompson's uncle. I had questioned Aldridge closely what she had done with what was given to her? She at last said she gave them to Thompson.


                  JANE 
                  ALDRIDGE
               



            . This is the brooch Asbury gave me. I cannot speak to the other things.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
GROVES'S Defence. I am guilty, but Asbury was not with me. I gave him the things, but he did not know where I got them.
ASBURY'S Defence. When I came home on Monday. I went into my brother's room, which is next to mine. I saw Groves, Aldridge, and a young woman there, and the box on the bed. He said it was a box he got from his brother, and asked me to carry it up to the room for him, while he got the key. We both sleep together. I carriedit up - he opened it, and gave Aldrige a comb. I asked where he got it - he said from his brother, and laughed, and gave me several things, which I gave the young women.

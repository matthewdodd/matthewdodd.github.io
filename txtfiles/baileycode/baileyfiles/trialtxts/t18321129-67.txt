            . I am in the employ of Mr. Nathaniel Smith Machin and others; they are auctioneer
s, and live in King-street, Covent-garden


. On the 28th of June the prisoner came to the sale-room; I did not see any one with him - I handed him a silver hunting watch out of Mr. Hindrey's hand; I turned round, and he and the watch were gone - I do not think any one could have taken it but him.

            . I was at the sale-room, and looked at the watch; I gave it back to Meredith, and I suppose he gave it to the prisoner, but I did not notice the prisonerthere; the watch was immediately missed, and I gave a description of it.

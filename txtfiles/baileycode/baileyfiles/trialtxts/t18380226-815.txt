WALTER LLOYD
. I am a butcher, and live in Berkeley-street, Clerkenwell. About two o'clock on Saturday, the 10th of February, I was in my parlour, and received information—I ran out, and found Williamson in the hands of the officer, with a pig's head in a bag—it was mine—Brown was brought up by a policeman, about a minute afterwards.





ANDREW COLLARD
. I live in Albemarle-street, Clerkenwell. On Saturday afternoon, I was at the corner of Berkeley-street, and saw the two prisoners walking up and down—I saw Brown take the pig's head off the prosecutor's show-board, and give it to Williamson, who put it into the bag—he was secured.


Brown. I was not taken for a quarter of an hour—I did not take the head. Witness. I am quite sure he took it.





ANTHONY BOOGIES
. I saw Brown take the pig's head off Mr. Lloyd's shop-hoard, and pass it to Williamson—I followed and helped to secure him.

Brown. I was coming down Wilderness-row, a boy said, "There goes one of them"—the witness turned round and said to the policeman, "I think that is one of them that took it." Witness. I did not say so.

Brown. The policeman said, if he did not say I took it I should get off. Witness. He did not.

Brown's Defence. I did not take it—I had been looking for employ, and was coming down towards John-street, when a boy said, "There goes one of them," and the gentleman collared me.

BROWN†—


GUILTY
. Aged 16.—

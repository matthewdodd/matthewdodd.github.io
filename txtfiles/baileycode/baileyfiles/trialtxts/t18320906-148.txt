. On the 16th of July I was on Holbornhill; I felt something at my pocket, and saw the prisoner with my handkerchief in his hand - he dropped it, and the officer took it up; this is it.
Prisoner. Q. If you saw it in my hand, why strike me, and offer to search me in the street? A. I did nothing of the kind; you offered to strike me.

            . I saw the prosecutor holding the prisoner - the handkerchief was down by his side - I did not see him strike the prisoner.
Prisoner. You said you saw two young men and a young woman run away. Witness. No, I did not.

RICHARD JONES re-examined. Q. Was there any other person near you? A. There was a woman with the prisoner; he said, "Here is your handkerchief," and dropped it down.
JOHN BEAN. The prosecutor was as sober as he is now.

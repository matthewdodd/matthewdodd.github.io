            , My husband is a shipwright, and lives in Ocean-street, Stepney


. On the 23d of January, about half-past one o'clock I was at my window, and saw a man take the coat off the prosecutor's cart, while he was gone into a house with some coals; he came out in about half a minute, and I gave the alarm - the man ran up the street. I cannot say the prisoner is the man.

            . I drive a coal cart for Mr. Cane. I was delivering coals in Ocean-street, and left my coat on the cart; Willis alarmed me, I missed it, and saw the prisoner running with it - he dropped it just before I got up. I secured him, before I lost sight of him.

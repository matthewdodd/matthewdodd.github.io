JOHN STAINER. I am an excavator
. I was at work on the 20th of April near Hyde Park-corner


 - I put down my jacket, and did not miss it till a person told me he saw a man run away with it; I went out, and saw the prisoner taken with it; he was a stranger, and had no right to it.

            . I was at work at the common sewer, and heard an alarm that the jacket was gone; I pursued the prisoner - he dropped the jacket from under his coat, and I took him.

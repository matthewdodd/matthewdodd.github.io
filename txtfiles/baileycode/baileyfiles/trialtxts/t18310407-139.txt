 - the prisoner had been my journeyman
 from Friday to Wednesday. I went out about half-past three o'clock, and left him at home at work; I had no other person working for me - when I returned, he and this property were gone; he was apprehended this day month - I have never seen the property since - I took him out of charity more than any thing else; he had scarcely a shirt to his back.

            . I work for Mr. Foster. On Wednesday, the 23rd of February, I saw the prisoner at work there when I went up to clean the room, and when I went down, he had absconded with all these things from the upper room - Mr. Foster had been out about two hours.
Prisoner's Defence. On the afternoon these things were missed I asked for a pair of upper leathers, which were not ready - Mr. Foster said it would be a good opportunity for Mrs. Isaacson to clean the room; I went to take a walk, left the children playing in the room, and the things all safe - I had not so much as would pay for my lodging while I was there; had I had the tools I could have got work - I need not depend on Mr. Foster's charity.

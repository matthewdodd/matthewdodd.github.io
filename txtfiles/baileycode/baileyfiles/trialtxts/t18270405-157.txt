THOMAS JOHNSON. I am a cabinet-maker
, and live at Hoxton. On the 28th of February I was working in an unfinished house in Brick wood-place


; I fastened it up at one o'clock, and went to dinner - I left my tools there - when I returned and opened the door I saw the prisoner going out of the parlour, with these tools all packed up in his apron - he was a stranger. I took him into custody.

            . I am an officer. I was sent for, and took the prisoner with these tools.
Prisoner's Defence. I was very ill, and in great distress - he cannot swear to one of the saws, because it does not belong to him.

            . They are all mine except one, which was in my care.

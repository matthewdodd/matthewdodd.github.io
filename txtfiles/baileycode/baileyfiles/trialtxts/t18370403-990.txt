 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
20th of March; 2 1/2 lbs. weight of bacon, value 1s., the goods of 



Joseph Bassett.






JOSEPH BASSETT
. I keep a shop at Uxbridge. On the 20th of March, the prisoner came, and bought a 1/4 lb. of cooked meat—when he went out, I missed 2 1/2 b. of bacon—I went out and found him about five yards from the shop, in the act of putting it down on the ground—I gave him in charge—I knew him before.

Prisoner. Q. Have I not always paid my way, and borne a good cha racter? A. I am sorry to say very different—he came to my shop every night, and I generally lost bacon—he used to watch me out.





GILES HUTSON
. I saw the prisoner take the bacon out of the window.
(The prisoner pleaded poverty.)




GUILTY
.• Aged 45.—


Transported for Seven Years.

Before Lord Chief Justice Tindal.

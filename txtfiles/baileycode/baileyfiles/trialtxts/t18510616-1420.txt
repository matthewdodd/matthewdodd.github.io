, 

stealing 1 thimble, value 1s.; 1 shilling, 1 six-pence, 3 pence, and 2 halfpence; the property of 



Charles Titchener, from the person of 



Ann Titchener: having been before convicted.






ANN TITCHENER
. I am the wife of Charles Titchener, of Wandsworth. On 11th June I was at Wandsworth fair; and in consequence of what Townsend told me, I examined my pocket, and missed a shilling, a sixpence, 4d. in copper, and a silver thimble—I had them safe an hour before.





JOHN TOWNSEND
. I was at the fair, and saw the prisoner put his hand into Mrs. Titchener's pocket—on his turning to go away, I caught hold of his hand, and found in it four halfpence, a sixpence, and this silver thimble—I did not find any shilling—I gave him into custody.





JOHN MOSS
 (City policeman, 225). I produce a certificate of the prisoner's conviction—(read—John Long, convicted at Clerkenwell, Aug., 1850, of stealing money from the person; confined six months)—I was present at that trial—the prisoner is the person.

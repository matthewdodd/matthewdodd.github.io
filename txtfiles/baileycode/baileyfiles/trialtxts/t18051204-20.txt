            ? - A. Yes, he lived with me at different times from seven to nine years; I am a shoemaker
, he was not my apprentice; 
               
                  William 
                  Gross
               



             is his father. The father had lodged at my house, but not at the present time.
Q. On the 20th of November last do you remember having a box in your custody? - A. Yes, it stood by the side of my bed upon another box above stairs, I had seen it in the morning when I got up.

                  Eastless
               



            , two shillings, a petticoat, one shillling, and a silk cloak, two shillings.
Q. When do you say he took this box. - A. Between 6 and 7 o'clock in the evening on the 20th of November.
Q. Was 
               
                  William 
                  Smith Gross
               



             in your service at that time? - A. No, about a month before he was.
Q. Upon missing your box what did you do? - A. I went to all the pawnbrokers down Shoreditch, till I came to Mr. Davison the pawnbroker.
Q. Whereabouts is your house? - A. 144, Shoreditch.
Q. How far is that from your house? - A. It may be three quarters of a mile.
Q. Did you hear of any of your goods. - A. I saw the foreman in the shop folding up my shirts.
Q. Did you see any other of your property there? - A. Yes, another shirt and a cottonhandkerchief. I told the pawnbroker that was my property; he said the lad had just run out of the door that brought it in; Mr. Martin and me run out of the door after him; he had not pawned it, he had offered it to sell. When the lad saw me come in the shop, I suppose he ran out. Martin took the boy, but he was rescued from me by three women; I followed behind and took the prisoner William Gross, the father, with a bundle upon him of mine, tied up in a coloured handkerchief; I laid hold of him by the collar, and asked him what he had got there; he said it was his own property; I looked the man in the face and I knew him, and he trembled a great deal; then I said let me look at the bundle; he said you may, but it is my property; I looked at it, and saw that it was part of the property that I had lost; I took him back to Mr. Davidson's the pawnbroker, and gave charge of him to an officer.

             sworn. I occupy the front shop of Mr. Riggs, and an apartment up stairs.
Q. On the 20th of November last who was in that shop in the course of the day? - A. My wife and servant; I was out some part of that day.
Q. You know this bed-room where this box was taken? - A. Yes, the one pair of stairs; I sleep in the second pair of stairs, there is a passage to go up stairs; my shop is partitioned off.
Q. So that any body may go up stairs without being perceived by any body in the shop? - A. They might if there were nobody looking after them.
Q. Were you at home when this box was missed? - A. Yes, I had come in about five minutes after the box was missing; I went out with Mr. Riggs to the several pawnbrokers, and at last we came to Davidson's; Mr. Riggs went in there first, I followed him, and from what passed, I followed the boy 
               
                  William 
                  Smith Gross
               



            , and caught him; he was running on the pavement, and I run on the curb, because I would not be stopped by the people; when I called Stop Thief, then he walked; I overtook him; this was rather better than twenty minutes past eight; it was quite dark; I took him by the collar; says I, you are the thief, and you shall come along with me; the lad was coming very quietly, there was some women caught me by the neck behind, while two men stood in the front of me; they rescued him from me; the women almost choaked me, so that I could hardly see out of my eyes; the boy went off.
Q. How was the boy taken? - A. He was taken the same night; I saw him in custody in Spital-fields watch-house.

Q. Do you remember this night, the 20th of November, when this box was missing? - A. I do, I went after the boy, I knew where he and his father lived; I watched about the place, I saw the boy as I thought going towards his father's house, but instead of going in he went past; I called out Stop thief, and he was taken, and I lodged him in the watch-house.

             sworn. I am servant to Mr. Clarke, Bishopsgate-street, a pawnbroker.
Q. Look at the prisoners, do you know their persons? - A. I think I do, I should not wish to swear positively to the lad; on the evening of the 20th of November, a few minutes before eight o'clock, a lad brought me two shirts to pledge, he told me they were his father's, and his father lived at No. 7, Duke-street.
Q. (To Riggs.) Does Gross the father keep a house in Dean-street? - A. Not as I know of.
Q. Where is the house you saw the boy? - A. Flower and Dean-street; it is near it.

             the elder's Defence. On the 20th of November, between six and seven o'clock my lad left work, he was gone about an hour out; I was at tea; when he came back again I was up in the garret at work; he came up to me with a bundle, and told me he had found it; I questioned him several times where he had found it, he told me he found it down Whitechapel Road; and I thought the lad having found it, I could claim it as my property, I untied the bundle, I looked at the contents; one part I pledged, and the other I had in my hand when I was taken.

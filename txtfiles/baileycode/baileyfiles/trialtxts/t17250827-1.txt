             thus deposed: The Prisoner came into my Master's Shop to cheapen Muslin. I shew'd her several Pieces. She was very difficult. I saw her put a Piece under her Petticoat, and let her go out with it; but I presently follow'd, and took it upon her. The Prisoner thus defended herself: I went into Mr. Holloway's Shop to buy 'ome Muslin-Wm. Ponds perceiving me to be an innocent Country Girl, he chuck'd me under the Chin, and said, I was a pretty Creature, and ask'd if I did not come out of Yorkshire. I told him yes; and then he took me into the back Part of the Shop, and put his Hand under my Coats, and gave me the Muslin to have to do with me; and because I would not let him, he charged me with this Robbery. 


               Guilty value 10 d.

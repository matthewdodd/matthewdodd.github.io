            . I am a bricklayer's labourer
; I was at the pay-table with my fellow workmen; the prisoner came in, and said she was dry and hungry; I ordered her a pint of beer; she sat down and drank it, and went out, and came back again in about a quarter of an hour, and sat down by me, and pulled out a key, and said she had an apartment of her own, and I might go to bed with her; I said, I would not; I went home between nine and ten; she followed me into Drury-lane; I suspected her; I took my watch out of my fob to put it in my coat pocket; she took it out of my hand and ran away with it; I could not catch her; I called, Stop thief; she got off; then I went back to the house again, and enquired where she lived; on the Friday following I took her; when before the Justice, she said she never saw me before in her life.

            . I live at the public-house; I saw the prisoner go out after Macguire, and in about a quarter of an hour after he came back, and said he had lost his watch; I saw he had it before he went out.
Prisoner's defence.
I know nothing of the matter; he wants to hand me for nothing at all.

            . I live at No. 4, Red Lion street, Whitechapel


. This piece of carpeting, was placed inside the shop about a yard from the door; between eleven and twelve in the afternoon; there was an alarm given, and in consequence of some information somebody pursued after the prisoner; the prisoner was brought back, and the carpet with her. I know the carpet to be mine though there is no marks upon it. I had some more of the same pattern.

            . I am mother to the last witness. I did not see the prisoner take the carpet; an alarm was given. I went to the door, and saw the prisoner at a little distance; she was stooping, and endeavouring to hide the carpet if she could. She was eight or ten yards from the shop. When I came up to her, she sat down; some more people assisted us to bring her back to the shop.
Prisoner's Defence. I was going along, and a porter with a load, pushed me against the carpet, and knocked it down; and I was going to put it up again, when they stopped me.

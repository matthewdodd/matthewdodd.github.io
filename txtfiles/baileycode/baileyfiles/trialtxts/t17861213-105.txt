             sworn.
The prisoner Parkins was a servant
 of mine; he went out at nine on Thursday, the 30th of October; I followed him and overtook him, a little way from my own house; I had strong suspicion of him; I asked him where he was going; he said to his washer-woman's; I told him I wanted to speak to him, and he stopped; he had a bundle; he said it was some linen; I found there was no linen in it; I searched it, and found there was some parcels that belonged to me; I took hold of one arm myself, and desired a person he was talking to, to lead him into the house, which he did; I then sent for a constable; he searched him in my presence, and took six papers of nails out of his pocket, and I ordered the constable to take them into his possession, and take him to the watch-house; when he came there, he begged for mercy of me; I left him there for that night, the next morning he was taken before the Justice; the things were produced, and he was committed to Tothill-fields Bridewell; I know nothing of Fawcett.
Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. Whose property are these? - Mine.
Has your son any share in your trade? - None at all, they are my sole property.

            , Junior, sworn.
I saw the prisoner go to the place in our shop, on Monday evening the 30th of October, I was on the side of the shop; I saw him take out several parcels; I could not distinguish how many, nor what they were, only I know by the place he was taking them out of, that they were coffin nails.
Mr. Garrow. Let Barnett step out of Court.

            . I was in our shop; it has a glass partition across the middle of it; I was on one side the glass partition; and he on the other; nobody else was in the shop but him and me; seeing him go out of the shop, I ran and called my father, I found him just by the door; I saw the nails taken from him.
Mr. Garrow. Barnett was taken up as a receiver? - He surrendered; he was suspected, and charged by Parkins.

             sworn.
I was the person that was speaking to the prisoner at the time his master came and took him; I have known him about three weeks; I was asking him whether he knew where one Mr. Bailley lived in St. Martin's lane; I knew nothing of what he had been about; I have heard he had been suspected, and I detained him till Mr. Bent came out.


                  JOHN

             sworn.
I am beadle; I produce the property which I found on the prisoner, in the entrance of Mr. Bent's passage; I found them in the different pockets of the prisoner.
(Deposed to.)


                  WILLIAM
                   BARNETT
               



             sworn.
Mr. Fawcett called at my house and left a parcel of clout nails, and left word he would call on Sunday morning; that was on the 29th of October; we went from there to the Black Dog, a public house, about five doors from my house; Mr. Fawcett desired me to dispose of them.
Court. You need not say any thing about Fawcett.
Mr. Garrow, How long is it since you was convicted? - Never in my life.
Then you was not transported? - Never in my life; in the evening he came to me and left six sets of castors with me; on Tuesday morning Mr. Fawcett came to me.
Where do you live? - In Castle-street, Long-acre, No. 26, where I have lived three years and a half.
Perhaps you have never been abroad? - Yes, twice; I went to sea from school, and in the year 1779 I was pressed.
Court. I cannot see why this fellow was not indicted for a receiver.

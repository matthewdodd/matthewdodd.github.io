            . I am an officer of Marlborough-street. I was in High-street, St. Giles's, and saw the prisoner following Edwards; he pulled the handkerchief a little way out - he pulled it three times between High-street and Coventry-street, Haymarket, and in Coventry-street he went up very close. I saw him cross the street, and secured him with the handkerchief in his hand.

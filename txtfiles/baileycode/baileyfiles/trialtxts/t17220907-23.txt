                     Charles 
                     Burton 
                  



               
            , Bart.
 of St. Gregory


, was indicted for 


               privately stealing out of the Shop of 
                     
                        
                           Joseph 
                           Ward 
                        




                      
                  , a Cornelian Seal set in Gold, value 15 s.
             on the 12th of July
 last. It appeared that the prisoner cheapened a Seal at Mr. Ward's Shop, but could not agree upon the price. Mrs. Kirton missing a Seal, and observing a Handkerchief in his Hand, desired him to shake it, which he did, holding one corner of it fast; but she took it from him, and the Seal dropt out. The prisoner in his Defence said, he knew not how the Seal came there, unless she put it there. Some of his Neighbours gave him the Character of a civil Gentleman, come of a good Family in Lincolnshire, but lately, by Misfortunes, reduc'd. 


               Guilty to the value of 4 s. and 10 d.

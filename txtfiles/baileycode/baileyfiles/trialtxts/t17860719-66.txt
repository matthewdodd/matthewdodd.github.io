             sworn.
I know the prisoner; he came as a lodger
 to my house; my husband and me were both at home; he took the lodging on the 20th and set off the 21st; when he went away, I saw his back bulge out; I was sitting up stairs in bed; I told my husband to pursue him but he did not; he was to pay me eighteen pence a week; I put on my shoes and run into the street after him; he was taken for the same offence by another woman; I never saw my sheets again.
You do not know they were sheets in his pocket? - I missed a pair of sheets and a hat; I never saw them again.
Prisoner. Pray did I take the lodging of you? - Yes.
How came you to say before the Justice, that you did not let the lodgings, you said, you was not at home, you was at work? - I never said so; he came of a Friday, I was out, he came again on Saturday; I was out and my husband, about a quarter after ten, he said, he was the person that agreed for the lodgings, he sat down in the kitchen for some time till I made the bed, then he went up and my husband carried up the candle with him; I pursued him immediately in the morning, and my husband run up stairs, and called out, oh, my God, the sheets are gone.

             sworn.
I was present when the prisoner came in Saturday night; he sat down by the side of me; he said, he would give me eighteen pence a week for the lodgings, to pay weekly, but he would have a bed to himself; after my wife had made the bed I went up with a candle, and in the morning between five and six I heard him unbolting the door, and I jumped out of bed; he had the street door open; my wife sat up in the bed; I unlocked the door as she sat up in the bed, she saw something bulge, she called out; I ran up stairs and found the sheets were gone, I called out and she ran after him, but he was gone; I never found my sheets again; I missed the sheets and a hat.
PRISONER's DEFENCE.
My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, the prosecutor stood as I came down stairs; I asked him what o'clock it was, he said, six or half past six, and I wished him a good morning; I should think if any body had robbed him, they would not have stopped to have asked questions; why did not the woman follow me, I went gently from the door, and I went to the public house over the way.
Mrs. Kemp. I saw nothing of him; I run immediately; I never saw him till I saw him at the Justice's.
The prisoner called three witnesses who gave him a good character.

1452. 



JOHN KENT
 was indicted

 for stealing 1 musical instrument called a cornopean, value 1l. 10s., the goods of 



James Lawrence; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






WILLIAM BLEACH
. I am shopman to James Lawrence; he is a general dealer; he had a cornopean safe in his shop between seven and eight o'clock on the 18th of June—I saw the prisoner stand in front of the shop—I went for a ladder, and saw the prisoner going away with his hands in front of him—a person spoke to me, and I went after the prisoner, who had got a quarter of a mile—when I got nearly to him, and before I spoke to him, he turned and said, "D——your eyes, what do you want with me?"—I said nothing, and he ran on—I ran after him, and when I came up to him he struck me—he then ran on, and took this cornopean from under his coat, and threw it at me—I ran on and took him, and gave him to the policeman—this is the cornopean—it is my master's.

Prisoner. There was a mob running; he laid hold of me; I said, "What do you want?" he said I stole the cornopean; I went with him.





HENRY HUNT
 (police-constable M 82.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction (at Surrey Sessions)—(read—Convicted 2nd Dec., 1844, and confined six months)—the prisoner is the man.

PHILIP HARDWICK. I am an architect
, and live in Russell-square. On the 11th of July, about nine o'clock in the morning, I was in Fleet-street, near Bridge-street


, and felt a pressure, and my pocket was lighter than before; I turned round, and found the prisoner close at my elbow - he appeared alone; nobody but him was near enough to take my handkerchief - I collared, and gave him in charge; I saw my handkerchief about a yard from him, laying in the carriage-road - I saw it taken up; he asked what I meant by collaring him, and denied the charge: Mr. Hudson was with me.
MR. HUDSON. I am a Prothonatary of the Court of Common Pleas. I was with Mr. Hardwick, who seized the prisoner, and crossed the road - I saw the prisoner at that instant throw the handkerchief down, which I took up and gave to Mr. Hardwick.

            . I am a constable. The prisoner was brougth to the watch-house with this handkerchief.(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. For him to say nobody was near me is false; there were a number of people passing at the time I was.

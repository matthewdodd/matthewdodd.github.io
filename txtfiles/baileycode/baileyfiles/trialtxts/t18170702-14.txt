            . I am a constable. On the 2d of June I had information that some men were picking geese in Mr. Wood's grounds; I went there, and the prisoners came out-Trueman had a sack on his back, I went up and asked him what he had there - He said, geese. I secured them both. Bavin claimed the geese.
Both the prisoners pleaded distress.

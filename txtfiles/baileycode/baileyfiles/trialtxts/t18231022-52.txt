            . I am a constable. On the 17th of October, I was in Seven-dials, about half-past eight o'clock at night, and saw six or eight young men on the opposite side; the prisoner was with them; he crossed over to the same side as I was, and had a sugar loaf in his apron - I asked him what he had there; he said what was that to me; he made some resistance, I called for the watchman. I insisted on knowing where he was going; he said to No. 9, Greek-street, Soho. We said we would take him there - we went about six yards; he then turned round, and said,
"No, I'll go to the watch-house." The prosecutor afterward claimed the loaf.

            , a grocer
, Gerrard-street. This sugar was taken from our shop; Collington came and asked if we had lost anything, and upon looking we missed this. I know it to be ours; it has a mark in my writing on it.

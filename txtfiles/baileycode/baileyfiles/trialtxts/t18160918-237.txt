JAMES ROLFE. About eight o'clock in the morning of the 14th of September, the street door was shut fast, and was opened by someone; and this caddy stolen off a table in the parlour.
WILLIAM CLARK. I saw Willoughby at about ten in the morning of the 14th of September, with a tea-caddy; they went into a fishmongers, at the corner of Holles-street; I went in; they were opening the eaddy with a key, and they emptied the tea out of the boxes. I then put my head over the settle, and said, as you have emptied the the tea out of the caddy, will you sell the caddy; and one of them said, no not to you. I then went and got some assistance, and took them both; I searched them both, and on Willoughby I found these latch keys, and a small skeleton key, for opening desks; and another small key and a knife.

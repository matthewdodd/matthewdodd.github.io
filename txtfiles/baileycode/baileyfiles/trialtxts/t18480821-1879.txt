JOHN HAZEL



, stealing 100lbs. weight of tea, value 13l., and 1 chest, 1s.; the goods of 



Thomas Younghusband and another.






EDWARD JOHNSON
. I am clerk to Thomas Younghusband and Son, of Basing-lane, carriers. On 14th July, between seven and eight o'clock, a chest of tea was loaded, with other goods, into a three-borse wagon, to go to the terminus of the Great-Western Railway—it was directed to Mr. Salmon, at Reading—I saw it securely put in—it was an outside package—Goodrich was wagoner—I went to the railway, to superintend the unloading of the wagon—I found the chest was gone.

Cross-examined by
MR. PARNELL. Q. Who went with the Wagon? A. Henry Wooton, Goodrich was with him—I know it was in the wagon, I called it over to the clerk.





ROBERT GOODRICH
. I am in Messrs. Younghusband's employ—I went with this wagon from Basing-lane to the Great-Western Railway—I walked on the near side—I saw the chest at Paddington in its place—I did not miss it at all—I remained with the wagon till eleven o'clock, it was then on the Company's premises—it got there a few minutes to ten—the wagoner took off his horses, and then left me in charge of it till Johnson came.





EDWARD JOHNSON
. I arrived at five minutes to ten o'clock—the chest was not in the wagon then—it would arrive from nine to half-past nine o'clock.

Cross-examined by
MR. ROBINSON. Q. Whose was this tea? A. Mr.

Younghusband's, till it got to the Railway Company—Goodrich was there when I arrived, he left before me—I left the station at a quarter before twelve o'clock—the Company are not responsible for the goods till they are ticked off by them.

Cross-examined by
MR. PARNELL. Q. How was the wagon secured when you sent it? A. It was well corded, and a good tarpaulin over it—when I got to the railway the tarpaulin was untied—as soon as the man got on the wagon he found something was gone—they had not taken anything off then—the tarpaulin would be loosened, waiting for me—the boy was in charge of it—Henry Wootton was wagoner—he is not here.





THOMAS WEAKFORD
 (policeman, H 38.) On 13th July, about a quarter to twelve at night, I saw a horse and cart in Leman-street, Whitechapel—the two prisoners were in it—I asked what they were waiting there for, at that time of night—Brown had the reins—he said, "I am waiting for the carman: he is gone into the public-house, to get half-a-pint of beer and light his pipe"—there was a public-house about twenty yards off, but it was closed—I went round the cart, and saw "William Hurcum" on it, and an address—Hazell jumped out and ran away—I knew him before—I got in, and saw this chest of tea—I asked Brown what was in it—he said he did not know—I asked who the horse and cart belonged to—he said he did not know—I took him to the station—Brown said it was Johnny that jumped out of the cart.

Cross-examined by
MR. ROBINSON. Q. Brown said in Leaden hall-street he asked the carman to give him a ride? A. Yes; he made no attempt to escape.

Cross-examined by
MR. PARNELL. Q. You had known Hazell? A. I had seen him driving Mr. Hurcum's cart—Mr. Hurcum lives in Dowgate-hill—his stable is in the Curtain-road.





JOB SMITH
 (policeman, G 44.) I went to the Curtain-road—I saw Hazell, with a lad—he walked very quickly up to a house in Gloucester-street, where the lad lived—I followed them, and heard somebody inside say, "Johnny, the police have been after you"—he came out, and I took him at the bottom of the street, running—I said, "I want you, respecting a chest of tea, with a cart"—he said, "Oh!"—I said, "You were with a Cart"—he said he had not been with a cart—then he said he had been with a cart, and had given it to Brown, in Oxford-street, as he wanted to go somewhere—he called Brown "Tommy boy"—he bad this apron in his pocket.

Cross-examined by
MR. PARNELL. Q. Did you know him before? A. Yes; as a carman, in Hurcum's employ, and in the service of other persons before.





ROBERT MASON
. I am in the employ of Mr. Pearce, a grocer, of Philpott-lane. On 13th July I saw the prisoners with a horse and cart, belonging to Mr. Hurcum—they had some goods of ours in the cart, to deliver—I went with them to deliver the goods at different places—I joined them about one o'clock, and left them at half-past seven, at the corner of Foster-lane, Cheapside—they had delivered all the goods then—there was not a single thing in the cart—as I was coming away, Hazell told me to call and tell Mr. Hurcum that he was going to do a job from 22, Bread-street, and then he called me back, and told me not to tell him; that he would tell him in the morning, when he booked.

Cross-examined by
MR. ROBINSON. Q. When did you give information about this? A. Not till the policeman came to my master's on the Monday following—I have been in Mr. Pearce's employ ten years—I go out with the goods—I heard on Friday morning that Hazell was in trouble for some chest

of tea—I know Brown well, by his being sent to onr shop for orders occasionally—I know he was employed by persons attending on carts.





WILLIAM HURCUM
. I am a carman, and live on Dowgate-hill—I employed Hazell as a carman, on 13th July, to take a load of goods from Mr. Pearce's, in Philpot-lane—he had my horse and cart, the same that were found in Leman-street—I do not know that I had any job in Bread-street—Hazell generally gets back about eight o'clock or half-past—it would be his duty to return about that time, unless he had a job on his way back—we are bound to take a job wherever we are hired—he might take a job by bringing me the money—we are open to a job the same as a cab in the street—I know nothing of this chest of tea.

Cross-examined by
MR. ROBINSON. Q. If the man were to get a job at ten o'clock at night, there would be no objection to his taking it? A. Not if it were for my business, I have been out all night.

Cross-examined by
MR. PARNELL. Q. Hazell had been in your service some time? A. Two years—if he is not back by eight o'clock, we book the next morning—he has always accounted for what he has done, to my knowledge—I have given him bills about three times to 22, Bread-street—I have an unknown customer there.





WILLIAM GARMENT
. I am in the employ of Mr. West, of Lady Lake's-gove. I superintended the cording of a chest of tea, which was sent to Mr. Yonnghusband's—it was to go to Mr. J. S. Salmon, of Reading—this is it—I have the receipt for the delivery of it from the carrier's.

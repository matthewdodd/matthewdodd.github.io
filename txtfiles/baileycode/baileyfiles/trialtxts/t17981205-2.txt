Q. Have the prisoner and you lived together since? - A. He claimed the privilege of a husband over me, and I could not help living with him, but I ran away from him six times; he threatened my life several times, and I put him in prison three times.
Q. Did you bring him any fortune? - A. I had respectability, and some money, when I married him; but he has blasted my character, and he has done me every public and private injury; he has put a knife to my throat, and threatened to murder me.

He came to me as a person having a place under government, and going to receive a large sum of money; he told me, and I believe he had, just left a place called the Mary-le-bonne Coffee-house, which he had kept, and then lived in a private lodging.
- GREVILLE sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am parish clerk of St. George's Hanover-square: (produces the Register-book); I wrote the entry of the marriage of Phoebe Darwell with the prisoner; I witnessed it, this is my hand-writing.


                  Q. 
               


            (To Mrs. Darwell.) Is that your hand-writing in the Register-book? - A. It is.
Court. I am very glad to observe that it is kept on parchment.
Prisoner's defence. When I was first acquainted with that woman, I kept the Mary-le-bonne Coffee-house; she did not live farther from me than it is a-cross this Court, she kept a little tobacco and snuff-shop; I told her repeatedly that I had a wife, that my wife and I had parted about sixteen years, and I did not know whether she was dead or alive; she knew I had been arrested in her apartments; she said, she was lawyer enough to know that sixteen years was long enough to wait; I told her I wished to have Counsel's opinion upon it; she said there was no occasion, for she had been a lawyer's wife, or something of that sort; she asked me to go and look at a house in Oxford-road; she did not like that, and we went about looking at different houses; and when we had got so far as the bottom of Holborn, she said we might as well go on to Doctors'-Commons; I said, for what; why, says she, for a licence; I said I have no more than one shilling and sixpence in the world; and she pulled out two guineas and gave me, and we went for the licence; she insisted upon my coming to breakfast with her the next morning, but I would not promise; when I went the next morning, she was putting on a clean pair of white stockings; I said, what, are you going out, madam; she said, why, we are going to be married to be sure; I said, I do not know any thing about it, I have got no money; says she, then I will pay for the wedding, and we were married.
For the Prisoner.

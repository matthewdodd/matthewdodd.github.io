. On the 24th of November, in the evening, the prisoner Denure came to the shop, with another girl; they were looking at a print. I suspected them. Smith then came in and bought a yard of calico, and went out with it, speaking to the others. I watched the two girls to the door, and saw Denure deliver something to Smith, I stopped them, and found a piece of gingham on Smith. I gave them in charge.

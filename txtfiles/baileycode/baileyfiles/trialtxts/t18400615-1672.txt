was indicted

for stealing, on the

Thomas Gray; and that she bad been before convicted of felony.






MARY GRAY.
I am the wife of Thomas Gray, a gardener, and live in King-street, Islington. I left home on the 31st of March to go out nursing—I came home on the 6th of April, and missed tie articles stated,

which I had seen safe when I left home—on the 22nd of May I met the prisoner—I had seen her before—I watched her to No. 46, Windsor-street—I got a constable, gave her in charge, and found my cap and shift in her possession, and my gown on her back—these are them—(looking at them.)





CHRISTIAN SACKS.
I am a shopman to Mr. Smith, pawnbroker, Lowerstreet, Islington. I produce a napkin and apron which were pledged on the 8th of April, in the name of Sarah Golding—I do not know who by—I do not know the prisoner—this is the counterpart of the duplicate.





MICHAEL SULLIVAN.
I am a policeman. I got this duplicate from the prisoner's room at No. 46, Windsor-street—I found twenty-six other duplicates, but none of them referred to this property—I took her to the station-house, then returned to the room and found this shift and cap—she had the gown on her back—she said she had bought the things—I asked her if she could show me the person she bought them of—she said she could—I did not go with her, but I offered to go.

Prisoner's Defence. I bought the things with a pair of boots and grey trowsers of a woman in Rag Fair, but she was a stranger to me; I do not know the price I gave for them.





HENRY ALLEN.
I am a policeman. I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got at Mr. Clarke's office—(read)—she is the same person.

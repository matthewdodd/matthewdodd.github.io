            . I keep a publick house
; the prisoner came to my house and called for a pint of beer, and desired my wife to help him to a private lodging; my wife sent out, but could not get one; the prisoner looking clean, we let her lodge at our house: after she had been about 3 weeks at our house, our maid was going up stairs to sheet a bed, the prisoner took the sheets and said she would do it; she laid them on the bed, and took the dirty ones away, and a pair of buck-skin breeches out of that room, the property of 
               
                  Edward 
                  Westmore 
               



            , she went away with them. We took her up about a week after, and she confessed she had pawned the sheets on Ludgate-hill, for 6 s. and the breeches in Shoe-lane, for 4 s. where we went and found them.

            . I am a pawn-broker; these breeches (producing a pair) were pawn'd at our house, in the name of 
               
                  Mary 
                  Jones

Taylor. She own'd she pawn'd them about the middle of Shoe-lane, on the left hand side going from Fleet-street; there Mr. Slayter lives.
Slayter. There is no other pawn-broker in the lane but me.

            . (Produced a pair of sheets, and a pillowbear;) I cannot swear to the woman that brought them, I believe the prisoner to be the woman; there is never another pawn-broker on Ludgate-hill but me.
Prisoner's defence.
I lodg'd at my prosecutor's house 3 weeks, and was very ill with an ague and fever; I never touch'd the sheets.

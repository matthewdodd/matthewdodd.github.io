CHARLES BLIZARD. I am a servant
 to Mr. Hall, he lives at Cottage-house, near Melksham. On the 13th of June, after twelve o'clock at night, I was in Stafford-street


; the prisoner met me, and wanted me to go with her - I said, I could not; I stood for a moment and felt my watch drawn from my pocket - I had not the least intention to go with her; I was going to the hotel - I accused her of robbing me; she said, she had not got it - I said, "You have, and I insist upon your giving it me, or you shall not go home;" I turned my head and saw the watchman, who came up and took her, and found the watch in her hand.

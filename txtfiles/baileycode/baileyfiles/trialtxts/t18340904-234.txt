JOHN WYLD. I am a haberdasher
, and live in Rathbone-place


 - the prisoner was my porter
 for about two months, and slept in my shop - I had some suspicion, and opened his trunk on Monday, the 1st of September, I found someduplicates there for a pair of half-boots, and a veil - I missed two veils.
Cross-examined by MR. STAMMERS. Q. Was it quite a new veil you missed? A. Yes - It cost me 24s. - I should sell it for 28s. - it had a mark on it, but not when it was found.

            . I am a pawnbroker, and live at No. 4, Ryders-court. I have a veil pawned on the 16th of August, to the best of my recollection by the prisoner - the duplicate produced is what I gave for it.
Cross-examined. Q. Is that a new veil or has it been worn? A. I should take it to be a new one - I advanced 10s. on that and a pair of half-boots - it is worth about 20s., - to the best of my recollection it was the prisoner - I have not the slightest doubt about him.
Prisoner. Q. Did not your master say it was but an old one, and he could not advance more? A. Not to my recollection.
MR. WYLD. I have not a doubt of this being my veil- I never saw another of the same pattern - I took the prisoner out of charity, and was to give him 15l. a-year - he denied pawning it.

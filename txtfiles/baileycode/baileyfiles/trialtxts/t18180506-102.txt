            . On the 18th of April, about nine o'clock in the evening, I was in Holborn


, and heard a noise behind me; immediately after, a man ran across the way-my handkerchief dropped before him, a man picked it up.

            . I am an officer. I was in Holborn, and saw the prisoner, with another, very active in picking pockets. He followed the prosecutor, and pulled the handkerchief out a little way, he then went up to him again, took it quite out, and ran away - I crossed the road just before. I took him, and he threw it down.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

WILLIAM NORTON
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
15th of December, I mare, price 2l., the property of 



Alfred Hill; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






ALFRED HILL
. I live at Enfield, in Middlesex, and keep a mare and cart. On the 15th of December I turned my mare out on Chase-green

common—I missed her on the 16th—I saw her again' on the 18th at Edmonton, in the hands of the policeman Warren.





JOHN WARREN
. I am an Edmonton policeman, I was on duty at Winchmore-hill on the 16th of December, and about four o'clock in the morning I saw two men driving a mare poney along in Hoppers-lane—one was leading and the other driving—the prisoner was one of them—I took the mare and Thomas Norton, but could not take them both—I showed the same mare to the prosecutor—I am sure the prisoner William Norton was one of the men—he said he was going to drive it to the pound, but he was driving it the contrary way—Thomas Norton was committed on the Monday under the vagrant act by the Magistrate, and this man was apprehended afterwards.

Prisoner. I was not there—he never took me with the poney at all—I was in London. Witness. Yet, he was, he walked with me for a quarter of an hour, and then ran away.





JOHN MEAD
. I am an officer. I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the man.




GUILTY
. Aged 25.—


Transported for Fifteen Years.

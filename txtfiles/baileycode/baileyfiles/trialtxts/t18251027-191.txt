ALFRED CARTER. I am a shoe manufacturer
, and live in Blackfriars-road


. On the evening of the 20th of October I found the prisoner (who was employed by me to clean boots
, and go on errands
) laying in a gateway, drunk - I sent him to the watch-house, and next morning I had him brought to my house by the officer; I admonished him and discharged him from my service - in the course of the day my apprentice went to my curriers, and found he had been there, and taken away as much as he could stand under. I afterwards found he had been to a shop in Cranbourn-street, and got 7 l. 10 s. from a customer.

            . I am shop-woman to Mr. Curtis, of Cranbourne-passage. On the 20th of October the prisoner came about three o'clock, and asked me for the cash, for Mr. Carter - I asked if he had a note; he said No. I gave him six sovereigns, and 1 l. 16 s. in silver - he appeared sober, and said his master had desired him to get it.
ALFRED CARTER re-examined. Q. Had you authorized him to receive this money? A. No. I had not taken him to the Magistrate, but admonished him, and said he had disgraced himself.

            . I live with Mr. Carter. I remember the prisoner being taken into custody - he asked Davis what money he had from her, and she told him - he then said he had none.

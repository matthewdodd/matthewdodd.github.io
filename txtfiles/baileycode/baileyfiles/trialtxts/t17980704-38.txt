             sworn. - (Produces a parcel of indigo). I got this out of my master's warehouse, Messrs 
               
                  Edward
                   Hanson

            , William Pearson, and Daniel Gossett, they are partners; I saw the prisoner take it out of the warehouse this morning; I immediately went out after him, and in going out, I met Mr. Gossett, and told him, that was the man that had taken the indigo; Mr. Gossett immediately went after him and took him; the prisoner had got the indigo in his hat and breeches; he was brought back to the counting-house, and searched, and the indigo taken out of his hat and breeches.
DANIEL GOSSETT sworn. - When I returned from 'Change yesterday afternoon, my partner informed me he had found some indigo among some bags of cotton; I told him, I suspected Dasey; I secreted the boy where he might watch, and about a quarter before eight the prisoner went in; when he came out again I saw the boy, and he told me he had taken the indigo; I followed him into Thames-street, and brought him back; I sent for a constable, who searched him, and I saw him take part of the indigo out of the crown of his hat, andsome more out of his small clothes; there was a pound and a half taken from him, and three pounds and a half left secreted, ready to take away, as opportunity might offer.
Prisoner's defence. I was at work there as a cooper; I came down for some beadings, and I found this indigo; I meant to give it to some of the men.

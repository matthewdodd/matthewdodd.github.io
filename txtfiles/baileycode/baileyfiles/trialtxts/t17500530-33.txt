            , was indicted for 


               breaking the dwelling-house of 
                     
                        
                           James

, and stealing out there twenty three live rabits, value ten shillings, two hammers, a pair of pinchers, five auls and other things

               receiving them knowing them to be stolen

            . I am a shoemaker
, and live in St. John's, Wapping



. My shop, which joins to my dwelling-house, was broke open on the 7th of May at night, and from thence were taken out 23 rabbits, which were in the shop when I shut it up at a little after ten o'clock; the door I found open, some nails were wrench'd out, and the bolt undone by violence. The next day I had some intelligence of a woman in the neighbourhood, who had some rabbits to sell; which intelligence was brought me by Mr. Lee, who also told me that I might meet with her at the Seven Stars in Rosemary-lane. I went there, and found the prisoner, and likewise eight of my rabbits in a bag altogether, which the man of the house detain'd till Mr. Lee return'd. About two days after this, 
               
                  Stephen 
                  Answorth 
               



             came to me with my hammer, a knife, four auls, and two pieces of leather.


                  Stephen 
                  Answorth 
               



            . Davis, the prisoner at the bar, gave me these things for soleing and heel-piecing a pair of shoes. I live in Web-street, and work for her husband; but hearing the prosecutor had been robb'd, I deliver'd the goods to him, from whom I live about 100 yards.


                  John 
                  Lee 
               



            . I went for a pint pot to the house where Allen the prisoner lodg'd, which was at 
               
                  Elizabeth 
                  Davis 
               



            's. I keep the sign of the ship in East-Smithfield. Davis was in custody at the same time concerning a ham, which she brought to sell; and upon my seeing her stopp'd, I went to her house, to ask for my pint-pot, left I should loose it. When I came there, the door was fast; so I went about 20 yards from the door, and staid about 15 minutes, when I saw 
               
                  John 
                  Allen 
               



             take a little boy by the shoulders, and put him out at the door, with a bag on his back with something in it; and, before the door was clos'd, I push'd in and got my pot. Then I watched the boy, and followed him to Well-close-square, and, giving him a tap on the back, ask'd him what he had got there; he turn'd about, and said, what's that to you. I still follow'd him till he came to the Old Seven-Stars in Rosemary-lane, when I told him, if he would come in, I would give him some drink. Accordingly he came in, and put his bag down. I then ask'd him what he had there; he said they were rabbits. I ask'd him where he had them, and he told me from home. I desired to see them, and, upon looking, found them to be a buck, a doe, and six young ones. So I gave the landlord and a soldier charge of the boy, till I fetch'd the prosecutor, who lived near me, and who, I heard, had lost some.
Allen's defence.
As I was coming through Smithfield in liquor, I met a man, who said, come along with me, and I'll put you to bed. I went, and he sent for half a pint of gin, which we drank, and staid till one or two o'clock in the morning. There was nothing in the house but a pot from the ale-house.
Davis's defence.
The other prisoner came to my house with my son-in-law, and asked me to let him lodge there; accordingly I let him; and when the child and I was abroad, he brought three rabbits and two knives; and he stole a ham, which he wanted me to sell for him.
Allen, 


               guilty of felony only
            , Davis 

               acquitted
            .

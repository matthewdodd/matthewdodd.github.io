            . I am a painter
 - on the 25th of December, I was walking along Wilson-street, Finsbury


, about half-past nine o'clock in the morning - my hat was taken from my head with the handkerchief in it - I have never seen it since.
BENJAMIN NEAL. I saw the prosecutor walking along the street, and the prisoner snatched his hat and handkerchief off his head - he gave it to another lad - there was a third lad with them, and they all ran off - when they got to the bottom of Earl-street, the prisoner and one other returned back - I told the prosecutor he was the person - he then ran off, but was pursued and taken.

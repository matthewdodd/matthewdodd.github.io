            . I am a carpenter, and work at the house. I was looking through the window, and saw the prisoner, Harris, go through the area into the vault - I went to see what he wanted, and found him coming out of the street-door - he said he had been there for a necessary purpose. I went further into the building, and saw Bowden coming down the partition with a piece of lead on his head. I gave an alarm. Harris escaped, ran about fifteen yards, and was taken. The lead had been taken off the trap-door of the roof.

            . I live at Ealing


. On the 17th of September I lost a sack from my premises - I cannot say when I had seen this one, but I know it is one of mine; I had nearly two hundred - it has my name on it at length: I am a farmer - the prisoner never was in my employ.

            . I am a Bow-street patrol. On the morning of the 17th of September, about two o'clock, I saw the prisoner and another person coming from Brentford with some potatoes in a sack - I suppose they were near a mile from Mr. Thorn's premises; each man had a sack - I followed them into a house, and saw them throw them off their hacks; the other man got away - I asked the prisoner what it was; he said potatoes, and he had found them - I called for a light, and said, "Here are two sacks;" he said "Yes, I found them both" - this one sack is identified by the prosecutor; there was a fork there used for getting up potatoes.
(Sack produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I had been out after some work; I saw these sacks in the road, and took them up.

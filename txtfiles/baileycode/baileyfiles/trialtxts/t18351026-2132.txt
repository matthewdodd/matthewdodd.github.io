JAMES THOMAS
 (police-constable S 53). On the 1st of October, at half-past six o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoners at West-end, Hampstead, together—Carter was carrying a bag on his shoulder—I asked what he had there—he said, "Rags and bones"—I asked him to let me look at them—he put the bag down—I asked him to shake them out—there were two blankets, two pieces of carpet, and a towel—I took them both into custody—they were walking close together, and in conversation—when I stopped Carter, Dawes made a start to run away, and got about ten Yards—I loosed Carter and ran after him, and brought him back, and then Carter started, but two men stopped him.





SOPHIA CORBETT
. I am the wife of William Corbett, a carpenter, at West-end, Hampstead. The articles produced are ours, and were taken from the wash-house—I saw them safe the evening before—the door was not locked—they are worth 5s.—they were put into the wash-house to be washed—the door was latched.

Dawes put in a written defence, stating that he had found the property in a dust-hole.

            , the younger. The prisoner had been a servant
 at our house. I was in the shop on the 13th of October when the prisoner came in; the boy gave him some red herrings for his supper. I hid myself and watched the prisoner; the prisoner put the candle out, and as he passed me the tail of the fish rubbed against me; as soon as he had got out of the shop I followed him, and brought him back, and took three fish upon him (producing them); they are my father's property. The prisoner asked my pardon, and said he hoped I should forgive him.

, March 28
. Thomas Holms, thus depos'd. About 1 in the Morning, as I was going along Shoe-Lane in Fleet street


; the Prisoner came to me, she clapt one Hand upon my Shoulder, and t'other somewhere else - and, How d'ye do my Dear, says she. I laid my Hand upon her Breast to shove her away, and at the same Time I felt her pull the Watch out of my Fob, whereof I took fast hold of her and then another Woman came to her, to whom I suppose she gave the Watch; and upon that there steps up a young Fellow, and begun to be saucy, and so I caned him, for which he charg'd a Constable with me, and so I was carry'd to the Round-House, and there the next Morning, a Man pretending to be the Prisoner's Husband, brought me the Watch again and desir'd me to be favourable 


               Guilty. 10 d
            .

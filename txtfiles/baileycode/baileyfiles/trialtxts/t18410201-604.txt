HUGH HENRY ERNSTING
. I am a tailor, living in Adamsmews, Charles-street—the prisoner was my errand-boy. On Wednesday morning I took a yard from this cotton, and gave it to him to put round his neck—in the evening I marked the cotton, and when he went home at night I opened it, and missed the initials—it had been cut again—I went after him—he came back, and produced this cotton from his trowsers—he had only been three days in my employ.

Prisoner. I cut the cotton off, to make a bag to put the cuttings in—I did not take the cotton with me, I left it behind me, and then I took it out and gave it him. Witness. He took it from his trowsers, and threw it on the floor—he had left the house with it in his trowsers.




GUILTY
.† Aged 15.—


Transported for Seven Years.—Ship.

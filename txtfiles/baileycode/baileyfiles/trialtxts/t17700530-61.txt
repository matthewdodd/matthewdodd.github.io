The record of the conviction of Hampil was read in court, wherein it appeared he was tried and capitally convicted for the same, and afterwards was transported for fourteen years.

            . We have a manufactory at Stratford in Essex


, in the linen and callicoe-printing way. There are three partners


 of us, myself, 
               
                  Clement
                   Bellamy

                   Williams
               



            . We lost a great many goods out of our bleaching ground; some I found again. We apprehended one 
               
                  John
                   Hampil
               



            , and carried him before Sir 
               
                  John
                   Fielding
               



            . Sir John asked him if he had any body that would give him a character; he sent for the prisoner Jagger. When he came, he gave him the character of an honest man. He was asked, if he had bought any goods of Hampil; Jagger hesitated very much, and said something I cannot recollect. Mr. Fielding granted a warrant to search Jagger's house; the house is kept by 
               
                  Owen
                   Fox
               



            , in partnership with Jagger. I, the constable, and another person, went to their house; we told Fox our business; he would own to nothing. We went up stairs; the first room was for company, (it is a public house) there we found nothing. In the next room we came to there were several boxes, several of them were opened; at last we came to a box that was locked; we asked to have that opened; Fox pretended he had not the key. We wrenched it open; in it we found some little bits of cloth which I knew to be my own; the pattern was my own, and had not been exposed; none of that pattern had ever been sold, not being finished; they wanted a fortnight's bleaching. There was another great trunk; they pretended not to have the key of that, and talked of sending out for a key; at last the key was found in a breeches pocket, hanging in a closet joining to the room; we were ten minutes before we could get that. The chest was opened; there we found two pieces of white cotton, with my name at the end; they were not quite clear in the bleaching, nor were they in a marketable condition. We carried Fox and his wife before Sir 
               
                  John
                   Fielding
               



            ; then Mrs. Fox told us, there were more of these goods at a neighbour's house, three doors from Fox and Jagger's; it appeared to be a lodging house. She brought down a bundle, which was mine, and a gown, and two pieces of purple colour, in bad condition; this appeared to be made up into a gown. She gave information that Marckle, who kept an alehouse in Chissel-court, had dealt with Hampil; and she said, 
               
                  Owen
                   Fox
               



             and Jagger had bought all these which we had found, of Hampil. Then Fox and Jagger owned they bought these things of Hampil. ( The cloth produced.) This is cloth never sold, nor never used for the purpose; they had cut it into table-cloths, pillow-biers and sheets. The cloth is very improper for that; they are not white, and they are very nappy, and very improper to be used for any such purpose. We got a warrant to search Marckle's house. We went there, and asked him if he knew one Hampil; he said, he did not. We said, he certainly must know him; he said, No. Have not you bought any cloth of him? No; he had not. We then told him, we had a warrant to search. We went up stairs, and found the door locked; that was opened. There was a line on which a whole piece was hanging, wet and dirty, as it came out of the field, not saleable; it was cotton and linen yarn. Some of the marks were cut off, and some appear on them. Mrs. Fox was an evidence in Essex against Hampil, but against her husband she cannot.

            . I produced all these things here; I found great part of them where Mrs. Fox shewed us. Jagger went up stairs in Fox's house, and shewed me the things; he could not find the key a long time, at last he found it in a breeches pocket of Fox's. Jagger was sent by Sir John with us to shew us the house where he lived. Mr. Williams went up stairs with us; we searched several boxes; some were open, some locked. Some of the drawers were open. Jagger and Fox too, said they could not find the key of a large box. We found white cotton cut out, which Mr. Williams swore to. Then we went from there to Marckle's, and in a back room up stairs, we found a whole piece of white cotton, wet and dirty; he said, he had not bought it. When I first went into his house, I asked him, where the cloth was that he bought; he said, he bought none. He was asked if he knew Hampil; he said, he did not. He would not tell us of any goods till we went up and found them.

            . I was at Sir 
               
                  John
                   Fielding
               



            's when Hampil was examined. Mr. Hampil desired me to carry a letter to Jagger; I went and delivered it into his own hand in his own entry. He said, he did not know the man. I said, I dare say he did. He asked me my reason for thinking so, I said, Did not you know him when he was in the Hanover service? He said, Did you know him then? I said, I did. Then he, said, I do know a little of him, not much. He asked what was the matter; I said he was taken up on suspicion, and it was a pity a man should be hurt if he was accused wrongfully. Then he said, if I can be of service to him, I will go down. Then he went; Sir John examined him. I think he at first said, he had lodged in his house some time, and had never known any harm of him.
The prisoners said nothing in their defence.
For Fox and Jagger.

               Guilty
            . Death.
This Indictment was founded on an act of parliament made in the 18th year of George II. which makes it a capital felony for stealing goods out of any bleeching-grounds, laying to be whitened, after the first of June, 1745, any linen, fustian, cotton, or any thread of linen, or cotton yarn, to the value of 10 s. or any that should assist, or procure, or buy, or receive, any such goods, so stolen, knowing it to have been stolen so as aforesaid; every such offender shall suffer death: but there is a power left in the judge, to change that of death to transportation for fourteen years, which was the case here.

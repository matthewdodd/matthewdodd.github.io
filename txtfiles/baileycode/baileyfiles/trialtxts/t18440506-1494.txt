1494. 




ANN CRANSTON
 and 




GEORGE FOLLON
 were again indicted for

 feloniously receiving 1 frock, value 1s.; 1 pair of socks, 3d.; and 1 pair of boots, 1s.; the goods of 



George Henry Dosson, knowing them to have been stolen.






MARY DOSSON
. I have a brother four years old—on the 1st of April he was playing about the door—he came back crying without his frock, socks, or boots-these are the boots and frock he had on before—they are my father's, George Henry Dosson.





RICHARD TAYLOR
 (police-constable N 62.) I found this frock in the bundle under the bed at Ann Cranston's.





WILLIAM GROOM
, pawnbroker. These boots were pawned by Follon on Monday evening, the 1st of April, for 8d.





JOHN SMITH
 (police-constable N 121.) I know Ann Cranston's house—Follon cohabits with her, and is in the habit of being there, and living there—I found the duplicate of these boots in the name of Follon in a tea-pot in the house—he said he did not take them to pledge.

Follon, I did pawn them for 8d.; the girl said she was to wear these things, and go to the lady's house who gave them to her on Sunday; we had not a tea-pot in the place; if 1 had known the things had been stolen I should not have encouraged the child to do it.

ANN CRANSTON—


GUILTY
. Aged 32.

FOLLON—


GUILTY
. Aged 30.





Transported for Seven Years.

(There were nine other indictments against the prisoners.)

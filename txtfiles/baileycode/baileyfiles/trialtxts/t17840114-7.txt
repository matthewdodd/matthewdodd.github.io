             sworn.
On Saturday between two and three in the afternoon, I saw the two prisoners at the bar in Basinghall-street, opposite the White Bear, I thought they were not doing the thing they ought to do, looking in at the window, and I watched them about 20 minutes, and I went and rung at a gentleman's door, and desired them to let me into the house for a few minutes, for a thought there were two thieves in the street; and the clerk let me in, the prisoners walked up and down the street several times, and I saw one point to the other to go into the house, he staid there about four minutes, and the other waited at the door, I desired the clerk all the time to keep the door open, that I might have a run; I expected a run, and just as I came to the door the two prisoners came up with this coat, and hat under one of their arms, and the other offered to take it from him, but I said, I will take care of it and you too; I did so, and the clerk took the other prisoner, I took him to Guildhall, and I sent for a Mr. Hippy, I think the gentleman's name is, and he said, it was his servant's property.
(The things deposed to.)
Court to Price. Were these things in your master's house that day? - Yes.

             sworn.
On Saturday last, between two and three o'clock, Mr. Rigly rung at our bell, and asked to come into our little office to watch the two prisoners, I looked through the window and we watched them some short time, and after being sometimes backwards and forwards, the one in brown opened the hatch and went into the passage of Mr. Hippey's dwelling house in Basinghall-street, and after being in a short time he returned out with the servant's coat, and hat; the other waited at the door, and they walked together, and as he came out, him in blue would have taken the things from the other, but he did not chuse to let them go, then they came on together till they came to our door, then we came out upon them, and the constable took him, that had the coat and hat, and I took the other.

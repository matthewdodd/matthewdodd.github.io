, 176, Piccadilly


. The prisoner was porter
 to Mr. Mackey. Having suspicion that he stole some oil, I watched him. He took two quarts of sperm oil. On the next day I missed two quarts more. That is all I know. I heard him move the tray out of its place, and there were the marks on the board where it stood, and he had it in his basket, and I helped the basket on his shoulder.
- SAMS. I am a servant to Mr. Mackey.

             got me to watch the prisoner. I saw the prisoner go into M'Kone's house, in Bond-street. He run there in about five minutes. From there he went home. I saw him take the basket into M'Kone's.
- . I am a constable. I took the prisoner into custody. I went to M'Kone's house; I found five empty bottles and three full ones. They were found under the dresser, where Mr. M'Kone keeps the oil.
Mr. M'KONE. I live in Old Bond-street.
Q. Did you see the prisoner on this day that Sams followed him to your house - A. No, I did not see him that day at all. I know nothing at all about the oil.

             saith, that the man, whom he believes to be the prisoner, put one of the bottles now produced into the deponent's hand, without saying any thing; deponent took the bottle and put it in the place where the bottles for the oil are always kept, for the use of the house. The deponent saith, brought another bottle the week before. He took and deposited that in the same place." Did you ever swear that - A. No. I could not swear that.
Q. Then you mean to say, that you never swore what is contained in this information - A. I don't know that I did.
Q. Did you never swear that you believed the prisoner to be that man - A. No, I could not swear he was. I am in the habit of taking parcels by persons leaving them, of taking parcels of different persons. I don't know one person from another.
Q. You swear, that you never swore before the magistrate that you believed the prisoner was the man - A. I swore that he was like the man.
Q. Did you never say that the same man brought another bottle - A. No. I got one bottle a week afterwards.
Q. You heard this paper read, and you was sworn before the magistrate. Are the contents of this information true or false - A. I don't know. What I told the magistrate was right. I don't know the person that gave me these bottles. I swore that he was like the man. There was a paper read over to me.
Mr. Alley. They put this down at the magistrate's a little stronger than you swore to - A. I said he was like the man.
Q. They have said, that you believed he was the man - A. Yes. I said he was like the man.
Sams. These four bottles have labels upon them. They are Mr. Mackey's property.

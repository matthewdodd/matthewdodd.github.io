            . I am a watchman. On the 2d of July, between four and five o'clock in the morning, I stopped the prisoner in Lower Grosvenor-place, about one hundred yards from Mr. Clark's, with a bundle, containing a loaf of bread, some broken bread and butter, part of a leg of lamb dressed, and a frock-skirt; I asked where he got them - he said, he did not know.

            . I am servant to Mr. Richard Clark of No. 21, Grosvenor-street, West


. We missed a loaf from the safe, and this skirt was taken off a line in the yard; they were safe when I went to bed the night before - I can swear to the skirt, but not to the loaf.

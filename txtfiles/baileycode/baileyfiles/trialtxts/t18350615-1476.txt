 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
3rd of June, 1 copper, value 25s.; 3 feet of leaden pipe, value 1s. 6d.; and 1 copper ball-cock, value 4d.; the goods of 



George Henry Hutchings, and fixed to a building.






HENRY HUTCHINGS
. I live at No. 4, Furnival's-inn-court. I had a copper, some pipe, and a cock, at No. 8—I missed them on the 3rd of June—they had been fixed in the back kitchen—there were lodgers in that house—the prisoner was brought to me by Hubbard, with it on his shoulder.





CHARLES HUBBARD
. I lodge at No. 8. I heard a noise that morning in the cellar—I jumped out of bed—my wife opened the window, and the prisoner went out with these articles—I went down and took him with them on his shoulder.

Prisoner's Defence. I went to the corner of Gray's-inn-lane—a man came and asked me if I wanted a job, and authorized me to go and fetch the copper.




GUILTY
. Aged 28.—


Transported for Seven Years.

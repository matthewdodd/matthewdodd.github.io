1786. 




THOMAS DAVIS
 and 




CHARLES OVERY
 were indicted for

 stealing, on the 
20th of May, 16 handkerchiefs, value 16s., the goods of 



John Horne; and that Davis had been before convicted of felony.






HENRY WHITE
. I am in the service of John Horne, of St. Margaret's-hill, High-street, Borough. These handkerchiefs were on a pile of goods on the night of the 20th of May—I saw them safe about half-past eight or nine o'clock—between nine and ten I went to the door and found the prisoners in custody—I then missed the handkerchiefs—these are them—they have our mark on them.





CORNELIUS LANK
 (police-constable M 144.) On the 20th of May I saw the prisoners near Mr. Home's—I saw Overy come from the door three or four yards to the front of the window and pass this piece of handkerchief to Davis—I ran across the road and secured them both—they resisted all they could, and Davis threw the handkerchiefs down after I took him —I had not seen them in company before I saw Overy with the handkerchiefs—they went at once to the shop.

Davis's Defence. Overy picked the handkerchiefs up and passed them to me, and the policeman came and took me.





CORNELIUS LANE

re-examined. I produce a certificate of Davis's former conviction, which I got from the Clerk of the Peace's office at Newington Sessions House—I was present at his trial—he is the person mentioned in the certificate—(read.)

HENRY MILLMAN. I am a chop-house keeper
, and live in Brydges-street


. On the 19th of October I lost four tablecloths from my dining-room - I was standing in front of my house, and a young man said to me "What business has this woman in the passage?" - I looked and saw the prisoner with the four cloths on her arm; I went to her, and she said I might take them, and let her go.

            . I saw the prisoner on the staircase with the cloths on her arm - I went into the yard, and something struck me that all was not right; I turned back, and told the prosecutor.

Prisoner's Defence. I never had them in my hand - I merely walked in and out again; he pushed me out, and I said "Don't hurt me."

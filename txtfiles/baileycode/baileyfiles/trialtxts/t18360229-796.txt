SARAH SMITH
. I live servant at Mr. Jordan's, No. 22, Cork-street, New Bond-street. When I lost this property, I lived at No. 11, Lancaster-court, at Mrs. Harland's—the prisoner slept in the same room—I missed the property from out of the room—it was loose—I missed it in December, at different times—I had never lent the prisoner any thing—I spoke to her—she said she had pledged them, but would get them out, but I never gave her leave to pledge them.

Prisoner. She was living there nearly three months—I kept her during that time, and washed for her six weeks—here is the bill, and I sent her to the place where she is now. Witness. No, she did not, nor did she lead me any money—she did not get me the place—I got it by the servant who was living there.





MARY ANN ANSELL
. I am a servant out of place, I lodge at Mr. Harland's—the prisoner slept in the same room with me—I missed a flannel petticoat, two aprons, a shawl, and two gowns—I never beat her them to wear, not permitted her to pawn them.

Prisoner. She has lent me things to pledge. Witness. I have but not these things.

COURT
Q. How long is it since you gave her any thing to pledge? A. In January I gave her two or three things—two aprons—I delivered them to her with my own hand, and she took three away at the time.





JOHN ROBINSON JACKSON
. I am a pawnbroker, and here three aprons—I produce a handkerchief, two gowns, and the shawl—the prisoner pawned them all at different times, in the name of Ann Roberts.
(Property produced and sworn to.) Prisoner. She allowed me to take them, provided that I got them out again.




GUILTY
. Aged 48.—


Transported for Seven Years.

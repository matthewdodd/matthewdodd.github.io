            . My husband's name is Robert, he is a Butcher
; we keep a shop in the New-Market


. I was standing opposite my shop, and saw the prisoner throw her cloak over something and take it away.
Q. What time of the day was this?


                  Mary 
                  Leake 
               



            . This was between 7 and 8 at night: I went and laid hold on her, and she struck at me, and let the meat fall to the ground; I made her stoop for it and take it up; it was a piece of the thin-flank.
The prisoner did not say any thing in her defence.




               Guilty 10 d
            .

            . I live at Ruislip. On the 20th of March, about eleven o'clock at night, I was returning from Mr. Meadows, at the sign of the Sun and Ship, and as I came out at the door the prisoner hustled me, but I did not miss the watch for about five minutes; I then returned, and accused him of taking it out of my fob; he denied it- I locked him in the bar while I sent for the officer, and kept him there about two hours; he then said he saw a man go across the road with something like a watch - I asked where he put it; he said if I went through the gate, and looked on the left-hand side, I should find it - the landlord went with a candle, and found it; this is it.

            . I am the officer. I took the prisoner, and have the watch.

            . I am landlord of the public-house; what has been stated is true.(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. As I was standing against the door I saw a man with a round frock on, with his hand up to his side; I watched him to the gate, and then went in doors - I did not say any thing, and the prosecutor thought I had taken the watch.

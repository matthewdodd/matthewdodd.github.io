MR. BIRNIE
conducted the Prosecution.






JAMES MOTT
 (policeman, L 186). On 30th Sept. I was at the Old Shades-pier, near London-bridge, about half-past 6 o'clock in the evening—I saw the prisoner take this pocket-book out of a gentleman's pocket—I took it out of his hand, and took him into custody—he was perfectly sober—he was very violent, and tripped me up on the pavement—I was hurt in my hip, and was laid up for a week, and was not able to do any duty—I feel it now—I got assistance, and look the prisoner to Bow-lane station.


Cross-examined by
MR. BALLANTINE. Q. Are you quite certain he was sober? A. Yes; I do not think he had been drinking at all.





GEORGE LYTHALL CROCKETT
. I live in Charlwood-place, Pimlico. This is my pocket-book, I have no doubt—I had not purchased it twenty minutes before the robbery—about 20 minutes-past 6 o'clock, in Cheapside, I put it into my coat-pocket, and went to the Shades-pier, to take a return boat—I did not feel the book leave my pocket—it was raining at the time.




GUILTY
. Aged 35.—(The prisoner was also charged with having been before convicted; to which he pleaded Guilty.)—


Transported for Ten Years.

JAMES KELLY
 (police-constable T 113.) On the 22nd of March, between five and six o'clock, I saw some persons looking at the area of Mr. Webster's house, in Connaught-terrace—Mr. Webster was on the steps—I got over the rails, and found the prisoner in the cellar—I asked what he did there—he said, "Nothing"—I brought him out; another constable

went into the cellar, and brought out this bundle, containing cheese, bacon, and a fillet of veal.





BENJAMIN BRETTON
 (police-constable D 73.) I went into the area, and found this handkerchief in the cellar, containing the articles stated.





TRYPHENA JERWOOD
. I am cook to Mr. George Webster. These articles are his property—I saw them safe between eleven and twelve o'clock, the night before—the prisoner was in the coal-cellar, adjoining the safe, which was in the area.

Prisoner's Defence. I was walking past the house—I saw two young men at the rails, one of whom I thought I knew—I crossed over to them—two men, who seemed to be coal-heavers, crossed at the same time—the two young men went away, and one of the coal-heavers caught my cap of, and threw it over the rails, into the area—I got over to get my cap, and saw the safe door wide open—I was coming back again, and saw the policeman—I ran into the cellar, as I thought they would take me for being in the area.
(Mr. Edwards, of Upper Ground-streeet, Blackfriars, gave the prisoner a good character.)




GUILTY

Transported for Seven Years.

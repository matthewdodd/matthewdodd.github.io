JOHN HOGAN
 was indicted

for a misdemeanor.


MR. CLARKSON
conducted the Prosecution.





JOHN EDWARDS
. I am in the service of Messrs. Leaf and Co. of Old Change. Mr. Harvey, of Sloane-street, was one of our customers—on the 18th of March the prisoner came for tone merino to match, as he said, and brought this paper—he produced a pattern—I inquired for whom it was—he said it was for Harvey, of Knights-bridge. I looked out one as near the pattern as I could—I gave him a pattern, and told him to go home and see if it would do—he re-turned in about six hours, and said it would do—I looked for the piece I cut the pattern from, but could not find it—I suppose it had been sold—I then took another piece near the colour to Mr. Gibbins, and he entered it—the value of it was above 9l.—there were twenty-six yards and a half of it.





FRANCIS MILES GIBBINS
. I am in the service of Leaf and Co. Mr. Edwards delivered to me a piece of merino—I entered it, and asked the prisoner his name—he said Hogan—I gave him the merino, and he went away.





JOHN BEALE
. I am in the service of Mr. Harvey, of Sloane-street. The prisoner was in his service, and left about two months before the 18th of March, I think—on this order is written, "Merino, to match pattern, French"—I believe it is the prisoner's writing—he had no authority to go and get goods in Mr. Harvey's name after he left—a statement of the account was sent in to Mr. Harvey, but we had not received the goods.





BENJAMIN HARVEY
. I am a linen-draper in Sloane-street. The prisoner was not in my employ on the 18th of March—he had no authority to get this.

Prisoner. I produced the bill, but they did not ask me who I came from.




GUILTY
. Aged 18.—


Transported for Seven Years.

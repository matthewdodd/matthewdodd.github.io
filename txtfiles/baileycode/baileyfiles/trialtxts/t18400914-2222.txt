SHORE HOUSTON
. I live in Portland-terrace, Wandsworth-road. On the 9th of September I was going up Ludgate-hill, about a quarter-past twelve o'clock, and saw the prisoner take a piece of cloth from a pile which was half inside and half outside the prosecutor's door—he put it under his arm—I went in and told the shopman—he came out and cried, "Stop him"—the prisoner threw the cloth down, and the shopman picked it up—he then ran up a turning—I followed, and my foot happening to touch his foot, he fell—I took hold of him—he struck at me twice, but another person came up and secured him.





SAMUEL DOUDNEY
. I conduct the business at No. 29, Ludgate-hill, This cloth is the property of William Morley Burnet and another—it has my own mark on it—the shopman who ran after the prisoner is not here—he was before the Magistrate, but he refused to take an oath.





SHORE HOUSTON

re-examined. I believe this to be the cloth—I saw the prisoner throw it down, and saw the shopman pick it up and give it to the policeman.





WILLIAM DEVONSHIRE
 (City police-constable, No. 237.) This piece of cloth was given to me—I have had it ever since—I took charge of the prisoner.

Prisoner. I am innocent.

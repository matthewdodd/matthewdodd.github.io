WILLIAM SIMPSON. I am a surgeon
, and live in Angel-terrace, Hammersmith


. On the 28th of September I missed a case of instruments, from a little parlour at the back of my shop; the constable produced them the same day - I know nothing of the prisoners - I cannot identify these instruments, but Pearce made the case; my surgery door is generally open, and my boy not always there.

            . I am a cabinet-maker. I made this case to fit these instruments - I am sure this is the case I made.


                  WILLIAM 
                  FRIAR
               



            . I am a carpenter. I was at work at Hammersmith, between twelve and one o'clock on the 28th of September - Lovegrove called me to the back window, and I saw Broad scratching some time away; he and Donoughdoo seemed to deposit something there; he and a third person covered it over, and went away - I desired Lovegrove to go and see what it was; he went and brought this case - I took Broad and Donoughdoo that day.

                  LOVEGROVE
               



            . I was at work with Friar - I am a carpenter. I saw Broad scratch the hole, and Donoughdoo put something in from a handkerchief, which he untied - Broad and Prendergast covered it over - I went to the spot, and took this box out; it was about two hundred yards from Mr. Simpson's.

            . I am an officer, and have produced the box - I took Prendergast by information - I did know them before.
DONOUGHDOO'S Defence. I was returning from work, and Friar seized me - I had not been there that morning.

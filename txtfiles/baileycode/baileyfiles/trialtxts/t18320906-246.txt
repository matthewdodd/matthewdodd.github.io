            . I live with Mr. Richard Carpenter, he keeps a sale-shop
 at Brentford


; he lost a waistcoat on the 26th of August. I did not see it taken, but I heard it was gone - I went after the prisoner, who was about four hundred yards from the shop - he said he had not got it, but in coming back, he dropped it.
Prisoner. Q. Did you see me take it, or drop it? ANo, but the people called out that he had dropped it, and there was no one near him; this is it.
Prisoner. I went to the shop, and came out again - this witness came after me, and said I had a waistcoat; I said I had not - he said, "Go back and free yourself;" I was going back, and some one dropped a waistcoat - he said I dropped it.

            . He had been looking at some waistcoats, he brought one from the door, and asked the price of it, but none of them suited him; he went out - my master went to the door, and asked if I had sold one - I said No; I then missed it - there had been no one else there.

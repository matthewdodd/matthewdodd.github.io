JEREMIAH M'CARTHY
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the

THOMAS LAMPORT HARRIS
. I live in Carey-lane, City. On the evening of the 29th of May, between seven and eight o'clock, I was walking in Drury—lane with a friend—in consequence of something that was said to me, I felt in my pocket, and missed my handkerchief, which I am certain was safe a few minutes previous—I turned round, collared the prisoner, and accused him of taking it—he said he had not taken it, that it was two boys, whom he pointed out—on my accusing him again he said if I would let him go he

would give me the handkerchief, and he produced it from his pocket—this is it.





WILLIAM WEST
. I am a policeman. The prisoner was given into my custody with the handkerchief.

Prisoner's Defence. There were two boys behind the gentleman; I saw the handkerchief drop; no one looked for it, and I put it into my pocket.





CHARLES PURFORD
. I am a policeman. I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction—(read)—I was present at his trial—he is the boy who was so convicted.

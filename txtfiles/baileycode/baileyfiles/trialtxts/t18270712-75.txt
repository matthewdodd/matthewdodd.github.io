            . I am street-keeper of Islington. On Saturday, the 30th of June, about half-past ten o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner coming up Lower-street, with this sack on his back. I asked what he had got; he said what was that to me. I took hold of it and found this property; he then said he had bought them in Cheshunt-street.
THOMAS YOUNG. I live at Walthamstow


; this property is mine. I know nothing of the robbery.

            . I live with Mr. Young; this is his property. I had seen it safe in the barn on the 29th of June - and on the morning of the 30th it was gone; I locked the door the night before; my master found it broken open in the morning, and he called to me - it appeared to me to be broken with this piece of iron. I know nothing of the prisoner.
Prisoner's Defence. I was coming up Cheshunt-street, and a man offered me this property for 16s., which I gave him.
T. COPE. I found no money on him; he was offering them for sale for 14s.

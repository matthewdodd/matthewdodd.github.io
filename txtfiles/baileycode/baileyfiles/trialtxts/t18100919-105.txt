s in Long Acre


. On the 16th of August, the prisoner was clearing some things away in the cellar, at the back premises. I went to the top of the stairs, I saw the prisoner putting the property in his pocket and under his waistcoat; I was about three minutes watching him, I then called him up, and asked him what he had been about in the cellar; he said, he had been putting the things away; I asked him what he had put the things in his pocket for; he denied having any thing about him that did not belong to him. I then told him that I saw him take them, and desired him to return them to where he took them from. He took these seven pins out of his pocket, they are worth about a shilling. I sent the officer to search his lodgings, there he found one hundred screws, twenty-four bolts and nuts, and two spring sword case catches.
The prisoner said nothing in his defence, nor called any witnesses to character.

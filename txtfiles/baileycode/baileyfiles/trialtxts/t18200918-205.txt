            . I am a ship-owner in Jamaica
. On the 21st of July, about nine o'clock in the evening, I was going by George-yard


, with a lady on my left arm. The prisoner made a slip with his foot, and fell slightly with his head against my breast, at that instant he made a snatch at my watch, pulled it out, and ran up George-yard with it. I immediately called Stop thief! and received several violent blows from others. An officer knocked him down, and the case of the watch dropped from him immediately. I saw it fall from him. I never lost sight of him till he was secured.

            . I am an officer. I was in George-yard, heard the cry of Stop thief! and stopped the prisoner who was running before all the rest, we both fell down, and at this instant the case fell on the ground, and the watch close to it. It fell from him.

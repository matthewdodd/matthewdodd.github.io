            ; I live in a court in St. James's-street


; the prisoner came to me for a lodging; I had known him ever since last March; he did not come to lodge with me then, but was to come in three days; he did not come. My door was broke open when I was out, and the things mentioned in the indictment were taken away; I suspected the prisoner, from the description the neighbours gave me of the person they saw go out with the bundles; I got a warrant and went to his lodgings; I saw his wife, she had one of my aprons on; I went for a constable; when I came back she had got another apron on. The prisoner was taken that night at the bottom of the Hay-market; he said he found them, and confessed that some of the things were at a public house in St. George's Fields, and the rest pawned.

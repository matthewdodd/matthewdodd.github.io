            . I am a mason's labourer
. I met the prisoner in a public-house on the morning of the 24th of March, about five o'clock, when I went to have a pint of beer - I had a sovereign and 1s. 6d. in my pocket; the prisoner stood on my left - I did not feel her hand go into my pocket, but I felt it drawing out, and I made a grasp at her hand - she got it from me, and ran out; I followed her out, but was knocked down by three or four persons, who used me very cruelly - she was afterwards taken by the officer; she said "Give the man his money, it is all there but one 6d., which I have spent."

             (Police-constable F 8). On Sunday morning, the 24th of March, I was informed a man had been robbed, by a girl who had crossed the road - I followed the prisoner, and took her in George-street - I saw she was trying to swallow something; I took hold of her throat, and put my other hand to the back of her head; a sovereign and a shilling dropped from her mouth, which were taken up and given to me - she desired me to give it to the man, and said it was all she had taken from him, except 6d., which she had spent.
JURY to JAMES MURNANE. Q.Was the 6d. expended in drink, of which you partook? A. No; it was not spent to my knowledge - I had not been in company with her.

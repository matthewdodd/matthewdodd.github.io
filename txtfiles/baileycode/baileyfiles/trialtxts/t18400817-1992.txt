1992. 




JAMES SMITH
 and 




JOSEPH PETERS
 were indicted for

 stealing, on the 
20th of July, 3 pairs of shoes, value 2s. 3d.; and 3 pain of boots, value 2s. 3d.; the goods of 



Richard Pinkney: and that Smith had been before convicted of felony.






RICHARD PINKNEY
. I keep a shoe warehouse in Church-street, Bethnal-green. On the 20th of July I went out—I left my boots and shoes all safe at my door—I returned in two hours and a half, and missed three pairs of boots and three pain of shoes.





SILAS FOORD
. I am a shoemaker. Between three and four o'clock that day I saw the prisoner Smith cut the boots and shoes from the prosecutor's door—he gave them to Peters—I crossed, and took Smith into the shop, and Nicholls took Peters.





JOHN NICHOLLS
. I am a labourer. I saw Smith cut the boots and shoes from the door, and give them to Peters, who put them under his jacket—Mrs. Wells ran and caught Peters—I went to her assistance, and this property fell from under his jacket.





RALPH HEATON
. I am a policeman. I produce the certificate of Smith's former conviction, which I got at Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person.

(Peters received a good character.)

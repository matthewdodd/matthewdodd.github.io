            . The prisoner came to me on the 17th of June, and said he wanted a barrow to move some drawers; I said I had not got one, but I had a truck; and hired that - he said it was for a Mr. Baker, of Islington - I said,
"Is it Mr. Baker, the cabinet-maker" - he said Yes. As he did not return I had some bills printed, offering a sovereign reward.

            . The prisoner offered to sell me a truck on the 17th of June, about half-past eight o'clock in the evening - I asked where he got it; he said it belonged to a man who kept a green-stall in Brunswick-street. He asked 12 s. for it; I said I thought it too cheap - an officer came up, and I gave him in charge. We went to where he said he had got it, and found it was false.

             BAKER. I am a cabinet-maker, and live at Islington. I never sent the prisoner for the truck.

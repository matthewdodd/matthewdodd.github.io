            . I had left my watch at my brother Richard's house, and called for it on the 15th of January, and was told it was stolen, and that they suspected the prisoner, and one 
               
                  Dick 
                  Purcer 
               



            ; and by inquiring at a pawnbrokers where they used to pawn things, found it again. (Produced in court, and deposed to.)
Agness Young. The prisoner came to Mr. 
               
                  Richard 
                  Clark 
               



            's house, to iron some things; soon after, 
               
                  Dick 
                  Purcer 
               



             came in. I had seen this watch about a quarter of an hour before. When they were gone I miss'd it. I went to where she lodged, and said, they had played the rogue with it. They both denied knowing any thing of it.

            . I am a pawnbroker. The prisoner, and 
               
                  Richard 
                  Purcer 
               



            , brought this watch, and said, an old woman, a relation of her's, lent it her to pledge on account her husband was arrested; and my master lent her a guinea on it. I was by at the time.
Prisoner's Defence. I think it is hard upon me: I did not take the watch: It would have been proper to have taken the man: Purcer said it was as much his watch as it was Mr. Clark's.

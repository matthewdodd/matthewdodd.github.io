            . I am a merchant
. On the 29th of September, about two o'clock in the afternoon, I was at the corner of Cornhill, turning into Bishopsgate-street


 - my snuff-box was in my coat pocket. I was standing for the carts to pass, and felt it taken from my pocket, and on turning round saw the prisoner putting it it into his bosom. I ran after him, and saw him throw it away. A gentleman stopped him, and I gave him in charge.

            . I live in Catherine-street, Limehouse, and am a cheesemonger. In consequence of something I had heard, I was watching the prisoners, who were with two other boys. Long went into the shop and stood about two minutes; he then came out and spoke to the other three boys outside; he then went in again, and Oliver followed him - Oliver turned round and took the copper kettle off the book, and came out, and Long followed him. The instant Oliver came out I seized him with it, and afterwards took Long. The other two ran away.

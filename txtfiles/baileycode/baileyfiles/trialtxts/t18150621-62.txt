            . I am a school master
, residing in Grove-street-field, Hackney


. I lost these things out of my yard, on Sunday night last. Having been frequently robbed of whatever, was left out, I procured a very furious dog, which was chained up in the yard; but he never barked all the night, and in the morning, he was loose.

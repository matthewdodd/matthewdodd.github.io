            . I deal in second hand clothes
. On Saturday last, between nine and ten in the morning, the prisoner came to my shop; he agreed to buy two shirts for eight shillings, two pair of stockings for three shillings, and a waistcoat at seven shillings and sixpence. He told me to fold them up; he would pay me for them. I folded them up; he seemed to feel in his pocket for the money. In a little time I turned my head of one side, he throwed a quantity of snuff in my face. He took the bundle and ran away. He was pursued and taken, and brought back with the property.

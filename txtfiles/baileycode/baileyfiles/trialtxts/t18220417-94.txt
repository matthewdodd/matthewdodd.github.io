                  ELIZABETH 
                  PERKINS
               



            . I am the wife of 
               
                  William 
                  Perkins
               



            , tailor
, Litchfield-street, Oxford-Road. In February I took a lodging at Mr. 
               
                  John 
                  Day
               



            's, at Enfield


, on account of ill-health. I had a one pair back room. I sat with Mrs. Day. Gilson lodged in the house. I never saw Marsh there. I went there on the 14th, and on the 16th, I lost the articles stated in the indictment. They were worth above 5 l. altogether. I left the silk gown in a box unlocked in a closet in my room. The pelisse hung in the same closet, and the rest of the things were in a large hat-box in the room. I left them there safe about five in the afternoon of the 16th. Gilson went out on the 6th. I cannot say whether she carried any thing out with her. She went out again in about a quarter of an hour; it was then a little after seven o'clock. She said to me,
"If a young man should call tell him," I shall return in a few minutes, and I will leave my candle burning" - she did not return at all. A candle was left burning in the back kitchen.
Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS Q. These things would make a large bundle - A. Yes.


                  SARAH 
                  DAY
               



            . I am the wife of 
               
                  John 
                  Day
               



            . The prisoners came to lodge at my house on the 28th of January - represented themselves to be sisters, and said they lived by needle-work. Marsh continued her lodging till the 7th of February, and then left without notice. Both lodged in one room - I did not see her again till she was in custody. Mrs. Perkins came to lodge with me on the 14th. On the 16th I was out.


                  JOHN 
                  DAY
               



            . I keep the house at Enfield. I remember the night Gilson went away - she asked me to lend her a coal-bag to fetch coals, between six and seven in the evening. I said, I did not know where it was, - she found it in the cupboard, and took it up stairs with her. - I saw her go out afterwards, but did not notice that she had any thing. Mrs. Perkins's is a back-room - her's was in front, on the same floor as Mrs. Perkins. Anything thrown out would fall into the street. As Gilson left, she said,
"I will leave the candle burning; and if a young man calls, tell him I shall be in a few minutes." When she left, the coal-bag was missing.

            . I am a tin-plate-worker, and live at Enfield. On the 16th of February, I met Marsh coming down the town towards Day's house, within about fifty yards of it, at seven o'clock in the evening. I heard of the robbery next morning.

            . I am driver of the Edmonton Coach. Edmonton is in the way from Enfield to London. I took the prisoners as passengers on my coach, on the 16th of February, about twenty minutes after eight o'clock, at Tottenham High Cross; they had a white bag, which would hold about a peck. I sat them down at the end of Old-street. The bag appeared clean.
GILSON'S Defence. Q. Did I not tell you to mind the tea-caddy in the bag - A. Yes, there appeared something like a caddy in it.

            . I am an officer at Edmonton. Day gave me information. I found Marsh on Saturday, the 23nd, at No. 12, Portpool-lane, in the one pair front room. I found some frills, false hair, and a quantity of duplicates on her. On Sunday the 24th I took Gilson in the same room. I found nothing on her but duplicates, and a dredging-box. I went to the pawnbroker's. Marsh said the frills were her's. I found a dark lantern, fifteen skeleton, and two picklock keys, and a phosphorous box in a portmanteau, at the lodging, and found the coal-bag in the room on Sunday.
Cross-examined. Q. Did you see a man there - A. No, I found both the prisoners lodged there. There was one bed, and a small couch in a closet.

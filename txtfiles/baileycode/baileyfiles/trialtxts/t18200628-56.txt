            . I am servant to Mr. Castle. On the 27th of May I saw the prisoner coming out of the counting-house with this coat. As soon as he saw me he dropped it. I walked up to him, and asked what he was going to do with it? he said some strange man, with a knot on his head, sent him for it. I ordered him to take it up and put it where he found it. He put it on a chair in the counting-house, where I had seen it before - I then gave him in charge.

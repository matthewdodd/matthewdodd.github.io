. On the 19th of September, the prisoner and 2 or 3 other women were in the taphouse; they called for some beer; the tea-kettle stood by the fire side; the people went away, and my maid missed the tea-kettle; I sent people out; the prisoner was soon brought back; I said she had got my tea-kettle; she said she had not, and bid me take care what I was at, and wished a great many bad wishes; when she found I would take her before my Lord-Mayor, she said she wanted to speak with me, if I would go backwards; then she said she had carried it into Petticoat-lane, and pledged it for 18 d. there I found it; (produced and deposed to.)

Prisoner's defence.
I met a sister to my former husband; we went in and had some beer; when we went out, she said, be so kind to take this tea-kettle and pledge it for me; so I took and pawned it for 18 d. I did not know but it was her own.

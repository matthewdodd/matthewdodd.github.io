THOMAS FRANCIS JAMES
 was indicted

 for forging and tittering a request for the delivery of goods.






THOMAS FOSTER
. I am clerk to Henry Good, a wine-merchant, in

Queen-street. On the 3rd of March the prisoner delivered this order to me—I knew him before, in the service of Mr. James—I believed this order to be Mr. James's, and knowing him, I delivered to him half-a-dozen of wine, but that being an unusual order, I entered an order for a dozen—he called for the rest as he returned—he said he was going west—(order read)—"March 3, 1840. Sir, If you be so kind let the bearer have six bottles of sherry, the same sort as the last you sent us, you will oblige.
"W. & E. JAMES, 33, Fenchurch-street."

Prisoner. I was not in his house that day. Witness. He is the person who brought it, and I believe it was the 3rd of March.





EDWARD JAMES
. I am a wine-merchant, in Fenchurch-street. I have sent once or twice to Mr. Good's, and had some sherry from him—the prisoner lived with me, but left about three weeks before the 3rd of March—I did not send him with this order—it is not my writing—he had no authority to go there.

Prisoner's Defence. This order was given me by another person to take to Mr. Good's for the wine.




GUILTY. Aged 22. Of uttering.—


Transported for Seven Years.

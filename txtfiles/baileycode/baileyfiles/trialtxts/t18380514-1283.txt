ELIZABATH CRODKER. I am the wife of Robert Crocker; we keep a tobacconist's shop, in Yardley-street, spa-fields. On the 14th of may, about half-past nine o'clock, we had a jar on the counter, which contained about three ounces of tobacco—I missed it from the counter, but I did not see either of the prisoners—the policeman came and asked if I had lost any thing, and I described the property—this is it—(looking at it.) JOHN BURLEY (police-constable G 50.) I saw the prisoners running last Monday evening, the 14th of May, about fifteen or twenty yards from the prosecutor's house—Manley had got this jar—I took them all into custody.

            ; my husband also lives there; it is in the parish of St. Martin's in the fields. The prisoner lived servant in the house.

            , my brother-in-law, missed two one pound notes; in consequence of that the servant
's box was searched, on the Saturday following, and the shift was found in it. I searched her. I found a one-pound note on her, and eighteen shillings in her pocket; I delivered all the property to Lavender. The shirt was my own.

            . I produce a shift; I received it of Mrs. Taylor.
MR. TAYLOR. It is my shift, the mark she had taken out; I am sure it is mine.
Lavender. I produce a one-pound note, and six three-shilling pieces, which the prisoner confessed to me was the produce of the other note; she had bought a pair of stockings. When Mrs. Taylor, gave me the money I asked the prisoner if the silver was the produce of the other note; she said yes; and went with me to a stocking shop in the Strand, where she had bought a pair of stockings; the linen draper remembered taking the note, but he had paid it away. This note

             can speak to; he said it was one of the two notes that he had lost.
Q. Did she tell you how she came by it - A. Yes. she said, she was going up stairs on Sunday, she saw a man came in at the window; he hove a jug of water over her; she saw this bundle laying on the stairs; she was tempted to take it, and convert it to her own use.

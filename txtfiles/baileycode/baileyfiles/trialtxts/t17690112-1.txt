            . On the evening preceding St. Thomas's day, as I was going from Cheapside into St. Martin's le Grand


, about six in the evening, I found something disturb my pocket; I immediately turned round and discovered my handkerchief in the prisoner's hand, holding it out to another person, whom I apprehended to be his associate, saying at the time, Here, here, or Take it, take it, I am not sure which. The other person, seeing I observed it, refused taking it, so it fell to the ground. I took it up, and took hold of the prisoner, who used me with a good deal of effrontery, but at last fell on his knees and begged for mercy.
Prisoner's Defence.
Going along the street, the gentleman turned round and seized me. I never had his handkerchief.

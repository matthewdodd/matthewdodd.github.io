            . I live in Duke-street, Aldgate, and am a tailors' cutter
. On the 2nd of October, at twenty minutes past six o'clock in the evening, I was on the righthand of Fleet-street


, going westward, and between St. Dunstan's church and Temple-bar; I am positive I had a handkerchief in my pocket - I felt something at my pocket near Chancery-lane, and immediately after found my handkerchief was gone; I turned round, and nobody was near enough to take it but the prisoner - I attempted to lay hold of him, seeing him putting something into the left breast of his coat; he ran about forty feet - I took him, and at that moment my handkerchief dropped at his feet: a handkerchief was found on him, which he said was his own.

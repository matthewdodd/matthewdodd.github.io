            . I saw the prisoner go into 48, Upper Berkeley-street, and bring these pots out of the passage, she put them into her apron, she ran to the corner of Adams's Mews, there I stopped her.
Prosecutor. They are my pots. I took them out of her apron. This is an aggravated case. She had her husband following her that morning with a basket, I suppose to take them from her.
The prisoner said nothing in her defence.

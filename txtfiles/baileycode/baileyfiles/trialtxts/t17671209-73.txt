            . I was loading the Andover waggon in the inn-yard; I saw the prisoner at the bar come out of the stable with the prosecutor's coat on; I knowing it, stopped him (the coat produced and deposed to.)
Prisoner's defence.
A boy took me to this place, and said it was his coat, and desired me to carry it for him; I took and put it on, and they stopped me.

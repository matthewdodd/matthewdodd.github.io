JAMES DENNIS
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
28th of April, 1 ring, value 5s., the goods of 



Charles Stanborough.






SARAH STANBOEOUGH
. I am the wife of Charles Stanborough, a labourer, and live in Richmond-buildings, Kingsland. I knew the prisoner for three weeks, by his coming backwards and forwards to the house—I sent him on the 28th of April for a quartern loaf, he got it, and asked me if he should take it up stairs to my room—I told him no, as the stairs were clean, but to put it on the stairs—he made some hesitation, and seemed to wish to take it up—I told him to take it up, and put it on the sideboard—I had a ring on the mantel-piece in that room, which I missed a quarter of an hour after he was gone—this is it—(looking at one)—the prisoner's uncle lodges in the house, he is a doll-maker, and respectable in his trade.





WILLIAM TUCK
. I live at Mr. Miller's, a pawnbroker, at Kingsland. I took in this ring of the prisoner, I believe—I am not certain of his person—I believe it was him.





JOHN SULLIVAN
. I am a policeman. I took the prisoner in charge.





SARAH STANBOROUGH

re-examined, I had seen this ring safe about four o'clock, and the prisoner left about a quarter past four o'clock—no one else had been in the room.

Prisoner's Defence, I used to go there to see my aunt—I fetched this loaf, and was told to take it up stairs—as I came down, I saw this ring on the stairs—I took it up—I had nothing to eat scarcely for two days, and that induced me to pawn it as I went home—my father took me to my aunt's, and they made me tell where I had pawned it, and said they would do nothing to me—the ring was broken when I found it—it was separated about the eighth of an inch, and I shoved it together with my fingers.




GUILTY
.* Aged 17.—


Transported for Seven Years.

ROBERT ISAAC
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 22nd of April, 2 1/2lbs. weight of bacon, value 1s. 8d. the goods of 



John Walter; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






SUSANNAH WALTER
. I am the sister of John Walter, who lives in Carburton-street. This bacon was taken from his shop-window, about a quarter past nine o'clock at night, on the 22nd of April—I did not see it taken—a person brought it back, and I knew it.





ANTHONY VOGT
. I saw the prisoner take this bacon from the prosecutor's window—he wrapped it in his apron—I ran after him, be dropped it, and ran away—I left the bacon, and ran and took him—he begged me to let him go, and said he would not do it again—I took him back, and a boy picked up the bacon—I took it to Miss Walter—she begged me to stay till the policeman came and took the prisoner.





WILLIAM BAKER
. I am a policeman. I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 22.—


Transported for Seven Years.

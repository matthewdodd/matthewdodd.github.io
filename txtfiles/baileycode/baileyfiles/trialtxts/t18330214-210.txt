                  LAVER
               



            . I live at Royden, in Essex, and am a fisherman. On the 25th of January I took Mr. Webb's horses to the stack-yard - I saw Glenn there, and there were four trusses of hay on the top of the loaded waggon; I helped Glenn to put the horses to the waggon - we came out, and then Glenn said that he had been having a devil of a sweat, as he had been cutting four trusses of hay off Mr. Webb's stack - I came with him as far as Kingland





, and there saw Venables standing on the pavement; Glenn threw the four trusses of hay off the top of the waggon, and Venables took them down to the King's Head yard.
Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is not Venables ostler there? A. Yes; I do not know that he had purchased hay before - it was done in day-light, about seven o'clock in the morning.

                  WEBB
               



            . Glenn was my servant
; I did not authorize him to cut any hay from my stack - the waggon had been loaded before, and had the tilt on it; the prisoner had no general authority to cut hay - it was worth about 1s. 10d. a truss; the waggon was going to St. John-street, Clerkenwell.

                  PEGRAM
               



            . I live with Mr. Webb - his premises are twenty miles from town. I came with this waggon - we stopped at Nazing the first place, and then came on to Kingsland, where I saw the hay thrown off the waggon, but I cannot say from what part, as I stood against the horses - we had started on the Friday night, and got there about seven o'clock in the morning.
Cross-examined. Q. Have you the least doubt that they could see you? A. No: Venables could see me when he took the hay up the yard.

                  PEARSON
               



             (Police-constable N 126). I went to the King's Arms yard, and saw Venables - I told him to come to the office; he came.
Cross-examined. Q. Were you in your Police dress? A. Yes; he went very willingly.
Venables' Defence. I know nothing about it.
Several witnesses gave Glenn a good character, and one engaged to employ him.

             was indicted for 


               feloniously receiving the same, well knowing them to have been stolen
            .
THOMAS WEBB. I live at Royden





, and am a butcher
. I had a stack of hay about a mile from my house, in a yard - Glenn was in my service; he assisted in loading a waggon of hay from that stack, and putting the tilt over it, on the 28th of January, about half-past one o'clock; a single truss was put outside for the horses - it was to start at eight in the evening; I watched and saw Glenn go to the stack, cut three trusses of hay from the stack, and put them on the waggon - he started with them and the one for the horses; I went and put my horse in the cart, and started for London - I saw the waggon at Ponder's-end with the three trusses on it, and the horses were out; I went on to Kingsland-bridge, and waited for him, but he did not come that way - I asked him on the Wednesday after why he did go that way; he said he went the other way - and while we were talking, the officer came in.


                  JOHN 
                  PEARSON
               



             (Police-constable N 126.) In consequence of information, I watched about Kingsland-road





 - on the 29th of January; I saw Glenn come to the King's Head with some hay on the waggon; I saw Willett bring out a truck, take the two trusses of hay from the waggon into the truck, and he was going down the yard- I went and took him by the collar; he said he wanted to go into the house to the ostler, who had sent him.
Willell. The under ostler came to me and said, "I want you to do a job for me, go and get two trusses of hay;" I told the officer so. Witness. Yes, he did.


                  WILLIAM 
                  PEGRAM
               



            . I went with the waggon; when we got to Kingsland turnpike we turned off to the right- we did not pass the public-house in going to London; we went to London and delivered the hay, but two or three trusses were left in the waggon; we went home by Kingsland, and stopped at this public-house to have a pint of beer - while we were in there somebody took the hay from the waggon; I told Glenn of it, but he said nothing - I saw the other prisoner stopped with the hay in the truck - I went out, the hay was gone from our waggon.
Glenn. When I unloaded my hay, a man asked me if I would take two trusses down Kingsland-road for him, which I did - I stopped at the King's Head, and I expect the same man took them out that put them in; I saw no more of them.
Willett. I am innocent - the under ostler told me to fetch the truck, and put the two trusses of hay into it.

                  LONGMAN
               



            . I live at Hoxton. I was at the King's Head when the ostler asked Willett to get Mr. Bartram's truck and put the two trusses of hay into it, and he would give him a pint of beer for it - Willett told the officer who had employed him, but the ostler got away.

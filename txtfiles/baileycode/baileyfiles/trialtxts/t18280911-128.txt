THOMAS MASON. I am a journeyman silk-weaver
; and work for Mr. Graham who supplies me with the silk to make into bobbins. I did not know the prisoner till this happened; he came up to me and said he had come from the warehouse for 6 bobbins of silk; I asked what warehouse he came from, he said from Mr. Graham; I asked if he had any note, and he presented me with this note, my name is on it; I delivered him 6 bobbins, believing that he came from Mr. Graham who is the owner of the silk; I have never seen it since.
Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What were you to do with the silk? A. To manufacture it for Mr. Graham; I had not finished the work; it was his property entirely.

            . I am foreman to Mr. Graham and supply the weavers with their materials. This order is not written by Mr. Graham or any person in our house; I am the only person who sends for silk; I never gave the prisoner such an order; I never saw him before.
Cross-examined. Q. It has no name signed to it? A. No; Mr. Graham is not here.(Order read.)
"MR. MASON - Let the bearer have six bobbins of shute."
Prisoner's Defence. Mr. Robert Graham came to my house and gave me that order; he told me to go up to this man and get the silk.

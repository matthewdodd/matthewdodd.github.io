             deposed, Forrester came into his shop on the 20th of June, and the other followed immediately; he asked for a pair of sleeve-buttons, they were shewed some of half a crown, at 5 s. and at 3 s. 6 d. He missed a pair at 3 s. 6 d. being asked for them, they denied having them, but when going to send for an officer, Morgan delivered them out of his hand two pair and a half; and that Morgan offered him his silver watch to indemnify him, that he should not be prosecuted for compounding a felony, if he would let them go.

            . On Tuesday last I was at the corner of King-street, Cheapside


, the time Mr. Wilkes was going to Guild-Hall. Mr. Paine came and told me I had had my pocket picked of a handkerchief, and he would shew me the man. He shewed me the prisoner. I found my handkerchief (a linen one) in his left-hand waistcoat pocket.
W. Paine. I was in the crowd at the time Mr. Wilkes was going to Guild-Hall, more with intent to take a pick-pocket, than to see Mr. Wilkes, or any other gentleman. I saw several that I knew to be pick-pockets. I saw the prisoner take a handkerchief out of the prosecutor's pocket, as he was by the corner of King-street. I informed the prosecutor of it, and we found it upon the prisoner.

I picked the handkerchief from the ground.

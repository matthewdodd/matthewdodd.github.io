JAMES SCRUTON. I was going down Holborn-hill


 about half-past twelve or one o'clock at night, on the 16th of June; I felt some one behind me, and turned round - I saw the prisoner near me, with his hands behind him; I felt in my pocket, and missed my handkerchief, which I had used two minutes before; the watchman took him immediatley, but the handkerchief had been passed - I have not seen it.

            . I am a watchman. I saw the prisoner draw the handkerchief from the prosecutor's lefthand pocket, and seized him immediately, but the handkerchief was passed.
Prisoner's Defence. The gentleman turned round, and accused me of taking the handkerchief; I said I had not got it - he struck me in the mouth: I called the watchman, who told the gentleman to desist, and then they took me to the watch-house, but nothing was found on me; the gentleman was quarrelling with two other gentlemen, and I thought there would be a fight; there was no person near me.

Job Heath. I am a shoemaker
, the prisoner was my porter, a weekly servant
; I had intelligence the prisoner had behaved ill towards me, and got a search-warrant; and in searching his lodgings in Castle-court, Whitecross-street, I found the things mentioned in the indictment, my property.
Q. Had you missed them before?
Heath. I had not. [Produced in court, and deposed to] I gave the prisoner in charge to the constable, he acknowledged the goods were my property, and that he had taken them from me.
The prisoner said nothing in his defence.

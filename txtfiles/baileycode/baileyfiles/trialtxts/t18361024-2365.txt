WILLIAM TWEED
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
10th of October, 2 half-boots, value 3s. 6d. the goods of 



George Ferguson.






CHARLES ADCOCK
. I am a policeman. I was on duty, on the 10th of

October, to Whitechapel—I saw the prisoner, and watched him, and saw him take the pair of half-boots from Mr. Ferguson's shop—he walked away—I followed and took him about thirty yards off—he immediately dropped the boots, and said, "I did not take them, the boy gave me them, "

Cross-examined by
MR. PAYNE. Q. Had he got into Essex-street? A. He had not—he was at the corner, standing, and just putting the boots into a handkerchief—there had been two more boys with him, but no one was on the spot then—I am quite sure he is the person—I followed him immediately—I was on the opposite side of the street—it was nine o'clock at night.





SAMUEL TAYLOR
. I was on the opposite side, in Whitechapel—I saw the prisoner take the boots out of Mr. Ferguson's door-way—I saw them in his hand all the while.

Cross-examined. Q. What did you do? A. I crossed over directly—there was the light of the shop and the lamps—there were no carriages passing.





EMMA HALL
. I assist in the shop of Mr. George Ferguson. These are his property.

Cross-examined. Q. Are they old boots? A. Yes.
(Mr. Ferrell, a cabinet-marker, gave the prisoner a good character.)




GUILTY
. Aged 16.*—


Transported for Seven Years.

            . I am a carman
, the prisoner was my servant
. On the 2d of December, I sent him with the waggon, to deliver four crates to Mr. Tyne, of Kensington, and entrusted him to receive the carriage, which was 4 l. 9 s. He set off about ten o'clock, and at half-past four, the waggon came into the yard without any driver, and the whip tied to the side of it. On the 28th, I saw him at Rotherithe, charged him with it; he said he had lost the money - he never paid it to me. He was about a month with me. I had given him no warning.

            . The Prisoner was my Servant
, and went away on the 21st of Jan. the Goods were miss'd. A Watchman who knew her, happen'd to meet her a Month afterwards in Stepney-Fields, she told him where she lodg'd, and he persuaded her to go in and drink with him; while she was there, he sent notice to my Wife; but before my Wife came to them, the Prisoner made her escape. At her Lodging we heard she was just gone by Water to the Red-Cow Alehouse in Hungerford-Market; we follow'd and found her there with all the Goods in 2 Trunks and a Bundle, and she confess'd, she took them out of my House. I have heard a good Character of her before she came to me.
The Prisoner made no Defence, and the Jury found her 

               Guilty
            .

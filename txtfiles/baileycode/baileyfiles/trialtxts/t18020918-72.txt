, at St. Margaret's-hill; I lost two casks, just opposite Dark-house-lane


, on the 30th of August, about a quarter before twelve at noon; one cask contained two gallons of spirits of wine, and the other five gallons of bitters.
JOHN SMITH sworn. - I am an officer; on the 30th of August, I was standing with another officer, at the end of the Minories, two men came up and looked bard at me; I saw them cross the way, and go up to the prisoner, who was resting a small cask on a post; in consequence of their speaking to him, he walked off with it as fast as he could, into Petticoat-lane; I followed him, and spoke to him, upon which he threw the cask down and run away; I pursued him, and took him; he was very obstinate at first; he said, it was a keg of rum, which some man gave to him to carry, and offered me two guineas to let him go. (The cask was produced and identified.)
Prisoner's defence. I had been to the other end of the town, a man asked me to carry it to Wingfield-street, that man followed me, and shoved me against the wall, and hurt my hand, which made me drop the cask.

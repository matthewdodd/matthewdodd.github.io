. I lost a piece of broad cloth last month; it was the lining of a stage coach that stood in my yard; I did not miss it till last Saturday fortnight. which was the Saturday following, when the prisoner, Ward, came to me, and acquainted me he had stole it, and shewed me the coach he stole it from; Ward confessed it at the Rotation Office, where he desired to be made an evidence.

             took the prisoners; he was called on his recognizance, but did not appear.
Ward's Defence.
I never owned that I cut it from the coach at all; I never said any such thing. I lay in the coach in that place several times, having no habitation; as I was coming out one morning, the other prisoner came into the yard with the cloth under his arm, and asked me to go with him to sell it, and we were stopped.

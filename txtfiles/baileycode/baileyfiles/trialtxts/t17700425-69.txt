            . I live in the Minories


 with Mr. Boddington, a baker
. I saw the prisoner in our shop on the 6th of April, between seven and eight in the evening, as I was sitting in a back-room, through a glass door. He took the two coats and my waistcoat, and ran out. I followed him, and took him about thirty yards from our door; he had never been out of my sight. I took him and the clothes back. He said, two boys gave them to him.
Mrs. Boddington. I went after the prisoner, and saw him with the clothes in his hand; the two coats are my husband's. I told the prisoner, he would come to a very bad end. He said, he never was on Justice Fielding's list yet.

Two boys hired me for two pence to fetch them clothes.

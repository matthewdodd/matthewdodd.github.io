            . I am wife to Edward, but he does not live with me, he lives with another woman. On the 16th of January I lost the things mentioned in the indictment, (mentioning them by name) from my own apartment in Gray's-inn-lane


; the prisoner lodged in the same house, but I had no suspicion of his taking them. I went to enquire about among the pawnbrokers, and found the petticoat pawned in his wife's name in Turnmill-street; then I went and got a warrant to take up the prisoner and his wife on suspicion; I took them before Justice Welch; the prisoner there cleared his wife, and owned he himself robbed me of all the things, and confessed where he had pawned them; some in Turnmill-street, and some in the Strand. The justice directed me to go to the people; I went, and they brought the things to the justice.
Prisoner. I have nothing to say.

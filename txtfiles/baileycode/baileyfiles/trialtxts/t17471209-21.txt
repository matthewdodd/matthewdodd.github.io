.
Ezdra Redger. I had a waistcoat stole, a black silk waistcoat, on Monday night last, I observed her going to the back room where it was; the Prisoner came to drink at our house, and I observed her to go towards my back room, where all these things were; I mist these things very soon the next morning; I went and took an inventory of her goods as she was my tenant, and she clapt her hands upon these things, and she said they were not fit for me to see: I said my wife should then; but when we saw them, she then beg'd I would not trouble her.
Court to the Prisoner. What have you to say?
Prisoner. A woman gave them to me, and laid them upon my table.




               Guilty 10 d.

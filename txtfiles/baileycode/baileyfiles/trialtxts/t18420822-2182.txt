JAMES MURRAY
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
28th of July, 1 coat, value 1l. 5s., the goods of 



Ephraim Haley.






EPHRAIM HALEY
. I am a plumber and painter, and live at Uxbridge. On Thursday evening, the 28th of July, I hung a black coat up in the passage of my house—I went out on Friday mo wring, returned on Saturday, and missed the coat—there was a bill in the pocket—I have since seen the coat and the bill—the prisoner is a stranger.





ISAAC QUINNEY
 (police-constable T 87.) I met the prisoner near Hillingdon, on Thursday, the 28th, at a quarter past twelve o'clock at night, with a sack on his back—I searched it, and found this black coat in it, and this bill in the coat, with mr. Haley's name on it—the prisoner told me he had bought it at Uxbridge for three half-crowns. (Property produced and sworn to.)

Prisoner's Defence. I buy marine-stores; I bought the coat of a man for three half-crowns; I came into Uxbridge in the afternoon, and went to a lodging; I gave a woman half-a-crown to get some ale; she would not give it me back again; I would not stop, but came off towards London, and was taken; I bought the coat about five o'clock in the afternoon, in a back street; as I was calling "old umbrellas," the man came out, and asked me to buy it; he looked like a gentleman's servant.





EPHRAIM HALEY

re-examined. I had the coat on at nine o'clock that very night, so that he must have bought it four hours before I lost it.




GUILTY
. Aged 18.—


Transported for Seven Years.

JOHN BARNES
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
27th of November, 1 handkerchief, value 3s., the goods of 



Edward Williams, from his person.






EDWARD WILLIAMS
. I live in Basinghall-street. On the 27th of November, about half-past nine o'clock, I was in Duck-street, Smithfield—I felt a slight touch behind—I instantly turned round, and saw the prisoner running from me—I ran after him about fifty yards, and laid hold of him, and said, "You have got my handkerchief"—he denied it—I said, "You must have dropped it," and the constable passing by took hold of him—I found it on a dust heap in another street—not where it was taken from me.

Prisoner. It was nine or ten yards from where I was standing—I had not been in that street at all. Witness. It was taken from me in Duck-street—he ran through Bartholomew-close, and there I found it.





ROBERT TYRRELL
. On Sunday night I heard the cry of "Stop thief"—I was in a house—I ran out, and saw the prosecutor with this lad—I took him, and found nothing on him—I told the prosecutor to look about—he went a few paces, and got on a dust-hill and found it.

Prisoner. I stopped to make water—a man past me—this gentleman came and caught hold of me, and said, "You have got my handkerchief"—I said, "No I have not" he said, "I am sure it is you"—I said, "I have not, search me"—he would not—the officer came, and he jumped up a place and found it—I had not passed that place at all.





EDWARD WILLIAMS
. Yes, he had passed close by, and was just by there when he was taken.




GUILTY
*. Aged 18 Years.—


Transported for Seven Years.

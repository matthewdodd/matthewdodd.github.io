            . On the 22d of January, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, I was at the end of Watling-street, near St. Paul's Church-yard


, walking with a friend, and felt something at my pocket, I put my hand down, and missed my handkerchief, turned round, and saw the prisoner behind me, with my handkerchief in his hand; I took it from him, collared him, and charged him with picking my pocket. He denied it, and said he picked it up. I said that was not true, and I must give him in charge. He requested I would walk down the street with him, where he could get a character - I did so, but he could not point out the house. I gave him in charge.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner. I was in distress.

            . Aged 40.




               Transported for Seven Years

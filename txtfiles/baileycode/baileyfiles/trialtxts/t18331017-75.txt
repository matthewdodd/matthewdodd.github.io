            . I know the prosecutor's shop- he is a pawnbroker
, and lives at No. 105, Bishopsgate-street


. On the 12th of October I was passing the shop; I saw the prisoner try to take several things outside, she then went into the shop, and took this shirt, and came out putting it under her shawl - I took hold of her, struck me in the eye, and ran off - I had taken the shirt from her, and I crossed the road and took her.

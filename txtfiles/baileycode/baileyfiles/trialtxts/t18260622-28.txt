            . I am shopman to Mr. William Curtis, linen-draper
, Sloane-street, Chelsea


. On the 22d of May the prisoner and another young man came into the shop together, and asked for some white cotton stockings, and while I turned to call the shopwoman, to serve them, the other man ran out of the shop - the prisoner followed him - I saw the wrapper, which covered these handkerchiefs, moved; the prisoner had been near them; I ran out and secured him, just outside the door; the other escaped; Souter produced one piece, containing six handkerchiefs; I lost five pieces - the other man must have had the rest - they are worth 5l. together.

            . I am a butcher. About seven o'clock in the morning I was within a few yards of this shop, and saw Jones holding the prisoner outside the door; he took him into the shop; I saw him put his hand into his coat pocket, and throw the handkerchiefs down on the ground - the other man ran away.(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I know nothing of the other young man. I was in this shop when he came in, and stood three yards from him - the other man dropped the handkerchiefs - I took them up.

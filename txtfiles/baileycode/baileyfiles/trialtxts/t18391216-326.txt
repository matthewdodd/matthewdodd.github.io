SAMUEL WILLIAM MOLLINEUX
. I am a butcher, and live in St. George's. On the 14th of December, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I missed a piece of beef—I went out and asked my man about it—he knew nothing about it—I went into the room, put out the candle, and looked over the blind—I saw the prisoner, come, to my board, put a cloth over a piece of beef, and run away with it—I went out after him—he was stopped by some gentleman—I never lost sight of him—he threw it in the mud, and I picked it up—I took him to the station-house.





EDWARD SIMMONS
 (police-constable H 115.) I took the prisoner, and found this cloth on him, and 2 1/2 d.—I said, "Have you got the beef?"—he said, "No, I hove it down."

Prisoner. I did it for want—I have been twelve months in the House of Correction, and could get no work.




GUILTY
.* Aged 16.—


Transported for Seven Years—Convict Ship.

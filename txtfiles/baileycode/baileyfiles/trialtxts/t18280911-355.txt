JAMES LYNCH. I live in Oxford-buildings, Bloomsbury


. The prisoner lodged at my house six nights in the course of July; he did not tell me he was going, but I got up on the 15th of July to work - I went into my apartment - the prisoner was gone; I missed a shawl, a jacket, a hat, a pair of shoes, and a pair of overalls - I had seen them all safe the night before; I have never seen them since - I met the prisoner about seven weeks afterwards, and said, "I think you have seen my face before;" he said,"Yes, James, I have seen you - I am very sorry for what I have done, and if you will go to work, I will go to work and make you recompence for it;" I said, "If you will go home I will consider about it" - I gave him in charge; he said he had pawned the shawl for 3s., and sold the duplicate for 6d. - the other things he had sold.

            . I took the prisoner - he said he knew nothing about the robbery, but at the watch-house he said he pawned the shawl on Saffron-hill for 3s., and made away with the rest of the property.
Prisoner. The prosecutor held out hopes to me, that if I acknowledged what I had done with these things he would let me go - I said Yes, to get away, but I know nothing of them; I was only a nightly lodger, and the door was open - any one could get in.

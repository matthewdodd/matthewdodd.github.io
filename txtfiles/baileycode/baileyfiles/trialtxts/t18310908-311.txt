            . I am the prosecutor's sister. The prisoner came to the house, and I opened the door - he rushed in before I could get the door open; he went to the window, and took the umbrellas - I hanged the door too, and set my back against it to prevent his getting out of the shop - I had no one in the house, but I called out Uncle! thinking that would frighten the prisoner - I saw the Policeman go by in about five minutes; I called him in, and gave charge of him.

            . I am an officer. I was called in about twelve o'clock - I found the prisoner with his back against the counter, and five umbrellas lying on his left side, which Isaacs charged him with stealing from the window - I asked him his reason for doing so; he said that would be known by-and-by; he supposed they sold them; I said Yes, but they were not to be stolen.(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner. I shall leave it to the mercy of the Court.

THOMAS GATES



was indicated for stealing 26lbs. of bacon, value 13s.; the goods of 



John Matthews; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






WALTER ROBERT LEIGH
(police-sergeant T 7.) On the 22nd of Dec., at a quarter-past two in the morning, I was on duty in Bridge-road, Hammersmith—I pass the back premises of Mr. Matthews, and heard a noise—I looked over the gate, and saw the prisoner with a piece of bacon partly on the wall and partly on some boxes, and his hand was on it—I asked him what he was doing there—he said he worked for Mr. Matthews, and he was going out with the cart—I jumped over the gate, and he escaped—I found this piece of bacon, another piece in the hog tub, and another piece Mr. Matthews found in the morning.





JONH MATTHEWS.
 On the 22nd of Dec. I lost three pieces of bacon—these are them—they were not taken off the premises—they are my property—I can swear to them—before they were taken they were in pickle in a shed in my back yard—the shed was not locked—I recollect being called up by the policeman—the bacon he showed me was mine.

Prisoner. I was not there at the time the policeman mentions; I am innocent; they took me on suspicion.





WALTER ROBERT LEIGH

re-examined. I knew the prisoner well before—I have seen him three or four times a day for the last twelve months—I was not more than ten or twelve inches form his face—I put my bull's-eye in his face—I knew him well.





HENRY MOUNT.
 I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction at this Court—(read—Convicted 3rd Feb., 1845, having been before convicted, confined three months)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY. Aged 27.—


Transported for Seven Years.

and
BODKIN
conducted the Prosecution.






WALTER ROBERTSON SCULTHORPE
. I am one of the presidents of the Lon-don District Post-office. The prisoner has been a letter-carrier there about fourteen years, and has been stationed at Deptford the greater part of the time—on 10th Feb. I marked a half-sovereign and a sixpence, in the presence of Mr. Cole, and folded them in this card (produced)—I did not turn down the ends, I put it in the inner-fold of this letter, put the whole into this cover, sealed, and addressed it to Thomas Jefferies, Mickley. near Ripon, Yorkshire, and gave it to Peak, with instructions—if posted at Deptford or New-cross, before four o'clock that afternoon, it would arrive in London about ten minutes to six—I was at the office when the Deptford mail-bag arrived—I looked for the letter; it was not in the bag—I went with Cole, Peak, and Russell, to the Deptford post-office; we got there about seven—Cole and Russell parted from me—I followed shortly afterwards, and found them at the prisoner's house, in a street leading out of Pomeroy-street, and found him there—Mr. Cole said in his presence, "We have found the money and the letter"—the money was produced—I examined it, and found my marks on it—Peak then produced the letter—I examined it, and said to the prisoner," How do you account for this? this is my money"—he said the money must have shaken out of the letter; when he called at New-cross for the collection he put it properly into his pouch, and going to the office a man gave him a ride in his cart, and the cart having no springs it must have jolted the money out of the letter—I then said, "Why did not you give it to the charge-taker at Deptford, when you gave in your collection?"—he said, "I did not discover it in my pouch until after I left the office"—I gave him in charge—the office at New-cross is a mile or more from the post-office at Deptford, where he would have to carry the letters—there is a charge-taker there, to whom it would be his duty to deliver his letters—I believe New-cross was the only place where he would have to call—to the best of my belief I found the letter folded the reverse way—I put the money in the inner fold—it was not there when shown to me; the cover was torn, as now, and part of the wax broken away.

Cross-examined by
MR. DUNCAN. Q. Are not your duties, amongst others, to investigate the defalcations of the letter-carriers? A. Yes—I have never had to charge the prisoner with defalcations before; he has borne a general good character, but I should not have gone at once to him unless I had my idea of him—I left both ends of the card open—the letter was folded square, with all the ends in, and placed inside the envelope—there are receiving-houses at Deptford, which send their letters up to London—it would be his duty to deliver his collection up at Deptford. and assist in picking out the cross-post letters, and telling up the number of letters brought in by the other collections, which are all forwarded to London in a bag—there were about 288 letters that day—as soon as he had done that, the London down-bag would be due; it would then be his duty to take the letters directed to Deptford, on his way to New-cross again; that concluded his duty for the day—he does not have to return to Deptford—five or ten minutes is allowed for the dispatch of the up-bag—there is considerable haste occasionally—I have never caused test-letters to be posted at New-cross or Deptford before—not

five minutes elapsed between my sending Russell and Cole, on and my arriving—it may have been next day before I examined the letter, I am not positive—I gave it back to Peak.





MATTHEW PEAK
. I am a constable of the post-office. On 10th Feb. I received from Mr. Sculthorpe this letter, sealed; it appeared to contain coin—I pot it into the post at New-cross, at twenty minutes to four o'clock in the afternoon—it bears the New-cross stamp.

Cross-examined. Q. You went with Mr. Sculthorpe to the prisoner's I house, and found Mr. Cole and Russell? A. Yes; Mr. Cole said, "We I have found your money, Sir," addressing Mr. Sculthorpe, who looked at it, I and left the house with me.





ANN HAMMOND
. I keep the post-office receiving-house, at New-cross. If a letter was posted at the receiving-house at twenty minutes to four o'clock it would be forwarded to Deptford at a quarter to five—on 10th Feb. the prisoner came to the office for the letters; one of them appeared to contain something—I gave it to the prisoner with the rest—he looked them over, and put them together in my presence—I think there were between fifty and sixty.

Cross-examined. Q. Did you go through them one by one? A. I had I them all singly in my hand; they are all laid ready for him to take up when I he comes in—two or three letters every time contain something—I did not notice this one at all—I was not examined before the Magistrate when the prisoner was committed—the postman is allowed a quarter of an hour between New-cross and Deptford—sometimes he has only just time to take the letters up, put them into the bag, and go away with them—the number of the paid I and unpaid letters is entered in the bill, which is laid with them, ready for him to take up—the paid are separated from the unpaid and stamped—the I practice is to tie up the letters with a piece of string before he puts them into the pouch.





CHARLES CRAWLEY
. I am & letter-carrier, of Deptford. On 10th Feb. I and Evans, another letter-carrier, made up and dispatched the London-bag at forty-five minutes past four o'clock; that enclosed letters going from New-cross to the London District for six o'clock—the prisoner brought the New-cross collection—I always ask him whether they are all right, and he says, "Yes;" that is with reference to the number on the bill—it is his business to see that the number corresponds with the bill—he then proceeds to lay the country letters in for delivery—he does not assist in making up the London-bag, he I merely hands them over to me, and I put them into the bag—the letters are I not given out before the London-bag is dispatched—when they are given out he sorts them for delivery—he started on his delivery that afternoon I somewhere near half-past five—he would have no occasion to return to the Deptford-office after that—after his last collection it was his practice to hang up his pouch in the office, and then go and deliver his letters.

Cross-examined. Q. You know the general practice of the Deptford postoffice? A. Yes, the letters are already sorted when the prisoner comes in—his letters are placed in the bag—the bye-letters are taken off first, and then when he says "All right," I understand all right for London—the bye-letters are deducted—the down-bag arrives sometimes at a quarter to five, and sometimes at five o'clock—it has occasionally arrived before the up-bag has gone—I will not swear that they did not arrive together—the down-bag is never put on the same side as the up-bag—if they do arrive together there is a little more haste to dispatch the London-bag—the time allowed between New-cross and Deptford is invariably fifteen minutes.

MR. CLARKSON. Q. Do they always finish one bag before they comment

the other? A. One man is sometimes sorting the down bag and the others are tying and sorting the London-bag, but they are always kept separate—the same man does not interfere with both at the same time—if the prisoner has bye-letters it is his duty to give them to the post-master's assistant—they are separated at the receiving-house at New-cross—the number of paid and the number of bye-letters are put on the bill—if there are fifty letters, and two of them bye-letters, they would be deducted by the letter-carrier, and the number would be forty-eight, which added to the letters for the London-post, would make up the number he had—it is his duty to ascertain that the letters for London only are passed to me—I then ask if all is right, and he says, "Yes."





WELCOME COLE
. I am an inspector of letter-carriers to the London district. I was present and saw Mr. Sculthorpe put half-a-sovereign and six-pence in a letter—I saw them marked—these are the same—the envelope was folded in this way—the coin was in this card, which was in the inner fold of the paper—on the same day, a little after seven o'clock, I went with Russell, the policeman, to the prisoner's-house, 4, Alfred-place, Pomeroy-street, Kent-road—we saw the prisoner—I asked if he knew me—he said, "No"—I said I was inspector of letter-carriers, and the person with me was the police-constable from the office, and asked him if he was on duty at the Deptford-office when the five o'clock bag was made up for London—he said, "Yes"—I asked if he made up the bag—he said, "No", I only counted some of the letters"—I said there were two letters posted before four o'clock that ought to have arrived in that bag, but had not, and asked if he knew anything about them—he said, "No"—I said as one of them was posted at New-cross, where he collected, had he any objection to be searched—he said, "No"—I asked what money he had—he put both his hands into his trowsers pockets and took from the left pocket half-a-sovereign and sixpence, and from the other he put on the table 3s.—I took up the half-sovereign and sixpence, examined them, and said, "This is Mr. Sculthorpe's money"—I examined two sixpences before I found the right—the second was the one that had accompanied the half-sovereign—he said, "That I found in my pouch; it shook out of a letter on my way to the office"—I said, "Where is the letter?"—he was about to put his hand into his pocket—I stopped him, and told Russell to search him, who took the letter produced from his breast coat-pocket with the seal broken as it is now—I did not take the letter out of the envelope till Mr. Sculthorpe came—it was then in the same state—I told Mr. Sculthorpe, loud enough to be heard in the room, that I had found the money and letter—the prisoner was taken to the Deptford post-office—he was asked where he put his pouch—he got up from his seat and showed me behind the door in the office, and took it off the hook—he said he had not been at the office from the time of having been with his letters until he was brought back by me—I took the letter out of the envelope at the post-office, and found the card in the inner fold, in the other leaf of the sheet, quite contrary to where it had been placed by Mr. Sculthorpe—it was on the reverse side, showing only the white of the paper, instead of the writing—if the prisoner had found any letter in his pouch from which money had escaped, it would be his duty, when he arrived at Deptford, to give it to the charge-taker.

Cross-examined. Q. Where is the seal broken? A. portion of the impression is gone, and the paper is torn, in the state it is now—a portion of this blue wax adhered to the under fold—it was very small, only a speck—I do not know whether blue or fancy sealing-wax is used in the post-office for detecting crimes of this sort, or that fancy waxes are more likely to open—I

think it is more strong than the other—red or common black wax is much more likely to break than this; this is much purer—the half-sovereign, six-pence, and card would not be a heavy weight for this envelope—if the money came out of the envelope, it must in the first instance have come out inside the note, and then, if this piece of blue sealing-wax was to give way, it would almost necessarily fall out, if it was a single letter—I did not tell the prisoner when I went to his house that he was suspected of taking or stealing a letter, or that what he said might be urged in a Criminal Court against him—I went on with the investigation without any warning to him—I received instructions from my superior officer, Mr. Sculthorpe—he gave me no specified instructtions—I have several times gone into people's houses without giving them warning—the officer took away some articles, and among them a silver watch and some money—I did not direct him to take it—it has not been restored—it is in my possession now—the officer gave it me the same evening—I heard the prisoner say to Mr. Sculthorpe, "The money shook out of a letter on my way to the office, as I rode in a cart that had no springs"—I did not hear him say he believed the letter had broken away from the string, and shaken out into his pouch from the jolting.

MR. BODKIN. Q. Does the money in the card, when placed in the envelope fill it as near as possible? A. When taken from the prisoner it only reached to the seal—it filled up about one half of the envelope.





WILLIAM RUSSILL
 (policeman). I went with Mr. Cole to the prisoner's house, took the letter from his breast-pocket, and gave it to Mr. Cole in the state in which I found it.

Cross-examined. Q. Did you see the prisoner take a half-sovereign and sixpence from his left pocket? A. Yes, and 3s. or 4s. from his right—the prisoner said he found the money and letter in the bottom of his pouch, that he rode in a cart without springs, and he believed it had jolted out—he said when Mr. Cole asked him, that he had no objection to be searched—he said he knew nothing about it.
(Francis Weaver, fishmonger, of Lower-street, Islington; William Richards, shopkeeper; and John Piper, ironmonger, of Peckham; gave the prisoner's good character.)

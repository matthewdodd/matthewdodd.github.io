             sworn. - I am a lace-manufacturer
, I keep a shop in Bishopsgate-street


: I lost some lace on or about the 20th of January last, about one o'clock in the day; I saw the prisoner at the bar come to our shop-window, with a little boy with him, I was talking with a gentleman backwards in the accompting-house, and I perceived something move in the window; in consequence of which, I went into the shop, and I perceived that a square of glass in the window was broke; I perceived the prisoner taking up a card of lace, which is cut off, we have an alley on one side of the house that I imagine he made his escape through; I pursued him but could not take him.
Q. Look at the prisoner, can you undertake to swear that that is the person? - A. I can; I dare say he was ten minutes, or a quarter of an hour, about the window, I am perfectly satisfied in my own mind as to his person; he was not apprehended till the 27th of April; the same square of glass was broke a second time that day. I had seen him four or five days about the house prior to that, and did not know whether I should take him or not; the lace I have never found.
Prisoner's defence. I am really innocent.

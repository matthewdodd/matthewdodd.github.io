            . I am a baker
, and live in Shepherdess-lane, City-road


, my coat was stolen off the parlour door, adjoining the shop - it was produced in half an hour by Bradford.

            . I am a milkman, and live next door to Leffen. I was passing his door, and saw the prisoner and another opposite; I noticed them. About five minutes after I heard of the robbery, and told the prosecutor if he went across the City-road he would find them. I am sure the prisoner is one of them.

            . I am a headborough of St. Luke's. I was in Peerless-row, and saw the coat rumpled up under the prisoner's arm; I asked him where he got it? he said two boys dropped it and he picked it up - I found it was the prosecutor's.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

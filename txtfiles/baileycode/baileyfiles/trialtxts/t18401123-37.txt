SAMUEL JUKES
. I live with John Pare and others, ironmongers, in Chiswell-street. On the 4th of November the prisoner came in company with another boy who asked for a pennyworth of tacks—I had seen the prisoner before—he then attempted to take a parcel, but my attention was called away by a boy—in about a quarter of an hour he came again with another—the other asked for some tacks, and during the time I saw the prisoner take a parcel, and walk off—I called a young man, who stopped him at the door, and he threw it down—it contained these two sconces.





FREDERICK POWER
. I am in Messrs, Pare's employ. I saw the prisoner in the shop, and saw him throw down the parcel—he was taken into custody.

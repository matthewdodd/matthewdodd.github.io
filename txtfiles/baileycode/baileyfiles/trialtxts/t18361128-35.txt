THOMAS BROWN
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
8th of November, 1 handkerchief, value 2s. 6d., the goods of 



Charles Teakle, from his person.






CHARLES TEAKLE
. I was in Goswell-street between seven and eight o'clock in the evening of the 8th of November and felt in my pocket and missed my handkerchief—I saw the prisoner two or three yards from me—I collared him, and saw my handkerchief fall between his legs by a shop window—he struggled very much to get away, and threw me down in the mud, but I detained him—he then said he did not know what I took him

for—I gave him in charge—he was looking in at a pastrycook's shopwindow—he had a white apron on.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

Prisoner. A gentleman and lady coming along kicked this handkerchief—the gentleman took it up and threw it down again—I did nothing more than kick it with my foot—I never stole it—the gentleman was very much intoxicated, and with a woman of the town. Witness. I was perfectly sober—a person picked up the handkerchief and gave it to me—there is no truth in his statement.





HENRY BARRY
. I am a policeman. The prosecutor was perfectly sober.




GUILTY
. Aged 26.—


Transported for Seven Years.

Fourth Jury, before Mr. Sergeant Arabin.

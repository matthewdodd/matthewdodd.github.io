John Donnel. The 26th of June, the Watch was stole on board a Ship (The Willing Mind)


 riding off the Armitage. I was just got out of Bed to roll some Goods out of the Hold; and while I was in the Hold, he stole the Watch out of my Breeches which lay on a Chair in the Cabbin. I advertised it, and the Watchmaker he had sold it to, brought me the Watch again. I took the Prisoner before Justice Farmer, and he confessed the Fact, and signed his Examination.
The Confession being proved, was read.

            . I had the Misfortune to buy this Watch of the Prisoner, three or four Days afterwards I saw the Advertisement: it did not come up fully to the Description in the Advertisement, for the Maker's Name is advertised (W A Y) and the Name on the Watch is WISE; however I immediately carried it to the Prosecutor, who own'd it; the Prisoner was taken up, and carried before Justice Farmer, where I saw him sign his Confession. 


               Guilty, single Felony

I am a hosier
, in the Strand, the corner of Catherine-street


; on the 15th of January last, in the morning, I was in my parlour reading the newspaper, about ten in the morning, my two sons were in the shop, and no servant there; one of them came running in to call me, and I stept into the shop, and in the further end of the shop, I was astonished when I found this young man the prisoner, where nobody should have been; where some silk stockings were laying, he had come in as a purchaser, it was in the middle part of the shop, on the out-side of the counter; he told me he wanted a silk waistcoat piece, which he pointed to, I saw by his confusion that something was not right; he had a great coat buttoned, and I saw him drop, from under his coat, these stockings, the shopman came in and took them up.
(Deposed to.)

             the shopman confirmed the above account.
PRISONER's DEFENCE.
I went into this shop to buy a waistcoat, and there were two children at play, and they told me to go forwards, which I did, and I was going towards Mr. English, and in returning, I stept my foot on two pair of stockings, and instantly Mr. English accused me of taking them.

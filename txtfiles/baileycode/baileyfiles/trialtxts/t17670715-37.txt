            , a shoemaker
 in Birchin-lane


; the prisoner came into my master's shop the day before yesterday, and said he wanted a pair of shoes; I showed him some; he gave me a deal of trouble; he tried a pair, and pot them under a chair, none would please him; he went out of the shop, then he stood looking through a pane of glass; I went to the farther end of the shop, then he came in almost double, with his head almost to the ground, and conveyed them under his left arm, and just as he got to the threshold of the door I catched hold of him (produced and deposed to;) I sent for his mother by Mr. Knight's desire; he was for turning him about his business, but his mother begged for God's sake he might be sent abroad, for he was a very bad lad, and his uncle sent word to me the same yesterday.

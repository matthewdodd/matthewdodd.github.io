            . On the 1st of January I followed the prisoner from my sister's shop, Mary Batty, in King-street, Goswell-street


 - I saw him throw down this pound of candles - she had been continually robbed of candles, and we could never tell who robbed her; so she tied a long string to the candles, and a bell at the end to give an alarm - one of the children called out, "The candles are gone again;" I ran out, took the track of the string, and as soon as the bell began to ring the prisoner threw the candles down - I took him, and brought him and the candles back to the shop.
 - LYNCH. I am an officer. I took the prisoner; these are the candles.

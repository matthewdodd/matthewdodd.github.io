            . I am an extra tide-waiter
, and live in Cannon-street, St. George's in the East. On the 20th of July, about ten o'clock at night, I was going on duty, and at the corner of George-street, Tower-hill


, three men came after me - the prisoner, I am certain, is one - he chucked me under my chin, and took my watch from me; I collared him, and gave him in charge. I have not recovered it.

            . I am a cork-cutter. I was passing, heard a noise, and saw the prosecutor lay hold of the prisoner, I assisted in securing him; he struggled very hard - two more came up, and told me he was not the man - they jostled me. I saw the watch in the prisoner's hand at the time. When we got to the watch-house he had not got it.

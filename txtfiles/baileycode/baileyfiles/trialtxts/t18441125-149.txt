DAVID WARDER
. I am assistant to Mr. Clement Smith, a pawnbroker, in Bath-street, City-road. On the 21st of Nov., about four o'clock in the afternoon, I was at my master's shop—I saw the prisoner standing outside—he took a knife from his pocket, and cut a pair of boots off a rail before the window—he put the boots under his coat, and walked away a few steps—I had three people in the shop, and I ran out after him—he saw me, and began to run—he threw the boots over the workhouse wall—I pursued and took him—he begged me to let him go, and said hunger made him do it—I said he must come back—these are the boots—they are my master's.





WILLIAM DAMER
 (police-constable G 161.) I took the prisoner, and got these boots from the gatekeeper at the workhouse.

Prisoner. I was coming up the street about four o'clock; a great number of women were outside the door; these boots were on the pavement, and I picked them up and went about 100 yards; he came after me and said, "Give me those boots," and I threw them away.





CHARLES FANN WRIGHT
 (police-constable N 304.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got at Mr. Clark's offfice—(read—"Convicted on the 8th of May, 6th Vict.")—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY

Transported for Seven Years

WILLIAM CATCHPOLE. On the 19th of May I was in Osnaburg-street, Regent's-park


, and met the prisoner; I had 7s. in my waistcoat pocket; we were talking together, and I found her hand in my pocket, and told her she had taken my money - she denied it; I took her to the watch-house, and gave her in charge. I am certain it was safe just before; she said all she had about her was sixpence and some halfpence. The watchman let her go; I stopped heragain, and took her to another watchman, who made her take the seven shillings out of her mouth.

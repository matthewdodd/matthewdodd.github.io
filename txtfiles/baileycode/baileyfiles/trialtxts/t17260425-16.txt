             thus depos'd. The Prisoner came to an Ale-house where I live, and said his Wife was dead, and he had got her Gown and Petticoat to sell, which were these here, and I bought them of him for 9 s. The Prisoner in his Defence said, that he bought the Clothes in Rag Fair for his Wife, but she being dead he sold them again. The Jury found him 

               Guilty
            .

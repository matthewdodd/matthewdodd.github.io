            . I am the wife of George Smith. On the 27th of August the prisoner came to our house and lodged there - next day she went away, between eight and nine o'clock in the evening; there was this quilt, fire-irons, and other articles in the room - I did not miss them till Monday night, between eight and nine o'clock, when we broke the door open; it was on Saturday she left - the door was locked, and she took the key with her; when we took her she denied having lodged with me, or having seen me.

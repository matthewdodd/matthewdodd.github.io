            . I am a Police-constable. Last Saturday, about two o'clock, I was at Holborn-bars


, and saw the prisoner take a book off a board in front of Mr. Bumpus' window, and conceal it under his coat; I immediately took him into custody - he said nothing; I took him into the shop - Mr. Bumpus wanted me to let him go, but I refused.

            . I am a Police-constable. I was passing down Holborn with my brother officer, and saw the prisoner by Mr. Bumpus' window; I saw him conceal something under his coat - Lancaster immediately took him; I went to lay hold of his collar, and this book fell from under his coat - it is Jennings' Encyclopaedia.
JAMES PETTIT, I am in the employ of Mr. Thomas Bumpus. I put this book on the shop-board about nine o'clock in the morning - the selling price is 14s.; I know the prisoner - he was convicted last Session by the name of 
               
                  George 
                  Wilson
               



            , of robbing us, I am quite positive of his person; I produce the certificate of his former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office - (read.)
The prisoner pleaded distress.

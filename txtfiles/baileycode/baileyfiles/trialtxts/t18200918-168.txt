            . I belong to the ship Providence
. I was standing opposite the Black Horse public-house, New Gravel-lane


, waiting for a shipmate; the prisoner and two others came up, and got into conversation with me. Carpenter came up to wish me good bye, as I was going to sea - the prisoner snatched my watch out; all three ran off together. I followed and overtook him, without losing sight of him, but he had not got my watch. I paid 4 l. for it the day before.

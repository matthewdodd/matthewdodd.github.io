            . I am a carpenter, and live in Castle-street, Oxford-market. On the 16th of July, about nine o'clock at night, I was in the narrow part of Spring-gardens, going into the Park, and saw the prisoners together, feeling several gentlemens' pockets. They followed a gentleman along Cockspur-street, and at the corner of Pall-mall


 Wright took up the skirt of his coat, and took a handkerchief out. I went up, told the gentleman, and seized them both. Matthews threw the handkerchief down, and wrested himself from me; I picked it up, called Stop thief! Gillon stopped him in my sight. The gentleman claimed the handkerchief. The gang came round, I told him to follow me to the watch-house, but he did not. I do not know his name.


                  JOSEPH 
                  GILLON
               



            . My father is the watch-house-keeper. I heard Bidgood cry Stop thief! saw Matthews running in the road, and secured him.

            . I am a smith. I saw Matthews running and seized him - on going up Church-passage he dropped a silk handkerchief.

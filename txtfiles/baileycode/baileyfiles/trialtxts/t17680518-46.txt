            . I am owner of the building at Pimlico


. On the 4th of May in the morning we missed about 5 or 600 weight of lead from two houses, and on the next day about ten in the morning, we found 7 pieces about four inches under water in our saw-pit, my property, and on the next night I watched and saw the prisoner taking it out of the pit; he put one piece in a sack which he brought, and he had got out another piece of 69 pounds ready to put in when I took him; he gave me various accounts of the place where he lodged; there was no thoroughfare where he went to get the lead.

            . I stood centinel at the Cannon near this place, and saw the prisoner go down towards this saw-pit with a sack under his arm.
The prisoner in his defence said, he went down to that place to ease himself.

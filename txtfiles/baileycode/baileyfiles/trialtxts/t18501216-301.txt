CATHARINE NEIL



, stealing 28 yards of printed cotton, value 12s.; the goods of 



John Cumner; having been before convicted.






EDWARD BRIGHT
. I am in the service of John Cumner, a linen-draper,

of High-street, Southwark. This piece of printed cotton is his property—I saw it safe about eight o'clock in the evening on 11th Nov. I missed it about half-past eight—it was fastened inside the door—I afterwards saw it in the fire-escape-man's hands—he was calling "Thief!" at the door.

Cross-examined by
MR. ROBINSON. Q. Has your master any partner? A. No.





EDWARD SMITH
. I belong to the fire-escape establishment—I was on my station that night, and saw the prisoner take this print and put it under her cloak—I laid hold of her arm, and kept her till the young man out of the shop came and took it.

Cross-examined. Q. Where were you? A. At my box, right opposite the shop—after eight o'clock we are all standing there—the prisoner's back was towards me—she did not stoop—it was about half-past eight.





WILLIAM DEAR
 (policeman, M 43). I produce a certificate—(read—Ellen Williams, Convicted Dec, 1849; Confined nine months)—I was present—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
.* Aged 45.—


Transported for Seven Years.

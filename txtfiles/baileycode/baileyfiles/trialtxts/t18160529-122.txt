            . I lost my handkerchief on the 2nd of May, at Brook Green Fair


. I did not miss my handkerchief until an officer came and laid hold of me, and tapped me on the shoulder, and told me I was robbed.

            . I was once an officer. I was attending at Brock Green Fair, about four o'clock in the afternoon of the 2nd of May, in company with Wonderoffe and Thompson. I observed the prisoners behind the prosecutor, and Merrett drew a handkerchief out of the prosecutor's pocket, and put it inside his frock; they then left him; one went one way, and the other went another. I ran after Merrett, and apprehended him, and took the handkerchief from his breast. We lost Truelove; but apprehended him afterwards. I saw Truelove attempt several pockets; I can't say I knew Merrett before; but I am certain they were together, and spoke to each other.

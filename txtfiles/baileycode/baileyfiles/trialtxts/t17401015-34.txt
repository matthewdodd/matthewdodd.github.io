            . Last Monday 7-night , I had occasion to go to the Door, and left the Prisoner alone in the Kitchen. I saw the Spoon just before I went up Stairs to the Door, and when I came down again, it was gone . When I first asked her about it, she said she knew nothing of it, but afterwards confessed the taking of it. I am Servant to Mr Rosey.

            . I was sent for to take charge of the Prisoner, I said, she had better tell the Woman where the Spoon was; and when I came with her to the Door of the Round House, she own'd that it was at a House in the Coal-Yard I went there with her, and the Woman of the House delivered it into her Hands. She confessed before the Justice, that she took it out of the Kitchen, while the Maid was gone up Stairs to open the Street Door. 


               Guilty 10 d.

            . I am a Watchman at the Conduit at Snow-Hill (they call it Lamb's Conduit:) the Prisoner was coming along with some Lead, I examined him, and he said he had the Lead from Mr Hiron's, and that he was going over the Bridge with it; I suspected it was stole; said I, instead of going over the Bridge you shall go to the Watch-House. The Prisoner passed by me twice, and that made me suspect him. 

               Guilty

             sworn.
On Tuesday morning last I lost out of my office in Great Armitage-street


 a leather trunk, two hats, a pair of shoes, a pair of buckles, a red Morocco pocketbook, two bound books of Mrs. Rowe's Works, and a stone breast-buckle; I saw the things the night before in the office, the door stands open; I was not come down stairs when the things were taken, the shoes were by the window, and the buckles on the table, and the other things in the trunk; the next morning 
               
                  Edward
                   Ryan
               



             came to me with an account of having taken the prisoner.

             sworn.
On the 17th of last month, between ten and eleven at night, these two men came to my house, and asked for a lodging; I sometimes board and lodge seamen

, they said they came from the ship called the South Carolina, and that they never were in London before; I said I had one spare bed,and they might lay that one night; they went up to bed, and left the trunk down stairs, and my wife went to lift the trunk, and perceived a receipt for one pound one, for the poor of Saint George's; I found a letter directed for the prosecutor; I examined closer and found children's stockings, and lace, and edging, and two bound books; I am a headborough, I was not easy, I went up stairs, and desired the prisoners to get out of bed; I called two watchmen, and took them to the watch-house; the next morning I went to the prosecutor's house according to the direction of the letter, and which were also on the shoes. (The things deposed to.) I asked him who directed him to my house; he said he could not tell me; I found the pocket-book on Ford, I suppose he hove it away, for I never saw it afterwards; Ford desired the other prisoner to go and fetch the trunk, but he was not very willing to go, and Ford went himself and brought it; in the watch-house after they were committed, I found a pair of plated shoe-buckles.
PRISONER FORD's DEFENCE.
The first day of my coming on shore in the morning, my money was almost gone; we met a girl who took us into a house; I had no money, I asked the girl in the house to pledge my watch, she went with me and pledged it for 5 s.; I sent this young fellow for my trunk, lest the captain should stop it; we went to board and lodge with this gentleman, I went to the public-house to get my trunk, and whether she brought out my own or no, I do not know; if I had stole a trunk, it is not to be supposed I should lay it about.
PRISONER THOMPSON's DEFENCE.
This gentleman sent me on board for his trunk, and the girl brought me a trunk, the girl brought out the wrong trunk; I never was in England before last Friday.

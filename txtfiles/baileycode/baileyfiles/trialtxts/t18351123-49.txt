HENRY HOOTING
 and 




JOHN OWEN
 were indicted for

 stealing, on the 
9th of November, 1 handkerchief, value 2s., the goods of 



Joseph Stainburn, from his person.






RICHARD TOZER
 (police-constable R 149.) I was in Cheapside, about five o'clock, on Monday, the 9th of November, and watched the two prisoners in company, for about ten minutes—I saw them near the prosecutor—Hooting put his hand into his pocket, and took something out—I told Wild,

another officer—Owen was going away—I seized him, and Wild took Hooting.





JAMES WILD
. I am a police-constable. I was with Tozer—we followed the prisoner for about ten minutes—I saw them very busy, trying pockets—I saw Hooting take something from the prosecutor's pocket—Owen was about to leave, and Tozer took him—I took Hooting, and found this handkerchief on him.





JOSEPH STAINBURN
. This is my handkerchief, and was in my pocket at the time—the prisoners were taken on the spot.

Hooting's Defence. I was walking along, and the policeman took me—he found this handkerchief at my feet—the prosecutor said he did not know whether it was his or not.

Owen's Defence. I was returning through the City—the policeman took hold of me, and said I was in company with this young man.

HOOTING—

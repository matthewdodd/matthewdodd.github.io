LEWIS LEWIS
. I am shopman to James Davey, a linen-draper, in Whitechapel-road. About two o'clock in the afternoon of the 12th of February, I received information, in consequence of which I jumped over the counter, ran out, and saw the prisoner running, and part of the cotton hanging from her shawl—I overtook her, and she handed the print to me, said she never would do any thing of the kind again, and began crying—I brought her back to the house, and gave her in charge—the print is the property of my employer—I had seen it half-an-hour before in the lobby of the door.






WILLIAM LAPWORTH
. I took the prisoner into custody.

Prisoner's Defence. It laid down by the door, and I picked it up.




GUILTY
. Aged 14.—


Transported for Seven Years.—Penitentiary.

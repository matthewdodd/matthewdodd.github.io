510. 




WILLIAM NASH
and 




JAMES HARRISON
were indicted for

 stealing, on the 
23rd of December, 1 copper, value 5s. 10d., the goods of 



William Jowell.






WILLIAM JOWELL.
I live at Isleworth, and am a market-gardener. I had this copper outside my shed—I missed it on Christmas-day—I had seen it safe a day or two before—I do not know exactly when it was taken—I know the prisoners used to come backwards and forwards to work—I believe one of them is a painter—this is my copper—(looking at it.)

Nash. Q. Can you swear to it? A. Yes, because my wife told my son to clean it, and he cut the bottom of it with a spade.





WILLIAM MILLS.
I am a dealer in marine stores, and live at Hounslow. I bought this copper of the prisoner Nash—a lad came with him, but I do not think it was Harrison—I think he was less than him—I know both the prisoners.





SAMUEL BARBER.
I am a parish constable. On the 28th of December I received information of this, and found Harrison—I asked what he knew about the copper—he said Nash stole the copper—I asked him how he knew that—he said he was with him at the time, and he sold it at Mills's, at Hounslow, for 5s. 10d.—I asked how he knew that—he said he was outside at the time—I went and took Nash—I told him what for—he made me no answer.

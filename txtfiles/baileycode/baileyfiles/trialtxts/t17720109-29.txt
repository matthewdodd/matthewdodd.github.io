            . I live in Mr. Payne's house, Liquorpond-street


; it is lett out in single tenements; Mr. Webb has the bottom room, which is a chandler's shop; I lodge up one pair of stairs. I lost a gown and petticoat on Monday the 30th of December. Smith lett a coat and waistcoat with me. Somebody came in at the window. I found the things at Mr. Needham's.

            . I am a pawn-broker on Saffron-hill. I took in this petticoat of 
               
                  Rebecca
                   Tinley

                  Rebecca
                   Tinley
               



            . I pawned it at Mr. Needham's; I had it from the prisoner; he said he had borrowed it of his sister in order to buy him a great coat; I pawned the gown for six shillings and six-pence to one Mrs. Parker.


                  Margaret
                   Parker
               



            . I am a pawnbroker. This gown (producing it) was brought to me by the last witness; she pawned it by the name of 
               
                  Margaret
                   Tinley
               



            ; I lent her six shillings and six-pence on it; I did not ask her if it was her own; she had often pawned things before; she said she had damaged it by setting her foot upon it.

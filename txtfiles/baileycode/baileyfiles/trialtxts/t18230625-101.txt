, I bought a lot of goods, and sent him home to my grandfather, about six o'clock in the evening, for eight sovereigns and a five pound note, as they came to more than I expected, and never saw him afterwards; he was apprehended in about a week.

Prisoner's Defence. I was rather in liquor at the time, and as I returned, met a friend, drank with him, and lost the 5 l. note somehow. A young man met me, and said I had better go and lay down with him, which I did, and he robbed me of the ten sovereigns.

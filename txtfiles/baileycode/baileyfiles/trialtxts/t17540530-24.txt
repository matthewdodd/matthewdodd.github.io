            . I am wife to

                  Barber 
               



            , and live in the Minories. The prisoner was my lodger, who came to me on the sixth of May, and asked what rooms I had to lett; I answered that I had one at three shillings a week, and he replied that was too much; but on the Tuesday he came and hired a lodging of me. This was on the eighth of May.
Q. How long did he stay in this lodging?


                  Martha 
                  Barber 
               



            . He staid Wednesday and Thursday.
Q. When did he leave the lodging?


                  Martha 
                  Barber 
               



            . On the Friday morning; I never saw him no more till he was catched in Moorfields.
Q. What goods were there gone out of your lodging?


                  Martha 
                  Barber 
               



            . I went in the afternoon to make the bed, and missed the pair of sheets, the pillow-case was ripped off, the window curtain gone, and the brass candlestick I gave him to light him up to bed; he did not take the blankets. When we had him before justice Withers, he denied that ever he saw me, and said, he did not know the Minories. When he came to take the lodgings, I asked him what trade he was, he said, a working silversmith: says I. where do you work? he said at Jone's, near Shoreditch. After I missed the things, I went on the Saturday morning, and there was no such person as Mr. Jones there. I went from one end to the other, and enquired at all the silversmiths.
Q. from the prisoner. Did not you see me go out every time I was there?


                  Martha 
                  Barber 
               



            . No; I lay in the next room and heard him go down on Friday morning, about half an hour after five.


                  Thomas 
                  Barber 
               



            . I got up about half an hour after the prisoner, and went down, and found the key in the parlour, where my wife had ordered him to put it when he went out. My little boy saw the prisoner sitting in a ring in Moorfields on the Saturday; I went there, and took him, and carried him before justice Rickards, and because I could not give the clerk a shilling for the warrant, we could not have no hearing there.
Q. from the prisoner. Was not the door left open at all hours in the night?
Court. What door do you mean ?
Prisoner. The street door; the shop is shut of nights, and they always come in at the back door out of the square, the street door being always fast.
Prisoner's Defence.
I never took the things: when he took me in Moorfields he charged me with the theftand kicked and abused me very much; I told him if I was ever such a thief, he was not to kick me about, the law must take hold on me. I am a house broker
 by trade.

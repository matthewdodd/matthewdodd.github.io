            . I lodge on the third floor of Mr. Perrey's house, a baker
, in Gray's-inn-lane


. On the evening of the 30th of June I was coming down stairs, and saw the prisoner on the first flight of stairs, with a shawl on her shoulder - she asked if there was room to go by; I said Yes, and as I passed, I saw some things near her on the stairs. I gave an alarm - Mrs. Perrey flew out at her; I went for an officer.

            . I am wife of James Perrey. Winter called me - I found the prisoner with my shawl on her shoulder, and some things in a bundle, at her side - they were mine; the scarf, handkerchief, and two caps were in her bosom, and the Prayer-book in her pocket; she said nothing till the officer came - but then she appeared to be in liquor, and cried, saying she was in distress.

The prisoner pleaded distress.

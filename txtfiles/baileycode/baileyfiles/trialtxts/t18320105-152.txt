I was shutting up on the 22nd of September, at a quarter before ten o'clock at night - the door was open; I saw the prisoner go into the shop, and come out with the cheese under his arm - I was in a little place where we keep the shutters; I ran, stopped him, and made him bring it back- he had got about a yard from the door; I had known him before - he lives at Drayton; he told me not to split - I did not know that he was going to take it.(Property produced and sworn to.)

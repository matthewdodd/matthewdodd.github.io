On Wednesday, the 3rd of November, between one and two o'clock, I was in the shop—I saw the prisoner and some other boys opposite—I watched him nearly an hour—I saw him come to the window, take the pistols, and it appeared as though he put them into his pocket—I ran out after him, and found him a little way off—he threw one at me, and the other on the ground—these are the pistols,—the yare my master's.

ELIZABETH ROEBUCK
. I am the wife of Charles Roebuck, and live in Clipstone—street. On the 12th of September, at three o'clock in the afternoon, I was walking up the street with a bag on my arm—I felt a pull at my arm—I turned round and saw a person taking my bag—he got it and ran away with it—a person going by called "Stop thief"—I believe the prisoner to be the man—I did not see him secured—he was met by a policeman and brought back directly—the bag contained the articles stated the indictment—it was cut off my arm.

I was in London—street, and heard an alarm of "Stop thief"—I saw the prisoner running towards Tottenham Court—road—I stopped him, and asked what was the matter—he said he did not know—I took him back to Charlotte—street, and met the prosecutrix—she said the prisoner had cut her bag, and I took it from his bosom, between his shirt and waistcoat—I was present at the examination, before Mr. Shutt, the Magistrate, and heard what the prisoner said—I know the Magistrate's hand—writing—I believe this to be his—(read)—"The prisoner says 'I was never here or any where else before; I did do it; I am out of work.

            . I am the wife of

                  Jeffreys
               



            ; we live in Essex-street, Battle-bridge


. I let my back-parlour to the prisoner, Thomas, on the 8th of November, at 4s. 6d. a-week; the articles stated in the indictment were let with it; in about seven weeks I gave them notice to quit, but they did not go - the man worked for Mr. Lewis, a dyer - he came home late on the night of the 29th; we heard them quarrelling; he came to my door and said he had come home to sleep, and his wife had parted with all the things; we did not get up - next morning early my husband asked him what was gone; he said every thing, and that they had slept several nights with only a carpet over them - we gave them till the following Thursday, as the woman said she would get money to redeem them; she went out and got very drunk, and was about the streets with a sailor; at eleven o'clock that night, she came home very drunk; and next morning we gave them in charge.

            . It is true I pawned the property, but they knew it; and I asked Mrs. Jeffreys to come into the room - I pawned them through necessity, and did not mean to leave till they were made good; but they would not grant me another week.

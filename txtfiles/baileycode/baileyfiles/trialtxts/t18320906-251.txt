 - the prisoner was my shopman
 for three days. On the 18th of July I went to bed, and had two watches, one on a nail, and one in a bureau drawer, in the room I sleep in - the prisoner slept in the shop; I got up a little before seven o'clock in the morning - he had then absconded, and I missed these articles - the bed-room door had not been locked; I took him four or five days afterwards.

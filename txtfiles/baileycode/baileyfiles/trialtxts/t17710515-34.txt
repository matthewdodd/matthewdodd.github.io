            . I am a baker
. I lost six loaves.
- Brotherton. I carried out this bread. I missed six loaves out of my basket; soon after I missed them, a man came out of the Red Lion Inn, and told me he suspected a man in the house had stolen the loaves. I saw the prisoner come out of the house and run away. I ran after him and overtook him; the loaves were not with him; but were left in the house.

            . The prisoner came into the Red Lion with a bag, it tumbled down stairs. I suspected the bread was in it.

            . I saw a man he said he tumbled down; I thought it was so, but I now believe it was the loaves. He said he had hurt his head; it was dark. Upon an alarm of somebody coming to take him he recovered and ran away.
Prisoner's Defence .
A man at the door gave me these loaves; that man was to meet me afterwards in Baldwin's gardens.

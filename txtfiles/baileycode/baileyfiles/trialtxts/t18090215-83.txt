. On the 27th of January last, about half past five, the two prisoners came into my shop, they asked to look at a pair of stockings, which I shewed them; the young one, James, said they would not do; asked to look at others, which I shewed him; he put his hand in the window, and took out two pair of little children's; I took them from him. I told him I never permitted any body's hand but my own in the window. He then asked to look at others, which I shewed him.
Q. Did you know them before this time - A. I never saw them before. The man, 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Carter
               



            , was standing near the door, just within the shop; Thomas went away; and James, after looking at another pair or two, went away, saying they would not do; neither of them bought any thing. In a quarter of an hour I saw them pass the window, with a number of other people, and on my going to see what was the matter, I saw a scarlet cloak, my property, in the hands of a neighbour, Mr. Bignall; on which I went and seized both the prisoners.
Q. How soon had you seen the cloak before the prisoners came in - A. Perhaps two or three hours before that I had noticed particularly the cloak.

             struck at me. Mr. Bignall searched him; I took the younger.

            . I live about an hundred yards from the prosecutor, I am a coal dealer. On the 27thof January, about half past five, I was standing at my own door, I saw the prisoner 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Carter
               



             pull a scarlet cloak from under his coat and look at it, or a pelisse, something similar to that; I saw him speak to a woman, as though he offered it for sale, at the corner of Charles street, nearly opposite where I live; I went over the road, I asked him what he had got; he replied what is that to you; I caught him by the collar, he made some little resistance; I asked him the second time what he had got under his coat; he denied it; I insisted upon knowing; I suspected he had stolen it from a neighbour, a pawnbroker; he made resistance; I throwed him down and took it from him by force; I told him he would go back with me if he came honestly by it. Passing by Mr. Squire's door Mr. Squire came out and owned the cloak which I had in my possession. At Mr. Squire's door the young one ran in between us, and asked me what I wanted with his brother. The oldest said he had bought it of a dustman and gave four shillings for it. James said he bought it of Mr. Squire and gave three shillings for it. The cloak has been in my possession ever since.
The property produced and identified.

            's Defence. The East London militia came up from Greenwich; my brother was drinking about with the soldiers; I went into this shop, I looked at two or three pair of stockings; my brother was gone off; I lost him; I went to look for him.

WILLIAM GIBBON. I am a schoolmaster
, and live at Northfleet. On the 5th of July, about three o'clock in the afternoon, I was in Shoreditch


 - I felt a pull at my coat pocket, and missed my handkerchief - I turned round and saw two men smoking pipes behind me - I said they had my handkerchief - one of them walked off - I then told the prisoner, who was the other person, that he had it - he said,"No; the man who has walked off has it, and I know nothing of him" - an officer came up, and I gave him in charge - this is my handkerchief; the officer found it, but he is very ill, and cannot appear.
Prisoner. Q. Did I not say that I saw the young man who ran away pick your pocket and throw the handkerchief down, and I took it up? A. No; you said you had not got it.

ELIZABETH HOTTON.
 I am the wife of George Hotton, of Warren-street, Fitzroy-square, in the parish of St. Pancras. On the evening of the 25th of March I came home, and went into the back parlour—I heard something, and made a search, having been robbed twice before—I heard footsteps below in the kitchen, went out and called an officer—I gave him the key of the kitchen door—with difficulty he unlocked it, and went into the kitchen—I found a box broken open, and all the wearing apparel taken out—the prisoner was concealed under the bedstead there, with a bundle by his side containing the articles produced—they are ours—I did not find the street door open, but locked.





GEORGE DAVIS
 (policeman.) I took the prisoner in charge, and found seventeen keys on him—one will open the prosecutor's street door, and another the kitchen door.

Prisoner's Defence. I met a person whom I knew in the strand coming along; he asked me to go down stairs with him where he lived; I went into the kitchen, as he said he lived there; I heard somebody say, "You had better go and fetch a policeman;" I went into the room and saw the man; he said, "Don't say anything, I do not live here, hold these," and gave me the two keys and the bunch, and said, "You get under the bed, and I will get into he cupboard."





GEORGE DAVIS

re-examined. I found no man in the cupboard.




GUILTY. Aged 18.—


Transported for Seven Years.

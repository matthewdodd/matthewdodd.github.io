            . I am a dismounted patrol. I was on the look out on Sunday morning, the 16th of September, between five and six o'clock, with Charlesworth, and met the prisoner coming down White Lion-street with a basket on his back covered with parsley; I asked what he had in his basket, he said "Parsley" - my partner found thirteen banks of hemp under it; he at last said he found it; I found he lived in the rope-walk, White Conduit-fields.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

            . I am a watchman. On the 4th of October, about four o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner at the corner of Old Compton-street and Wardour-street, he was bulky behind; I stopped him, and asked what he had got? I found 30 lbs. of lead under his coat - it appeared to be fresh cut, and was part of a gutter. On Monday I compared it with No. 20, Frith-street, it fitted the gutter on the roof. I am certain it belonged to the gutter.

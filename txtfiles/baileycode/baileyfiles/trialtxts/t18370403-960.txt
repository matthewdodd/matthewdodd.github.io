ELISABETH CLARK
. I am single, and lodge in Victoria-street, Islington. The prisoner is the apprentice to my landlord, and lived in the house—I missed some things on the 4th of February, and missed other things down to the 1st of March, when on account of suspicion, I gave the prisoner in charge.





WILLIAM STOTHER

I took the prisoner on the 1st of March—I questioned him about the property, and he told me he had destroyed the tickets—he told me he had pawned a carpet for 6s. at Mr. Smith's—a gown for 1s. at Mr. Goodburn's, and a gown for 1s. at Mr. Blackburn's, in Gloucester-street, Myddleton-street, Clerkenwell, but I found that to be two gowns, and a petticoat for 2s.—he told me that the half-crown that was in a purse previously taken from him by his master, and two Irish tenpenny-pieces, was part of the money the carpet was pledged for—a key was also found at the same time—he told me he had filed one ward off to open the drawer—I did not tell him it would be better for him to tell me.





WILLIAM SMITH
. I am a pawnbroker, in Lower-road, Islington. On Saturday the 25th of February, the prisoner came and pawned this carpet for 6s., and this apron was round it as a wrapper.

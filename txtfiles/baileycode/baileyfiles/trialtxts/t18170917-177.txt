            . I am a tailor
. On the 20th of June, I was going to Gracechurch-street, and met the prisoner on Holborn-hill - She asked me to treat her with some beer-which I did; she took me to a house in Shoe-lane - I staid there about half an hour - She followed me into Plumbtree court


-she stood by my side, and put her hand into my waistcoat-pocket and took my pocket-book, which contained eleven 1l. notes and my apprenticeshipindentures, and 8s. 6d., out of my pocket, and ran away. I am positive she is the woman; it was about half-past eleven o'clock at night; she ran into a public-house - I followed her, and lost her about half a minute, and found her there among several more girls. She told me if I would stop in the court, she would fetch me the pocketbook.

            . I am a watchman. The prisoner was brought into the watchhouse-nothing was found on her; at one o'clock in the morning, I found the pocket-book behind a gate in Holborn, it contained two duplicates and the indentures.

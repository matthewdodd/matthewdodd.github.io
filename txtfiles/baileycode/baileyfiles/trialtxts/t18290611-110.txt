            , ESQ. I am a barrister
, of Lincoln's Inn. The prisoner was employed to clean to my shoes - his wife was my laundress; I had a book called the "Modern Universal History." When the prisoner was apprehended the officer produced a duplicate; I found the book at the pawnbroker's; I think I had seen it within three or four months.

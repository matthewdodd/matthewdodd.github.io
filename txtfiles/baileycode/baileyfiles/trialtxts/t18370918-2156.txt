WILLIAM CHEESEWRIGHT
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
9th of September, 1 truck, value 15s., the goods of 




George Coe.






ALFRED COE
. I am the son of George Coe, a blacksmith who lives in Sidney-street. This truck belongs to him—it was outside the door on the 9th of September, about ten minutes after twelve o'clock—I lent it to the prisoner, as he asked me to let him have it to take three boxes to the East India Docks—he was to return it in three hours, or three hours and a half—we let it out at 2 1/2 d. an hour, but nothing was said about the price—he never brought it back—I saw him on the Monday following, at the Barley Mow, near Gravel-lane, where I went with a man who had bought it, and gave him into custody—I know the truck to be my father's—I did not know the prisoner before.





JOSEPH ROBERTSON
. I am a blacksmith, and live in Back-road, Shad well. I have known the prisoner by sight a long time—on the 9th of September I bought the truck of him for 15s., about a quarter past one o'clock—he said it belonged to his brother, who was in great distress.




GUILTY
. Aged 24.—


Transported for Seven Years.
(There were two other indictments against the prisoner for similar offences on two successive days.)

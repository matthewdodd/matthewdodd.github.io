I keep a public house
, the White-bear, in great Eastcheap


; on the 6th of this month, I lost a kettle off the fire; it was about six in the evening; my wife was at tea, and the kettle was on the fire in the tap room; the prisoner took it with the hot water in it, and the handle was so hot, that I could hardly hold it when I took it from her; I run after her, and took her within six yards of my own door, with the kettle in her hand, and she offered me half a crown to let her go about her business; here is the kettle, it is mine.

I am the maid of this house; I was coming from the sink to get some water out of the kettle, and I saw this woman with it in her hand going out, and she bid me good night; I had seen her once before, and she had called for a pint of beer; I told my master, and he ran after her, and took her.
PRISONER's DEFENCE.
I had been drinking, and did not know what I was about.

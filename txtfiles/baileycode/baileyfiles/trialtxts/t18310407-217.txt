. On the 1st of March the prisoner was brought into the shop, accused of stealing these handkerchiefs, which I had seen safe five minutes before - they were partly within the door-way.
JAMES KENNEDY. I am a music-copier, and live in Dover-street, Oxford-street. I was in Oxford-street, on the opposite side to Mr. Howard's-shop, and saw the prisoner, with another about four years older than himself, lurking about this shop; his companion crossed over the road - I looked towards the shop door; the other then went over, and took from the door-post the handkerchiefs - they were in one piece; the prisoner stood close at his side, held up his apron, which the other put them into, and both ran away - I ran over, and laid hold of the prisoner; the other quickened his pace, and got away - I took the prisoner within four doors of the shop, without losing sight of him; I took the handkerchiefs out of his apron, and took him into the shop.
WILLIAM SIBLEY. I am a Policeman. I received the prisoner in charge, with the handkerchiefs.
Prisoner's Defence. I was coming along Oxford-street, and saw this boy with the handkerchiefs in his hand; he gave them to me - I asked where he got them; he made no answer, and I was taken.

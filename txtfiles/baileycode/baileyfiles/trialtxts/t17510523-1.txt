             to watch for him: He called me, and said, the man which we suspected was gone up into the buildings. I went and found him tying up a handkerchief of sugar. It was produced in court and deposed to. It was Barbados sugar, above twelve pounds handkerchief and all.
Q. How near was he to that hogshead you say was broke open?
Shaw. He stood at the next hogshead but one to it. He desir'd I would let him go, and not expose him, and confess'd he took it. There was no other hogshead open in the ware-house, and this was at that time. I don't know who it belongs to: I weigh'd it, and found it had lost one hundred, three quarters, and odd pounds.

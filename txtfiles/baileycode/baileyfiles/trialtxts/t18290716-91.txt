. I saw the prisoner near our shop on the 13th of June; she untwisted something from the door, and went very quickly away - I went out, and saw her putting three pairs of lasts into her basket - I went and caught her with them in her basket.

            . I was standing at my father's door. I saw the prisoner, and asked what she had got - she said Nothing; I took hold of her - she slung me round against the door, and put my thumb out, but I would not let her go - it was a market basket, and had several things in it: there was a bunch of onions, three lettuces, and a bit of cheese - she had been drinking.
Prisoner. It was mere distress; my five fatherless children were without food, and I was tipsy.

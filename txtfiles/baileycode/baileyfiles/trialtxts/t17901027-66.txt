             sworn.
I live at No. 18, Red-cross-street


. On the 9th of this month, I lost three pieces of point gauze, value eighteen shillings, from a little shelf in the shop-window, near the door; I saw them there about half after seven in the morning; I missed them immediately on two of the prisoners going out of the shop; I do not know who took them; I did not see them taken; I saw the prisoners Matthews and Pank in the shop; the other prisoner did not come in; one of them asked for some thread to mend his breeches; then he would have silk; I went to the drawer, and could find none of the colour; he went away; I opened the door, and let them out; I missed the gauze immediately; I had nobody in the shop; I could not pursue them; they were taken in ten minutes or a quarter of an hour; I am certain to the persons of these two young men: the constable has the gauze; I cannot say whether both came into the shop together; they went out together.

             sworn.
Coming down Wells-street at half past seven, I heard the cry of stop thieves; the prisoners were very near the prisoner Matthews; and I saw him drop three parcels of gauze; I saw Pank close to him; Matthews was immediately laid hold of; these I believe to be the three parcels.
(Deposed to.)
It was two hundred yards from the shop, in a different street, about half past seven in the morning.

             sworn.
I was going to my business. Coming down Red-cross-street with a man that worked with me, as we got to the prosecutrix's shop-window, I perceived 
               
                  John
                   Betson
               



             stand at the window; and the other two came out, and they all three ran off together; and I saw Matthews putting something under his coat; and I called stop thief! and the corner of Jewin-street, I saw Matthews drop these pieces of gauze; I brought Pank back to the house he came out of; all the three prisoners were taken together directly.

             sworn.
(Deposed much to the same effect, being in company with the last witness; he brought Betson back, and did not see Matthews drop the things.)

             sworn.
Coming through Red-cross-street on the 19th of October, I perceived the prisoners Matthews and Pank in Mrs. Mann's shop; I saw the prisoner Betson a few yards below the shop; he appeared to me to be watching; I passed them, and went down; I returned back again, and observed the three prisoners coming towards me very fast; that was in three minutes; I saw nothing of Betson: I observed a bundle in Matthews's bosom, as they passed me in Jewin-street; I turned up Jewin-street; Matthews and Pank turned down Wells-street; and turning, Matthews dropped these three pieces of gauze from under his coat; I seized him, and desired Might to seize Pank; they were brought to the shop.

             sworn.
I produce the gauze.
Prisoner Pank. I was coming along Jewin-street; I went to buy some thread to mend my coat; and I saw Matthews in the shop; the gentlewoman said she had no thread; I turned out.
Matthews. I went in for some thread, and she had none; and I ran for fear of being too late at work.
Prisoner Betson. I was going to a leather-cutter's; I stopped to tie up my knees, and these two young fellows came out; I know nothing of them.

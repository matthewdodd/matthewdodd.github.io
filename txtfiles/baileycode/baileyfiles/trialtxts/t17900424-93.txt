             sworn.
I have sheep walks in the parish of Finchley


: I lost a ram, and ewe lamb. I went to 
               
                  John
                   Wells
               



            's house; I found almost three quarters of the lamb cut out; his wife asked me what I came for? I told her she would know by and by; I came to search the house; I suspected he had robbed me; the prisoner's lodgings are very near where I found it.

             sworn.
I am headborough of the parish of Hornsey: Mr. Ekins brought me a search warrant; I went, and found there was a young man brought to Highgate, 
               
                  John
                   Wells
               



            ; we found the lamb in Wells's house; it was an ewe lamb; the prisoner lodged in Hornsey, at 
               
                  John
                   Burr
               



            's; I went up stairs, and searched under the bed: Mr. Ekins said to me, here is the wool; and his wife then said, I know what you are come upon; and she then pulled out from under the table, three quarters of a lamb in a pan; Mr. Ekins took the lamb away; I took the live lamb in my apron, and marked it; I took the prisoner; he was committed.
Was you present when the lamb was turned down to the other sheep? - Yes; I desired them to turn five ewes in, and I picked that lamb out.

             sworn.
I bough the ewe lamb of 
               
                  Richard
                   Rushing
               



            , on Sunday evening, about eight; I gave him one shilling, and share of a pint of beer.
How old is the lamb? - As far as I understand, it was about ten hours old.
Was any body present when you bought it? - Nobody but my wife and child; she is not here.
What is it worth, do you think? - I am afraid I gave the full value of the lamb.

             sworn.
On Saturday afternoon, between three and four, I went down, and saw this man jump out of the sheep-house; I looked in, and saw the head of a lamb, and the entrails and pluck; it was my uncle's sheep-house; I looked a little farther, and saw the carcase hanging up; and the skin was concealed in truss of straw; I saw three quarters of a carcase afterwards, which I can speak to with certainty, being the same I saw in the sheep-house; we have the skin here.
By what mark do you know this skin, so as to be certain it was your lamb's skin? - Yes, I saw it afterwards; (the skin produced;) this is the skin that was found on the truss of straw.

             sworn.
I was going down, and saw a lamb hanging in Mr. Ekins's sheep-house; and I did not see the prisoner there; I know nothing of him.
Prisoner. I have nothing to say.

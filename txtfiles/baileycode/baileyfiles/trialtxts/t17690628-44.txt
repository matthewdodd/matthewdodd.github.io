            . On the 10th of June, about twelve at noon, from out of my lodgings, at Mr. Reed's, peruke maker in Dean-Street, Soho


, I lost the articles mentioned in the indictment. I applied to Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



             the same day, and put them in the paper. On the 17th my landlord's boy was carrying out wigs, when he saw the prisoner with my great coat on. He let me know. I went and met with the prisoner at the Bell in a Court in St. Martin's-Lane. I took and carried him before Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            . There the prisoner confessed where he had pawned some of the things. He went and shewed us; then he went with us to his lodgings. All the goods are here (Produced in Court and deposed to.)

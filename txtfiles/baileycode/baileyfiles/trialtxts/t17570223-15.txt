            . I was told my coat had been just stolen out of my house, as I was at work in another room. I ran out, and in about fifteen minutes met the prisoner. I asked her if she was a dealer. She said, she was. I asked her if she had seen such a coat, describing it. She said, she had seen a person cheapening such a one. I wanted to see what she had in her apron, and there I found my coat. (Produced in court, and deposed to.)
Prisoner's Defence.
I bought the coat of a woman for three shillings, and shew'd him the woman I bought it of. He had hold of her, but let her go, and took me.
Prosecutor. I had them both at my house. The prisoner said then she did not buy it of that woman, so I let her go.




               Guilty, 10 d.

             sworn.
I am master of St. George's Workhouse, opposite the prosecutor's premises; which are in Farthing-field, Old Gravel-lane


; about eleven at night, on the 27th of December last, I saw three men standing between Mr. Child's workshop and our workhouse, I said and watched them for some minutes, I suspected them, seeing something in their possession, that was large and cumbersome; I called up three men in the house, and went to examine, as soon as they saw the men appear, they made off, and took the property with them, they were pursued by these three men, and the prisoner Williams said he was taking it away from two lads that were there, it did not appear that he was taking it away from them, he was conversing with them some minutes.
Court. Did there appear to be any struggle between them? - No Sir, there did not, in half an hour after, I saw the prisoner Thompson in custody, he said he was coming past and another boy gave him the lead to carry a little way for him, and they stood and conversed together for ten minutes.

             sworn.
I belong to the workhouse too, I apprehended the prisoner Williams, he went away from the place where he was, and the other after him, he had a piece of lead upon him, he carried it in his arms, and when I came up to him, he put it down on the causeway, he said he took it away from some lads, he said he was a going to take it to the watch-house, I left him with the other two men, and went after the other, he said that another lad that was with him, gave it him to carry, and Thompson said that Williams said, he would carry it to an old iron shop to sell it.

                   CHILD
               



             sworn.
The lead is here, it has been in my possession ever since the day it was found, I had some part of it from the workhouse, and some part of it found in a field, the part that was taken from the prisoner has been in my possession, ever since it was taken from the watch-house, I sent one of my men for the piece of lead.
Where is that man? - He is not here.
Did you lose any lead from your house? - About thirty one feet, I cannot swear it was this lead, only by having measured the lead that was found, and by comparing the pieces together.

             sworn.
I carried the lead to the watch-house, and I can swear that this is the same lead, by this scrag end, I took particular notice of it.
Prosecutor. I can only identify the lead by measuring the length and width of the gutter, the pieces all seemed to match, except this piece that is scragged, that has been lost; the nail holes exactly fit.
Jury. How high is your house? - About ten feet from the ground.
Jury to Reader. Did you ever lose sight of Williams, from the time you pursued him, till you took him? - No.
PRISONER WILLIAMS'S DEFENCE.
I was at a Publick-house, from about six till nine, drinking with 
               
                  Robert
                   Humbleton
               



            , and one Holliday, and I came home, and asked my daughter where my wife was, she said she was gone out, I went in next door and had a pot of beer, by and by my wife came in, and she told me she saw this lad and another with the lead, and I went and looked at them, and asked them if they were not ashamed, they had better go to Sea for ten shillings a month, and I said they should go to the watch-house, and three men came running after us, but I told the men, and the master of the workhouse, the name of the lad, and where he lived.
PRISONER THOMSON'S DEFENCE.
I was down at Greenland-dock in the morning, and coming home I met a boy, and he had a piece of lead on his head, and he asked me to carry it, and I said yes, I carried it twenty yards, and this man stopped me, and the other lad run away.
The prisoner Williams called eight witnesses, who gave him a very good character.
Court to Bremen. You are sure you saw Williams standing with the other two? - I did, I saw them ten minutes in conversation, there was no struggling, they run away upon my calling out.

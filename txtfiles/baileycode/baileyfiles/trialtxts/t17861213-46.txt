             sworn.
I only know that this house was plundered of some lead; it belonged to Mr. 
               
                  Mark
                   Spott
               



            ; it was an uninhabited house; I saw the lead on the 12th of this month at the Justice's; the lead found on Lewis exactly matched with what was lost; I could not swear to it, but it was tried in my presence, and it answered exactly.

             sworn.
Last Monday morning, about twenty minutes after six, I was coming with my pails, and the prisoner Stevens passed by with some lead on his shoulders, and him in the white jacket, that is Lewis, passed by at the same time with some lead; there were two more; I went up to Lewis, I said, I am afraid you have been stealing this; says he, I came honestly by it; I gave charge of him, and the other two got away; then I gave descriptions of the other two, and a boy came in and said, here are the two men; and I looked, and they were the two men; I am sure these are the same men; the lead was gone; the Justice admitted Taylor an evidence, but he has since escaped.

             sworn.
I took charge of the prisoner Lewis, with some lead.
PRISONER STEVENS'S DEFENCE.
I got up to work before six, and I saw the lead lay, and I picked it up, and turned back with it, and they took me.
PRISONER LEWIS'S DEFENCE.
I know nothing of it.
The prisoner Lewis called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.

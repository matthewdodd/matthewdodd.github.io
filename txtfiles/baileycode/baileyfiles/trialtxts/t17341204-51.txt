            . I went out about 8 at Night and lock'd the Door, and left my Mother a washing in the Inner-Room, on the Ground-Floor.
Eliz. Champion. As I was washing, I look'd thro' a Window that is in the Partition betwixt the 2 Rooms, and saw the Door open; upon which I went forward, and mist the Linnen out of a Tub of Water that stood in the Fore-Room.
Will.  Bear. I met the Prisoner at the Bridge Foot; we went into Old-Swan-Lane


, and saw this Woman's Door open, and a Tub standing in the Room. The Young Woman came out and shut the Door; and then he opened it and went in, and put my Hat into the Tub to prevent the Water from bubbling, and so he took out the Linnen. But he threw the Caps away, for he thought they would fetch nothing, and he sold the Handkerchief to Elizabeth Brand for a Shilling.

            . I gave the Prisoner and this Boy a Shilling for this Handkerchief, and they snack'd the Money between them.

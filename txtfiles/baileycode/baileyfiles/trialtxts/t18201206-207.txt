            . On the 13th of December, about twelve o'clock, I was under the Colonade, Pall-mall


, and felt a catch at my pocket, I turned round, and saw my handkerchief between the prisoners. I secured Clark, Jones got away - he followed us to the watch-house; I afterwards saw him by a picture-shop in Piccadilly, and secured him - I am sure he is the man. I picked my handkerchief up off Clark's feet - I saw him holding it out to Jones, but on seeing me he let it fall.
JONES'S Defence. I was looking at a shop, and the gentleman took me.

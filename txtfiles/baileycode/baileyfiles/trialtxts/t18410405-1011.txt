JAMES BROWN

for stealing, on the

Harris Lazarus.






HARRIS LAZARUS
. I am a furrier and cap-maker. Between four and five o'clock in the morning of the 23rd of March, I went into my back yard, which is surrounded by a wall—I opened the door and saw the prisoner on the wall—I took hold of his leg and pulled him down—no one was with him—he struck me with his fist—the policeman came and took him—he found this brass cock in the prisoner's pocket—it had been cat off the pipe—it was secure the night before—when he was taken he said, "I did but just come in the yard."





JOSEPH WELSH
 (City police-constable, No. 603.) I heard the cry of "Police"—I went to the house, Lazarus and the prisoner were struggling in the passage—I found this in the prisoner's pocket—he said he was very hungry, and he had a white cloth in his hat.




GUILTY
. Aged 19.—


Transported for Seven Years. (There was another indictment against the prisoner.)

SARAH JONES

I am the wife of William Jones—he has one partner—they keep a shoe warehouse in Crawford-street—the prisoner was my servant for two months—on the 12th of February she was going out, and I thought she looked rather stout—I stopped her, and found these boots in her pocket, which are ours—I asked her where she got them—she said, "Out of the ware-room."





JOHN BROSNAHAN
 (police-constable D 133.) I took the prisoner, and asked her how she came to take them—she said, to give them to a cousin of hers.





JOHN STANLEY
 (police-constable D 48.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—she is the person who was then tried—(read.)

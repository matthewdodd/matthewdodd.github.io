Jeffery Burton. I live in St. George's in the East


, and keep a slop shop
. I missed the goods mentioned, but knew not who took them. Mr Gardner called upon me, and asked me if I had been robb'd; I replied I had, of three or four Holland shirts, and about thirteen yards of hooping cloth; he answered he had one of the thieves with him, which was 
               
                  Daniel 
                  Pugh 
               



            . Pugh said he knew where two of the thieves lodg'd, and that there were two or three more concerned in the gang, who all liv'd in an empty house in East Smithfield. We went there, and there came two of their company and knocked at the door; they were soon let in, and I, the officer, and a watchman  went in likewise, where we found four of them, but one got away; but the evidence telling us where they resorted to, which was at the house of Anne Brown, we got a warrant, and took her and 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Radborn 
               



            . We took them before Justice Rickards, where we found three of my shirts, one upon the evidence Hambleton, one upon 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Radborn 
               



            , and another on 
               
                  John 
                  Bell 
               



            . I lost these goods on the tenth of this month out of my shop window, and found the hooping at a pawnbroker's in Spittle-fields, but not pawned by any of the prisoners.

            , and I, were together at the taking these things. 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Radborn 
               



             took them from near the prosecutor's window, on a shelf : this was I believe on the tenth of this month, between eight and nine o'clock.

                  Radborn 
               



            . We brought them to

                  Brown 
               



            , and she took them home to an empty house in East-Smithfield, where 
               
                  John 
                  Bell 
               



             and I lived. Bell,

                  Radborn 
               



            , and I, had a shirt each, and we were to pay Pugh when the cloth was sold, who was to have three shillings for his share. 
               
                  Anne 
                  Brown 
               



             had seven yards of the cloth to make her a gown, which was cut off; she said afterwards she sold it for six shillings; and the other piece was carried to a pawnbroker's. Pugh had some of that money. The three shirts were found upon us three.

Pugh. I was not concerned along with them, but happened accidentally to be coming by at the time.

            , who lives in the Edgware-road. On the 1st of July, between eleven and twelve o'clock, I left the kitchen a few minutes, and on my return saw the prisoner come from the closet where this mug is kept - I asked what he did there; he turned, and asked if Mr. Jones lived there, and as he went up the area steps I saw the mug under his coat - I had put it in the closet a few minutes before. I alarmed the painters who were at work, but they could not overtake him. I am certain he is the man. I observed his face and dress. The mug has not been found; he had a brown coat and trowsers, and a leather apron on.

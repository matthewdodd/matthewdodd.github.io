JOHN COSGROVE
was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
4th of January, 7 yards of floor-cloth, value 17s., the goods of 



Joseph Brurabley.






JOSEPH BRUMBLEY.
I am a broker, and live in Drury-lane. On Saturday morning, the 4th of January, I had seven yards of oil-cloth—directly I opened the shop I went backward—a neighbour came in and told me something—I ran out and saw the prisoner, in Great Wild-street, in custody of an officer—the prisoner gave the floor-cloth to the policeman, and ran away—he passed me—I caught his coat, and tore one side off—I chased him down to Clare-market, and there lost him for a few minutes—a gentleman passing said he had run into the Black Jack public-house—the policeman went in, and found him with a short pipe and a pint of beer—I can swear to him—this is ray floor-cloth.





MICHAEL GERSHON.
I was standing at my door at a quarter-after nine o'clock last Saturday morning—I saw a man running with some floorcloth under his coat—I went to my neighbour's, the prosecutor's, and he missed it—I told him which way the man ran—lie ran after him—I cannot swear to the prisoner—I only saw his back.





THOMAS REYNOLDS
(police-constable F55.) I was going up Great Wild-street at a quarter-past nine o'clock—a boy came and spoke to me—I turned, and saw the prisoner coming up with the cloth on his shoulder—I asked him whose cloth he had got there—he said his own—I was about to lay hold of him—he threw down the cloth, and ran away—I pursued, and after that found him in a public-house—he had his coat off, and some beer just warming for him.

Prisoner's Defence. I was coming up Drury-lane; and a man asked me to carry it for him—he gave me a shilling, which I gave for a pint of beer.

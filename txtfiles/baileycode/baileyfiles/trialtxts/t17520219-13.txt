             I keep the Rummer Tavern in Chancery-Lane




; I have lost many plates and things: on the twelfth of December I lost several plates and dishes, out of my scullery in the yard: Mr. Hunter stopped some marked with a Rummer on them, and my husband

            's name. I know the prisoner very well, having seen him come through my house several times: I went to Mr. Hunter's house, there I saw several of my plates cut in four pieces, (each produced in Court and deposed to.)

            . I am a Smith and Broker, the prisoner brought these plates cut to pieces to me to offer to sell, I stopped them and informed the prosecutor of them, who deposed they were her property.
Prisoner's defence.
A woman came to me and asked me if I knew where she could sell some pewter, I said no: then she asked me if I would buy some; so I bought them for a small trifle of money.

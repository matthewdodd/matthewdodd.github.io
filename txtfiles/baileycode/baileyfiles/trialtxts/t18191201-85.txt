            , I am a tea-dealer
, and live in Tooley-street, Borough. On the 9th of November, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I was in King-street, Cheapside


, while the Lord Mayor's procession was passing - I stood there about five minutes. The officer came to me with a handkerchief, and asked me if it was mine? it was so - it was safe five minutes before. There was a great crowd. I do not know when he took it. The prisoner was laid hold of.

            . I am a constable. I was in King-street as the procession was passing; I saw the prisoner, with two other lads - I saw him with his arm between two gentlemen who stood together, one of whom was the prosecutor - he appeared to have his arm round Mr. Easto's body; he turned his head, and spoke to the two lads, they immediately closed and hid him from my view. I stepped forward, and the moment I came up I saw a silk handkerchief in the prisoner's hand, he was handing it to one of the other two. I seized him and one of the lads - the lad, I think, threw the handkerchief on the pavement. I told Mr. Easto, he claimed it. The lad got away as I stopped to pick it up, but I kept hold of the prisoner.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

            . I am servant to Mr. Saunders, an haberdasher and hosier
. The prisoner came into our shop, and desired to see some ribbons; I shewed her a drawer of ribbons; she stood a tedious time over them; the shop filled apace: I saw her convey a piece of ribbon under her arm, and afterwards she went out of the shop. I followed and brought her back again, and took her backwards into the counting-house, and found the piece of ribbon under her arm. [ Produced in court, and deposed to by a mark on it.]
The prisoner said nothing in her defence.

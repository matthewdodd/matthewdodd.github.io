            . Some time last month, I cannot recollect the day, I lost the things laid in the indictment (mentioning them) from out of my lodgings in Oxford Road


. When the prisoner was taken up, she went with me to the pawnbroker's, where one shirt was pawned by her for half-a-crown. I got them all again by her direction but one neckcloth. I never saw her before to my knowledge.

            . I lost three shirts the same night. In going to enquire at the pawnbrokers, the prisoner was at one pawning a shirt. I stopped her, and sent for the apprentice, who came and said it was not mine. Then she said she would punish me for stopping her. We took her to the justice's; then it came out who the shirt belonged to. The prosecutor owned it.

Another woman desired me to go and pawn it.

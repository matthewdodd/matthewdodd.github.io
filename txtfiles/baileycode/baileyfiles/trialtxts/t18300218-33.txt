keeps a hotel
 at the bottom of Adam-street, Adelphi


. Last Saturday morning, at twenty minutes before eight o'clock, I saw the prisoner jump out of his parlour window - the witness followed him, and cried Stop thief! I caught him at the corner of Robert-street; nothing was found on him.

             keeps it. I was going into one of the parlours, and saw the prisoner getting out of the window with my master's coat - I ran, and snatched it from him - I then pursued him round the terrace, and he was taken; I am sure he is the man - this is the coat; this handkerchief and book were in the pocket of it.
Prisoner's Defence. I have been out of work a great part of the winter - I have a wife and two children, and had not a morsel of bread.

            . I live at Wapping


. On the sixth of December, about four or five o'clock in the afternoon, I went out; I returned again about eleven, and then missed, among other things, this camblet gown, which I left upon the bed; the linen I lost, was in a box under the bed. On the ninth of March, I saw my camblet gown hanging up in Mr. Townshend's shop. I never found any of the other things.
The camblet gown produced, and deposed to by the Prosecutrix.

            . I made that gown for Mrs. Hagston a twelvemonth ago; I am sure it is hers.
Charles Townshend deposed, that he took the gown in to pawn of the prisoner.

I bought this gown in Rosemary-lane, and pawned it the same day I bought it.

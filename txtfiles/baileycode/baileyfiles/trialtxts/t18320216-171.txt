            . About a quarter-past eight o'clock in the morning of the 8th of February, I saw the prisoner enter Mrs. Johnston's shop, in Tottenham-court-road


; he took a roll of flannel off the counter, and passed me with it on his shoulder; I went into the shop, and found nobody there - I called the boy up stairs, then went in pursuit, and overtook the prisoner in Rathbone-place, with the flannel on his shoulder - he made a great resistance, but I brought him back.

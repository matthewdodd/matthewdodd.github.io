I live at No. 131, Bishopsgate Without


; on Thursday the 8th of March, about half past six in the evening, I saw the prisoner and another boy lurking about the shop-door; I was serving two customers, and the prisoner came into the shop, and snatched the goods off the counter; Mr. Davis brought the prisoner and the goods back directly; there were two pair of cotton stockings, and three pair of worsted stockings.
(The things produced and deposed to.)

             sworn.
I am a silversmith and jeweller in Bishopsgate-street; I live facing the prosecutor; I was at my door, and saw the prisoner and another at Mr. Buxstone's window, which gave me some suspicion that they were upon no good; I saw the prisoner go in the shop the last of the two, and he came out immediately with some handkerchiefs and stockings, but I did not see the other come out of the shop; I pursued him, and saw him drop them in the coach-way, at which time he fell, and I took him and the property to Mr. Buxstone's; they were all over dirt; the dirt is now upon them.
Jury. Were they tied in that handkerchief? - No, they were pinned together for shewing in the window.

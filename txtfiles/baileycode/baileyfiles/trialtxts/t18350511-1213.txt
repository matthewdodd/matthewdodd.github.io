1213. 




THOMAS SCARSBROOK
 and 




THOMAS TOOMEY
 were indicted for

stealing, on the 
5th of May, 1 handkerchief, value 3s., the goods of 



Samuel Garrett, from his person; and that Thomas Scarsbrook had been before convicted of felony.






SAMUEL GARRETT
. I live in High-street, Shadwell, and am a licensed victualler. On the evening of the 5th of May, I was in Sutton-street, and, in consequence of something which was told me, I missed my handkerchief from my pocket—I went with an officer, and found it—I can swear I had it in my pocket a quarter of an hour before.





GEORGE ELLIS
. I am a police-constable. I saw the two prisoners together on the 5th of May, and followed them—I saw them follow the prosecutor from his own house, till they came to Sutton-street—Scarsbrook then took the handkerchief, they turned down a street, and I ran round and met them in a passage, where I saw Scarsbrook give the handkerchief to Toomey—I waited till they came to me, and seized them both—I put them into a house, and was about to search Toomey, when the woman of the house found the handkerchief behind the door—when I took them, they asked what I wanted them for—I said, "For picking a gentleman's pocket"—they said they knew nothing about it.





ELIZABETH M'PHERSON
. The officer pushed the prisoners into my house, and my little boy picked up the handkerchfef in my presence.





GEORGE MORGAN
. I have a certificate of the conviction of Thomas Scarsbrook, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—I was present, and know he was the man.

Scarsbrook's Defence. I know nothing of this lad; I was walking along, and he was behind me.

Toomey's Defence. I was coming down the passage—the officer ran into the shop, and a gentleman picked up the handkerchief.

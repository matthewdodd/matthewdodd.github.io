WILLIAM JONES



was indicated for stealing 1 handkerchief, value 4s., the goods of 



William Cross, from his person; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






JOSEPH DALTON
 (City police-constable, No. 366.) I saw the prisoner and another person with him about eight o'clock on Thursday evening, the 11th of Feb.—I watched them attempting to pick pockets—I saw them go to the prosecutor, and I distinctly saw the prisoner take a handkerchief out of his right hand pocket—I tapped the prosecutor on the shoulder, and told him his pocket was picked—I caught the prisoner and the other, but they both broke away—the pavement was very slippery—I knew the prisoner, and took him the next morning.

Prisoner. If he saw me take the pocket-handkerchief why did not he take me at the moment, without going to the prosecutor?—I cannot go anywhere but he is always watching me. Witness. I have not had the opportunity of watching him for the last six month—I knew him quite well, and I went by him to get to the gentleman.





WILLIAM CROSS
. I live in Agar-street, Strand. I was going up Holbornhills on that Thursday evening—the policeman came and told me I had been robbed—my handkerchief was gone from my pocket—I had used it not two minutes before—it has not been found since.

Prisoner. I know nothing of it.





WILLIAM SICKLE
 (City police-constable, No. 290.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction at this Court—(read—Convicted the 6th of July, 1846 and confined six months)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
. (†) Aged 19.—


Transported for Seven Years.

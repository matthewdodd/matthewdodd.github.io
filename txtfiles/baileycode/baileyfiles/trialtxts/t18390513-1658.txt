1658. 




HENRY HALL
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
11th of May, 2 sovereigns, 4 half-sovereigns, and 6 half-crowns, the monies of 



William Joseph Lott.






WILLIAM JOSEPH LOTT
. I am a pig-feeder, and live at Nottingdale, Kensington. The prisoner lodged with me, as he had no father nor mother I took him in—I have known him two or three years—I lost this money out of a little jug in the parlour cupboard—it was in a bit of paper—there were two sovereigns, four half-sovereigns, and four half-crowns, which I received on Saturday, for three pigs I had sold in the morning—the prisoner picked up a bit of paper, and I put the money into it—the day passed on—I was not very well—I went to bed, and the prisoner said, "Bill, I'll get a pitcher of water"—he did so, and brought it up stairs, and went down—I soon fell asleep—I awoke about twelve o'clock, and saw a bit of a light in the room where my money was, I called him, but he did not come—I went down—there was a sieve-basket under the cupboard—I got upon it, and the money was gone, and the prisoner also—I did not see him any more till he was in custody.

Prisoner. Another young lad lodged in the house. Witness. Yes, but not in the room, and he returned again—you never did.






ANN ELIZABETH LOTT
. I am the prosecutor's sister. I heard of the loss of his money—I met the prisoner on Monday, the 13th, stopped him, and asked him why he had robbed my brother—he said, "If you will let me go, I will give you all the money I have got"—he pulled out half-a-sovereign and some silver—I said no—I seized him by the collar, and held him till the constable came up.





WILLIAM MAVERLY
 (police-sergeant F 74.) On Monday last I was in Bridge-street, and saw the witness and the prisoner—he had half-a-sovereign, eight shillings, and some coppers, and these new silk handkerchiefs.




GUILTY
. Aged 18.—


Transported for Seven Years.

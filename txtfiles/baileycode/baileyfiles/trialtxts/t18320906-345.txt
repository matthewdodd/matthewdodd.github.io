. On the 14th of August I was in the kitchen, and saw the prisoner leave the passage; I ran after him - I took hold of his coat, tore the flap of it off, and the candlestick fell from him; I followed him to the Edgware-road - I there stumbled and fell, but I got up, and still pursued; he was taken in my sight.
Prisoner. Q. When I came out of the kitchen, did you follow me? A. You took it from the front-room; I came up to you while you were running - I followed you into a mews, where you was taken; I never lost sight of you.

             (Police-constable D 125). I took the prisoner at the Hop Pole, public-house; his coat had the skirt torn, as it has now.

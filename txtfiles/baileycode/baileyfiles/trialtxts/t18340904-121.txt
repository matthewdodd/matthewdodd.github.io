 - the prisoner was my servant of all work
 - she had no business at the till - I marked four shillings worth of copper, which I put into the till on the 17th of August - I looked again between three and four o'clock that afternoon, and missed 1s. 3d. - I got the police-officer, and we went up to the room where the prisoner was - I said I suspected she had robbed me, and had some money on her, perhaps she would go to the station and be searched - she wished to get away, but the officer would not let her - she then said we might search her there - the officer was going to do it, when she pulled out a purse with 1s. 3d. of the marked money in it - she had been four weeks with me.

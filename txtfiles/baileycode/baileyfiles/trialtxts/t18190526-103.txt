            . I am a fisherman
, and live at Chiswick. On the 1st of May, at night, I left my eels in the well of my boat, there were about 70 lbs. - the boat and all were taken away in the night. Next morning I found the boat at Putney. All the eels were taken out, and ten planks in the boat's well knocked in; the rudder and sculls were thrown overboard - a sack was also taken.

            . I am in partnership with Malcolm. Our boat and all were taken away. Next morning I got a search-warrant, and found the sack in a cupboard in the prisoner's house - it was all over slime, as if eels had been in it.

            . I am an officer. I went to the prisoner's house at Hammersmith, he was not at home. I told his wife my business; she put her back against a cupboard, and said I should not search her house. I found the sack in that cupboard. She ran up stairs, I followed her, and found a very large eel-pie there; there was also a quantity of eel-skins and guts in a dish.
(Sack produced and sworn to.)

            . I had orders to watch this house, in the parish of St. Michael Queenhithe


: On the 19th of October, about a quarter after 7 in the evening, I saw the prisoner, and another in company, come out of it; I followed them a little way. The first got away. I stop the prisoner with this lead in his apron. [Produced in court.] There was a man passing by; I desired him to lay hold of the prisoner, while I ran after the other, who had dropt his lead, and ran for it. I could not catch him.
Q. Was there any lead missing from that house?
Ballard. There was; and I and another man, who is not here, sitted this lead to the place; it sitted exactly.

Q. How old do you look upon the prisoner to be?
Ballard. He says he is 15 years of age, he would never tell who was with him.
Prisoner's Defence.
There was nobody with me, I had been over the water to Tooley-stairs with a fair. I returned and went back behind that house to ease myself, there the lead stood against the wall.

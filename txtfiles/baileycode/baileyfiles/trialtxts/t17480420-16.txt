            . I went into my yard about a quarter after nine at night, and saw that the clothes were thrown about, and I lost these things. I saw Mrs. Walker in the inside of the parlour endeavouring to conceal herself, and I saw a person stooping down under the window; so I open'd my parlour-door, and laid hold of my gentlewoman, which is Mrs. Walker; I sent for a constable, and that night she made several impeachments. The next day I went to 
               
                  Mary 
                  Richmond 
               



            , and she gave me this bundle, in which was a shift and some stockings.

            . I was at Mr. Harris's house that night, I went backwards, and saw this petticoat and some other things thrown out of the back parlour window on the ground-floor, and Mr. Harris and I saw the Prisoner at the bar endeavouring to conceal herself, and she said, break an arm or a leg if you will let me go; Mr. Harris got hold of her, and I saw a bundle in her apron.

            . Mr. Harris sent for me to take a thief, I did not care to go without a warrant, but I did, for I would do any thing to serve my country; I said to her, see here, young body, what you have done, and I spoke several harsh words to her, and told her, she was going the ready way to be hanged.

                  Walker 
               



             being discovered, she discovered the Prisoner; and I told her, if she would confess, I would not prosecute her, because I did not know what goods I had lost: and she said, 
               
                  Mary 
                  Walker 
               



             took the goods out of a house two doors off, and gave them to her.
Jury. Did she say she had any thing of yours?
Harris. I asked her if she had any thing of mine, and I told her if she had, and would own it, I would forgive her, and then she gave me this bundle.

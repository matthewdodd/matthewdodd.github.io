            . I met the prisoner early in the morning with a bag; I thought it suspicious, I stopped him; he said it was some victuals his brother had given him, some fowls and meat: I found it so, and also this saddle and saddle-cloth (producing them.)

            . I know the saddle and saddle-cloth; they are the property of my master, Mr. Park. On Friday night I had a saddle-cloth, and used it upon a mare of my master's, and locked it up; about seven o'clock I missed them. On Saturday and on Monday I saw them at the justices; there I knew them very well. The prisoner when charged with stealing them, said, as he was going along the road early in the morning he found them.
Prisoner's Defence.
I have no friends; they have attended some days, but are not here now. I found these things upon the road.

            . I am in the service of Thomas Fowke, a linen-draper
, of Tottenham-court-road


. The prisoner came there on the 7th of February, and asked if we wanted to purchase any silk handkerchiefs; I said No, and he went away - after he was gone we missed a piece of print from the counter; I pursued, and overtook him about a quarter of a mile from the shop; I asked if he had been in Mr. Fowke's shop; he said he knew no such person - I let him go on, but Green, one of Mr. Fowke's men came up, and in consequence of what he said, I went to the prisoner again; I said, "I think you are the man - let me look into your hat," which he did, but there was nothing: I then took the corner of the handkerchief from the bundle under his arm, and there I saw this print, which I know to be my master's.

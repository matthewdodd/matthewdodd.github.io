            . I live at the Red-lion in Long-acre


; on the 17th of November I lost three stone mugs tipped with silver; I could suspect nobody but the prisoner, he being in and out several times. I searched his room (he lives in Castle-street ) there I found them. I took him up, and he acknowledged he took them, and said he was very sorry for it. I took him before the justice, there he acknowledged the same.

Henry Green. I am the constable; I went into the prisoner's room, there I found the mugs; we took the prisoner before justice Fielding, there he acknowledged he took them out of the prosecutor's house.
Prisoner's defence.
I know nothing of the mugs.

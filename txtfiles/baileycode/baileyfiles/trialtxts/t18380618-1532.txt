WILLIAM MEADER
. I am in the service of Mr. Nathan Blake, a shoe-maker, in Edgeware-road. On the 29th of May I saw the prisoner lurking about our shop—she walked away, and we left her—she returned again in about an hour—I was serving a customer in the shop, and cast my eye towards the door—I saw the prisoner with a boot in her hand—I went to the door, and laid hold of her—I said, "This won't do"—she let the boot go—I turned her shawl back and saw another boot under her arm—this is it—(producing it)—it is my master's—she was then taken into custody, and the cotton was found under her arm, under the boot.




GUILTY
. Aged 18.—


Transported for Seven Years.

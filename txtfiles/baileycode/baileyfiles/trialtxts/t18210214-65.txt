            . On the 22d of January, at ten o'clock in the morning, I was in the Strand


. An address was going to Bradenburgh-house; I stood up till it passed. In a few minutes, I felt my fob disturbed, and saw my watch in the prisoner's hand - he struck me in the face - I seized him - a scuffle ensued - he was rescued by a gang; but before that, I had marked his cheek with a pallet I had - the officer secured him. I am certain of him; I never lost sight of him, till he was taken; he had the mark on his cheek - I have not found my watch.
JOHN DAVIS. I was at the bottom of Southampton-street; the brass-founders were passing. I heard a man cry,
"That is him with the mark on his face." I and another officer ran up - twenty or thirty were rescuing him. Idrew my staff - they let him go - we seized him; his face was covered with yellow paint.
Prisoner's Defence. I was looking at the procession, and they took me.

            . I am a merchant and banker
, at No. 190, Shoreditch


. The prisoner had been in my employ since 1825, as clerk
, and in September, 1828, I made him my cash-keeper. On Monday, the 19th of January, when I came to town, he was not at the desk, as he ought to have been, and on making inquiry I found he had absconded; I immediately looked at the cash-book, and found there should have been 1584l. odd in the cash-box; we found 1290l. 17s. 2d. difficient - 324l. was all that was left: I had not counted my cash for some time before; I depended on him - the amount of cash in hand changes every five minutes; I cannot say whether it was taken at various times or not.

            . I am a Bow-street officer. I was employed to go in search of the prisoner - I went to Mr. Needham, of Liverpool, and apprehended the prisoner at No. 5, Union-street; I searched him, and found about him a green purse, containing five sovereigns, three half-sovereigns, and 31s., and in a carpet bag I found 7l. 12s. 6d. in silver, and on his wife, who was with him, 2l. 18s.; I was surprised to find so little, and said, "Where is the rest?" Mr. Davies told me there was 1200l.; he said, "I assure you I had no more than what you have found, and what Mr. Needham has got - I have been squandering the remainder away for the last two years;" Needham had a bag of money, which I did not see found.

            . I am a labourer
. On the 15th of June, between eleven and twelve o'clock, I was lying down to sleep on Hampstead Heath


, with several more labourers - we had made a tent. I put my jacket over my children for a covering. About two o'clock my eldest child said the kettle was gone; I got up and found it outside the tent, but all our victuals was gone out of it. I missed the jacket and hat, and on Sunday, the 18th, I found the prisoner in the cage with them.

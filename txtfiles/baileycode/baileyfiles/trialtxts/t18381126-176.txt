WILLIAM HAYNES
 and 




JAMES DOYLE
 were indicted for

 stealing, on the 
18th of October, 2 pedestals, value 3s., and 1 bowl, value 10s., the goods of 



John Venables.






JOHN VENABLES
. I live in Broad-street, Bloomsbury. This property was taken from my shop window on Sunday the 18th of October—I saw it

safe about six o'clock, and missed it about ten minutes after—I found a pane of glass had been broken about an hour and a half before—I did not find my bowl again, but the pedestals I believe I have seen—I have no mark on them—I saw one at the station-house, which I believe was mine-Haynes was then in custody.





GEORGE RIPKEY
. About six o'clock in the evening of the 18th of October, I saw the prisoners together by the prosecutor's house—I saw them take the glass out with their fingers, take out a china bowl, and go away with it—I did not see them afterwards—I am sure they are the two—I had seen them before, and I am sure they are the same persons.





JOHN SUMNER
. (police' constable F 137.) I met Haynes about six o'clock that evening as I was on my beat, at the bottom ox the coal-yard, about one hundred yards from the prosecutor's—I saw he had something under a short jacket—I saw him go up Smarts-buildings, and turn round to Newton-street—I took him, and found this pedestal on him.





HENRY NEWMAN
. (police-sergeant F 18.) I was on duty in the coal-yard about five o'clock the next morning, and found one of these pedestals in a hole in the wall.

Haynes's Defence. That boy Ripkey and another, who, I believe, was his brother, were the persons I bought it of—I gate 1 1/2 d. for it—I found it was not what I thought it was, and I went back to try to see him, but could not (The prisoner Haynes received a good character.)

            . I am shopman to Evan Thomas, a linen draper
. On the 26th of February, the prisoner came into the shop, the young man who served him is dead; he asked for black shalloon, we had none, he showed him some holland; he was a quarter of an hour in the shop, and bought nothing; he went out, and the young man after him, and brought him back with a piece of Norwick crape in a bag, which he had brought into the shop; we gave him in charge; the young man said he had missed it, and suspected him; he said nothing, to it - the end of it hung out of his bag.

            . I am an officer. I was fetched to Mr. Thomas's, and took the prisoner; they said he had taken a piece of Norwich crape off the bench; that a person came in and asked if he had bought anything; upon which the young man who is dead, said he pursued and brought him back with it in the bag.

JOSEPH FELLOWS
. I am ostler at the White Horse, Gray's-inn-lane. On the 13th of March, the prisoner came there with his master, in the afternoon, and remained till twenty minutes to seven o'clock—the gentleman baited his horse—when they were gone, I missed my boots from the harness-room—on the 26th of March, the gentleman came again, and put up as he did before, but the prisoner was not with him—I told him I had lost a pair of boots, and suspected his servant—my boots were found at Woolwich—these are them.





ROBERT MOORE
. I am sergeant-major in the Royal Artillery at Woolwich. The prisoner is an officer's servant there—on the morning of the 27th, his master desired me to go and search his kitchen—I went, and found these boots on the top shelf, where the prisoner was quartered—his master asked him how he came by them—he said he bought them of a man in London.

Prisoner's Defence. I bought the boots is London, while I was walking with my horse.

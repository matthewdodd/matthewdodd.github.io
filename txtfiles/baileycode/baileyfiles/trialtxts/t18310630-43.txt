            . I live near Romford, in Essex. I am a gentleman
. On the 17th of June, as I was in Silver-street


, passing from Marlborough-street to Regent-street, somebody told me I had had my pocket picked - I felt and missed my handkerchief; I turned and followed the mob into Golden-square - Mr. Charlton, who had the prisoner, gave me the handkerchief which I had had in my pocket, and it is marked with my name.

            . I was in Golden-square between three and four o'clock - I heard a cry of Stop thief! and saw the prisoner running up Upper John-street, towards me: I pursued, and saw him throw something into an area - I lost sight of it while I pursued: I took him and brought him back, and in my way I asked a person (I believe a servant) at the door of the house where I saw the handkerchief in the area, and they gave it me - I gave it to the prosecutor, with the prisoner: I saw it picked up.

            . I was in John-street, leading to Brewer-street, on the 17th of June. I saw the prisoner take a yellow silk handkerchief from a gentleman's pocket who was walking along - it was such a one as has been produced.

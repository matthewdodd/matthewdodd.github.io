JOHN BLACKBURN



, stealing 1 half-sovereign; the money of 



Thomas Jones, from his person.






THOMAS JONES
. I am a hair-dresser. I was at a public sale at Tottenham—a mahogany table was knocked down to me, it came to 17s.—I took three half-sovereigns out of my pocket, and placed two of them upon the table, and put one into my waistcoat-pocket—I waited for my 3s., and when I got to the door, I saw the prisoner's fingers in my waistcoat-pocket, and missed my half-sovereign—I accused him of taking it—he denied it—I said I would have him locked up—he said if I did not mind what I said he would have me locked up—a witness said that he saw his hand at my pocket, and I kept him till the officer came—the prisoner took out two sovereigns and a half-sovereign in a paper from his pocket, and said, "You see it was not me that took it"—a person behind said, "You had better give him half a sovereign than be locked up"—the prisoner put the half-sovereign into my hand—a respectable person said, "You bad better not take it," and I gave it him back.

Cross-examined by
MR. BALLANTINE. Q. Did you lose sight of his hand? A. As soon as I saw his person—I did not lose sight of his arm—his pals were close by him.





JAMES WILSON
. I am a shoemaker, and five at Tottenham. I was at the sale, and saw the prisoner there, and two more with him—Mr. Jones accused him of stealing a half-sovereign—I turned and said, "I saw his hand in your pocket"—they went out of the sale-room, and I stopped.

Cross-examined. Q. Did you see him hand the money to anybody? A. No; I saw him and two others surround Jones, and saw the prisoner's hand in his pocket.





RICHARD SINCLAIR
 (policeman, N 321). I took the prisoner—I asked him where he resided—he said, "At 39, Borough-road"—I went there, and found it was not correct—it is only a chair-maker's shop—it is no dwelling at all




GUILTY
. Aged 20.—


Transported for Seven Years.

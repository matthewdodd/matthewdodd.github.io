THOMAS DICKINSON sworn. - I am a messenger belonging to the Police-office, Worship-Street: I apprehended the prisoner on the 19th of July; I met the prisoner in Norton-Salgate; I asked him if he knew Mr. Hodge, he said, he did not; while I was talking to him, I observed this pistol in his pocket; I took him into a shop, and searched him; I found upon him some counterfeit money, a tobacco-stopper, and a snuff-box.
Hodge. I lost a pair of pistols, but I cannot say that this is one of them; the snuff-box, I know to be mine, I have had it ten years; it is mended with a piece of putty at the top.
The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.

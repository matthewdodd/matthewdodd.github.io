The Prosecutor depos'd, that as he was going along Drury-Lane, the Prisoner came to him and ask'd him to drink with her; that she carried him to King's-Court in Russel-Street


, and would have him go with her into a House; and he not being willing to go in, she pull'd him in, and shut the Door upon him, and he feeling her fumbling about him, miss'd his Shirt; that then she ran down into the Cellar, he follow'd her, and when he came down, a Soldier was there, who hector'd him and threatened him if he did not be gone. The Jury found her 


               guilty to the Value of 10 d.

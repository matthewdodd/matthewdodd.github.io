THOMAS JOYCE. I am a provision merchant
. Between twelve and one o'clock, on the 1st of June, I left my cart on Saffron-hill


, with my coat in it; while I was looking into a shop opposite I heard a cry of "There is a man running away with your coat!" I saw the prisoner running, and I followed him up Castle-street - I saw him drop the coat - I took it up, and pursued him till he was taken on Mutton-hill. The coat was safe five minutes before.

            . I took up the prisoner - the prosecutor has had the coat ever since.

            . On the 1st of June I saw the cart on Saffron-hill; the prisoner went and took the coat off the seat - he ran up Castle-street, and into Onslow-street, with it.
Prisoner's Defence. As I was walking up Saffron-hill I heard a cry of Stop thief! I ran after the man, and he dropped the coat - I took it up and followed him - I droped it again.

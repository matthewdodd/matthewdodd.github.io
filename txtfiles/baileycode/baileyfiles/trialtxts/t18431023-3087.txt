MR. CLARKSON
conducted the Prosecution.






ELIZABETH LAVALLIN
. I am a widow, and live in Upper George-street, Greenwich. The prisoner lodged there wfth me and my daughter, whom he married—I went to London, and received the portion of some property which came to me—I had two 50l. and three 5l. Bank-notes—I returned—he knew I had received the money—I did not tell him where I put it—I put it in a bag, into a closet, and saw it safe about nine o'clock in the morning of the 16th of Aug.—the key was left in the lock of the closet-door—I went to the closet about six o'clock, and missed the money—the prisoner had left then—he said a person named Leicester had sent to him to attend a funeral at Deptford; he was to be there at half-past two o'clock, and should return in time to take the baby to her mother, who war nursing at a gentleman's house—he never returned—my son Henry bad taken the numbers of the notes, and he gave them to the police-inspector—I saw my son take the numbers.

Prisoner. You had no home, and were with me twelve or eighteen months, and only gave roe 3l. or 4l. the whole time. Witness. I deny it—I took cars of the child, and my daughter Louisa worked at her sister's business—I have paid you 10l. for rent.





HENRY LAVALLIN
. I live at Mr. Ender's rope-manufactory, Greenwich. On the 15th I saw my mother receive the money—I took the numbers of the notes as soon as we returned home—I gave her the paper.





EDWARD FREEMAN
. I am inspector of the Greenwich police. On the 16th of Aug. I received information of this robbery, and the numbers of the notes—the two 50l. were 07924 and 07925, the 5l., 78662, 63, and 64.





THOMAS WHITMORE
. I am a clerk in the Bank of England. On the 16th of Aug. a person came to the Bank, and received payment of this 50l. note, No. 07924—the name of Lavallin is written on it.

MRS. LAVALLIN. I believe this name to be the prisoner's handwriting.





JOHN HAWKES
. I am pay-clerk in the Bank of England. This 50l. note, No. 07924, was paid on the 16th of Aug., by a person giving the name of Lavallin—I gave five 10l. notes for it—two of them were Not. 55267 and 55269, dated 10th June, 1843.





ALEXANDER ROBERTSON
. I am pay-clerk at the Bank. On the 16th of Aug., between two and four o'clock, I paid a person fifty sovereigns for this 50l. note, No. 07925.





EDWARD PITT YOUELL
. I am clerk at a banking-house at Yarmouth. On the 25th of Aug. the prisoner deposited 65l. at our bank, in the name of Arthur Wensley, as I understood him—I received from him two 10l. notes, Nos. 55267 and 69, dated 10th June, 1848, and two 5l. notes, Nos. 78662 and 64, the rest in gold—he took 10l. out on the 26th, and the rest on the 29th.






CHARLES STURGE FLETCHER
. I am inspector of police at Cambridge. On the 26th of Oct. I found the prisoner at a house at Cambridge, and told him I took him on suspicion of stealing Bank notes from Mrs. Lavallin, of Greenwich—he said he knew nothing of Greenwich, and I was deceived; he was not the person, his name was Arthur Wellesley, and he came from London—I found a box and bag there—I asked if they were his—he said, "Yes"-—I found bills of parcels amounting to 46l., and a gold watch in it—I asked him to write his name—he wrote "Arthur Wellesley, K. G. C., London," and said he was the son of the Duke of Wellington; and while in custody he wrote a letter to the Duke, begging His Grace to write a letter, that he might be released.

Prisoner's Defence. I did not know what I was doing; I had entirely lost my senses for some hours.

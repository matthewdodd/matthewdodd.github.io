JOHN THORPE
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
5th of March, 1 handkerchief, value 2s. the goods of 



Thomas Frost, from his person; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






THOMAS FROST
. I am a professor of music, and live in Seymour-street, Euston square. On the 5th of March, about half-past seven o'clock, I was walking along Bowl-yard, Hoi born—I felt a touch at my coat-pocket—I turned, and saw the prisoner behind me—I felt my handkerchief was gone, and he had it in his hand—I seized, and accused him of picking my pocket, and having my handkerchief—he said he had not—I saw him throw it behind him—a person who was with him, walked back, and stooped, pretended to pick it up, and he gave it to me—the prisoner begged me to let him go, as I had got my handkerchief—he said I might have a wife and family of my own, and he was a poor fellow out of work—the officer came up, and I gave him in charge.





GEORGE PORTER
 (police-constable E 117.) I took the prisoner, and have the handkerchief.





JOHN LAWRENCE
 (police-sergeant F 9.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got at Mr. Clark's office—(read)— the prisoner is the person.

Transported for Ten Years.

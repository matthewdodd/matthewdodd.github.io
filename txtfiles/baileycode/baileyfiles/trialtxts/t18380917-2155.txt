CHARLES MERRITT
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
30th of August, 1 handkerchief, value Is., the goods of 



Alfred Edward Amiable Boughlinval, from his person; and that he had been before convicted of felony.







ALFRED EDWARD AMIABLE BOUGLINVAL
. I was in the Edgeware-road about half-past eight or nine o'clock on the evening of the 30th of August. I had a handkerchief in my pocket—I was walking with a friend, who saw the prisoner throw the handkerchief down on the pavement—I ran after the prisoner, and after a furious course I caught him—he behaved rather violently to me—he seized my scarf, twisted it round, and tried to get away, but I kept him—this is the handkerchief.

Prisoner. I am not the gentleman who picked the pocket.





PETER JASTREBSKI
. I am an artist. I was walking with the prosecutor, and saw the handkerchief drawn—I saw the prisoner have it in his hand when he drew it away from the pocket, and throw it down—I followed after my friend, and saw what he has stated.





GEORGE AYRES
. I am a policeman. I took the prisoner.

Prisoner's Defence. I was walking from my brothers—the gentleman collared me, and accused me of stealing his handkerchief—I am innocent.





JOHN WILSON
. I produce a certificate of the prisoner's conviction from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—I apprehended him, and was a witness—he is the person.

Prisoner. I am not the same person.

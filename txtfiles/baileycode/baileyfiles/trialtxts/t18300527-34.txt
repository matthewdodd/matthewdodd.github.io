            . I was going on an errand on the 12th of May, at five o'clock, and stopped to talk to a man who keeps a stall; I looked round, and saw the prisoner take a pair of trousers from the prosecutor's shop window, and run away with them - I told the people of it; I had worked with the prisoner about twelve months back - I described him.

             - he lives in the Hackney-road


. The witness told me a boy had taken a pair of trousers; I looked, and missed them - I have never seen them since; I had seen them not five minutes before, and had seen the prisoner near the shop - I had seen him about six weeks before, lurking about.
JURY. Q. When was the prisoner taken? A. On the 13th, the day afterwards - I looked after him directly, and saw him turn a corner, but he was gone too quick for me to swear to him.

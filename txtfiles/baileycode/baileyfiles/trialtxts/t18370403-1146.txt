CHARLES STEWITT
. I am in the Artillery. On the 3rd of April, between one and two o'clock in the morning, I met the prisoner over London-bridge, as I was going to Woolwich—she asked me to give her a gists of gin—I gave her a pint of ale, as the publican would not draw any gin—she took me down a court—I had two halfcrowns and 3d. in half-pence in my jacket pocket—we stood talking together—my jacket was undone, and she got her arms round me—she then left me—I put my hand into my pocket, and found all my money gone—I spoke to her about it—a policeman came up, and I gave her in charge—the halfpence were found on the ground—the policeman found the two half-crowns on her—how dropped out of her shoe, about ten minutes after the other—she had denied having any money.





SIMON SAVORY
. I am a policeman. The prosecutor called me—I found him and the prisoner up a court—he charged her with stealing two half-crowns—I found 3 1/2 d. on the ground—she denied having any money, but on going to the station-house, she admitted having taken it—I took off her shoes twice at the station-house, but did not find it; but on putting on her shoe, one half-crown dropped out from between the lining, and the other was found between the two soles.

Prisoner. I am very sorry—I hope you will look over it this time—I was very much distressed.




GUILTY
.* Aged 25.—


Transported for Fourteen Years.

Before Mr. Justice Littledale.

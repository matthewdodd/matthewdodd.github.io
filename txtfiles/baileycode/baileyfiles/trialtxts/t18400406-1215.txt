GEORGE ROSS
. I live in Charles-street, Middlesex-hospital, and am a tailor. The prisoner took a ready furnished lodging of me on the 13th of March—I went to bed that night, and about half-past ten o'clock I heard a noise, and about half-past twelve o'clock I heard the prisoner open the street-door—I went to him, and he asked me for the water-closet—I showed him the way, and went up stairs again—I then heard him run out—I pursued him, and took him with my sheets round his body—the bed was taken off his bedstead, and rolled up with the other things, ready to be removed.

Prisoner's Defence. I was reduced to great distress, and have two children to support—it was my intention to have sent the bedding back in a fortnight, when I should have got employ.




GUILTY
. Aged 38.—


Transported for Seven Years.

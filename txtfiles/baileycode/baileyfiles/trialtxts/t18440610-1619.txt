WILLIAM JOHNSON
 was indicted

 for stealing 1 bag, value 6d.; 4lbs. weight of coffee, 4s.; and 10 shillings; the property of Robert Corser.






JOHN CASS
. I am shopman to Robert Corser, a grocer, in Leadenhall-street. At a quarter to eight o'clock, in the morning of the 17th of May, I was in the shop—I received information, ran out, and stopped the prisoner about three yards from the shop with this bag of coffee, which had been in the shop—he said he was going along the street, and met a man who asked him to carry it, and he would go and fetch the man—I took him to the shop, and gave him in charge—I saw no other man.





JOHN WHITE
 (City police-constable, No. 667.) I found this other bag round the prisoner, in the shape of an apron.

Prisoner's Defence. The coffee was at the corner of the gateway; a gentleman asked if I wanted a job; he said he was going to Stratford by a bus, and told me to take the coffee and wait for him; he was not three yards away from me.




GUILTY
.* Aged 23.—


Transported for Seven Years.

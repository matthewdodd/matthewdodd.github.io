JOB BLAKE
 was indicted

 for stealing 1 watch, value 30s.; the goods of 



William Lintill, from his person.






WILLIAM LINTILL.
 I was drinking with the prisoner on the 11th of Aug., at Stanwell—I got a little fresh, and laid down on the grass—the prisoner accompanied me—I had a watch with me—I went to sleep, when I awoke I found my watch was gone—I gave notice to the Police—this is my watch, and the one I lost.

Prisoner. Q. Were there not persons drinking at the public-house besides me? A. Yes.





ROBERT HENRY RIGARLSFORD
 (police-constable T 26.) I received information, and went to the prisoner's room at the Windsor Barracks—I asked him if he had been to Stanwell-moor—he denied it—he was ordered to get out of bed to be searched—while I was searching a pair of trowsers, he passed me and went to his bed again—I then heard something rattling in his right hand, and found this watch in his hand—he told me had picked it up in a field—this was on the same night it was lost.

Prisoner. You told the man to swear a robbery against me, or he would not have his property again. Witness. No, never—it is about seven miles from the barracks to where the watch was lost.

Prisoner's Defence. I went to a public-house and met this man; he asked me to drink, and called for a pint of half-and-half; we went to a Tom and Jerry shop and had some more beer; I went out and laid down on the grass; I picked up the watch by the foot-path; I stated to the landlord that I had found it, and I also stated the same in the barracks.




GUILTY.** Aged 27.—


Transported for Seven Years.

            . I am the wife of R. W. Smith, and lodge at King-street, Drury-lane


, on the first floor; on the 3d of May, I went out about two o'clock; I thought I locked the door; I shut it, and had the key in my pocket; on returning about four, I found the prisoner coming out of my bed-room; he had a bundle in his hand, I said,
"Young man, what do you want in my bed-room?" he said, let me go, I shut the door, and took it out of his hand, he ran down stairs; I called Stop thief! and he was brought back in a quarter of an hour. I have no doubt of his being the man, the bundle contained all these things, except the waistcoat, which was in his hat.

            . On the 11th of November I was coming along Drury-lane


, about eight o'clock in the evening; I was going by Mr. Hodgson's door, I saw the prisoner go to Mr. Hodgson's window inside of the shop; he took the cheese and came out of the shop with it. I asked the prisoner if he belonged to the shop, he answered yes; I suspected him and followed him, and told him to come back, if he belonged to the shop, he did come back to the stone post by the shop door, and dropped the cheese behind the post in the street; Mr. Hodgson came to the door and I told him that the prisoner took the cheese out the shop; I gave the prisoner into his custody; I never lost sight of him.
Prosecutor. This is the cheese, I marked it directly; I am certain it is my cheese.

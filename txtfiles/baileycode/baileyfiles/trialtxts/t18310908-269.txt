            . I am a widow
, and live at Kentish-town


. On the 9th of July I was coming out at my door to go on an errand; I saw the prisoner at the next door, drinking water; as I returned, I met him just at my door; I went in, and missed a watch off the mantel-piece in the parlour - I had left the parlour door ajar; I followed, and called to him to stop - he began to run; I called Stop thief! and came up to him; he threw something over a gentleman's premises; the gentleman got on the pales, got on the tiles, and gave it me - it was my watch - I had seen it safe five minutes before.

                  THOMAS 
                  BAILEY
               



            . I am a carman
, and am in partnership with my father, 
               
                  Richard 
                  Bailey
               



            . I had two hogahead of sugar from the West India Docks, to deliver to Mr.Salmon, of Bell-alley, Coleman-street; it was the property of Messrs. John and 
               
                  Joseph 
                  Travers
               



            ; the prisoner was sent for them, and he received them at the docks; he left there at a quarter-past ten o'clock on the morning of the 22d of August. I did not see him going - I heard from Mr. Salmon, that there was 119lbs. of sugar short of weight - I spoke to the prisoner about it, and he said he had delivered them as he received them; he had been in our employ twelve or fifteen months; he might have got to Mr. Salmon's about twelve o'clock.


                  THOMAS 
                  HOLMES
               



            . I am foreman at the West India Docks. On the 22d of August I delivered two hogsheads of sugar to the prisoner, as Mr. Bailey's carman. I do not know where he was to take them; they were Nos. 14 and 15; one weighed 1604lbs., and the other 1411lbs.


                  JOHN 
                  KELLY
               



            . I am a labourer in the West India Docks. I recollect weighing the sugar for Mr. Holmes - I called the weight over, and he took it down.


                  WILLIAM 
                  BRIDGES
               



            . I am a carman, in the employ of Mr. Stubbs - I was going up Shoreditch, about twenty minutes before one o'clock, and met Mr. Bailey's cart coming towards the City.


                  ROBERT 
                  BAXTER
               



            . I am a horse-keeper. I saw the prisoner coming through Shoreditch, about twenty minutes before one o'clock; that was not the way from the docks to Mr. Salmon's.


                  ROBERT 
                  SALMON
               



            . I expected this sugar, and it came to me about one o'clock, on the 22d of August; the weight of one hogshead was 1304lbs.; he brought a cart note, which certified the weight of it to be 1411lbs.; the other hogshead which was weighed first was right, and when we were going to weigh the second, the prisoner said, "It is not usual to weigh the second hogshead; you won't weigh that;" I said Yes, I should - I then asked him if he weighed it at the docks; he said No - I said,"You see what the weight of it is;" he said Yes, and counted the weights himself.


                  JAMES 
                  BROWN
               



            . I am in the employ of Mr. Salmon. The prisoner brought the two hogshead to the house on the 22d of August; one of them was 107lbs. lighter than the note mentioned; the prisoner did not wish to have the two hogshead weighed; but they were; the one which was too light came out of the cart first, and then the heavy one; the prisoner wished to roll the heavy one into the house first, which was done; it was weighed, and was right; he then said, it was not usual to weigh the second hogshead, but it was done; sugar could be taken from it by raising the iron from the drawing-hole.
Prisoner's Defence. I know nothing about it.

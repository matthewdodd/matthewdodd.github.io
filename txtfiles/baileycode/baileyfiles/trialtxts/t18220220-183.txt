            . On the 15th of February, about half-past four o'clock in the morning, I was in the Haymarket


, seeing the people come out of the masquerade, at the Opera-house - I stood at the Opera-house door; I had a flute in my coat pocket; I felt something at my pocket, turned round, and saw the prisoner with it in his hand; I seized him directly, and somebody immediately took it from him. I have not seen it since.
Prisoner. Q. Did not I shew you both my hands - A. Yes, after he had given it to another man.

            . I am an officer. I was at the Opera-house, and saw the prisoner - the prosecutor said,
"You have got my flute," there was immediately an opening in the crowd, for somebody to get away. The prosecutor said,
"It is no use searching him, he has given it to another man."
Prisoner's Defence. Immediately as he taxed me with it, I shewed them both my hands.

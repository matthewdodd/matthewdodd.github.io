PHOEBE ROFF. I keep a baker's-shop
, at Hoxton


, and am a widow. On the 5th of January, about seven o'clock in the evening, I heard a noise in my shop - I had only left it about two minutes, when I had served a customer; I came into the shop, and found the prisoner on his knees behind the counter, with the till resting on the bread bin: I took the till from him - a witness ran in, and held him till the officer came.

            . I live opposite to the prosecutrix. I heard what she said - I ran over, and held the prisoner till the officer came.

            . This is my till - there was 1s. 6d., and some coppers in it; I have lost money four times before, and every time I go, I take out the silver.

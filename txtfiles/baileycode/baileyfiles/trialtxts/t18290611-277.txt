. On the morning of the 4th of June I was in the shop; the prisoner Wilkinson came in, took three half-quartern loaves, and ran out of the shop with them; the other two prisoners were standing outside - they all three tore them in pieces, divided them, and ran away; I did not see them tear them myself.

            . I am a constable. On the morning in question I saw three men run round the corner of Circus-place, pursued by the call of Stop thief! I and another officer, ran and took the three prisoners with two loaves and a half - they had each a loaf divided in two, and were eating them very voraciously; I asked why they took so many loaves; they said they were very hungry - they made a deal of resistance; we found nothing on them but a small bag and a spoon.

            . I was in the Circus at half-past seven o'clock in the morning, and heard the cry; I pursued, and took the prisoners - they were eating some of the bread, and had the rest under their arms.
WILKINSON'S Defence. I told him not to take the bread from me - I was starving with hunger.

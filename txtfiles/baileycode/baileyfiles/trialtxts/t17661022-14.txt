            . I lett the prisoner a ready-furnished room, at 18 d. a week; about the beginning of August she came as a single woman out of place, and said she had nobody belonging to her; she lodged there about a fortnight; a woman that lodged in my house had lent her her key, to go up into her room for some things, after which she found her box broke open; then my wife and that woman went into the prisoner's room, and found the sheets were gone; I took her up, and upon her second examination I heard her confess where she had pawned them.

Prisoner's defence.
I know nothing about it.
For the prisoner.

                  Nesbit 
               



            . I am aunt-in-law to the prisoner; she used to come often to our house, but I believe it is three years ago.
Q. Is she a married woman?
A. Nesbit. I do not know whether she is, or is not; she has not been in London above seven or eight years; she behaved well as far as I understand while in service, which was four or five years.
Q. Have you ever heard her husband was under sentence of transportation?
A. Nesbit. No, not till lately.

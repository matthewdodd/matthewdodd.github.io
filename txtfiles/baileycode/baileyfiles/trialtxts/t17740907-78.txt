            . I am an ironmonger
 in Smithfield


: on the 30th of August, the prisoner came to our shop for a pair of buckle chases; I served him with a pair, and he asked for another; while I was looking for them, I heard him fumbling among some tongues and chafes in the rough at the end of the compter; I suspected he had taken some, and informed 
               
                  Henry
                   Bonnum
               



            , who was in the compting house, of it, and desired him to step out and justle against his pocket; he did, and when he had paid for those he bought, and was going away, he stopped him, and we charged him with it; he denied it; but when I threatened to send for a constable, he pulled them out of his pocket; there were six dozen pair.

             confirmed his evidence.
The prisoner, in his defence, denied the charge, and said he only took up the paper to see if there were any there to suit him
He called two witnesses who had known him a dozen years, and gave him a good character.

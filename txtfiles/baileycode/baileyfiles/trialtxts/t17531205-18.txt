            . The prisoner being almost starved I took him into the stable and gave him victuals and money, and let him lie in the loft; in a chamber joining to the lost I had a box in which I kept my cloaths, and other things. One morning about the 20th of September
, I had let him have the key to go out to help another man in the stable. When I was got up he was missing; then I missed my money from out of my box, three guineas, one half guinea, and 9 s. 6 d. I inform'd his father at Hampstead, who came and went with my brother after him towards Stratford-upon-Avon. My brother did not go quite there; the father return'd and brought me a guinea and half, and 1 s. 6 d. from the prisoner, as part of what he had taken from me. About a month after this the prisoner came to London again and was taken and had before the justice. There he denied it, but own'd it to me and the justice's clerk.
Thomas Bingham was call'd and did not appear, and his recognisance order'd to be estreated.
The prisoner in his defence said he did not break open any lock.

            . I am warehouseman to Sir 
               
                  Charles 
                  Price
               



             and Co. The prisoner came into the yard in William-street


 on the 16th of December, I thought he came to ask for work, but he turned and went out. In about ten minutes I saw him come out of Sir Charles's coach-house with a bundle. I stopped him; he said he had nothing. I made him unbutton his coat, and found this chaise apron, which he had taken from the coach-house. He said he cut it off the chaise with a knife which he had in his hand.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

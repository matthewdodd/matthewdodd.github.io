                  Miller

                  John 
                  Miller 
               



            .
Q. Have you lost any thing?
Miller. Yes, to my sorrow.
Q. What?
Miller . Some cloaths.
Q When did you lose them?
Miller. Last Wednesday night.
Q. What makes you think the Prisoner was concerned in taking them?
Miller . Because the Prisoner's brother lives in the same house with me, and when he came to see his brother he stole them.
Q. Have you got the things again?
Miller . I have nothing but one shift and an apron.
Q. Where did you find them?
Miller. In Houndsditch.
Q. How came you to go into Houndsditch?
Miller. The Prisoner took me there; these are the things.
Q. Did the Prisoner say how he came by them?
Miller. He said he took them out of my room; the key was in my door, and when he went up stairs to his brother, he robbed me.
Q. Did you give any thing to get them out of the pawn-broker's hands?
Miller. No, the pawn-broker gave them me freely.


                  John 
                  Motterfield 
               



             . I am a constable, I took the prisoner before the justice, and he said he sold the things in two places, one part for 10 d. and the other for a shilling; he said he sold the child's things in the Back-Lane in St. George's in the East.
Q. Did you find them?
Miller. No, we could not find them there.
Q. What did you find in Houndsditch?
Miller. We went up one pair of stairs, and found an apron and a shift: the woman denied the having them at first; and I told her the boy had sworn it, and I said I must have the things, or I would carry her along with us; and then she said they were not bought, they were pawned.

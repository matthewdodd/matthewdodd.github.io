            , who lives in Oxford-street


. On the 2d of January, about nine o'clock, the prisoner and another man came in and asked for some fustian, I shewed them three or four pieces; the other man fixed on a dark one; the prisoner walked to the back. I saw him look at the black and blue cloth which stood there, I suspected him. The other man told me to cut half a yard of fustain, and then asked for buttons. The prisoner walked towards the door, I saw his great coat bulky. I missed the kerseymere off the counter. I looked out of the door and saw him walking with it under his arm - I pursued - he dropped it. I picked it up and called Stop thief! he was secured. I did not see it under his arm till he was out.
Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Are you sure he is the man - A. Quite
Prisoner's Defence. I am innocent.

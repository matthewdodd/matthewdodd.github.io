            ; On the 15th of April I had occasion to go to look at three houses, they were covered in, in Tottenham-court-road


; I found a part of the gutters were stolen; on the evening of the 16th of April I was still at the look out, and about ten o'clock I went to the back part of these premises; I heard a rattling amongst the slates were the gutters laid; I was then convinced that some person was there going to take off the lead; I looked up, and after looking for about a minute and a half, I fairly sawa man at work in the gutter; I went into a room of one of the houses, where 
               
                  John 
                  Nutting
               



             lodges; I told him there was a thief upon the house; I told him to come out, and take a weapon by way of defending himself; he laid hold of the poker; I called out, what are you about there; the watchman was at the front of the house; he called, what is the matter; I said, there is some person upon the house cutting the lead; the watchman sprang his rattle, and a number of people came to the front of the house; the man then desisted from working at the back part of the house; 
               
                  John 
                  Nutting
               



             saw him go into the garret; he did not attempt to come down; we lost sight of him; he got in at the roof at the back part of the house; I went and got a light, and went through the house that I live in, and went to this garret, and shewed the light into the window, and 
               
                  John 
                  Nutting
               



             saw him go down the partition, to the bottom of the house; it is very easy for persons, acquainted with houses of this description, to go down by having braces; we have occasion to do so ourselves sometimes; they can hold by the uprights, and keep their feet upon these braces; I saw him clearly go down; he had got the same jacket on then as he has now; he went down the partition to the bottom of the house, and came out of the kitchen-window; we had the house all shut up but the kitchen-window; we did not suppose any one could get in there; 
               
                  John 
                  Nutting
               



             followed him there, and took him at the back part of the house; we searched the gutter, and found there were two pieces of lead cut from the gutter, rolled up, and a great many slates broken; he was taken to the watch-house. I produce the lead.

                  NUTTING
               



             sworn. - I saw a person go from the end of the roof in at the back garret-window, and when 
               
                  William 
                  Jordan
               



             went up to the top of the house I saw a man come down the partition; I caught hold of the prisoner just as he came out of the back kitchen-window; the prisoner is the man I secured. (The lead identified by the plumber, James Golding.
Prisoner's defence. I had occasion to go there and do whatever it was; the same time I was there, there was an alarm given; they took me on suspicion, as being the person; I am very innocent of the crime.
Q. How came you to go up to the roof, and come down the partition; that is the awkward part of it? - A. I was not there at all.

 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
4th of February, 1 watch, value 2l.; 1 watch-chain, value 6d.; 1 seal, value 6d.; 1 watch-key, value 1s.; 2 handkerchiefs, value 5s.; and 1 three-penny-piece; the property of 



James Price.






ELIZABETH PRICE
. I am wife of James Price, a labourer, living at Isleworth. I had a watch, chain, seal, key, two handkerchiefs, and a three-penny-piece—I saw them all safe on Tuesday, the 4th of February, a little before seven o'clock in the morning—I have lost them all—I have known the prisoner a great many years—I employed him just before seven o'clock that morning to move some potatoes out of the cellar, and before that I went up and moved my husband's watch into the middle drawer of the looking-glass, as the prisoner had to pass the bed-room—he remained there till twelve o'clock that day.





THOMAS TULL
 (police-constable F 22.) I received information, and went and found the watch covered up in some hay seed in a little unoccupied house, near where the property was lost; it was wrapped up in the handkerchief—I met the prisoner in going cross Sion-park—he said, "It will give me a month at the cook's shop," meaning the House of Correction.





JAMES HOLLIMAN
 (police-constable I 149.) I took the prisoner—I met him, and said, "You are my prisoner"—he said, "I will go with you"—in going, he said, "Who sent you for me, Mother Price?"—I said, "How came you to think Mother Price sent me for you?"—he said, "I have been at work for her, and I thought she might have lost something"—I took him to Mrs. Price—she said, "You could not have come through my room, you went through the cellar window"—he said, "I did, and through the alley."





ELIZABETH REELEY
. I know the house in the alley where the watch was found—I saw the prisoner go into that house about eleven o'clock that same morning.

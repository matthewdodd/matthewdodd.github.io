CHAPELL BATCHELOR
. I am now staying at the Royal Academy of Music, in Tenterden-street, Hanover-square. On the 10th of February, I

was in company with Mr. Latter, in King-street, Covent-garden—he left me suddenly, and ran after a person—I afterwards saw the prisoner with my handkerchief in his hand—he threw it down immediately—I took it up—Mr. Latter pursued, and caught him.





RICHARD LATTER
. I was with the prosecutor, in King-street, about half-past six in the evening, walking arm-in-arm—I caught a glimpse of somebody behind, looked round, and saw the prisoner pulling a handkerchief out of Mr. Batchelor's pocket—I turned round, and ran after him—he threw it down behind him—I caught him about fifty yards off, and gave him in charge.





THOMAS MILLS
 (police-constable F 93). The prisoner was given into my charge with the handkerchief.

Property produced and sworn to.


Prisoner's Defence. I was in King-street—two boys who were on before me, ran up, picked the gentleman's pocket, and hove the handkerchief down at my feet—the gentleman came, and took me.

MR. BATCHELOR. I saw him throw it down out of his hand.
(Michael Shelly, of Belton-street, Long-acre; and Peter Coakley, of Eagle-street, Red Lion-square; gave the prisoner a good character.)

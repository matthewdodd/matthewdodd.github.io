             sworn.
I am a carpenter, about four in the evening I saw some person go into the prosecutor's house, I watched till eleven o'clock, and at eleven I saw somebody come out of the buildings , two persons, it was a considerable distance, but it was moonlight; I saw them coming along, and the woman was last; the watchman seized the man, and took the lead; the prisoner said he had bought it somewhere along the road; I took it the next morning and matched it to the lead on the building, and it fitted exactly.
PRISONER JOHN's DEFENCE.
I went as far as Brentford, and I saw something lay, and I found it was lead, my wife was with me.

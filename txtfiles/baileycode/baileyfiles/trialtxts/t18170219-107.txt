ROBERT WINTERBOTTOM. I am 
in the first regiment of Life Guards


-the prisoner was in the same regiment. On the 26th of January, early in the morning, I found my box broken open, we were both quartered in the same room at Hyde Park Barracks


. I suspected the prisoner as he had been in the room by himself, and reported him to our quarter-master; his box was searched, and a pair of compasses found there, that exactly fitted the marks on my box lid. The next day, I found my watch at a pawnbrokers. All the men were brought into the same room with the prisoner, and the pawnbroker came down and pointed the prisoner out among them, as the man who had pledged it. I had seen the watch the afternoon before.

            . I am a pawnbroker, and live in Cambridge-street, Golden-square. On the 25th of January, the prisoner pledged a watch with me for seventeen shillings. I am sure the prisoner is the man. It was between six and eight o'clock in the evening.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
The prisoner stated, that he could prove an alibi, but called no witnesses for that purpose.

            . On the 10th of December I had hung up my watch on a nail behind my compter, and went into the back part of my warehouse, I returned in about five minutes, and saw the prisoner coming from behind the end of the compter, she came to me and asked me if I had any waste paper to sell, saying, she wanted two-pennyworth; I spoke hastily to her, and said, I sell no such thing. Seeing her go out in a hurry, I thought I had lost something, I looked, and missed my watch, we took her and searched her, but found nothing upon her. The constable can give a farther account.

            . I am constable; on the 10th of December I was sent for to the prosecutor's, there was the prisoner, the people had searched her, but did not find the watch; she was taken to the watch-house, there she confessed she had taken the watch and delivered it to 
               
                  Anne 
                  Follet 
               



            , whom she called her mistress; we got a warrant to apprehend her, and the day after Follet's husband brought this watch and delivered it to me ( produced in court, and deposed to by the prosecutor.)
The prisoner had nothing to say in her defence.

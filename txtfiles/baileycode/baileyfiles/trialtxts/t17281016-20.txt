. last.
The Prosecutor depos'd, That he accidentally met the Prisoner at the Bar, and she being his Countrywoman, (a Calledonean) they agreed to drink together, and accordingly they went to one Smith's, at Charing-Cross, where he fell a-sleep, and then she, like a muckle wicked Woman, took away his Goods and that when she came to be apprehended, she said, he was drunk, and she might as well take it as another.

             depos'd, That the Prisoner confess'd to him, she had robb'd the Prosecutor, and that when she confess'd it to him, she said, we will snack it between us. She said in her Defence, That the Prosecutor was mortally fuddled, and dropp'd both his Watch and Handkerchief, and that she would have had the Landlord have taken Care of 'em, that she was very honest, and never did an ill Thing in her Life; nor in this did she design any other than to take Care of her Countryman; but she being too officious in her Care of him, the Jury found her 


               Guilty to the Value of 10 d.

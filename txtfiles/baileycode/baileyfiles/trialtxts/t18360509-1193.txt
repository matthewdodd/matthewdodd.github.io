GEORGE KEMP
 (police-constable N 87.) I was on duty and saw the two prisoners on the 19th of April with a third person loitering about several shops—they came to the prosecutor—Wood left the other two and took this mutton—Armstrong, stood with this bag ready to receive it—I crossed and took Armstrong, and another took Wood—Armstrong threw the away when I came near him.





PHILLIP REGNART

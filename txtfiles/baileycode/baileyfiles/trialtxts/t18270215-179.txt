            . I keep a broker's shop in Red Lion-street, Spitalfields. On the 2d of February the prisoner came to sell me a collar, saddle, and traces; I asked how he came by them; he said he picked them up at IIford, near the Rabbits' public-house; suspecting they were stolen, I sent for an officer.

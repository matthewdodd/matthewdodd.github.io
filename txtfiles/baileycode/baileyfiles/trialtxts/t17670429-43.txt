            . I live at the Weaver's Arms, Shoreditch


, a public-house; I was asleep in my room, betwixt one and two in the day; I was awaked with a noise in the next room; I got up and opened the door, and saw the prisoner at the bar with the things mentioned in the indictment I called Mr. Burtup; I took her by the arm, and the two candlesticks dropped down from under her arm. I asked her what business she had up stairs; she said she came up to make water. She had five of my handkerchiefs in her pocket, and the other things bundled up. (Produced and deposed to) I never saw the prisoner before.

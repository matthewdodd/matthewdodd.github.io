CHARLES KERSLAKE
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
21st of August, 1 handkerchief, value 2s., the goods of 




James Dobson, from his person.






JAMES DOBSON
. I am a carpet-manufacturer, and live in Southampton buildings, Holborn. On the 21st of August, I was in Broad-street, St. Giles'. I felt a motion at my coat, turned round, and saw a very suspicious looking person walking into a shop, which has two doors to it—I missed my handkerchief—he went in at one door and came out at the other—I followed him, and saw him turning the corner with the handkerchief in his hand against the wall, and he dropped it a little further on in an oil-shop at the other corner—it was the prisoner—I never lost sight of him—I collared him.





DANIEL WATKINS
. I am a brass finisher, and live in Upper Rathbone place. I heard an alarm of "Stop thief"—the prisoner was running in Middle-row—he turned the corner, and just at the oil-shop door dropped the handkerchief and ran three or four yards further, when the prosecutor collared him.





ALLAN PHILLIPS
 (police-constable F 48.) I was on duty—I received charge of the prisoner, and Mr. Dobson gave me the handkerchief. (Property produced and sworn to.)




GUILTY
.* Aged 22.—


Transported for Seven Years.

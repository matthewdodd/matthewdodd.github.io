JOSEPH FABOR
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
15th of Oct., 2 pence and 5 halfpence, the monies of 



Eliza Guilline; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






SARAH ANN GUILLINE
. I live in Eden-place, Iyy-place, Hoxton. I was in the parlour, minding my aunt Eliza Guilline's shop on the 5th of Oct.—I heard a noise in the shop—I went out, and saw the prisoner leaning over the counter, with his hands in the till—I took hold of him—he dragged me out into the street, down the stone steps, and got away—I missed 5d. from the till—I am sure he is the person—he had come in the afternoon for two halfpence for a penny, which I gave him.





JAMES CAFFRY
 (police-constable N 153.) I heard a cry of "Stop thief," and saw the prisoner running—I took him to the station—I sent for the witness—she identified him immediately—I found a sixpence and 4d. in copper in his pocket.

Prisoner's Defence. I went for half an ounce of tobacco, and the woman came out and laid hold of me; I was knocking the halfpence on the counter; the took hold of me; my hand was not in the till.





JOHN BOISSON
. I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 15.—


Transported for Seven Years.

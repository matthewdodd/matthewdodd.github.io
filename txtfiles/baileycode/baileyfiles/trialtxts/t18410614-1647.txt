ELIZABETH PITT
. I am a widow, and keep a glass shop in Upper Ber-keley-street. About five o'clock in the evening of the 27th of May, the prisoner came to my shop and took a goblet out of a basket that was standing on the rails—he would have run off, but I caught him with it, and gave him in charge—this is my goblet—he did not say any thing.

Prisoner. I did not have it at all—the woman found it on the rails—there was another boy, who ran away. Witness. I am certain the prisoner took it—I knew him by sight before.




GUILTY
.** Aged 12.—


Transported for Seven Years—Convict Ship.

            . On the 31st of December, between 8 and 9 o'clock in the evening, I was going to my stable near Fleet-ditch, I observed the two prisoners going down to the water side with a sack; I saw them come back and look at me several times. I saw them go into a lighter and fill the sack; when they came upon the gunnel of the lighter, I said, who is there? They did not speak; they were about to bring them to shore with a rope; then I asked a second time, who was there?

             answered me, and said, he hoped I'd forgive him. I took them part of the way to the prosecutor who owns the coals, then Lamb Jones made his escape, but he was taken again and brought back.

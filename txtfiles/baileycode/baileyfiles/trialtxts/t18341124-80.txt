WILLIAM CLARKE
 and 




JOHN BROWN
 were indicted for

 stealing, on the 
24th of October, 1 handkerchief, value 2s.; the goods of 



Edward Wigan, from his person.






GEORGE GALL
. On the 24th of October, I was at the end of Lombard-street, and saw the two prisoners and another—I saw Brown take the handkerchief from the prosecutor's pocket—he let it fall because I seized him—Clarke was walking five or six yards behind him—the other, who was close by Brown, escaped—the officer came up, and I sent him after Clarke—I had seen Clarke speak to Brown not a minute before, and they had all three been following another person, which induced me to watch them.





EDWARD WIGAN
. I was walking in Fenchurch-street—Gall touched me on the shoulder, and I missed my handkerchief—I ran, and saw the officer with it in his hand—this is it.





PHILIP PARISH
. I saw Brown take the handkerchief—I took it up and followed Clarke, who ran down the road—I took him.

Clarke's Defence. I was walking up Fish-street-hill—there was a great mob of people—I ran across the road, and the officer took me—I asked him what for—he said, "Come with me, and I will tell you"—they took me to the corner of the street, and said they had seen me with this other boy.

Brown's Defence. I picked up the handkerchief at the corner.
(David Pemberton, of Clifton-street, and Thomas Bevil, gave Brown a good character.)

            . The two prisoners and I robbed the prosecutor's house one night between 7 and 8 o'clock, about two months ago; the door went with a pulley into an entry, the people were backwards; Casey went in and handed the things out, a coat, a pair of sheets, a blue duffil coat, a pair of half mourning breeches, and a black cardinal; we took them to Saltpetre-bank, and gave them to a Jew to sell, and he gave them to another Jew a barber; they were sold, and we had 23 s. for our part.

             came and said. I have some clothes to sell for them three young fellows; I went with the things to one Jacobs, who is absconded, and sold them to him, and brought the young fellows the money, that was paid at the Three Pigeons; there was a callimanco gown, a pair of sheets, a blue coat, and a black cardinal; they came down again with a pair of breeches, and got me apprehended; (some of the things produced, the prosecutor deposed to the blue coat.)

            . I serve this gentlewoman the prosecutrix with milk. On the 7th of December in the morning, between eight and nine, I observed the prisoner at the bar about 40 yards from her house, with something black rolled up in a little bundle under his arm; he pulled out a red and white silk handkerchief and wrapt it up, and went away very carelessly towards Saltpetre-bank; in a very short time I came to her door, they had missed the sack, and I told her what I had seen; she desired I would go with her servant to Saltpetre-bank, there the prisoner was playing at toss-up; as soon as he saw me he slinked away.

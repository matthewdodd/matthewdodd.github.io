                  , from his person
            .
NICHOLAS SCOTT. On the 26th of December, at night, I was in Warren-street, Tottenham-court-road


 - my neck handkerchief was not tied, but hung loosely round my neck - Davis came up, snatched it off my neck, and gave it to Shaw; one ran towards Tottenham-court-road, and the other towards Hertford-street; I followed, took Davis, and gave him to the watchman; I had been drinking, but was not drunk. I had been in a public-house, and three of us had a glass of rum and water.

            . I was at the watch-house; Scott brought Davis in - I thought Scott rather the worse for liquor, but I was not acquainted with his manner - he said Davis had taken his handkerchief, and had given it to another man, whom he should know; Davis said he knew nothing about it: I took Davis to High-street next day, and there he said that Stoney (meaning Shaw) had got it; I took Shaw next day - Scott said he was the person. - Scott did not stagger, but he talked a broken sort of French - he said afterwards that when he got a drop he talked in that way - he is a native of France.
Two witnesses gave Davis a good character.

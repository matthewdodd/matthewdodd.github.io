                  Chapman 
               



            . I live in Little Wyld-street, Lincoln's-inn-fields


. On the 10th of this instant at night my wife was in bed, there was a knock at my door; I went with a candle in my hand, in a candlestick; I opened it; the two prisoners rushed in; Blessett came foremost into my parlour, the other was following him; Blessett clapped a pistol to my breast, and said, deliver, or you are a dead man; I had a scuffle with him, and my candle went out; I called for assistance, and 
               
                  William 
                  Brown 
               



            , who lately came from the East-Indies, happened not to be in bed, he came down; I had wrenched the pistol from Blessett's hand, and had him by the collar; Massey came in with this large stick in his hand (produced in court;) he cried to the other, down with him, down with him; we secured them and got other assistance, and sent them to Covent-garden Round-house; I believe Blessett had been in my shop that day three times.
Q. Was any thing taken from you?
Chapman. No.


                  William 
                  Brown 
               



            . I lodge in the prosecutor's house. About a quarter before eleven that night I was not gone to bed, I heard a knock at the door; I heard Mr. Chapman go to the door, and ask who was there; soon after the door was open I heard a noise, and went down; the first person I catched hold of was Massey; I held him by the collar; he attempted to get away, he could not; then he cried for mercy; I got my back towards the door, and we secured them, the candle was then out; (the pistol produced in court;) it was loaded.

                  James 
               



            . I lodge at Mr. Chapman's; I and 
               
                  David 
                  Lewis 
               



             were gone to bed; Mr. Brown came home about a quarter after ten; he was sitting on his bed-side; presently I heard Mr. Chapman call, thieves, thieves; Mr. Brown ran down, and I followed in my shirt; he clapped his back against the door that they could not get out; I saw a pistol in one of their hands.


                  David 
                  Lewis 
               



            . I ran down also; I saw the prisoners first in the passage; 
               
                  David 
                  James 
               



             had secured one, and Mr. 
               
                  Brown
               


             the other; I brought a candle down in my hand; I saw the pistol taken from one of the prisoners.
Blessett's defence.
Mr. Chapman swears I put the pistol to his breast, I had not the pistol in my hand; when we went into his house, we had no intention to rob or hurt him.
For the prisoners.

            . I have known Blessett some years; I looked upon him to be a very good apprentice; his master desired I would go with the lad to Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            ; when examined there the prosecutor said, he did not understand what was said; he said there was something muttered, but he did not know what, when they came into his house.
Prosecutor. I said to Sir John, Blessett put a pistol to my breast, and said, deliver, or you are a dead man; this evidence came to my house that morning, and brought two or three more with him, and said, I ought not to prosecute them, they were young youths.

            . I have known Massey sixteen or seventeen years; I live within two or three doors of him; I always looked upon him to have a very good character.

            . I have known Blessett above half a year, and Massey two years; I have heard good characters of each; I would trust Massey with any thing in my power.

            . I live in Brewer's-street, Golden square


, and am a hat-maker
. On the 28th of February, early in the morning, my shop was broke, and a pane of glass was broke, and six hats taken out, five old ones and one new one; the prisoner was detected with three of them that same morning.

            . I am a constable. About eight o'clock in the morning, on the 28th of February, I saw the boy at the bar offer several to sell in Lower Thames-street; immediately I was called by a gentleman to detect him; I went and asked him how he came by them: he first said his mother trusted him to sell them; after that he said his mother was dead, and he found them in a dust-hole in Marybone street; I knowing there was no dust-hole there, cross questioned him again; then he told me he and three more broke open a shop in the Hay-market, and they trusted him to sell them in Rosemary-lane, and meet them in St. James's Park to share the money, I took him before Mr. Alderman Cokayne; the Alderman desired me to find out the owner if I could, as I lived that way. I began at Charing-cross, and was soon directed to Mr. Wingfield, by the mark on a hat, it being his mark. I went to his house; he knew the hat, and owned it as soon as he saw it. (Produced and deposed to.)
The prisoner said nothing in his defence.

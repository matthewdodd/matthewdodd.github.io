WILLIAM GARROD. I am a linen-draper

, in partnership with Bennett Sewell; we live in Church-street, Hackney



. We lost a piece of handkerchiefs on the 28th of August, containing eight handkerchiefs, but I was not at home.

                  CODLIN
               



            . I am a headborough. I was passing the prosecutor's shop on the 28th of August, and saw Baker and Langdale come out of the shop; I went in to ascertain if they had lost any thing; I then went to the station-house, and got assistance - we went out, and saw Baker and Langdale together, and Mendos a considerable distance from them; we followed them on to Clapton-pond - Mendos there left them, and ran down a turning; I followed Laugdale, and took him - I found nothing on him; he had a smock-frock on.
Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Was not Mendos a considerable distance behind the other two? A. yes, in the church-yard, but he joined them again near Clapton-pond; they then walked all three abreast - I saw Mendos turn down a turning, and an officer followed him; I took Langdale - I do not know how long Mendos was in my sight.

            . I serve in Messrs. Garrod and Sewell's shop; Langdale and Baker came in between eleven and twelve o'clock on the 28th of August - they wanted to look at some neck handkerchiefs, and I showed them some cotton ones; they would not do - I then showed them silk ones; they bought one, and paid 4s. for it - as they were leaving the shop they said if it would wash well they would be good customers; I did not miss any thing till the piece of handkerchiefs was brought back - Lang dale had a smock-frock on in the shop.


                  WILLIAM 
                  UNDERWOOD
               



            . I went up Clapton, and apprehended the three prisoners, within one hundred yards of each other; I saw Baker searched at the station, and eight handkerchiefs found on him.

                  HAMMOND
               



            . I am a Police-officer. I was on duty, and saw Mendos go down a turning; I saw my brother officer take Baker - he gave me information that there was another in a flannel jacket; I recollected I had seen Mendos with such a one, and I went and took him - I saw him throw a piece of handkerchiefs over a garden, but they are not this prosecutor's.


                  HENRY 
                  COWDRAY
               



            . I took Baker, and found these eight silk handkerchiefs on him.
WILLIAM GARROD. These have my mark in my own writing; this other one is the one they bought.
HENRY COWDRAY. I found that one on Baker.
Langdale's Defence. I met Baker as I was standing near Bishopsgate-church - he went and bought a handkerchief, and then did not like it - it was not good enough for him; he went and bought that silk one: we went on through the church-yard - I was reading a tomb-stone, and lost sight of him; I walked on, and overtook him.
Baker's Defence. I was passing Bishopsgate-church, and saw Langdale - I said I could get him a situation; I called at Mr. Sexton's, and bought a handkerchief; it did not seem fit for the neck - I went on the Hackney, and bought a silk one, at the prosecutor's, for 4s.; I went on through the church-yard, and a quarter of a mile before we got to Clapton, a man was selling some handkerchiefs; I asked if he had any more - he said he had, and showed me these, which I gave 25s. for.
WILLIAM CODLIN. They ran into the church-yard, but in the road they walked very fast.

            . Langdale and Baker came into our shop; Baker bought the handkerchief, but Langdale was near him - they were in the shop about five minutes.

            . I am apprentice to Mr. Humphrey Sexton, a linen-draper
, of the Hackney-road



. On the 28th of August I saw Langdale and Baker in his shop, about a quarter before eleven o'clock; Baker paid for a silk handkerchief, but both bargained for it - they were close together, and were there about five minutes; they looked at some other handkerchiefs - I did not miss any, but at half-past one o'clock the officer came in, and brought these handkerchiefs, which I had seen in our shop; they have our mark on them, and I missed articles of this description.

            . I saw the three prisoners together; I took Langdale, but found nothing on him.

                  UNDERWOOD
               



            . I was with Codlin, and saw the three prisoners at the watch-house.

                  HAMMOND
               



            . I saw Mendos turn down a turning, and throw these handkerchiefs over into a yard; I knocked at the door, and asked the person to give it to me; I thought it was but one, but it was this parcel of handkerchiefs - I saw the person pick it up.
Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Is that person here? A. No; I saw Baker and Langdale - they did not turn the corner with Mendos; I had seen Baker pass that turning, whether Langdale had or not I do not know - I should think Sexton lives a mile and a half or two miles from where I took Mendos.
Langdale' Defence. I went with Baker, but did not know he had any thing; I missed Baker, but saw him again at the other end of the church-yard - I then went and asked Mendos the way to Shoreditch church.
Baker's Defence. I went and bought a handkerchief; how Mendos came in possession of these I cannot say - I never saw him before.

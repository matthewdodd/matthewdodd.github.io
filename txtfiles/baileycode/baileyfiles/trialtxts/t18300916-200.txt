WILLIAM VARRELL. I am a journeyman baker
. On the 26th of August these articles were together in a little drawer; my wife kept the key of it - the prisoner is my wife's brother - I cannot tell when they were taken, but on the 26th of August I found the spectacle-case, and thiscornelian stone; the other articles I have not found - I had seen them all safe a fortnight before - they were all kept together - the prisoner said he was innocent - he said he found the spectacle-case under Temple-bar.

            . I have nothing to add to my husband's evidence, but the things were kept together.

            . I took up the prisoner - he said he was innocent of the crime, so help him God - I found these things on him at the watch-house - he denied all knowledge of them; the prosecutor was by at the time.(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner. I leave it to the mercy of the Jury.

HENRY EDWARD LEE
. I am a student at Oxford. On the 15th of April, about a quarter before eleven o'clock, I was walking with my father in St. Giles's—I heard a cry of "Stop thief," and saw some person run—I did not see the prisoner till I got to Bow-street, but Mr. Pitcairn told me what had happened—I saw my handkerchief at the station-house—this is it—(locking at it)





JAMES PITCAIRN
. I am in the employ of Mr. Robert Stevens. I was about ten yards behind the prosecutor and his father—I saw the prisoner near the gentlemen, and immediately after I saw a white handkerchief in

his band—I caught hold of him, and he pulled the handkerchief one of his Pocket threw it on the ground, and ran down an alley—I called "Stop thief," and ran after him, and took him—two policemen came up, and I handed him to them.

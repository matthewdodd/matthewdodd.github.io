            . I am shopman to Mr. Dickenson, of Limehouse. I have a whittle which the prisoner brought about twelve o'clock, on the 2d of October; I advanced 2 s. on it - the prosecutor's girl was in the shop at the time, and said her mother had lost a whittle; I ranout after him about three hundred yards, and saw him dividing the money with a man. I took them both, and called some person to assist me; the man got away, but I gave a description of his person, and he was taken the same evening.

Prisoner's Defence. I was coming along the street, and the man said he would give me three-pence to pawn the whittle. I went and I took the duplicate and the money to him, and he gave me three-pence; they let the man go, and would not let me speak a word.

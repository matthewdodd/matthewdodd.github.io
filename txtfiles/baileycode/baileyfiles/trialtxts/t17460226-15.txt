               stealing a Copper Funnel, value 10 s.
             the Property of 
               
                  
                     John 
                     Lowrey 
                  




                
            , of Westminster .
Lowrey . I lost a large Copper Funnel between the Hours of Seven and Two.
Q. Where did you find it?
Lowrey. At a Broker's in Moorfields.
Q. Who first inform'd you where this Funnel was?
Lowrey. The Broker, my Lord.
Q. What is the Broker's Name?
Lowrey. 
               
                  David 
                  Carter 
               



            .


                  Q. 
               


            (to 
               
                  David 
                  Carter 
               



            ) Are you the Broker?
Carter. Yes.
Q. What have you to say touching the Matter now in Question?
Carter. My Lord. Upon the 9th of February, between Eight and Nine o'Clock in the Morning, 
               
                  Robert 
                  Wilson 
               



            , the Prisoner at the Bar, brought to me a large Copper Funnel .
Q. To what Purpose did he bring it to you?
Carter. To sell, my Lord. He ask'd me 14 d. the Pound for it. I ask'd him what it was. He said it was the Head of a large Furnace. I ask'd him what he was, and he said, a Distiller. I said it was very odd, that you should be a Distiller, and ignorant what it was. My Lord, he told me that he liv'd at Henly upon Thames, that he was a Distiller, had come to Misfortunes, and must sell it. So when I question'd him about it, he said, if you don't like it, or don't think that I came honestly by it, I'll leave it, and go fetch a Person to my Character. With that I told him I would not have the Things left, without he said himself. At last, a Gentlewoman, a Widow of a Common-Council-Man of our Ward, who was some Relation to the Prisoner's Father, desir'd me not to charge an Officer with him. He equivocated in several Shapes. At last, he said, his Wife had bought these Things of a Woman that sold Rags and old Iron. Said I, what do you imagine your Wife might give for it? He insisted upon it, that she might give a Great 2 Pound. He told me his Father liv'd in St. Giles's, and also his Brother. They directed me to the Prisoner's House, but his Wife deny'd him. I went in the Broad-Way, Westminster. I ask'd there, if there were not several Gentlemen that keep Distiller's Shops thereabouts. Pray do you know any one in particular, I said. They said, pray what is your Business? This Morning I stopp'd a Copper Funnel, which I imagine was some Gentleman's Property hereabouts, because the Person lives hereabouts that brought it. Upon this we went to a Person of the Business, Mr. Lowrey; and it appear'd that he was the Person that had lost the Funnel. Upon that we charg'd the Constable with the Prisoner. From that we went before the Justice and he was committed upon a Suspicion, because then Mr. Lowrey had not seen it. The next Day Mr. Lowrey came to me to see the Funnel, and swore it was his.


                  Q. 
               


            (to Lowrey) Look upon that Funnel: Is it yours?
Lowrey. Yes. This is what I lost the 4th of February.


                  Q. 
               


            (to the Broker) Is that what you stopp'd?
Broker. It is what I stopp'd.
Council for the Prisoner. My Lord please to observe that any Confession the Woman may make, must be against herself , it wont do against the other. He is charg'd in the Indictment with being the Principal .
Carter. He confess'd before the Justice that he gave a Groat a Pound for it .
Q. Did he confess he stood by when it was stole?
Carter . No.


                  Q. 
               


            (to the Broker ) Who brought the Copper to you?
Broker . The Prisoner brought it to me.


                  Q. 
               


            (to the Prisoner ) What have you to say?
Prisoner, This Man, when I came to bring the Funnel , stopp'd me: I emptied it out of my Sack, and they desir'd me to sit down by the Fire, and I sat down. They brought a parcel of People into the House, and stopp'd me and frighted me. They ask'd me whether I had any Money in my Pocket. But the Broker said, he would stop me with it, but not charge me with the Constable, and wanted me to run away. I sent to my Father to Broad St. Giles's ; and when my Brother came, he made him Pay 6 d. for sending his own Boy. The Broker told me I had a pretty deal of Impudence to ask 10 d. the Pound for it .
Council for the Prisoner . I'll only mention this, that if this Man had been conscious he had committed the Felony, 'tis certain he might have made his Escape.
Barthia Whitefield . I went to Mr. Wilson's, the Prisoner; he said to me, don't you never light on no Copper Pots, no distilling Things, I can see them lie about in Shops. The first Thing I ever took was two Funnels, and he bought them of me. About a Fortnight after, I took this large Funnel. I was in Company with him at the Time I took it. He said, the Shop is clear, you may now take it. He receiv'd it of me, and gave me 3 d. the Pound for it.


                  Q.

            ) Do you know any Thing of taking up Barthia Whitefield at the Bar? What do you know of it?
Clarke. I had a Crown Reward to take her.
Q. Where was Wilson all this while?


                  Clarke 
                  In 
               



             the Gatehouse.
Q. Had you some Reward for taking of her up?
Clarke. Yes. Of Wilson's Spouse. She said, if you can catch her, I will give you a Crown.
It was answer'd Whitefield had never absconded at all.

                  Sarah 
                  Smith 
               



            ) You are call'd upon to the Character of the Prisoner at the Bar: Do you know any Thing of him?
Smith. Yes, I know him and his Father. I believe him to be a very honest Person.
In order to set this Matter in a clearer Light, we shall give the Close of his Lordship's Charge to the Jury. Gentlemen, you are to put the whole Matter together. The Evidence seems to lie pretty strong against Wilson. His having stolen the Goods in Possession, carrying them about in a suspicious Manner, as I find he was found in three different Stories, these are strong presumptive Evidences of Guilt. What he has to take off that Presumption was, that he was instrumental in apprehending of Barthia Whitefield; if you would make any Use of her Evidence, it must be taken together : That is, that she did steal it, but that Wilson was present at the Time that she took it.
Both 

               Guilty
            .
Wilson to be 



               transported
             for 14 years, and the Girl for seven.

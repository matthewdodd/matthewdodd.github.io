. On Saturday last I was in James-street, Covent-garden


, between three and four o'clock in the day; I had a snuff-box in my left-hand coat pocket - I was walking with a friend, and a witness came after us, holding the prisoner by the collar, and asked if we had lost any thing; I felt, and missed my snuff-box - the witness desired the prisoner to take what he had out of his pocket, and he took out my snuff-box from his right-hand pocket.(Property produced and sworn to.)

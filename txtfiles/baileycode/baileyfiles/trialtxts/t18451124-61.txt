THOMAS MURRELL
. On Saturday night, the 1st of Nov., I was in Vinegar-yard about twelve o'clock—I was returning from the theatre—I felt a tug at my pocket—I looked round and saw the prisoner fling a handkerchief to another boy—the colour was like mine, and I missed mine from my pocket—followed and caught the prisoner—the other boy ran away—I had had my handkerchief safe about ten minutes before.





JOHN KERR
 (police-constable F 85.) I took the prisoner from Mr. Murrell's custody.

Prisoner. I was playing; the gentleman ran after me, and said I picked his pocket; I did not.





JOHN COSTER
 (police-constable G 38.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's conviction at Clerkenwell by the name of John lennon—(read)—Convicted 11th. Feb., 1845, and confined six months, six weeks solitary)—the prisoner is the person, and I have seen him about with pickpocket.




GUILTY
. Aged 14.—


Transported for Ten Years.

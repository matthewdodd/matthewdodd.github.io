. I saw the prisoner bring the three deals out of my timber yard, on the 28th of March; my wife came and asked me if I had sold him the deals; I said, no. I followed him to No. 24, Peter-street, St. James's; he put the deals down in the passage; I took him in custody. These are the deals; I am sure they are mine.

            . I only swear to the gown, [producing it] but here is an evidence who saw it taken upon the prisoner.
Q. What was the prisoner?
Mandavill. She was my servant, and was going away when it was found.


                  Alice 
                  Boone 
               



            . I am one of the prosecutor's family. The prisoner was going away, and as we had missed two or three trifling things, we thought proper to search her box, and upon opening it this gown was found in it. I charged her with taking it, and she owned she took it out of my mistress's drawer.
Q. Was her box lock'd?
A. Boone. It was.
The prisoner had nothing to say in her defence.




               Guilty, 4 s.

             sworn.
I am a pawnbroker; I have got two counterpanes, a handkerchief, a black sattin waistcoat, a pair of drawers, a blanket, a bolster, two pillows, and a sattin petticoat; they were pawned on Saturday the 21st of July; I believe the early part of the day; I remember the circumstance of taking them in, they were put in distinct pledges, they were pledged in the name of

            , but I cannot say that is the man from the distance of time.
Prisoner. The fact is I keep this house, and I have pawned these goods with them gentlemen; this good woman was turned out of her house in Mary-le-bone some time before this happened, through keeping a bad house; Mrs. Rivers being my landlady, begged me to let her have a room in my house, accordingly I agreed to it; Saturday the 21st of July she came to me, and asked me to help her to move these things into the lodging, she told me if I would go and help her in with the things she would pay me; a fellow workman called on me expecting I would go to work, but I did not; in the midst of it she told me that she was distressed for a little money to make up her rent, and that her landlady had told her that she would cartainly seize the things if she did not make up the money, and she asked me to go and pawn these things; accordingly I told her I would, and I went to these places, I carried the things that she gave me, I went out once and after I came back, she told me that was not enough, and she desired me to go again, I went the second time, and when I came back I gave her the money and the duplicates, before my fellow workman; the Monday following I went into the country to the harvest, this woman never said a word to me good, bad nor indifferent. I found on Sunday that she came with three women of the town and abused my wife very much; on Monday morning I spoke to her and she said she had got a drop in her head, and did not know what she said; Monday evening I met her and she told me she had got a warrant against me; I told her she had no right to have a warrant against me; she did not say any thing to me, good, bad or indifferent; and when I was in the country she turned my wife away, and never let her come into the house any more.
Watts. At the same time the person pawned these things in the name of 
               
                  Nicholas
                   Hughes
               



             there was also a silk cloak pawned in the same name, which the prosecutrix came and redeemed herself; she redeemed it about three months ago; she paid the money that it was put in for, and said she would take out all the rest by degrees; she did tell me she had been robbed of it.

                   GORDON
               



             sworn.
I have known the prisoner at the bar for some years back, he worked along with me; this Saturday morning that the woman has been speaking of, he stayed away and did not go to work; he was moving in goods for this woman into his own house, and I lent him a hand down with two or three stoves into the kitchen for her; I see her give him a bundle, I know there was in it two gowns and a black cloak, and he went out and brought in some money and duplicates. I think it was the 19th or 20th of July, it was a Saturday. She told him to pawn the things, I waited till such time as the man came back again, and he gave her some gold and silver and duplicates, and they wanted me to go out and bring in some gin; there was some gin got, a shilling worth, and we drank together, and she had the money the things produced herself, and the first time he came back she said that was not enough; she sent him out the second time with another bundle, and she was very well satisfied at both times.
Q Had you more gin when he returned the second time? - Indeed we had; the gentlewoman had almost a pint mug full of gin when I came into the place.
Court to Mrs. Norrie. Is that true or false what this man has sworn? - I never saw him with my eyes before; I never saw his face in my life time before.

Q I want to know whether on that day you charge this robbery to have been committed, any man was in your company drinking gin with the money that was got from pawning these articles? - No.
Q. Do you remember any time sending any body to pawn these clothes? - No.
Q. Do you insist upon it on your oath? - I do.
Court to Gordon. Do you mean to say upon your oath that that fact passed? - I do.
The prisoner called four witnesses to his character.
Mr. Hosty to Watts. You say these things were pawned with you the early part of the day? - Yes, before dinner time.
Q. What do you call dinner time? - Before two o'clock, but I am not very exact in the day.
Q. How soon were they found at your house after they were pawned? - I think she made an enquiry on Monday.
Court. This woman swore positively that she went out at half after three o'clock, and then all the things were safe; do you think they were pawned before that time? - I firmly believe they were; I believe they were pawned before two o'clock.
Q You are now stating a transaction that happened ten months ago; what reason have you to induce you to suppose it was earlier than the time she speaks? - Because on the Monday when the enquiry was made I had the recollection of it in my mind, that makes me have little or no doubt.
Q. What makes you have little or no doubt, in opposition to this woman's positive oath, or what is the ground of your belief that they must have been pawned earlier? - I recollect being very particular in taking them in, he told me he was a housekeper, and that I might go and see or send.

SARAH HOLLOWAY. I am a widow. The prisoner hired a room in my house on the 22d of December; she left on the 1st of March without giving any notice - these articles were a part of the furniture which were let to her - I missed some of them before she went, and asked the man she cohabited with about them - the prisoner then came into the room and struck me - she said she would not mind two years' imprisonment to have her will of me.(Property produced and sworn to).

            . I am an officer. I went to Mrs. Holloway's on the 6th of March; I found the prisoner there- we took these five duplicates from her pocket, which relate to this property - I asked her what had become of the coppers and looking-glass - she said Mrs. Holloway should never have them any more - she then flew into the room where the prosecutrix was, and struck her violently, saying she would not mind having two years for it.

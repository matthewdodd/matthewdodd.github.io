WILLIAM WILLIAMS
. I am one of the City-police. On the 21st of October I took the prisoner in charge at the house of Richard Philip High-ham, in Bishopsgate-street—the prisoner was charged with stealing a pair of trowsers, which I produce—he said he had done it through having a quarrel with his mother in the morning—that he had no work, and was determined to do something—he did not deny that they were Mr. High-ham's property—he said they were Mr. Higham's—he is not here—he is a pawnbroker.





JOHN MALLIBAR
. I am a policeman. I heard the alarm of "Stop thief" in Skinner-street, and took the prisoner into custody—I saw him throw the trowsers down just before I collared him.




GUILTY
.* Aged 20.—


Transported for Fourteen Years.

Before Mr. Justice Coltman.

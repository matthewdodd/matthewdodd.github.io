Court. Do you know any thing affecting Tomkins, the prisoner at the bar, of taking these oats and peas, of your own knowledge? - No, only from the accomplice.

I am a leather dresser
, I live at Enfield





: I lost a deer-skin, in February last, I did not know I had lost it, I could not miss a single skin out of so many thousand as I have; I was sent for down to Hertford, where the prisoner, at the bar, who was my apprentice, had pawned the skin.
Court. Are you sure it was your own skin? - The prisoner told me he took it out the yard.
Court. What is your reason for thinking it is yours? - In the manufacturing of them our men mark them, and I have reason to think these are our marks, every man has his different mark, there are about seventeen or eighteen of them in the whole.
Jury. But there are other people that may mark them the same? - Yes.
Court. What could induce the prisoner to send for you to Hertford to give you this information? - He did not send for me, the gaoler sent for me, he was taken up about this skin; he had run away from me on the Sunday, and it was either Thursday, or Friday that I was sent for, and when I came there, I asked him, if this was not such a man's making, he said yes; I made him no promises; he took it to a pawnbroker's, at Bishop's Stopford, and was stopped there, then they sent to me.
Prisoner's Council. You say it is impossible to swear to these skins? - I should think so.
It is marked as your workmen generally mark them? - Yes.
You have many thousands? - Yes.
Did you insinuate that you would shew him favour, or any thing of that sort? - No.
Court. Were any threats made use of? - No, I never promised him any thing, I was very sorry to see him there I told him.
Is that the same skin that was produced to you at Hertford? - Yes.
Prisoner's Council. Did he ever carry any of these skins out for you? - No.

             sworn.
I live at Enfield, I worked for the prosecutor, I am of no business at all; the day that he took the skin, was a Sunday, as he told me, I do not know that he took it otherwise; the prisoner and me went to Stopford the Monday after, and the prisoner went to ask his master for his money, and after his master went to church, he told me he took the skin, and carried it to his aunt's.
Court. Did he say what he took the skin for? - No, we went to Stopford on the Monday about five, we went to the Red Cow, and had three pots of beer, and some bread and cheese, and slept there all night, and on Tuesday we went and pawned the skin for 4 s. and a handkerchief, then we went to the Red Cow again, and stopped there till Wednesday morning, when we were taken up.
Prisoner's Council. You received three guineas from the last prosecutor, Berner, did not you? - I never received any.
Prisoner's Council to Greenwood. The confession was before the justice, I submit that confession will not be received by the Court, unless it was in writing.
Court. If it was taken in writing, then I would not receive the parole evidence.
PRISONER's DEFENCE.
I have nothing to say, but that I am quite innocent.
(The prisoner called five witnesses, who gave him a good character.)
Prisoner, Sir, my master cannot give me a bad character if he speaks the truth of me.
Prisoner's Council. How has this young man behaved during his servitude? - Very well.
Court to Jury. Gentlemen of the Jury, you will in such a case as this incline to the favourable side of the question.

                   BERNER
               



             the younger sworn.
On the 6th of February last, in the night, the prisoner Tomkins and Whitebread went into a wheat granary of mine, and from thence took nine sacks of wheat.
Court. How do you know that the prisoner broke into your house? - The watchman saw the prisoner.
Court. He is here I suppose? - No, he has absconded.
Court. Is there any thing that you know, that induces you to suspect the prisoner? - I found the wheat in the house of 
               
                  John
                   Wells
               



            , between the roof and the cieling, on the 14th, in a lane adjoining to his house, it was an empty place on purpose to conceal any kind of goods, I saw no other use it was made of, but part of a drag-net, which was stolen from my father; the sacks were mine, they had my name upon them and marks.
Court. What has the finding of sacks by the house of 
               
                  John
                   Well
               



            , to do with the prisoner, how came that to lead you to suspect the prisoner? - From the evidence of one Whitebread an accomplice, who was concerned with the prisoner. Whitebread is here, the prisoner confessed it before the justice, I was present, and my father, when he confessed it.
Now let me hear what passed in your hearing at the Justice's? - It was made mention by Whitebread in what manner they got in; the prisoner owned to the taking the wheat, and conveying it away in wheel barrows, he said, he held open the sacks, while Whitebread put the meal in the sacks, and they then conveyed them away in wheel barrows.
Court. He confessed taking the wheat? - I don't recollect that he said that altogether.
What did he say, be careful to speak nothing but what you do recollect? - I do not mean it.
What did you hear the prisoner say about this matter? - The prisoner said nothing more than this, that he owned to be concerned in taking the wheat.
Was any promises made him, or any threats to induce him to confess? - None at all.
For what purpose did he say he took it? - After Whitebread had given his evidence, which he heard, they were face to face.
Then relate what the prisoner said afterwards? - To the best of my remembrance, he said, he carried a sack or two to the mills, and helped one barrow full or two to the house of 
               
                  John
                   Wells
               



            , who is his uncle.
Court. You heard him say, what you have said yourself? - Yes.
And that was after he heard the account given by Whitebread? - Yes, they were face to face.
Do you know any thing more? - Only the finding the wheat, and removing it from Wells's; the Justice gave me an order to manufacture the wheat.
What became of the sacks? - They are at the mill, there is G. for George and Berner at the end.
When had you seen these sacks at your own mill? - The day before I missed them, they lay in the wheat shop, the sacks lay empty, and the wheat lay loose.
Prisoner's Council. Had you no more sacks than these that contained this wheat, how many sacks had you so marked? - A pretty many.
Do you think all the sacks marked in that manner you have described, are in your possession at this time? - They are never all in my possession, they are in the hands of bakers, and people that I deal with.
You said just now, that you saw these sacks the day before? - Yes.
Do you mean to say, you saw these very sacks in which you found corn? - Yes, these very sacks, because there are particular rags and patches.
You have no other sacks out or at home, I suppose that were mended? - Yes.
What were those particular marks besides the letters? - M. G. I saw that among the rest.
Did they lay one upon another? - No, they all tumbled loose, that lay among the rest.
Did you give Whitebread the evidence any money? - Never.
You did not give him three guineas? - No.

             sworn.
I am Mr. Berner's miller, I know nothing of these sacks before the 14th of February, I never heard they were lost before.
Court. Was you absent? - No otherwise than at meals.
And you never heard of those sacks being lost till the 14th of February? - No, I did not miss them till then.
The place where the sacks lay was open to you? - Yes, on the 14th of February my master came to me and said he had heard where there were some sacks of his wheat, our sacks are coming in and going out in considerable numbers.
Then you do not know, except from what you heard from your master, with regard to these nine sacks? - Between the 6th and 7th they were stolen as I heard, but I do not know of my own knowledge, I was very particular in marking the sacks that I might be certain sure, there were six as I said before.
About what quantity of wheat might there be at the time at your mill? - I take it there might be about sixty or seventy quarters.
Would you have missed such a quantity as thirty bushels out of that? - Sometimes it is to be missed, and sometimes not.
You had not missed any between the 6th and the 14th? - No.
Was you present at the Justice when this man was examined? - No.

                   BERNER
               



            , the elder sworn.
I was present at the Justice's when this man was examined by one Stanstun, Esq; at Hertford, he made confession not only of this stealing the wheat, but likewise of stealing the skin, but there was a stood in the river, and the miller could not work, they had locked the door over night, and they broke in that very night and took the wheat out, they were confronted together, the evidence Whitebread, and the prisoner, the Justice asked the prisoner whether it was so or not, he confessed it, and said yes, he could not deny it by any means, he said yes.

Jury to Berner. Did you hear the prisoner say so? - Yes, upon my oath.
Did you hear him say any thing about putting any thing into the sacks, and helping to wheel them away: did he speak the word, or did he not deny it? - He said yes, he was concerned, he did do it.


                  JOHN
                   WHITEBREAD
               



             sworn.
The night we took the wheat out of Berner's mill, there was a very large flood, me and Tomkins went down to the mills, to 
               
                  John
                   Well
               



            's house, and there we sat up playing cards, and 
               
                  Peter
                   Bellard
               



            , and 
               
                  Mary
                   Wells
               



            ; I and 
               
                  Peter
                   Bellard
               



            , and the prisoner, went to Mr. Berner's mill, the watchman was coming by crying the hour of ten, after he had done, we set the ladder up against the door, then we got in at the window, and went into the wheat shop, and there lay a parcel of empty sacks, and we took nine sacks, and put as much wheat in as we thought we could carry away, and we carried it to a little place at the bottom of Mr. Greenwood's field, then we got a wheel-barrow and wheeled it up, then we put the wheel-barrow in the mill, where we took them from, and went and carried the meal between the cieling and the tiles, in 
               
                  John
                   Wells
               



            's house, we left the wheat there.
Court. How long after was it that you made discovery of this? - It was on the Thursday night that we took it out, and I made the discovery on the Wednesday following, I discovered it to Esquire Dunstan, of Hertford, on the Monday we set off for Stopferd, and were taken up there for pawning a skin, we were taken up upon suspicion of stealing a skin.
Prisoner. I beg that the character of the evidence may be enquired into.
Court. There is no occasion to enquire into his character, for he sufficiently condemns that by the evidence he has given.
PRISONER's DEFENCE.
I am very innocent, I never made any confession, I could not, I was not guilty.
Prisoner's Council. This man has been tried on the indictment before your Lordship came into court, where several respectable persons have given him a good character.
Court to Berner the younger. How came you not to tell your miller any thing about it, nor ask him any thing about it till the 14th? - He remembers hearing the report of the mill being robbed, when I found that sack with that particular mark on it, I remember seeing the sack on the day before.
Court. Then you had not missed the sacks till the 14th? - We missed them, but did not know where they were gone to.
Then why did not you ask the miller about them as soon as you missed them? - I supposed they had been thrown up stairs or shut into the binns filled with wheat.
Then you thought nothing about them till the 14th? - No.
Jury. Have you more millers besides him? - Five or six.
Witham. I did hear the mill was robbed.
Court. Why do you unsay, now you have heard the evidence, what you said before, you said that you had not heard that any sacks had been stolen or missed. - No, I heard that the mill had been robbed on the Sunday morning.
Court. When I asked you so repeatedly that question, why did not you tell me? - I thought you asked me about the sacks.
Court. I do not like this piecing out of evidence, we will take it as it stood at first.

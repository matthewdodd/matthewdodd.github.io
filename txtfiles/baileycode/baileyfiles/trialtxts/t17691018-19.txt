            . Last Saturday night, about eight o'clock, I was knocked down in Hemlock-court


. I had the things mentioned in the indictment in my hand. I er the bundlerfall. The prisoner came from behind me, and took the bundle up and ran away with it. I believe it was him that knocked me down, but being behind me, I could not see him. I called Stop thief! and he was brought back.

            . I was coming out of a public-house, when this boy was crying a man had stole his bundle. I saw the prisoner before me with a bundle under his arm. I ran to him and asked him where he was going with that bundle; he said it was only a joak. I said, Joak or no joak, you shall carry it back. I brought him back to the boy. There was a crowd came about; then I left him. The boy said before the justice the prisoner was the person that knocked him down.
Q. to Burgoine. Did you know the prisoner before?
Burgoine. No, I did not.

            . I had been at the Crooked Billet, in Little Shire-lane. Somebody said, Pray gentlemen come out, a boy has been robbed. I went out and saw the boy standing. The prisoner was brought back. He took and laid the bundle on the boy's head, and said, Come along, come along, I know Mr. Webb very well. I took him by the collar and said, I know Mr. Webb, I'll carry you to him. I took him to his house, and he was not at home. The boy said before the justice he received a violent blow on the side, and he threw the bundle down, and had not power to take it up; and that he believed the prisoner was the person that hit him.
Prisoner's Defence.
I was going through the court; this bundle was lying in the high way: I took it up, and had been some time away. A gentleman came out of a public-house, and said a lad had lost a bundle. I sad, I did not know whether it was his or no. I went and gave it him. He said he had been struck. He said it might be by me; he did not know who it was.
Prosecutor. The boy swore punctually no body followed him up the court but the prisoner, and that it was him that knocked him down.

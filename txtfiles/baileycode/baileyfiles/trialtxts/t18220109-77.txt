            . I drive the Thetford waggon
. On the 2nd of January, I met the prisoner in Whitechapel


; I had seen her in the street twice before; she took me into a dark street, into a room. I sat down a few minutes. I had a purse, containing twenty-six sovereigns, one 5 l. Suffolk, and three 1 l. bank notes - my purse was in my right hand breeches pocket - I felt her pull it out of my pocket; she ran out of the room. I pursued her - she got away. We had only been ten minutes in the room. I was rather in liquor. I described her to the watchmen - and am certain of her.

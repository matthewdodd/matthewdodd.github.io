                  , from his person
            .
EDWARD HOWE. On the 30th of June I was passing along Great Queen-street, Lincoln's-inn-fields


, when Phillips caught hold of me, and asked if my pocket had not been picked; I then felt and missed my handkerchief, went back, and found the prisoner in custody, with it.

            . I saw a lad take a handkerchief from the prosecutor's pocket, by Great Queen-street chapel - there were three of them together - he gave it to the prisoner. I followed them some distance before they took it - one walked close behind Mr. Howe, and then two behind him - the other two went up the street, and the prisoner down the yard - I followed and took him with it under his coat.

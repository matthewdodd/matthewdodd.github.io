, they are linen-drapers

: Last Friday, about half past four. I stood with my back to the door, and there were two chairs, with pieces of print on them, two or three paces in the shop; I accidentally turned my head, and saw the prisoner had them grasped in his hand, and skulking out of the shop door; I called, holloa, and he dropped the prints, and ran away, and I after him; he had got them off, and then dropped them; I pursued him, he run about ten or a dozen yard's, and then dropped into a walk; I took him back, and am confident he is the same man.
Prisoner. He took hold of me, there were two men running, and, says he to me, I believe you are one; no, says I, I am not of that description, I am a seasaring man; says he, I shall take care of you.

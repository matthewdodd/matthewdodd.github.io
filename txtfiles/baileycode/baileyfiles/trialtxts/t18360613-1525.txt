ELIZABETH SMITH
. I live with my father-in-law, at Twickenham. I had this gown on the hedge, by the side of the house, on the 30th of April—about two o'clock that day I saw the prisoner throw it over the hedge—I asked him how he came by it—he made no answer—I took it in—doors, and called my mother down.





JOSEPH GREEN
. I live opposite the prosecutrix. I saw the gown on the hedge, and saw the prisoner open the gate of the adjoining garden, go up to the hedge, and take the down off—he came out—I watched him some distance, then called to him, and told him to take it back—he went back and threw it over the hedge.

Prisoner. I took it back and gave it to the prosecutrix—I had picked it up off the ground. Witness. No; he went into the garden, and took it off the hedge.

Prisoner's Defence. I took it back when he called to me, and in a few days I came home, and was taken.




GUILTY
. Aged 16—


Transported for Seven Years.

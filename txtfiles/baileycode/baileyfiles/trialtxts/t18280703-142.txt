. On the 13th of June, I had just hung up this coat, when a man cried out, "There he goes - he has got something;" I pursued the prisoner, and when I got near him I saw it was the coat which I had hung outside the window; he dropped it - I took it up; I lost sight of him, but I believe the prisoner is the man.

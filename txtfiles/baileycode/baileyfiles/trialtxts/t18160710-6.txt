JAMES M'ANDEL. On the 13th of June, which was the Anniversary Day, on which the charity children go to St. Paul's


, I lost my handkerchief; it was about a quarter past three, and I was at the North-gate; there was a considerable crowd there; I felt my handkerchief in the act of being drawn from my pocket; I immediately put my hand to feel, and missed it. I turned round immediately, and seeing the prisoner fall back, I accused him of stealing it; an officer was in the crowd, who unbuttoned the prisoner's coat, and the handkerchief was in his breast pocket.

            . I had lost a great many tin-burners out of lamps, from the stair-cases in the inns of court, and since this man at the bar has been taken into custody I have not lost any.


                  James 
                  Love 
               



            . I have lost a great number of tin-burners from the inns of court. A person call'd upon me to know if I had lost one out of Barnard's-Inn


. My servant, that has the care of them, said we had. He was shew'd one, and swore that was the same that was lost from thence.
Q. Why do you charge the prisoner at the bar?
Love. I heard the prisoner confess he stole that, and some that I lost before. There was one of mine, and one of Mr. Hinks's then before him.

                  Derry 
               



            . I think it was the 12th of December when I was in Clifford's-Inn, and saw the prisoner come from one of our stair-cases. I suspected him to be one of those that stole the lamps from the stair-cases, so I took and search'd him, and in his pocket I found two. ( Produced in court.) I asked him where he stole them from. This he said he stole from out of the Temple (holding one in his hand) and the other out of Barnard's-Inn, in Holbourn.


                  Henry 
                  Brown 
               



            . The prisoner was taken on a Sunday night with these two tin-burners here upon him, and this (holding one in his hand) I know to be my master's property.
Q. Who is your master?
Brown. His name is 
               
                  James 
                  Love 
               



            .
Q. to Mr. Hinks. Look upon the other burner, do you know it?
Hinks. That is mine.
Q. How do you know it to be yours?
Hinks. I have progressive numbers upon them, by which I know them.
Q. Do you supply the Temple?
Hinks. I do. This is No. 7, the very same that was missing, that very night, from Fig-Tree Court.
Q. to Brown. Who lights the lamps in Barnard's-Inn ?
Brown. I do. This is No. 13, in that inn.
Prisoner's Defence.
I never took any before them.
For the Prisoner.

            . I have known the prisoner upwards of ten years.
Q. What is his general character?
S. Maschal. I never knew any ill at all by him.

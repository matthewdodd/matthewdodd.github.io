 at the corner of New-street and Old-street


. On the 6th of October I saw the three prisoners go to the shop - I had seen them before - Hooper and Brown went in, and Leonard stood outside the door - they came out in three or four minutes, and I saw Brown give something to Hooper, which I thought was a bit of pudding, but it must have been the wooden bowl - they then all ran up the street - I am sure the prisoners are the boys.

            . I was sitting opposite, and saw three boys come to the shop - I cannot tell who they were, but I saw they brought a bowl out of the shop - I thought at first it was a piece of pudding.

             (police-constable C 224.) I took the prisoner, but I have not found the bowl.

            . This was my property - it was a bowl inside my till - it might have the appearance of pudding - I had been at the till ten minutes before - it was all secure - there was about 17s. in the bowl.(Hooper put in a written defence, stating that the witness had deposed before the magistrate that they only "believed him to be the boy.")

AGNES CLIFFORD re-examined. Q. Did you say you was seen the prisoners before? A. Yes; I knew their persons very well - I swear that Brown and Hooper were the two that went into the shop, and Brown brought out the bowl.(

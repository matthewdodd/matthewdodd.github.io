ROBERT JONES. I am a boot-maker, and live at Charing-cross. On the 23d of May, about eight o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner running, and a crowd following him, calling Stop thief! he had something under his great coat - I pursued, and he threw out this print - a boy took it up and gave it to me; the prisoner was secured at the same time; I am quite certain it was him who threw it down.
SAMUEL BELCHER. I am a linen-draper

, in partnership with William Jones - we live at Charing-cross. This property is ours. I was standing behind my counter about eight o'clock in the evening, and a person called out that a man had run away with a print; I went out and endeavoured to pursue, but I fell down in the street, and lost sight of him; I cannot say whether the prisoner is the man - he was brought back in about five minutes; the print had been just inside the shop, by reaching his hand in; I had seen it safe about five minutes before.

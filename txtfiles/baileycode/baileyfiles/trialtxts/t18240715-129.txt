            . I am a stone-mason
, and live in Goswell-street. On Sunday, the 21st of June, about six o'clock, I was passing between Moor-lane and Grub-street


, and felt both my pockets moved: I turned round, and saw my handkerchief falling between the prisoner and another lad; the prisoner said, "It was not me, Sir:" I then appeared to take no notice, but picked it up, and followed them - they walked a little way in company, and then the other one turned to the right, and the prisoner went on till he came to Bowling-alley; I called for assistance, and collared him; he made some resistance, but I took him into a house. There was not a person near me that could have taken it but them.

            . I am an officer. The prosecutor gave me charge of the prisoner - I handcuffed him as he was very violent at first; but he afterwards kneeled down, and said he would not do so again.

ELIZABETH BAILEY
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
1st of March, at 
St. Marylebone, 2 cloaks, value 8l., the goods of 



Letitia Miller in the dwelling-house of 



William George.






LETITIA MILLER
. I am a widow, and live in Castle-street, in the house of William George, in the parish of St. Marylebone. I occupy the second and third floors—on the 1st of March about half-past six o'clock I was going out of one room into another, and saw a woman pass me on the landing of the second floor—I said, "What do you want?"—she made no answer—I repeated my question several times, and followed her down—we have two doors, she slammed one against me, and went out—I ran and called her back—but I fainted away, and do not know any thing more—I had missed two cloaks from the work-room at the top of the house—I had seen them safe, hanging up, about five o'clock—if finished they would be worth 12l. or 13l. I should say they were worth 8l.





GEORGE DENHAM
. I am turn cock to the West Middlesex Water-works. I saw the prosecutrix go up to the prisoner, and catch hold of her, and something chucked over the area—I went to it, and it turned out to be a cloak.





MAJOR ELLIS
 (police-constable D 77.) About half-past six o'clock I saw the prisoner turn the corner of the Castle public-house in Regent-street, she dropped a cloak, and I took her and the cloak.

Prisoner. I did not have it at all, but I saw the policeman with it in is hand as soon as he took me—the lady said, I had it on my arms. Witness I saw her drop this one—I did not see her drop the other.
(Property produced and sworn to.)


Prisoner. It was impossible for me to carry these two large cloaks, for I had a child in my arms.




GUILTY. Aged 29.—Recommended to mercy by the Prosecutrix.



Transported for Life.

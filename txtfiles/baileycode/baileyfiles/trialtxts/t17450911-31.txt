            . I was sent for to one 
               
                  Betty 
                  Withers 
               



             on the behalf of a servant, and in her trunk was this pair of pumps, which are mine.

             came next morning and brought them: I suspected the Prisoner, and went on Sunday the 24th of August in search of him, and found him at his mother's. He had given away my goods for years together. This dozen of soles I found at 
               
                  William 
                  King 
               



            's at Newington; this sack of leather was left with an old gentleman, who told me, the Prisoner left it with him, and when I came to open it, I found every individual to be my property. The Prisoner according to his own information had taken one, two, three, or four pair of shoes a week, and he owned, that a great many of his master's goods were at one 
               
                  William 
                  King 
               



            's at Newington, and several of them were found there; this King has absconded ever since. The Prisoner has lived with me six years, and if he had lived with me another year, he might have ruined me. 

               Guilty

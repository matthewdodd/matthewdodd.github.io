            . I am a footman
. On the 8th of January, between eight and nine o'clock in the evening, I was in Bond-street


, and felt a twitch at my pocket - I turned, and saw the prisoner with my handkerchief in his hand; I seized him - he threw the handkerchief behind him; I took it up, and gave him to an officer - there was another boy rather taller than him in his company.

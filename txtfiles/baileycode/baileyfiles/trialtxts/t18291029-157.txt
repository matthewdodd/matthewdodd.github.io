            . I am the brother of Mary Ann Wyld. She lived as cook in the service of a gentleman to whom the prisoner was gardener; I afterwards saw them living together as husband and wife in Adam-street, Manchester-square; he called my father and mother, father and mother, and me, William - this signature is my sister's writing; I saw her on the 16th of September alive.
Cross-examined. Q. Is there a person of the name of Skilton here? A. I have not seen him; I do not know Catherine Rowe.

                  WILKINSON
               



            . I married the prisoner at Islington



, on the 23rd of April, 1826

; I know his hand-writing - this signature is his; he lived with me till the 28th of last January - I had two children by him; he left them with me - he paid for one of them for three months after he left me; he ill-used me, and pinched and kicked me.
Cross-examined. Q. You parted by mutual consent? A. Yes; we had quarrels - he did not complain of my making use of twenty-two weeks' rent; I was obliged to pawn some articles from necessity, but not the furniture - we each took one child; the person with whom he placed one child gave it up, because the payment was not kept up after the first four months.
COURT. Q. What were you before you married? A. I was servant to Mrs. Wall, of Hoxton-square - I had been there ten months; the prisoner courted me twelve months and twenty days - he represented himself as a single man; he never told me he had been married - I accused him of it, but he denied it; he was gardener to a gentleman at Upper Clapton; I had no fortune.
Prisoner's Defence. The witness has sworne false.

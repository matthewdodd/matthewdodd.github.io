            . I am a watchman. On the 4th of November, I was crossing the end of Beaufort-buildings, Strand


, and saw Mr. Barlow - the prisoner, who was alone, took this handkerchief from his coat-pocket - he started to go down the buildings; I caught him in my arms, and sent another watchman after Mr. Barlow - he knocked my hat off - I told Rickhuss to see if he had not thrown it down.
PHILIP BOCKET BARLOW. I was in the Strand, and had this handkerchief in my coat-pocket - I did not feel it taken, but was called back, and found the prisoner in custody with it - my pocket had been attempted two minutes before by somebody.

            . I am a watchman. I saw the prisoner take a handkerchief from one of these gentlemen - Rantmore caught him, and sent me after the gentleman; he then told me to look and pick up his hat - I found the hat and handkerchief in the street - the prisoner said he was taken short and was running down to the coal yard.

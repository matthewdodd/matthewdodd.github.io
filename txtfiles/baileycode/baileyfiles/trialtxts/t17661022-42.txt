            . I lodged at Mr. Smith's, at Charing-cross


; my husband is a seafaring man
; the prisoner lodged there also; I missed the things mentioned in the indictment on the 22d of September from out of my apartment, at the same time the prisoner absconded; I took her last Friday in Wapping; she had a handkerchief, a shift, a pair of stockings, and a cap of mine on her; some of the things I found at her lodging in Wapping, and she directed me to some pawnbrokers where she had pawned some, by which means I have got most of my things again; (the goods found, produced and deposed to.)
The prisoner said nothing in her defence.

THOMAS BRAND sworn. - I was going home to dinner; I stopped at the corner of Edward-street, and saw the prosecutor stop the prisoner close by the side of me; he told him he had got his coat; he grappled hold of him, and the prisoner tried to get away; I assisted Mr. Solomons in taking him back, and when he got to the door, he took the coat from his left side, and threw it into the passage.
Prisoner's defence. I took the coat down to buy it, and I went to call a young man that had been drinking with me, and this gentleman came out, and said, I had stole it.

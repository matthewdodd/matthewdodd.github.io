RACHEL REYNOLDS
. I am the daughter of Mary Reynolds, who keeps a shop in Hoxton Old-town. On the 1st of January, at half-past eight o'clock in the evening, I was sitting behind the counter—a man stooped, and took up this roll of linen cloth—I ran, and called my brother, who ran after the man, and brought him back—this is my mother's cloth.





SAMUEL REYNOLDS
. I received information, and ran out—I saw the prisoner, with the cloth under his arm—he was stopped, but he had thrown down the cloth then—I am sure he is the man who threw it down—I brought him back, and the officer took him.


Prisoner. I had been seeking for employment, and ran, as I was cold.




GUILTY
.* Aged 19.—


Transported for Seven Years.

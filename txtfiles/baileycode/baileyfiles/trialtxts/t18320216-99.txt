             and his son; they are solicitor
s, and live in Lothbury


. On the evening of the 2nd of February I heard the outer door go about six o'clock - I went down stairs to a place we keep the papers in, but I found no one there; I came up again, and met the prisoner coming out of our right-hand office - she was quite a stranger; I stopped her, and asked what business she had there - she made no answer; I took this paper from her - it is two drafts of a will and some drafts of a deed, which I know are my employers'.
Prisoner. I was in distress.

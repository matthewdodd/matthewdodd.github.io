            , at Stoke Newington


 - my father is dead, and

             married my mother; the prisoner used to keep his books
. He was there on the Sunday before the 4th of November, and I was in the same room with him - Mr. Curvey's desk was in the room; I saw the prisoner take the money out of that desk - he had a handkerchief in his hand, and pretended to wipe his nose; he put the money into his coat pocket; I saw two pieces of money, but I cannot tell whether they were sovereigns or half-sovereigns - he sat down, wrote, then got up, and went away - I saw no more of him.
Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. I believe he is in the habit of coming to your father-in-law's to settle his accounts? A. Yes; the books were kept in the desk - he was in the habit of mending his pens; I know it was not his knife that he had in his hand - the knife laid on the desk - he put up his handkerchief.

            . On Sunday evening, the 31st of October, I was in Mrs. Curvey's room; she was lying-in at the time - I saw 
               
                  Mary 
                  Feruey
               



             come into the room; she said something to her mother, who gave her a box on the ear, but she still persisted in making her complaint.
ANN CURVEY. On the Thursday before the 4th of November, I counted the sovereigns we had, and on the Saturday I was put to bed; there were twenty-one sovereigns and three half-sovereigns - I put them into the secret drawer in the desk in the room we sit in; the prisoner was in the habit of attending to the books. On the Sunday evening (I believe it was between five and six o'clock) my daughter gave me some information - I did not attend to it. but gave her a box on the ear.
Cross-examined. Q. How long has he been in the habit of coming to your house? A. About five years - he is single.

            . I saw my mistress with twenty-two sovereigns and a half on the Thursday before the 4th of November; she counted them in the shop we work in, and then went into the house.

            . There are two drawers in the middle of the desk, and the prisoner took the money from one of them.
Cross-examined. Q. Did he find the desk open? A. Yes.


                  JOHN 
                  CURVEY
               



            . I live at Sandford-lane, Stoke Newington. The prisoner managed my books - I paid him half a guinea a quarter; this transaction took place on the 31st of October - he had applied to me about a fortnight before to lend him some money; he said he wanted two sovereigns, and I agreed to lend it him - on the Sunday in question, about three o'clock in the afternoon, I met him about the middle of the lane; he asked if I could lend him the two sovereigns he had asked for - I promised to lend it him, and I met him at the Bull public-house that evening, about ten o'clock; I went with him to my own house, and went to the desk - I had at that time one sovereign on my own person; I lent him that, and one other which I took from the desk - I had not taken any money from the desk from the Thursday preceding; the money remained there, for any thing that I know to the contrary - when I took the sovereign from the desk, he said, "You had better lock it, as there is a strange woman in the house." meaning the woman who was attending on my wife; I locked the desk, and he asked me if I knew exactly what I had in it - I said I did not exactly; on the following day my wife gave me information - I counted the money then, and found nineteen sovereigns; the desk had been locked from the time I had the conversation with the prisoner -I informed Brown, the officer, and he brought the prisoner. who was taken to the watch-house and then to Worship-street; he there asked me to take the girl into a private room, and said sooner than come under the scandal of being published in the newspapers, he would pay me the money, and he would rather I should keep the girl from going into the office.
Cross-examined. Q. How long had he been in your employ? A. About fifteen months; I said I did not wish to prosecute him, but I did not say there was any mistake - I firmly believe there is none.

                  BROWN
               



            . I am an officer. I took the prisoner - he denied the charge.
JURY. Q. Was there any money found on him? A. Yes, a half-sovereign and some silver.
Prisoner's Defence. I borrowed the two sovereigns; I then went to a place in Park-street - I paid 17s. 6d. out of one of them, and had 2s. 6d. left; when the officer came to me, he said, "Harry, you are my prisoner, I come from Mr. Curvey, who says you have taken 50s. from him;" I said I had borrowed two sovereigns, and I would go and explain it to him - we went down, and when we had had some talk, Mr. Curvey said, "You may as well stop and sleep with me;" Brown said, "No. you can't take him out of my charge" - I thought I would sooner pay the 50s. and have done with it; I called him and said, "Although I never had the money, I would sooner pay it than go before a Magistrate, and I hope you have not mentioned it to any one" - the night before he said he would not mention it; I said I would pay the 2l. at Christmas, and the rest at Lady-day - he said he would agree to that if I could get the signature of my master; I said I could not - while we were talking the officer came, and we were taken in; the child said she saw something in my hand glittering, and I had put it into my outside coat pocket, with the handkerchief and all - on the second day there was a regular tale made up, which plainly shows the child must have been tutored by some one, namely that I took the front of the desk down, and poured the money into my handkerchief; I did go to the desk, and take out the books - I had occasion to return for a pen, which I took out of the drawer that had the money in it; when I returned with the prosecutor, he opened the desk and took out two sovereigns - he then said, "Give me the sovereigns back, and take a cheque which I have here for 9l., and bring me the difference;" he looked for it, and it was gone - he said,"I dare say she has got it up stairs;" I said, "You had better inquire about it, and you had better lock your desk, any one could come and look over your books" - I said, "Do you know what you have in the other drawer?" he said, "That is all right enough;" I said,"You had better inquire about the cheque" - I then went away; there was 18s. 11d. found on me when I was taken, which was the change of the two sovereigns.

                  CURVEY
               



            . I had the cheque by me, and on the Thursday my wife had changed it, but being ill she had not time to tell me of it.
Prisoner. Q. Have you not lost money out of that drawer before? A. Yes.
JURY. Q. What is the nature of your secret drawer? A. It stands in the middle of the desk, and is eight inches deep; to get the money you must take it quite out, and turn it up - I do not think that could he done under the cover of a handkerchief - it would not make a rattling.
JURY to 
               
                  MARY 
                  FERNEY
               



            . Q. What did the prisoner do? A. I saw him take the money out and put the drawer in again - I did not see any body else go to the desk; the drawer shuts quite up, so that no one could tell whether it was locked or not.


                  JOHN 
                  CURVEY
               



            . My books are kept in it; it is a bureau - the drawers are narrow and deep; the cheque and papers were in another drawer - the prisoner knew how to open these drawers.
Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How do you know that he did - did you see him? A. No, but I had another shop, and I let it, - the prisoner told me to take the money and put into these drawers, to keep it secret from my wife, but I showed it to her the next day.

THOMAS DIAPER. On the 7th of July, between ten and eleven o'clock at night, I was in James-street, Westminster


, the prisoner came up and asked where I was going - I said, home - she pulled me about, I shoved her away several times; and at last missed half a crown out of my right hand breeches pocket; I told her she had it, she denied it, and I gave her in custody.
Prisoner. Q. Did you not give it me - A. No; I gave her nothing; I also missed a shilling, and she pulled it out of her mouth.

            . I am a watchman. Clegg, another watchman, who is now in Ireland, sprung his rattle, I found the prisoner in his custody; she denied having the half-crown, but in Piccadilly she pulled it out of her mouth. Diaper was sober - she did not say he gave it her.
Prisoner's Defence. He gave it me, and then wanted it back. I refused, and he went away, passed two watchmen, and then gave me in charge - he said, If I would return the money he would not give me in charge; I did so, but the watchman made him give me in charge.

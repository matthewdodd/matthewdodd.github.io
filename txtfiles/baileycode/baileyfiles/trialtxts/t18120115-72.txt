            . I live at 231, Tottenham Court Road


, I am a carpet manufacturer
. On the evening of the 23d of December, about six o'clock, I was in the accompting-house with a gentleman, I heard the front door of the warehouse open, conceiving that it was my boy that I expected in, I waited for some little time, expecting that he would come to speak to me, not finding him coming forward, I looked forward and saw the prisoner with a piece of carpet in his hand, going towards the door, I immediately followed him, and came up to him about three doors off, he was running away, and when I came up to him he threw it down; when he threw it down I called out stop thief and ran after him, and by assistance I secured him. I never lost sight of him.
Q. Was the door upon the latch. - A. I cannot say, it might be put to and not upon the latch. This is the carpet, it is mine.
The prisoner said nothing in his defence, nor called any witnesses to his character.

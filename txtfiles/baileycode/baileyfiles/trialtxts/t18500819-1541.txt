Thomas Pollett Jebb: having been before convicted.






THOMAS POLLETT JEBB
. I am a plumber and glazier, of 3, Norfolk-cottages, Greenwich. On 10th Aug., I saw the prisoner at the Red Lion; she said she had had nothing to eat, and I gave her something to drink, and sat with her till half-past ten, when I went home, and she followed me, and went up-stairs with me, and laid on the bed—she would not undress herself—I awoke in the morning, between four and five, and missed my watch and chain from the bedside—I went in search of the prisoner, and found her at the Red Lion—the policeman told her the charge, and she said to a person who was with her, "Hold your own council"—my watch was worth 2l. 10s.

Prisoner. I saw him at the public-house in the evening, and again in the morning; all he states is false; I have a husband and young family. Witness. I cannot be mistaken about the person who went home with me.





JOHN JAMES FRANKLIN
 (policeman, R 353). I apprehended the prisoner at the Red Lion, at ten minutes or a quarter-past five o'clock—I told her the charge—she made no answer—on the way to the station, she told a person named Mary Frampton, who was with her, to keep her own council, and appear silly, and know nothing about it—she was searched, and 8s. 7d. found on her—I believe she is married, and has four children.





JOHN WHITE
 (policeman, R 180). I produce a certificate of the prisoner's conviction—(read—Convicted here July, 1848, and confined four months)—I was present—she is the person.




GUILTY.** Aged 26.—


Transported for Seven Years.

GEORGE TULL
 was indicted

 for embezzlement.


MR. PHILLIPS
conducted the Prosecution.






JOHN ROMILLY, ESQ
. I am a barrister, and reside in Lincoln's-inn. The prisoner was my clerk, and was entrusted to received money from different solicitors, and was to pay it to me immediately he received it—I never gave him authority to sign a discharge in my name—Messrs. Blower and Vizard were clients of mine—on the 25th of April, 1835, they were indebted some fees to me—the prisoner has never accounted to me for 39l. 1s. 8d. as received from them—in consequence of suspicion, I had him taken up.





JOSEPH BLOWER
. I am one of the firm of Blower and Vizard, of Lincoln's-inn. I knew the prisoner as Mr. Romilly's clerk—in April, 1835, he brought me a list of fees due to Mr. Romilly, and I paid him 39l. 18s., and 3l., for himself, included in one cheque, of 42l. 18s., for which he gave me his receipt on account of Mr. Romilly—the cheque has been returned to me by my bankers, as paid.





CHRISTOPHER PARKER
. I am clerk to Dixon and Co., bankers, in Chancery-lane, I paid this cheque to a Mr. Tull, according to my entry in the book—I have seen the prisoner before, and suppose I paid it to him, from the entry in the book.


MR. ROMILLY
re-examined. Then name signed to the paper I have no doubt is the prisoner's handwriting.

Prisoner. I have no doubt the receipt is in my handwriting—I have signed several bills in the way that is signed.




GUILTY

                  Churchman 
               



            . I live in St. Martin's-lane, near Charing-cross




, I am a carpenter and builder
. I had a leaden pump stood at the further end of my yard, about a hundred yards from the front of my house. There was the leaden pipe to it; it was taken away on the first of December last. I suspected some of my men. The prisoner had worked for me about eight or nine months. I took up two of my men, and they proved to be innocent. Then I laid a plan to see who was the guilty person. I laid four brass cocks, particularly marked, and some old sash-weights (which had been locked up in the store room) open on the table in the same room, and bid my foreman to let the men go in, and serve themselves with nails, and what they wanted; and as soon as they were gone, to go in and see if any thing was missing. Soon there was a cock missing, which was taken by 
               
                  John 
                  Keen 
               



            ; but the prisoner was discovered by one 
               
                  Edward 
                  Eagle 
               



             being admitted an evidence against him for stealing ducks and fowls. The prisoner was taken up, and he confessed he took my pump, and sold it for six shillings and sixpence.


                  Charles 
                  Jones 
               



            . I am servant to Mr. Churchman, I missed the pump on the first of December, about seven in the morning. That morning the prisoner was not at work. The prisoner was taken up for another offence about a fortnight after, and in the Gatehouse he confessed, in my hearing, that he took it. I asked him how he could take it away so in a morning, when people were about. He said, if he had happened to have met me, he would have thrown it on my toes, and run away.


                  Mary 
                  Eagle 
               



            . I have known the prisoner (before he was born, I was going to say) but I have ever since he was born: a strange man brought the pump into my room, the day after St. Andrew's-day. I was stick in my bed when it was brought in.
Q. Where do you live?
M. Eagle. I live in Pye-street, Westminster, and go about with earthen-ware.
Q. Are you any relation to the prisoner?
M. Eagle. No.
Q. Did the prisoner come with that strange man?
M. Eagle. No.
Q. Did he come afterwards?
M. Eagle. He did, and took it away; it was something of lead; I do not know whether it was a pump or not: he said afterwards he had much ado to make Mrs. Franklin buy it.
Q. What did he say he sold it for?
M. Eagle. He said he sold it for six shillings.
Prisoner's Defence.
I know nothing of the affair.

(M) He was a second time indicted for 


               stealing 36 ducks, value 10 s.
             the property of

               receiving the same, well knowing them to have been stolen

                  Thomas 
                  Walker 
               



            , Esq; I am a merchant
, and live in Thames street; I have a country-house at Stretham in Surry




, and had there several fine large ducks; I think there was never a one that did not weigh four pounds. On the 10th of December at night my coach-house was broke, and my ducks taken away: there were 36 of them.


                  Edward 
                  Eagle 
               



            . I have known the prisoners at the bar 16 or 17 years: they are father and son. I married the old man's daughter. I have been at sea, but was a brewer's servant. 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Manton 
               



             and I took a walk to Stretham in Surry. We drank at the White Horse on Bristow-causeway, and then went to an alehouse on the other side Stretham. About eleven at night we went to Mr. Walker's house, and the prisoner, with a ripping chissel, purchased two boards off from the backside of Mr. Walker's coach-house, and took out thirty-six ducks.
Q. Did you know of those ducks being there before?
Eagle. We did: we were there about two or three days before.
Q. What was your business there then?
Eagle. We were looking out for such things.
Q. Who took the ducks?
Eagle. I went in first, and he held the bags, and I put them in.
Q. Did you take them away alive or dead?
Eagle. We killed them all there; there were thirty six of them: I took one bag, and he the other, and brought them to Westminster, to his room in John's Street, No. 12. We pluck'd the feathers off, and the old man at the bar took most of them, and sold them.
Q. Did he know which way you came by them?
Eagle. He might very well know that, because he had been out several times with us. We made him sensible where we fetched them from; he said they were very fine ones; he got up, and sell to helping us pull the feathers off; we told him we had been about seven miles for them.
Q. How many had he in his custody?
Eagle. He had them all in his custody. I and the two prisoner went and disposed of six of them to Mrs. Douglass, and two fowls, which we had taken two nights before at a wheeler's shop at Stretham.
Q. Where does she live?
Eagle. She lives in King-street, Westminster, at the King's Arms.
Q. What had you for the six ducks?
Eagle. I believe we had about twelve shillings. She gave us half a guinea, and we had the rest in liquor.
Q. Did you see any of the rest disposed of?
Eagle. No, I did not. The old man allowed us eight pence a-piece for all the rest. He sells fowls about the streets. I heard him say he sold two to Mrs. Price; she lives in Westminster.
Q. to Mr. Walker. In what manner was it that your coach-house was broke open?
Mr. Walker. They had pull'd down two boards, I suppose with a chissel; it was a new coach-house: there appeared the marks of the chissel: my carpenter said he was sure it was done by a workman, that understood it.
Eagle. He took the chissel out of his father's room, it is there now, it has a split handle.


                  Thomas 
                  Manton 
               



            . Did you not come to me in the morning, and ask me to take a walk with you over the water; and say you was afraid of being press'd? So I went with you.
Eagle. I can't say that; but he was always very agreeable to going out.
T. Manton. He used to change his dress; sometimes he was in a brewer's servant's dress, and sometimes like a sailor: he has been cast for transportation once here, and he has broke out of Bridewell with his irons on, and had them knocked off at Sand-hill.
Eagle. I do not think that I am a bit better than he, or he than me; but that is no reason that I should remain so.
T. Manton. To be sure Eagle has a great deal to say for himself more than I have. He once gave evidence against his own brother, then he sent him to Northamptonshire, and gave evidence against two others; then he sent word for me to get out of the way.


                  Richard 
                  Fowler 
               



            . I heard 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Manton 
               



             confess before the justice that he was at the taking other fowls from Mr. Bullock. I saw him and Eagle together that night Mr. Walker was robb'd of his ducks, at Bristow-causeway, in the way to Stretham, at the White Horse.
Q. What time did you see them there?
Fowler. It was between seven and eight o'clock.


                  John 
                  Coger 
               



            . I saw 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Manton 
               



            , and Eagle the evidence, together, at the White Horse on Bristow-causeway, that night.
Q. How far is the White Horse from Mr. Walker's house?
Coger. It is about two miles, or rather more. The next morning, when I heard Mr. Walker had lost his ducks, I suspected Eagle, because he had been about our neighbourhood before in that way.


                  Martha 
                  Douglass 
               



            . I keep a publick-house in King-street, Westminster; the two prisoners and Eagle have been at my house together several times: about three weeks before Christmas, as near as I can guess, I bought six ducks and two fowls of them; I gave them half a guinea, six pots of beer, and a dram a-piece at the bar.
Q. What sort of ducks were they?
M. Douglas. They were tolerable good ducks, pretty large ones, but rather staleish. The old man once was a publican, now he sells fowls about the street.
Q. from T. Manton. Did Eagle never sell you fowls before?
M. Douglass, No.

T. Manton. I was once at this woman's house, when she asked Eagle to give her her sack, which he had about his waist: he told her, if he did deliver it to her, he could never bring her any more fowls.
Mrs. Price. I know the old man at the bar, I bought two ducks of him about three weeks before Christmas.
Q. What did you give him for them?
Mrs. Price. I gave him twenty pence for the two.
Q. What size ducks were they?
Mrs. Price. They were very large ducks. I sent my maid out on an errand, and she came in, and said, Madam, do you want any ducks? He followed her in, and I bought them. I never saw him before; he has called several times since. When my husband came home, I shewed them to him, he thought them too cheap, and desired I would buy no more of him.


                  Thomas 
                  Manton 
               



            's Defence.
I know nothing of what this man ( pointing to Eagle) has said. Ever since he came from sea he has practised this. He has come to me time after time, when I have been at dinner, and I have lent him several shillings; he owes me a great deal of money now. He was once charg'd with stealing fowls at Pimlico, just on his coming from sea; and once before he was cast for transportation for the same offence. I would ask Mr. Walker whether he ev er saw me with Eagle?
Mr. Walker. I never saw them till before justice Fielding, but I had a description of them before.


                  Samuel 
                  Manton 
               



            's Defence.
Mr. Eagle had some ducks, how he came by them I know not; he begg'd I would sell three or four of them, and said he would satisfy me for my trouble. I parted with half a score, and he gave me half a crown.
Both 

               Guilty
            .
See Eagle tried for stealing fowls in company with 
               
                  Edward 
                  Allen 
               



            , from Mrs. Beaumont, at Putney, No 83, 84, in the mayoralty of Mr. Alderman Dickenson.

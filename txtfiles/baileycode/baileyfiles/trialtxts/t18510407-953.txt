EDWARD HOPE



, stealing 25 shillings, and 20 sixpences, the moneys of 



William Holloway: having been before convicted.






MARY POTTER
. I was barmaid at the King's Arms, in Strutton-street. I was in the bar, near six o'clock in the evening, on 10th March—I saw the prisoner come through the parlour, at the back of the bar, and take 2l.-worth of silver off a cabinet in the bar—it was standing up in pounds—he could see me, but I do not suppose he was aware that I saw him—he ran into the tap-room—I followed him, and called Mr. Holloway, and told him of it—the prisoner came out of the tap-room again—he got out of the house, but was caught by the potman—I did not see him again till the policeman brought him—I can't say that I had seen him before—I believe he was sober.





JOB HOLLOWAY
. I live as potman with my brother William Holloway.

I was busy in front of the bar that evening—I saw the prisoner take 2l. worth of silver—he went into the tap-room, my brother went after him—he came out and went outside the door—I went out and took hold of him, but several girls got round me and bit me, and kicked me, and got him away from me—I am sure he is the man—I had seen him about twice before.

Prisoner. I was never in the house but once before in my life.





WILLIAM MILLERMAN
 (policeman, B 95). I took the prisoner—I told him it was for stealing 2l. from the King's Arms, Strutton-ground—he said, "I suppose I shall get a stretch for this"—I found on him 2s. 6d. in silver, and 3d. in copper—he was drunk.

Prisoner's Defence. I had been in the house about four o'clock; a young man got fighting with the potman, and I went to get him out.





GEORGE JACOB POWLEY
 (policeman, B 228). I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction at this Court—(read—Convicted Dec., 1848, and confined six months)—he is the person.




GUILTY
. † Aged 22.—


Tansported for Seven Yeans.

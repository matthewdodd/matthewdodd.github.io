DANIEL WYLES
 and 




WILLIAM ADAMS
 were indicted for

 stealing, on the 
26th of February, 135lbs. of lead, value 8s., the goods of 



William Williams, and fixed to a certain building, against the Statute.






WILLIAM AUSTIN
 (police-constable D 131.) On the 26th of February, I was on duty in East-street, Portman-square, at half-past six o'clock in the morning—Mr. Williams's house is at the corner of East-street—I observed the two prisoners carrying a sack; they both carried it—it appeared heavy—I asked what they had got—they said lead, which a man gave them on the other side of the New-road, and they were going to carry it down the court—they went on to the corner of the court and rested—I thought they were going to stop there, but they went on—I followed them—they said they were going to take it to Gee's-court—they then threw it down, and I took them.





JOSEPH WHITE
. I am a plumber. I was employed to go to the house at the corner of Davies-street and East-street, on Tuesday last, to lay a new gutter—I took up the old lead which remained, and compared it with this found by the officer—I have no doubt it is part of the same, it had very recently been torn off.





WIILIAM WILLIAMS
. I am a wine and spirit merchant. This house is mine, and was empty—I went when the lead was gone, and missed it—the house was locked up, but a bar had been taken from the back, by which persons could get in.

Adams's Defence. We were coming along the New-road, and a man told us to carry it to the corner, of Gee's-court and wait there till he came, and he would pay us.

WYLES—

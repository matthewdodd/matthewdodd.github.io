1923. 




MICHAEL DUNN
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
11th of August, at 
St. Giles in the Fields, 25 yards of kerseymere, value 14l., the goods of 



Caleb Robinson, in his dwelling-house.





CALEB ROBINSON
. I live in Holborn, in the parish of St. Giles in the Fields—I rent the house—the shop is part of my dwelling-house. Aabout ten o'clock in the morning of the 11th of August, I heard an alarm—I went into my shop, and I saw Howell calling me out in a great hurry, saying a man had run out with a piece of cloth—I saw the prisoner with a piece of kerseymere on his shoulder, which is mine—I had seen it safe on the counter, not three minutes before.

Cross-examined by
MR. DOANE. Q. Where did you see the prisoner? A. A few doors off.





WILLIAM HOWELL
. I live in Stonecutter-street, Paddington. About ten o'clock in the morning, I was going down Holborn, and saw the prisoner, with two others, coming up Holborn—they passed me—the prisoner left his companions, looked across the road, and walked into the prosecutor's shop—I went to the shop window—the two others came up and looked me in the face very hard—I then crossed to the other window (it is a double shop) and I saw the prisoner leaning down to the counter, and raising the cloth on his shoulder—he walked out of the shop with it on his shoulder—I immediately gave an alarm, and ran after him—I collared him with it, and gave him to a policeman.





JOHN JAMES BARNARD
 (police-constable G 110.) I was called by Howell—he had the prisoner by the collar—I took the cloth from his shoulder.




GUILTY
. Aged 18—Recommended to mercy by the Prosecutor.


Transported for Life.

First Jury, before Mr. Recorder.

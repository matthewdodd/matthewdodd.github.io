SAMUEL LUCAS
. I am a student, and live in the Temple. I went into a cigar shop in Drury-lane—I took my purse out of my pocket to pay for the

cigars—I had a 10l. note, 5 sovereigns, a half-sovereign, and some silver in it—I did not stay in the shop longer than to buy—I did not smoke them there—I paid 1s. for the cigars—I could not say whether I put my purse into my pocket or not—I then went to the Strand, down Drury-lane, and missed my purse—it has not been found—I did not know the number of the note—Foxcroft has given me the number of it since—I carried my purse in my coattail pocket.

Cross-examined by Mr. BALLANTINE. Q. I believe you had an impression that you had left it on the counter? A. Yes.





JAMES DUNN
 (police-constable F 20.) I was on duty in Drury-lane on the evening of the 26th of Feb.—I saw the prosecutor walking down Drury-lane, and the two prisoners after him—I knew them by sight, and had seen then together before—I followed them down Drury-lane—when the prosecutor came to the corner of Princes-street, he crossed the road—Stack followed close behind, with Foxcroft—after I crossed the road I saw Stack put his hand into the prosecutor's pocket, and pull his hand out closed, he turned round—I faced him—he ran away—I ran after him, and fell down at the corner of the street.

Cross-examined. Q. When did you see him again? A. At Bow-street. I was porter to King's College Hospital—Stack had a hat on—I have seen Stack every night in Drury-lane—I have known him for the last two years, but never spoke to him—I saw his face on this occasion—I was going up, and he was coming down.

            . I am a seaman; last Thursday between twelve and one at noon, I saw the man at the bar throw an apron over this piece of copper (producing a part of a boiler which had been taken to pieces) at Bear-key


; he took it up, and walked off with it, and the woman followed him; a porter stopt them, and brought the copper and them back.

            . I am a ticket-porter, I worked the ship out called the Anna, Capt. Brown, from Jamaica, this copper was part of the cargo; a man called and told me a person was gone up the gateway with a piece of copper; I ran up, and met the woman at the bar with the copper in her lap; I took hold of her, she pointed to the man at the bar, and said that is the man that stole it, and gave it to me; then I brought them both to the key, and charged a constable with them; they were taken before an Alderman, and committed.
Young's defence.
I took the thing up, and it was taken from me and given to this woman, and put into her lap

There was another woman with Young, he told me he would give me two or three half-pence if I would carry it for him.

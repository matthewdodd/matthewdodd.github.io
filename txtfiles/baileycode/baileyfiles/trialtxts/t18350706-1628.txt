JOSEPH BLACKWELL
. I am warehouseman to John Besemears and Co. of Houndsditch; we have dealings with Mr. Richard Morley—I did not send Mr. Morley any order, nor write this paper—no one but me and the principals in the house have any right to send orders—this is not their writing—the prisoner was formerly in the employ of Mr. Besemears.





ADAM MURRAY
. I am warehouseman to John and Richard Morley, in Wood-street. On the 27th of June, the prisoner came with an order, for two dozen pair of white cotton stockings—this is the order he brought—(read) "Please to send by bearer, two dozen full-sized men's white cotton stockings, about twenty-two shillings, for John Besemear and Co. 27th of June, 1835"—we have an account with Besemear and Co., and acting on this order, I gave the prisoner the stockings.

Prisoner. I leave myself to the mercy of the Jury.

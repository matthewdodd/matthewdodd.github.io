On the 23d of July last, coming down Long-lane, Smithfield


, I found some person's hand in my pocket, I immediately caught the prisoner fast by the collar, and seized my handkerchief in the prisoner's hand, it was between nine and ten at night, I took the handkerchief from him, and cried out murder; I secured the prisoner immediately, and I immediately tore a piece out of the handkerchief, with one of my teeth.
(The handkerchief produced and deposed to.)

I was coming from Fleet-market, and he was catching hold of a man, and he caught hold of me, he had his handkerchief in his hand, he took me to the watch-house, and used me very ill indeed; I am innocent of the affair, I was upon my own business.

            . On the 22d of December, on Sunday, in Service Time, the Prisoner came into my Shop and took out a Jack.
Q. What Time of the Day?
Nichols. Between Eleven and Twelve. There was no Body at all in the Shop, the Door was shut to, and the Prisoner came in. This Gentleman saw him; I was not there.

            . My Brother, Sir, lodges with Mrs. Nichols. On the 22d of December I went up Stairs to speak to him. When I came out of the House, I went over the Way in order to go to Church. I stopp'd at the Church Door to hear a Gentleman's Servant read the Gazette. I observed this Lad (the Prisoner) come out of the Shop with something under his Great Coat; I called to Mrs. Nichols, and asked whether she had lost any Thing. She said a Jack. I run after him almost as far as Christ's Church, and brought him back with the Jack.
Q. What became of the Jack?
Wealy. when he came back he left it in the Shop.
Prisoner. Please you, my Lord, I was coming along Aldersgate-street, and I met with one Wilks, who said, he would give me 3 d. if I would fetch this Jack. And the 'Prentice gave it me. 

               Guilty

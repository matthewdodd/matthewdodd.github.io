             sworn.
I am a barrister
, walking through Fleet-street


, on Monday the 18th of April last, I felt somebody touch my coat pocket, on the left side, I put my hand upon it, and found my handkerchief was gone, at the same time I saw the prisoner about three yards from me running away, I ran after him, and he seeing that, put his hand under his coat, and threw from him a handkerchief, which I picked up immediately, and continued to run after him; the prisoner turned down Water-lane, and went to stand up against the side of a house, when I took him into custody, he said he was coming up Water-lane, and not going down it; I am quite certain of his person, for I never lost sight of him; the handkerchief he threw down, and which I picked up, was mine; it was marked with the two first letters of my name; I am pretty sure I had my handkerchief a very little before in my pocket.
PRISONER's DEFENCE.
I was coming up Water-lane, on an errand from my aunt, I stopped to make water, and this gentleman seized hold of me, saying I had picked his pocket.

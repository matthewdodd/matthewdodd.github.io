1718. 





WILLIAM SHUNN
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
29th of June, 1 shilling, the monies of 




Thomas Curtis, his master.






THOMAS CURTIS
. I live in Broadway, Westminster, and am a cheesemonger. The prisoner was my servant-boy for two months—he was never allowed to serve in the shop but when there was a second person there—I was informed he had taken a shilling—I came and asked whether he had not got a shilling of mine from the till—he said nothing—I told him I was determined to prosecute—he made a sort of cry—I gave him to a policeman—he was taken to the station-house, and in one of his stockings were found twenty-three shillings in a piece of paper—I may have lost 5l. lately—he said he picked the money up—when the night-constable asked him whether he took the shilling from my till—he said he had, and it was mine—he had not a shilling when he came to me.

Prisoner I said no such thing.





JAMES MAHONEY
. I had charge of the prosecutor's shop—I watched the prisoner, and saw him, after serving a woman with some bacon, go to the till to put the 2d. in; and in so doing, I saw him put his hand into the silver drawer, and take out something which I knew to be money—I watched him—he came round the counter—he saw I was watching him—he had put his hand under his apron, and began to wipe his eyes—I went up to him, laid hold of his arm, and the shilling dropped from him—he put his foot on it, and said it was his.

Prisoner A woman came in, and I served—she gave me a sixpence, and took some bacon and half-a-pound of cheese—she gave me a sixpence—I gave her 1 1/2d.—when I came round my fellow-servant picked a shilling

off the pavement, and said I had dropped it, and then he said he saw me take something out of the till, but he did not know what.




GUILTY
. Aged 18.—


Transported for Seven Years.

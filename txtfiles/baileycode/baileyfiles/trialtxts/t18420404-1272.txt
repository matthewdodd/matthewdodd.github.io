THOMAS MANNING
. I am a green-grocer, and live in Little Chapel-street, Westminster. On the morning of the 12th of March I was moving there from Peter-street, and carried a bundle with me, containing the articles stated—I placed them in the shop in Chapel-street, between seven and eight o'clock, locked the door, put the key into my pocket, and went back to Peter-street—I returned before eight—the door was then on the jar, and the bed and other things gone—they are all here now, except the two pillows—they are mine.





RICHARD PEARMAN
. I am a policeman. In consequence of information, about eight o'clock, the same day, I went to No. 2, Norman-street, and took the prisoner there—he came to the door, unlocked it, and I went in—I said nothing to him, or he to me—Shaw did.





EDWARD SHAW
. I am a policeman. I went with Pearman—the door was opened by the prisoner—I asked if he had not brought a bed in—he said, "No"—I said, "I think you have"—he said, "No"—Pearman went up stairs and found the bed—I asked the prisoner where he got it from—"Close by"—on searching the house, I found all the other articles I produce,

and seven keys, five of which are skeletons, and one opens the prosecutor's door.

Prisoner's Defence. The keys were in the place when I went there; I gave a sovereign for the bed; while I was in custody the landlady took a false key, and opened my room.





JOHN MARSHALL
. I am a policeman. I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction—(read)—he is the man who was convicted on that occasion.




GUILTY
. Aged 27.—


Transported for Fourteen Years.

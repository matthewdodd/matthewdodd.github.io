 was indicted

 for stealing, on the

JOHN THOMAS
. I am a builder, living in Little Stanhope-street, Mayfair. About one o'clock in the afternoon of the 21st of May, I was standing in a crowd in St. James's-park—it was the Queen's birth-day—Scable tapped me on the shoulder—I turned, and saw my handkerchief between my heels—I took it up—I had seen it safe five minutes before—this is it.





WILLIAM SCABLE
. I live in Harrow-alley, Aldgate. I was in the park at the time the guns were discharged—I saw the prisoner—he had hold of the bottom of the prosecutor's pocket with his left hand, and drew out his handkerchief with his right a little way, looked at it, and then drew it out—I told the prosecutor, and the prisoner dropped it.





WILLIAM SMITH
 (police-constable E 151.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction—(read)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 16;.—


Transported for Ten Years—Convict Ship.

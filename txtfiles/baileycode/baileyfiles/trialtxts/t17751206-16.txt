               stealing a metal watch, &c.
             the property of

             (a black). I am servant
 to Mr. Waller in Soho-square: about a month ago he sent me into the city with a letter, between eleven and twelve at night; and, it being late when I returned, was afraid I should not get in: one of the prisoners, 
               
                  Rebecca
                   Wilson
               



            , picked me up in the Strand; I went with her to a public house: she wanted me to go home with her, saying she had very good lodgings: we took coach, and I went with her to Lead-court


; we found two girls in the room. The girl went to bed with me, and I laid there that night: before I went to bed, she asked where my watch was: next morning I found the girl, and my watch, a pair of plated buckles, a handkerchief, and flannel waistcoat, all gone, and the door locked; I called out, and a man came and broke it open: I went out and asked the landlord's name at a pawnbroker's who lived next door; I then went to a justice and told what had happened; the watch was found at a pawnbroker's, where 
               
                  Rebecca
                   Wilson
               



             had pawned it.

                   PULLEN
               



            . On the 1st of November, early in the morning, I met 
               
                  Rebecca
                   Wilson
               



             at the corner of Sydney's-alley, Princess-street, Leicester-Fields, - She desired me to pawn that watch for her: I asked if she came honestly by it, she said she did; accordingly I pledged it at Mr. Crofton's, in Silver-street, Golden-square, for half a guinea, which I gave her.


                  HENRY
                   JONES
               



            . By virtue of a warrant I took up the two prisoners: 
               
                  Rebecca
                   Wilson
               



             said she sent the last witness with the watch to a pawnbroker's. The boy had the duplicate, which he very readily gave me. I don't know the pawnbroker's name, but he lives in silver-street, Golden-square; he gave me the watch on producing the duplicate. (The watch produced.)
[Pullen was desired to look at the watch, which he did, and said, he was sure it was the same that he had from 
               
                  Rebecca
                   Wilson
               



            .]
[ The prosecutor was again called, and desired to look at the watch, which he did, and said, it was the same that he had in his pocket when he went with the girl to her lodging; that he knew it by a piece of brass on the back, and was positive it was his.]


                  Henry
                   Jones
               



             was again called, and asked the reason of his apprehending the prisoner 
               
                  Ann
                   Lynch
               



            ? - He said, they being both in company, and very much in liquor, he did not know which of them was the person.

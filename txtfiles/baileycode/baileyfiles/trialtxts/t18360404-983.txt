THOMAS ELDRIDGE
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
3rd of March, 47lbs. weight of lead, value 7s., the goods of 



William Brass, and fixed to a building, against the Statute, & c.






HENRY BRASS
. I am the son of William Brass, who lives in Wood-street, Cheapside, and is proprietor of a building in Essex-street, Hoxton.

There was some lead on that building—I have compared the lead found by the officer, with the lead remaining on that building—it exactly corresponds—I have no doubt it came from there.





WILLIAM HOLLAND
 (police-constable N 146.) On Thursday morning, the 3rd of March, from information, I went at a quarter before six o'clock in the morning, to an unoccupied house in Essex-street—I went on the first floor, there was no one there—I went on the second floor, and found a piece of lead, and found the tiles were removed—had not been there more than a minute, when I heard some person coming up stairs—the prisoner came up first, and another was behind him—the prisoner advanced towards the lead, and said to the other one, "Come along, here it is"—he turned, and saw me and the other policeman—I caught the prisoner—the other got away—the officer pursued him, but did not take him—I took the prisoner and the lead to the station.





RICHARD HAWKES
. I went on the roof of the house the lead was taken from, and saw some foot-marks—I went to the station, and took the prisoner's shoe—it fitted the marks exactly—I pursued the man who ran away—he ran through the prisoner's mother's house, which joins the premises.





GEORGE KEMP
 (police-constable N 82.) I got this certificate of the prisoner's former conviction from the office of the Clerk of the Peace, at Clerkenwell (read)—the prisoner is the person who was tried.

Prisoner's Defence. I went there to sleep, because I could not get into my mother's house.




GUILTY
. Aged 16.—


Transported for Seven Years.

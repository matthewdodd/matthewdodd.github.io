GEORGE JENKINS
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
17th of February, at 
St. George, 1 £10 bank-note, the property of 



Peter Clark in the dwelling-house of 



John Plowman.






PETER CLARK
. I am a sailor. The prisoner was a sailor in the same ship—I lodged at the house of John Plowman for two nights before this happened—I came to the King William in New Gravel-lane, and fell in with him here—he told me he had lost his money, and said he had no place to go to—I said I had some money, and would give him part of it—I treated him at my own lodging, and he slept in the same room—I had a pocket-book with a ££10 note in it—it was in my inside jacket pocket—I looked at it when I went to bed, and it was safe—I awoke in the morning at half-past seven o'clock, and he was getting up—I told him it was too soon—while he was dressing 1 fell asleep—I awoke again at nine o'clock, and my pocket-book and ££10 note were gone—I went down, and the prisoner was gone—I have never seen my note since—I have known the prisoner three years—he bore a good character.





GEORGE HUNT
 (police-constable K 136.) I apprehended the prisoner at the house of his sister in the Liverpool-road—I waited outside, while his sister went and called him—I asked what he had done with the £10 note he had taken from Peter Clark—he said, "I have changed it, but I have got 8l. left—I am sorry for what I have done"—Plowman's house is in the parish of St. George.





EDWARD DUN THORN
. I am a linen-draper. The prisoner came to my shop about ten o'clock in the morning and bought three pairs of stockings, and gave me this £10 note—I gave him 9l. and some silver in change.

Prisoner. It was done in a state of drunkenness.




GUILTY. Aged 23.—Recommended to mercy by the Prosecutor.

JOHN HARVEY
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
1st of May, 1 handkerchief, value 2s., the goods of 



John Richard Ingram, clerk, from his person.






REV. JOHN RICHARD INGRAM
. On the 1st of May, I was in Bloomsbury-square, at near five o'clock in the afternoon—a boy turned round, and asked me if my pocket had been picked—on putting my hand to my pocket I missed my handkerchief—I believe this to be mine.





EDWARD RAMSHIRE
. I am a policeman. I was in plain clothes, and saw the prisoner walking before the prosecutor up Southampton-street, he stopped there about half-way up, while the gentleman was talking with another one—he then went on, and passed by the prisoner, who followed him up Bloomsbury-square, he there snatched at his pocket, and ran away—I followed, and took this handkerchief from under his arm—he said, "Let me go, and I will beg the gentleman's pardon"—I sent a young man to tell the prosecutor his pocket was picked, and he came to the station-house.




GUILTY
. Aged 18.—


Transported for Seven Years.

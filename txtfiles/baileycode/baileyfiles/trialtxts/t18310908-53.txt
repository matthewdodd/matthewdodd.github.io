            . On the 15th of August, about half-past nine o'clock in the morning, I was going along the street with a basket on my head (I sell fruit in the street
) - I felt my silk handkerchief snatched off my neck from behind; I turned round, and saw the prisoner running down an alley, with it in his hand - I pursued, calling Stop thief! and he was secured; I am sure he is the man.

            .
JAMES LEIGH. I live in Whitechapel-road, and keep a carpet-warehouse
. On the 2d of November I sent Fisher with five pieces of carpet, in a truck, to Mr. Brockhole's,No. 26, Saville-row, Mile-end. I know this is one of the pieces.


                  CHARLES 
                  FISHER
               



            . I am in the prosecutor's employ. He sent me to Saville-row


; I got to the house about half-past three o'clock. I began to unload, and took the carpets into the passage; Mr. Brockhole came up the passage, selected one, and told me to measure the room; I laid down my rule to do so, and he asked me if I had a lad with me; I said No; he said, "A lad has run off with a piece of carpet;" I ran out, and saw the prisoner about fifty yards off, with a carpet; I came up to him; he struck me twice on the ear, and dropped it - I still kept hold of him till Mr. Brockhole came to my assistance.

            . I live in Saville-row. I had selected another carpet, not this one. Fisher's evidence is correct.

Prisoner's Defence. I met a lad, who asked me to carry it; he seemed fatigued, and said I should have 6d. to carry it to Globe-road.

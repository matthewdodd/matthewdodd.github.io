                  , from his person
            .
CHARLES BOYLE. I live in Paddington-street. On the 18th of October I met the prisoner, and went to a house with her; she took my watch out of my pocket; I missed it soon after, and made her give it back - I then put it into my pocket, and when I went to bed I put it under my pillow, in my pocket - it had two keys and a seal to it - I had 16s. 6d. in my pocket; there were two other women in the room; I was awoke in the morning, by her pulling my trousers from under my head - she handed something out of the pocket to another girl, but I did not see what; the other girl ran down stairs - she was dressed, but the prisoner was not; I took hold of my trousers, and missed the watch and money; I heard it rattle in her hand - I am sure I had it when I went there - I was not very sober.

            . I live near the prisoner; Boyle called and said he had been robbed - I went and searched the prisoner, but found nothing; there was another woman in the room, but I cannot find the woman who had the money.
Prisoner's Defence. The woman who took the money I do not know - I never had his trousers in my hand.

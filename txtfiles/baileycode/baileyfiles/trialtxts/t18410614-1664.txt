1664. 




WILLIAM HOLBOROUGH
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 6th of June, 2 cloaks, value 30s., the goods of 



John Dearle; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






CHARLOTTE MORGAN
. I am servant at the Blue Posts public-house, in Newman-street. On the 6th of June, I saw the prisoner go down the mews, and I watched him—he begged of a lady and gentleman—he had nothing then—he returned shortly afterwards carrying these cloaks—I went down stairs, mentioned it in the tap-room, and Rowland followed him.

Prisoner. Q. Did the lady and gentleman give me any thing? A. No—I did not follow you down the mews.





EDWARD ROWLAND
. I was in the public-house—in consequence of what Morgan told me, I went after the prisoner—I overtook him about one hundred and fifty yards from the mews, carrying these cloaks—the policeman took him into custody.

Prisoner. Q. When you overtook me was I running or walking? A. Walking at first—when you came to the comer of Newman-street, you ran across the road.





JAMES CARPENTER
. I am servant to Mr. John Dearie. These cloaks are his, and were in the phaeton in the mews.

Prisoner's Defence. Owing to my destitute state I was induced to beg of this lady and gentleman—they rejected me—I went down the mews and saw a man, like a gentleman's servant—I asked him for relief—he said he could not relieve me, but if I would take these things for him and walk on steadily he would overtake me—I was to wait for him at the bottom of Newman-street—I willingly did it, thinking to receive a small remuneration—acarriage was passing at the time and I ran across the road.





JOHN LAWRENCE
. I am a policeman. I have a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—he is the person—he was tried by the name of Henry Asten, and pleaded guilty.




GUILTY
. Aged 38.—


Transported for Ten Years.

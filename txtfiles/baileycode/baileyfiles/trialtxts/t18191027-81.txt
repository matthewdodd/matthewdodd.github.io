            . On the 23d of October, about twelve o'clock at noon, I was in Parliament-street, Westminster


, felt some one at my left-hand coat-pocket, turned round, and observed my pocket-book in the hands of the prisoner - I secured him, and he dropped it; as I was stooping to pick it up he ran away. I picked it up, followed him, and secured him without losing sight of him. I took him to Queen-square.

            . I am a grocer, and live in Queen-street. I was in Parliament-street, saw the prisoner put his hand into the prosecutor's pocket, and take the book out. I assisted in taking him to the office, and found a fork on him, turned three different ways like hooks.

JAMES FISHER
 (police-constable T 93.) On the 21st of April. I was in

the farm-yard of the Great Western Railway Company, at Acton, and found the prisoner under some hay—I pulled him out, and threatened to lock him up—he produced these eight screw-bolts from under his jacket—I said, "You have been robbing the Company"—he tried to pass them from him, from the left side of his jacket—he said he had not—I said, "I saw you pass them from under your jacket"—he strongly denied it—I took him to the station—I took off his hat, and found these five iron short bolts, and one bracket beside—I am sure I saw him take these long ones from under his jacket.





CHARLES THIRKETTLE
. I am foreman, carpenter, and superintendent of the Great Western Railway—the company have such property as this in their farm-yard—I can swear these belong to the Company—the prisoner was not in their employ—he had no business there.

Prisoner. I am very sorry—I had got no friends, and no where to lie.




GUILTY
.* Aged 23.—


Transported for Seven Years.

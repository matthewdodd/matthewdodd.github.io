             . The Prisoner at the Bar was recommended to my Brother as an Object of Charity; accordingly he came with a Note to my Brother, to get him into the Infirmary . My Brother order'd him to wait upon him at three o'Clock, but he did not come till four o'Clock, and my Brother was gone out. As my Brother was to go out of Town the next Day I desir'd he would stay . I being call'd up, he removes of his own accord to a Seat the other side of the Compter. There was one Servant in the Warehouse backward , and coming in, as he says, he saw him put a Cannister under his Coat . I was then call'd down Stairs, and he was then walking off , and he search'd him, and found the Tea upon him.

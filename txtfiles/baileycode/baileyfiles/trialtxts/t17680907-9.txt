            , we live in Wapping-street


 by the new market: on the 18th of August a pane of glass was broke in the shop-window, and a striped linen shirt, a silk hat, and a doll's petticoat, were taken away; the prisoner was taken within half a minute after, just at the turn of the corner, with the things upon him (produced and deposed to.)
Mrs. Hague's brother deposed he saw the shirt taken out; he ran out, and took the prisoner with the things upon him.
Prisoner's defence.
I work at coal heaving, I was coming from King James's-stairs, a young man ran by with these things; he dropped them, and I took them up, and delivered them to this young man.

             and myself worked at Mr. Wood's, Blossom Street, Shoreditch


; we went to dinner on the 28th of March, and left our tools; and when we returned we missed the things mentioned in the indictment; we had information from 
               
                  Tho.
                   Martin
               



             that they were stolen by the prisoner; we have never seen the tools since.

            . I saw the prisoner go to Mr. Woods; he endeavoured to get up the brick wall at the shop window by fixing two gimblets to the wall to stand upon, but he found that would not do for his purpose, so he got a stool and fixed it to the window, and took out three saws; I told him that I would inform Mr. Wood of it; he said he did not care, and went away with them.

            . I took up the prisoner and found two gimblets upon him, and there was mortar in the screws of the gimblets. As we were going in a coach to the justice, he said he would tell us where the tools were; we stopt the coach; then he said he would not tell without we gave him some money.
Prisoner's Defence.
I went to the shop, but I did not take any thing; I never saw the lad.
He called five witnesses who gave him a good character.

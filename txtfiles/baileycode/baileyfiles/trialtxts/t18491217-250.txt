THOMAS KELLY
 (police-sergeant, H 2). On Sunday night, 2d Dec., I was on duty in the New-road at half-past nine o'clock—I saw the prosecutor with an umbrella—the prisoner accosted him, and asked him to go home with her—he said, no, he had a wife and family of his own, and was going home—she got hold of him—some persons came by, and she said, "He is my brother, I want to get him home"—she got him down—he got up and went on, and she knocked him down, and ran off—I pursued and took her, and found this umbrella in her hand—I did not see her take it from him, as the night was dark and wet—the prosecutor had been drinking.





JAMES GREENHAM
. I am a stoker at the gas-works, in New Gravel-lane. I was going home from work—the prisoner accosted me—I told her I was going home—she followed, tripped me up, and knocked me down—I had an umbrella; she took it from me—I had a half-crown in one pocket, and 1s. 6d. in the other, when I left the factory, not a quarter of an hour before, and I lost them—this is my umbrella.




GUILTY

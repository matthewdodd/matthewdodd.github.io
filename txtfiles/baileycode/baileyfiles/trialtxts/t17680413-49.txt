            . I am servant to the Dean of Peterborough; the thieves came three nights, the 24th of March, the 25th, and the 29th; we watched and saw three men like smiths come into the yard on the 29th at night; we searched the yard, but could not find them; presently we saw them in the street; we went and secured them, Smith turned evidence; I found nothing upon them.

            . I was in company with the two prisoners about three weeks ago, they had some words about these rails, and Willis told me where they had them; Newy said he thought he had not his due. Last Tuesday Willis and I were taking a walk, he said I will shew you where I got these rails; going by, Willis staid behind, and brought an iron rail with him.

            . I bought iron of Smith and Willis at different times, the last time was on Monday fortnight, as much as came to 19 s. (a bar produced;) this I took to try if it fitted the place where the bars were taken from, it exactly fitted; all three were together one time when I bought iron of them, to about one hundred weight, much such bars.

            . I am a serjeant of the guards; Justice Fielding sent for me, and informed me of 
               
                  John 
                  Newy 
               



             stealing these things; he being a soldier, Sir John gave me an order to confine him; I took him to Sir John's house.
Willis's defence.
I was never guilty of no such thing, till Smith had enticed me to sit up all night to get iron.

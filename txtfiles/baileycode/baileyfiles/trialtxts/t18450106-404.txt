JOHN ARSON
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
19th of Dec, 1 sheet, value 3s.; 2 shifts, 2s.; 3 bed-gowns, 2s. 6d.; and 1 duster, 6d.; the goods of 



Sarah Hickenbotham; and that he had been before convicted of felony.


MR. SIMON
conducted the Prosecution.






CHARLOTTE AMELIA KEITH
. I am servant to Mrs. Sarah Hicken-botham—she is a widow, and lives at East Dulwich. On the 19th of Dec. she had the articles stated hanging on a line in the garden—I saw them safe about four o'clock in the afternoon, and after that they were missed—these now produced are them.





SAMUEL WRIGHT
 (police-constable P 172.) I was on duty in the Land-roost-road, and met the prisoner with these things in a bundle—I challenged him about it, and he said he had picked it up—I asked him what it contained, and he said, "Look and see"—I took it from under his arm, and he tried to run away—I secured him, and took him to the station—in going along he said, "You have got me to rights" meaning I had found him with the property on him—he was about half a mile from the prosecutrix's house when I stopped him—these things have been identified—they have the prosecutrix's marks on them.

Prisoner's Defence. I was coming across the hill, and had a dog with me; I jumped down into a ditch after him, and kicked among some leaves, and found the bundle.





JOHN MORGAN
 (police-constable P 211.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read—Convicted on the 5th Feb., 1th Vict., of larceny)—the prisoner is the person—he had six months.




GUILTY
. Aged 17.—


Transported for Seven Years.

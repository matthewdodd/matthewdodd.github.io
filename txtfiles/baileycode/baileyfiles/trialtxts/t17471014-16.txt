            . I keep an Alehouse
 in St Katherine's


. The Prisoner is a Dutchman
, and lodged two or three Nights in my House, had he took these Things, the Spoons and Money, out of a Chest that was in the Kitchen, the Money was in a little Box in the Chest; this was of a Saturday we reckon it was done late at Night, or early in the Morning, for he was gone out before we got up; we had a Suspicion of him and found him out, and the two Spoons were found in his Pockets.

            . I live within a Door or two where the Prisoner was taken, and was present when the Spoons were taken out of his Pocket.
Q. Did you hear him confess any thing?
Viko. He confess'd he had taken the Sum of eight Guineas from that Man's House out of the Drawers, and said he had been a whoring at a bad House in Whitechapel, and they pick'd his Pocket.
The Prisoner could speak but very little English, had nothing to say in his Defence, but that he was in Liquor, and begged for Mercy.




               Guilty to the Value of 39 s.

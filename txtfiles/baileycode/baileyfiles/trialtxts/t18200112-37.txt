            , who is a linen-draper
, and lives at Aldgate


. On the 1st of December, about half-past one o'clock in the day, I heard a pane of glass break, and in about ten minutes I saw the prisoner cutting the putty away. I went out, collared him and he dropped the handkerchiefs at the door. I first saw him at a short distance from the window; he pretended he had hurt his knee, and hobbled across the road. I afterwards saw him cutting the putty, and took him.

THOMAS HARRIS
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
30th of October, 1 wheelbarrow, value 16s., the goods of 



William Filkins; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






WILLIAM FILKINS
. I live at Ickenham. I had a wheelbarrow on the 30th of October, and missed it the next morning. I found the wheel on the 8th of December, at the prisoner's house, on another barrow—I asked him bow he came by it—he said he bought the wheel of a man who came round gathering old iron and bones, and he had made the barrow himself—I have examined it—the barrow is not mine, but the wheel is—it was annexed to another barrow when I lost it.





JOHN LARKIK
. I am an officer. I went with the prosecutor, and he identified this wheel—the prisoner said he had bought it of a man who went about buying bones and rags.

Prisoner's Defence. I bought it of a man who deals in old iron—I was at home one day at dinner, I saw he had this barrow wheel, and I bought it for half-a-crown.





JOHN LARKIN

re-examined. He stated that, and said the man he bought it of lived at Acton—I said I would take him there in my gig—he then said, "Never mind, on the trial will do." I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got at Mr. Clark's office (read)—the prisoner is the man.




GUILTY
. Aged 21.—


Transported for Seven Years.

             sworn.
On the 6th of December, about six in the evening, I lost this china; I follow the china mending business
, in Hanway-street, Oxford-road


; the back part of my house is a workshop, where I put the china; on the 6th of December, when I came home, the prisoner with the child was pleading very hard for liberty; she talked a deal of charity and forgiveness, and that we should forgive one another; but I took her to the Rotation-office.
Mrs. MOODY sworn.
I heard a noise in the back shop a few minutes after six; when I opened the door, I saw the prisoner turning from the work-board; I was in the middle room; I caught her by the cloak; she said she had made a mistake; I told her I would see what it was; I saw the nineteen plates in her hand; I immediately secured her as well as I could; I opened her apron, and found a china bowl in her apron.
Prisoner. I only beg for mercy.
Prosecutor. I beg the Court will shew her mercy.
GUILTY.




               Recommended to mercy by the Jury
            .
Court to Prisoner. Where do you belong to? - I came to town with Mrs. Garrett's family from Ramsgate with my husband, who died suddenly three months before this child was born; I do not know what parish he belonged to; I have not a friend in the world.




               Transported for seven years
            .
Tried by the second Middlesex Jury before Mr. RECORDER.

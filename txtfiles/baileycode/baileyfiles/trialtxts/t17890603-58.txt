             sworn.
I am coachman to the honourable Frederick Vane; I lost a box-coat between ten and eleven in the morning, at Chelsea


, from the coach-house, it was lost on the box, I saw it afterwards in the hands of the prisoner, I pursued him, and saw him throw it on the other side of the hedge; I never lost sight of him, it was a livery frock and a cocked up hat; I suppose I took him in a quarter of an hour; after I took him he begged for mercy, I had had the coat sixteen months, it was not become my property.
(The court deposed to.)

I picked up the coat in Chelsea College.

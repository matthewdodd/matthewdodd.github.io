On the 7th of this month, at eleven, I was at my two pair of stairs window, facing the prosecutor's, I saw the prisoner go into the prosecutor's hall, he was not in above a minute, and he came out with a cloak, putting it withinside of his coat; I told Mrs. Brush, and she sent her servant with me, and we went up the Minories, and saw the prisoner at the public house door, putting the cloak in his pocket; seeing us he began to walk away, and then to run; he was taken, and then I saw him take the cloak out of his pocket, and throw it in the kennel; it was given to the watchman.

I heard the cry of stop thief! and I caught the prisoner, I looked in his pocket, and saw a bulk, I saw him take the cloak out of his pocket, and throw it over my head; it was picked up and given to me.

PRISONER's DEFENCE.
I am innocent of the affair, I was coming along the Minories, I stopped to make water in an alley, and I picked up the cloak; I heard the cry of stop thief! and the woman said I stole it.

            . On the 27th of April, as we had lost coals several times, Ford and I were set to watch a lighter of coals at Gun Dock


. About two in the morning the prisoners came along side the lighter in a boat; one of them staid in the boat, and the other got into the barge, and filled three sacks with coals, and put them into the boat; I fired a musket at them; then they threw the coals into the water and attempted to row off; I told them if they rowed any further I would shoot them dead; then they stopped, and we took them, and carried them on shore to Wapping watch house; the coals were picked up by a waterman six hours afterwards.

             confirmed his evidence.
The prisoners, in their defence, said, they were fisher

s, and were looking after a boat that was adrift, and that they had not a coal in the boat.

            , of St. Mary Islington


, was indicted for 


               feloniously stealing four linen Clouts, a Punch Bowl, and divers other Goods
            , the Property of 
               
                  
                     Richard 
                     Holmes
                  




               
            , the 13th of this Instant October.
It appear'd by the Evidence, that the Prisoner got over the Prosecutor's Garden Wall, went into an Out-House, and stole the Goods. That the Prosecutor being alarm'd by the barking of a Dog, got up, saw the Prisoner and another in his Garden, and pursuing them, apprehended the Prisoner in an adjacent Field; but his Accomplice made his Escape. The Fact being clearly prov'd, the Jury found him 

               guilty
             of the Felony.

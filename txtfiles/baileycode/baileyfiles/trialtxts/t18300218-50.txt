JOHN AYLEY. I live at Little Adam, in Hertfordshire. I was coming to town on the night of the 25th of January with a load of straw - I stopped on the morning of the 26th, at the White Lion, Enfield-highway


, and took my coat into the house; I saw the prisoner at the White Lion - when I came out I put the coats on the straw, and when I got about ten or twenty yards from the house I missed them; I went back to the ostler, and told him of it - I then sent a constable to the prisoner's house, as I had seen him behind my cart.

            . In consequence of suspicion I went to the prisoner's house, and knocked him up; I said I wanted the two great coats he had stolen - he hesitated for some minutes, and then said he had found two; I went up stairs, and he delivered me these two coats from the head of the bed - he is single.
Prisoner. He said he was not sure whether he put them on the cart before he put his horses in, or not. Witness. No, but I put them on the straw.
Prisoner's Defence. I picked them up in the road, and went along with them a quarter of a mile, and then took them down to the house - he came in the morning, knocked me up, and said he wanted the coats; I said I had two, but I had not stolen them.

            . Aged 23. - 


               Transported for Seven Years

JANE EATHERTON
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
20th of April, 1 garden-pot, value 2d.; and 1 plant, value 6d.; the goods of 



Joseph Bayse; and that she had been before convicted of felony.






JOSEPH BAYSE
. I am a gardener, and live in Grosvenor-road, Pimlico. On the 20th of April Mrs. Jones called me about eight o'clock—I followed the prisoner, and overtook her just as she knocked at her own door in Commercial-road, which is a quarter of a mile from my premises, and found this geranium in her arms—I asked her if she had bought it—she said, "Yes, of a woman in the street"—I looked at it, and said I could swear to it by the number on it—she said she gave 3d. for it.





ELIZABETH JAMES
. I saw the prisoner take the plant, which was outside the prosecutor's shop door—I told him, and he followed her.





JOHN PARIS
. I am a policeman. I took her in charge.
(The prisoner put in a written defence, stating that she purchased the plant and pot of a woman in the street for 3d.)





THOMAS BEVIS
. I am a policeman. I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction from the Clerk of the Peace of Westminster—(read)—I was a witness against her—she is the same person.




GUILTY
. Aged 31.—


Transported for Seven Years.

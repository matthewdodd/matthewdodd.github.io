            ; we live in Gate-street, Lincoln's Inn-fields; the bale of army cloth was the property of my father and myself, the other cloth belonged to us and Mr. Smith; the superfine cloth is the property of

            . Our factory is in Stonecutter's-alley



, separated from the house by a yard - Mr.

                  Dolan
               



             slept in the house on the night of the robbery. The workmen leave about nine o'clock - the door is usually fastened by a bar, which is put across inside - that door communicates with Stonecutter's-alley. The door leading from the warehouse into the yard was locked.
Q. Did you see the warehouse on the morning of the robbery - A. I was called up about three o'clock in the morning of the 29th of February, I went to the warehouse, and observed the door leading to the yard open, and a skeleton key in the lock - it appeared they had entered there. I found a crow-bar on the premises; the door was left open. The door leading into Stonecutter's-alley was opened; the bar had been removed inside, it must have been opened inside. There is no access to the yard without getting over the wall, which is about ten feet high - there were marks on it, as if some person had climbed over. I missed three pieces of army cloth, in all about one hundred and thirteen yards. I saw them at Worship-street two days afterwards, and knew them to be ours.


                  THOMAS 
                  SMITH
               



            . I am a partner in the firm. I saw nine yards of black cloth at Worship-street, which I saw in the warehouse two days before the robbery.

                  SWINGLER
               



            . I am a watchman of Gate-street; the door of the prosecutors' workshop is in my beat. I tried it at nine and at twelve o'clock, it was safe then. Just before three o'clock in the morning I went up the alley, and saw some men pass by me in Stonecutter's-alley, at different times, and went towards Weston's-park, then up the mews again, and made a run. I wondered what was going to be done. I took my lanthorn, walked gently, and looked down Weston's-park, I there saw the back of a coach, it was yellow - there is a hackney-master lives at the upper end of the park. I went on the left hand, came to Mr. Dolan's warehouse door, and found it open; I then saw a parcel of cloth strewed about the yard by the door. When I got to the door, I saw the coach driving off in a direction towards Searle-street. I immediately sprung my rattle, and went round to Lincoln's Inn-fields. When I came round the corner two watchmen stood there; I desired them to follow the coach - it drove furiously away when I sprung my rattle, and I never got up to it.
Cross-examined by MR. ARABIN. Q. You could not keep up to it - A. No, I was never nearer to it than forty yards, and did not see what was in it.

                  BIDWELL
               



            . I attend Spitalfields-market, and usually go to business about five o'clock. On Tuesday morning, the 29th of February, about half-past six, I saw a coach in Dorset-street - it was a yellow-bodied coach, and stood before an alley. I took notice of it, as my father supposed there had been a robbery, and saw six or seven young men round it - I noticed two or three of them, and should know them again; I could distinguish Pitt, Dodd, Prussia, and Simpson, and the coachman, which was Hewitt, the prisoner. They stood round the coach, I watched them about a quarter of an hour; then Pitt, who had a white coat on, asked me if I knew where there was a public-house, for he wanted something to drink? I said I did not know of any being open. They found I was watching them, came to the coachman, and he drove round to the end of the alley.
Q. Had he to pass the end of Crispin-street - A. Yes, to Little Paternoster-row. The men went up the nearer way and met the coach. I followed the men up the alley, and saw the coach right up at the end of the alley. Hewitt got off the box, opened the coach-door, and the men went up and took the cloth out. I think there were two or three more men than I have mentioned. It was woollen cloth. Pitt took one piece out of the coach, and went into Franklin's house, and the others followed with each a piece. I have known Franklin's house a long while. The coachman held the door open for them - the coach was emptied all at once. I did not see Franklin then, his house was not open - he keeps a little broker's shop, I have known him two or three years; the coach remained there. I went and told Gregory, the officer, what had passed; he ran down the court, and saw the men in the room; he sent for Armstrong. Gregory's house is eight or ten doors from Franklin's.
Cross-examined by MR. ARABIN. Q. Were not the shops open - A. There were none but potatoe-shops open. I was just by the coach, and saw them plainly - it was between dark and light. Franklin generally opens about half-past seven, or eight o'clock.
Cross-examined by MR. HONE. Q. You never saw Simpson before - A. No. I particularly noticed them all, and have no doubt of any of them.

                  MILLER
               



            . I am a cooper, and work at the corner of Little Paternoster-row. On the 29th of February, about half-past six o'clock in the morning, I was going to work, and saw the prisoner, Pitt, who had a light-coloured great-coat on; he came, and walked up Paternoster-row - a short man was with him, it was not any of the prisoners. Pitt went down the alley, and into Franklin's house, alone. I knew the house before, but did not know Franklin. I think the shop was open and the goods at the door. Pitt came out instantly with a blue coat on - he had taken his great-coat off. He walked down Paternoster-row, and was crossing over towards the Ten Bells; at that time I heard the noise of a coach - Gregory and others had stopped the coach. Pitt stood still; the man who was with him was a Jew - when Pitt left, the Jew joined him again. The coach was standing at the Ten Bells door, which is about two hundred yards from Franklin's - it could have got within twenty yards of his house.
Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Franklin's shop was open - A. Yes, and a few goods before the door. I think he was putting the window up; he was not out at the door when Pitt went in.
COURT. Q. Were the shutters down - A. I did not go up to the house, and do not know.


                  JOHN 
                  GREGORY
               



            . I am a potatoe-salesman, and lodge with my brother in Spitalfields. In consequence of what I was told, between six and seven o'clock in the morning. I went up Little Paternoster-row, and saw Pitt, Dodd, Simpson, and Prussia inside Franklin's door - the shutters were down then. I saw a coach, which was No. 13, standing at the bottom of Little Paternoster-row. I then went and informed my brother, returned, and found the coach at the Ten Bells, and the coachman at the coach-door. It remained there till about twelve o'clock, and then drove away. I ran and saw an officer come up and open the coach-door, nobody was in it then. I immediately ran to Franklin's house, went in, and saw five or six men in the back-room behind the shop, Franklin was with them - they could see me. I stood there a minute or two, and the men ran out of the side-door into the yard; Franklin came into the shop. I followed them into the yard - they began to get over the wall into a farrier's yard, which communicates with the street. I ran round and saw Simpson, who had got over the wall into the farrier's yard. I saw the four prisoners, excepting the coachman and Franklin, in the yard. There were others, who got away. Simpson was immediately secured, and I took him to the watch-house, the others were also secured. I saw the cloth in Franklin's back-room, where the prisoners were. It was afterwards shewn to Mr. Dolan.
Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Whether Franklin was receiving it or not you cannot say - A. No; there was no appearance of his wishing to turn them out.


                  RICHARD 
                  GREGORY
               



            . My brother gave me information. I stood at my own door, and saw a yellow-bodied coach, No. 13, standing at the Ten Bells, about half-past six o'clock. I immediately sent for Armstrong and Van, and about half-past seven I saw Pitt go up to Hewitt, the coachman, and speak to him, he then drove on, and was going to turn his coach back to Franklin's; I followed, called two constables to take him, and I secured Pitt, who was taken to the watch-house. As I came out of the watch-house Armstrong came up, he and I went to Franklin's, and found the cloth in the room behind the shop - it was not at all concealed, and under the cloth was found a white great-coat. In justice to Franklin, I must state, that when I said
"Whose cloth is that - who brought it here?" He said immediately,
"I was knocked up, and my master's son, Mr. Pitt, brought it here." It was then eight o'clock.


                  JOHN 
                  ARMSTRONG
               



            . I got the cloth from Franklin's and took him into custody; he said he was knocked up, and his master's son brought it - it laid quite open. He said three or four men came with it, and he thought he should know them.
COURT. Q. Was there any more cloth in the house - A. None; there was no appearance of dealing in cloth - it was near eight o'clock. I know Pitt as a broker.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

             re-examined. That is the coat Pitt wore.


                  THOMAS 
                  CHAPMAN
               



            . I apprehended Dodd in Union-street, leading to Bishopsgate-street. I had heard the alarm, and saw him come out of the farrier's yard. I pursuedhim, calling Stop thief! - he had a stick in his hand, another person attempted to secure him, he struck him with it. I secured him, and took from his pocket a tobacco-box, containing tinder, and a knife, which appeared to have been used as a steel.


                  ROBERT 
                  CHRISTIAN
               



            . I am a headborough. Pitt was brought to the watch-house. When Dodd and Simpson were brought in I observed them frequently putting their hands to their pockets, as if they wanted to get away something. I searched Dodd, and found two centre-bits on him, and Chapman found a tinder-box and knife on him; the knife appears to have been used as a steel, and the tinder was fresh made. I found two flints on Simpson, and some list.
MR. DOLAN. The list has been torn of some of the cloth.


                  THOMAS 
                  HART
               



            . I am an headborough. I searched Pitt, and found a large skeleton key and several smaller ones on him.


                  EDWARD 
                  RAE
               



            . I am a constable. I apprehended Prussia concealed in a privy in a private yard adjoining Franklin's house - it was not the farrier's yard - he could have got there from the roof of an adjoining shed.


                  THOMAS 
                  VAN
               



            . As I was taking Hewitt to the office, he said he would not be hurt for others who had hired him, and that Simpson hired him at Charing-cross a little after two o'clock in the morning, and brought him to the corner of Gate-street, Lincoln's Inn-fields, a little way up the street on the left hand, which is Stonecutter's-alley; that they brought the cloth from the alley - he could not tell from where they brought it out, but they brought it round the corner, and that he drove up and down the Strand till the watch went off.
PITT'S Defence. A Jew fetched me to Franklin's to ask what the cloth was worth a yard; another person was with him, whom I took for one of Franklin's lodgers - I said it was worth about 5 s., a yard, and went away with the lodger and the Jew to the Ten Bells. Some persons were running - I believe Gregory was running after the men who belonged to the cloth. The boy pointed to me, and they seized me, and took eight 1 l. notes from me.
DODD'S Defence. I was in Union-street, and heard' the cry of Stop thief! a man stopped me, I said I was not the thief, and he let me go. I was afterwards taken again.
PRUSSIA'S Defence. I saw a number of people going down French-alley, they said there was some stolen property in the house. I went round the yard to assist in taking the men, and in about ten minutes several people came and took me.
FRANKLIN'S Defence. I knew nothing of the property having been stolen. It was brought to my place by the desire of Pitt, and I believe these to be the men who brought it, except the coachman. I did not know what sort of goods were coming.

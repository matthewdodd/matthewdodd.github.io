GEORGE SMITH
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
7th of March, 2 smock-frocks, value 8s., the goods of 



John Giles.






JOHN GILES
. I am a clothes-dealer, and live in Shoreditch. On Saturday night, the 7th of March, about a quarter-past nine o'clock, I was called to the door by a neighbour, and missed two smock-frocks, which I had seen safe about a quarter of an hour before—these are them—(looking at them)—they have my private mark on them.





JAMES CODLING
. I am shop-boy to Mr. Grove, a clothier, in Shoreditch, two doors from the prosecutor's. On the night of the 7th of March I was at my master's door, and saw the prisoner pass by Mr. Giles's, put his hand in at the door, and take these frocks, which were hanging up—he gathered them up, put them under his arm, and ran away.

Prisoner. Q. Are you sure it was me? A. Yes.





WILLIAM DEARMAN
 (police-constable G 162.) I saw the prisoner in Shoreditch on Saturday, the 7th of March, about twenty minutes past nine o'clock, with something concealed under his jacket—I caught hold of him, and asked what he had there—he made no reply—I took him to the station-house, and charged him on suspicion of stealing them—I found two smock-frocks and a piece of muslin on him—I could find no owner for the muslin.

Prisoner. I picked them up, wrapped up in the muslin—I saw no owner for them, and went along—he came up and stopped me. Witness. He was about a dozen yards from the prosecutor's shop when I stopped him—he had the muslin in his jacket-pocket.

Prisoner. I hope you will look over it; it is the first time.




GUILTY
. Aged 18.—


Transported for Seven Years.

WILLIAM KIRBY. I am an embosser
. On the 25th of June I was in the City-road


, about eleven or twelve o'clock in the forenoon - I was looking into a shop window, and, on turning, I saw two young men by my side - I suspected them, and felt for my handkerchief - it was not in my pocket- I looked in my hat, and it was not there - I went on, and they were before me - when they came to James-street, one of them, who was the prisoner, ran off - I pursued, and cried, "Stop thief!" - I picked up my handkerchief in the track he ran - I pursued him to Old-street, and he was taken - there was no one but the prisoner and I in the street, when I picket up my handkerchief.

Prisoner's Defence. I was going along, and a boy came by in great speed - I stepped into the road - a gentleman pursued me - I said, "There goes the lad" - he would not go after him, but took me.

            . I am a cabinet-maker
, and live in Ratcliffe-high-way


. Last Monday was three weeks I was in my parlour drinking tea; Mrs. Knight, who lives opposite me, came and asked me if I sold a glass, for she saw two women take one from the stall. I pursued them, and found them talking together in Princes-square. They denied they had been near my shop. Mannon had a long cloak on: I turned back her cloak, and she had my glass under it. I took them both into custody. Mannon said Murphy was innocent of it, for she had met her in the street just before she took the glass. (The glass produced and deposed to.)

             deposed, that she saw the two prisoners come up to the prosecutor's stall, that Murphy went rather before Mannon whilst Mannon took the glass.
Mannon's Defence.
As I was coming by Princes-square, I met a woman big with child; she desired me to hold the glass whilst she made water; seeing Mr. Clark come, she left me. I walked with it openly in my hand.
She called

            . On the first day of the poll last Saturday was fortnight, I went towards Guildhall, after dinner; I saw the prisoner in Guildhall


 attempting at several gentlemen's pockets; at last I saw him take a handkerchief out of the pocket of a gentleman; I told the gentleman of it; I took hold of him with my left hand and the gentleman with my right, and told him he had lost his handkerchief; he missed it; I opened the prisoner's breeches and drew it out. The gentleman lived in the country, and said he could not appear.
Prisoner's Defence.
The gentleman could not swear to the handkerchief; he could not find any thing else than my own handkerchief; that was my handkerchief.
Q. from the Jury. Was there any other handkerchief upon him?
Pain. No.

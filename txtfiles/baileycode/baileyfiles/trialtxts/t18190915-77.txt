            , and live in Cutler-street, Houndsditch


 - he is a licenced hawker
. On the 5th of August, about ten o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner coming down stairs with these things, which she had taken off the drawers in my bedroom - she was quite a stranger. I said,
"Halloo mistress, what have you been doing up stairs?" She said she had got the wrong door. I called my brother, who took her into the kitchen; she then dropped my husband's coat. She had a bundle in her hand, containing the other things.

"Don't make a disturbance, I have got every thing in the bundle." She dropped the coat from her waist - the other things were in her handkerchief.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

            . I am a jeweller
. On the 20th of July, I was walking over Blackfriars bridge


 with my wife; felt something behind - turned round and saw the prisoner drawing my handkerchief from my pocket - he took it entirely out; and put it under his coat. I seized and charged him with it - he denied it - my brother-in-law collared him, and he dropped it.
MRS. TALFREE. I saw my husband collar the prisoner; he denied taking the handkerchief, but I picked it up at his feet.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I deny ever seeing it.

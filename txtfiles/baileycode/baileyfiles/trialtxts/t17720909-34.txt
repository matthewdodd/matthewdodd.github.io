            . I was at Bartholomew fair


 on the 7th of September; I saw Litners take a handkerchief out of Hiam's pocket, and give it to Brown; I desired Mr. Gates to take notice of them; which he did. Hiam is a boy; he appeared before the alderman, and swore to his handkerchief, but his father would not let him appear before the grand jury.

             confirmed this evidence.
Brown's Defence.
I know nothing of the handkerchief, nor of this Litners.
Litner's Defence.
I never touched the lad's pocket; I never saw Brown before. I carried meat out for the butchers in Brooks-market.

                   Gates
               



            . Did you observe the prisoners before they got the handkerchief out of the boy's pocket?
Gates. Yes; for half an hour I believe; they made several attempts.

            . I am the wife of William Morton, and keep a chandler's shop
 in Charter-house-lane


. On the 20th of November, I saw two boys in the shop - I turned into the back parlour, and saw a boy going out with something under his coat. I called to him to stop; but he went out. I followed to the corner, and called Stop thief! I picked up a piece of cheese under the window - it was of the same description as that I had in my shop, but I could not swear to it.

            . I am a constable. I was coming past this house, and saw the prisoner run and drop this cheese from under his coat, under the window - he ran away - the prosecutrix cried Stop thief! and Thompson pursued and took him. He said his brother had taken the cheese, and he had taken ding of it.

            . I am a patrol. I heard the cry Stop Thief! pursued and took the prisoner - he said another boy had taken it and given it to him.

            . On the 20th of November, towards evening, I saw the prisoner come from Morton's shop door and run. I heard Mrs. Morton cry Stop thief! twice; I saw him take a piece of cheese from under his coat, and throw it under the window. I am certain he is the boy who dropped it. I did not lose sight of him.

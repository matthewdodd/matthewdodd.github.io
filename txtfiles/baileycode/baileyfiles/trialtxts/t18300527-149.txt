            . I am a tailor and slop-seller
. The prisoner came to me last Saturday, and brought this note from another ship; he wanted clothes to the amount of 20s., and one sovereign which I gave him for the amount of the note - he said he was going to the ship in a great hurry.
This was a note similar to the last, but stating him to belong to the ship Alice, and drawn for 2l.

            . I took the prisoner in charge.
Prisoner's Defence. The captain gave me the note on Sunday, and I met a black woman, who said she knew this gentleman; I went and got the note changed with him - the captain said I must be on board by half-past six o'clock; I ran off as the ship had sailed - I gave a waterman 1s. to put me alongside, but she was going before the wind, and I could not get on board; I came back, and got the note of the other ship - the things I had of the prosecutor are on board the vessel.

             M'Dermont. On the 21st of last month, I had been out about a little business; when I came home, I found a glass-window backwards was broke, and a brass candlestick was lying on the ground, and another missing; we were informed the prisoner was seen at that window; he was soon taken and carried before Justice Welch; there I saw my candlestick taken out of his pocket, (produced and deposed to); he said another man gave it him in the street to sell.

            . I was looking out at my window; I heard the prosecutor's window dash; seeing the prisoner at it; I asked him what he was about? he said he was mending his landlady's window by her order; I said, you are a very bad glazier; for instead of mending one pane, you have broke two.

I am very innocent of it; a man gave me the candlestick, and he is since gone away.

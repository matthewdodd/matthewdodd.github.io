WILLIAM GREENWOOD. I am a licensed-victualler
, and live in Bagnigge-wells-road


. I lost a spruce-beer bottle from my counter last Thursday; I did not see who took it, nor know it was gone, till the officer brought it back, about twelve o'clock; I had seen it in the morning: I noticed the two prisoners come in, and served them with a pint of porter, but I did not see them go out.

            . I took this bottle from Baker's pocket, about a quarter of a mile from the prosecutor's, it was about a quarter-past ten o'clock; he said he had bought it for 1s.: Chapp was with him.

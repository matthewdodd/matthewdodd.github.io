                  , from his person

THOMAS COOKSEY. I am a hatter
. I was in High-street, Shadwell


, on the 18th of April, about four o'clock in the afternoon - I had a handkerchief in my pocket; I did not feel it taken, and when I was told of it the prisoner had passed me.

            . I am a biscuit-baker, and live at Shadwell. On the day stated, I was crossing from my own door, and saw the two prisoners and another person with them; I saw Townsend take the handkerchief from the prosecutor's pocket, and whip it round to his companion Jones - I called to the prosecutor, then seized the two prisoners, and pushed them into a shop; the other man got away - this is the handkerchief.
Townsend's Defence. I did it through distress; I had not broken my fast all day - the gentleman passed with his handkerchief hanging out; it was a great temptation.
Jones' Defence. I was going along and met Townsend, who said he was going to get work - the prosecutor passed, and he took the handkerchief and gave it to me.
TOWNSEND - 

               GUILTY
            . Aged 19.
JONES - 

               GUILTY
            . Aged 18.

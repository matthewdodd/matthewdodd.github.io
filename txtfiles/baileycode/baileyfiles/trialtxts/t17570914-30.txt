            ; we live in Duke-Street, St. James's



. I lost six holland shirts, five made and one partly made, and an Irish stuff gown, on the 24th of July. I went out at about half an hour after twelve, and return'd and missed them about nine at night. I know nothing of the prisoners, I never saw them before to my knowledge. I double-lock'd my door at going out, and it was only upon the spring when I return'd; but there was no violence done to the lock. I found two shirts in another place. [Six shirts and a gown were produced in court and deposed to.] 
               
                  Elizabeth

             own'd that she pawn'd one of the shirts to Mr. Ashburner before justice Fielding. She was stop'd, going to pawn other things, on the 15th of August. I saw them both on the 16th; Cooper own'd he had the things, but said he did not steal them.
Q. Did you mention them all particularly?
C. Simpson. I did.
Mr. Woodward. I am a constable. The two prisoners were stop'd at a pawnbroker's in Long-Acre about the middle of last month. I took Cooper to the Round-house, and next morning I saw two keys lying in the area belonging to the Round-house. I searched Cooper, and found three other keys in his pocket (5 chamber door keys produced) these are the keys; he own'd he threw the two keys where I had found them. The prosecutrix produced the key to her door, which exactly agreed with one of the five for wards and size. At last Cooper confessed he had taken the things, and that he had given some of them to the woman to pawn.
Cooper's Defence.
I told Mr. Fielding the man that gave me these goods was gone on board a privateer.
Cooper 

               guilty
            .
Lawrence 

               acquitted
            .
(M.) They were a second time indicted for 


               stealing eight linen aprons, value 6 s. one lawn apron, value 2 s. one silver table spoon, value 9 s. one pair of shoe buckles, three tea-spoons, and one linen gown
            , the goods of

            , August 3

. ++
It appeared that this was perpetrated in the same manner as the former fact; one of the five false keys found upon Cooper agreed with that of the prosecutrix's key to her door, and some of the goods were found pawn'd by Lawrence. Cooper confessed this and divers robberies of the same sort.
Cooper 

               guilty
            .  Lawrence 

               acquitted

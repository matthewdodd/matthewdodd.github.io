            .) What have you to say against the Prisoner?
Tibbet. I say, Sir, that she lodg'd in my House almost Half a Year. She took my Wife's Shift out of the Drawer; she own'd it herself. I won't swear that she did it; but she own'd it before the Justice.
Q. What Justice?
Tibbet. Justice Holt.
Q. Was it sign'd?
Tibbet. Yes, she sign'd it with her own Hand.


                  Q.

                  Hollis

                  John 
                  Tibbet 
               



            ?
Hollis. Sir, I miss'd my Mistress's Shift between Eleven and Twelve o'Clock; and she ( the Prisoner) own'd she had pawn'd it.
Q. Where is your Master's House?
Hollis. At Islington.
Q. Did she own she took it from thence ?
Hollis. Yes, Sir, and the Money too.
Court. Prisoner, she says you took the Money from the Prosecutor's House at Islington.
Prisoner. My Lord, they lay more to my Charge than I had. Please you, my Lord, 'tis partly done out of Spight, as much as any Thing.


                  Q. 
               


            (to the Prisoner.) Have you any Witnesses to your Character?
Prisoner. No, my Lord; none but myself.

ELIZABETH WOODS
. I am the wife of Joseph Woods, and occupy a cottage at Stanwell. On the 26th of October I left home at five minutes to six o'clock to go to work—my husband had left before me—I locked the door and shut the windows—these things were safe—when I returned I found the prisoner in custody, and the articles produced were tied up and left on my bed.





JOSEPH WOODS
. I returned to my cottage, in consequence of information I received, about one o'clock—I found the window broken and a shirt gone, a bundle was tied up and laid on the bed—the door was locked, but the back window was open—the bundle contained a cloak, a coat, and a waistcoat—they are worth about 40s. together—the house is in the parish of Stanwell—I occupy it myself.





BENJAMIN SLOCOCK
. In consequence of an alarm I ran down to the prosecutor's cottage on the 26th of September—I got there about twelve o'clock—I looked through the bed-room window, which was shut, and saw the prisoner inside with a hat in his hand—he went out at the back window and ran away—I was about eight yards from him—I followed and took him.




GUILTY
. Aged 30.—


Transported tot Ten Years.

            . The prisoner was in my service - Crate was indebted to me; the prisoner has not entered 5s. received from her on the 18th of September
 - he has entered sums received from other customers on that day. and they amount precisely to the sum he paid me. I went out of town on the 20th of September - he had not paid it me then; he never told me of any mistake of this kind.
Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Might not this 5s. have been put down in the name of some other person, in some subsequent account? A. He received nothing after that; he left on the 20th of September - I have no reason to suppose this has gone to any other person's name - I am morally certain of it - I did up his book myself, on the 18th of September - I think what he received was, 18l. 19s. 1d., and I received 18l. 17s. 9d. - the rest was allowed to get him some refreshment - I received it, and these figures are mine - I had not discovered this error on the 25th of September, when he called; it was discovered that day by Jones - I suppose I now owe him 6l. or 7l. for wages.

Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Suppose all the accounts were settled between him and you, would you be in his debt, or he in yours? A. I think he would be considerably in mine.

            . I am a customer of Mr. Thompson's. On the 18th of September I paid the prisoner 5s. for Mr. Thompson; he wrote this receipt for it, on the back of the bill.

RICHARD BOOTH SMITH. I live at Uxley Farm, Edmonton


. On the 12th of June, I detected the prisoner in my barn taking this wheat; he had taken it from a heap and put in another place - I had seen him before, but not employed him - I was called up by Hawtree, and saw a light in the barn - we went to put in a key to unlock the door, the light was then put out; we went in and found about three sacks of wheat, which were dressed, and laid separate from the heap which was not dressed.

            . On the Sunday night, at a quarter-past twelve o'clock, I went to get my horses to go to London - I saw a light in the barn, and called my master - we went, unlocked the barn, and found the prisoner there - we had waited outside watching him for half an hour; some corn had been made ready to put into sacks; it was thrown on the other heap at day-light.

            . I am a constable. I went about four o'clock in the morning to the prosecutor's kitchen, where I found the prisoner charged with having been in the barn; he said he was found there - I went to the barn, and near where they said he had stood, I found about half a candle, which had been lighted, and this stick which he had opened the door with.

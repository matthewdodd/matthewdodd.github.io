. On the 9th of June, I heard my room door go - I ran down, and this cloak was gone; I could see nobody; and on Sunday I went out and locked my door - when I returned, I caught the prisoner behind my door, with my son's shoes in her hand; she ownedtaking my cloak, and said she burnt the duplicate on her mother's fire.

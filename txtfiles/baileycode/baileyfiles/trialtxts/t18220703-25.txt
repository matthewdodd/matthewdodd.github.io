            . I am an ironmonger
, and live in Fleet-street. On Saturday, the 8th of June, about ten o'clock at night, I was a few doors on this side Temple-bar


, coming home - I felt something at my pocket, and missed my handkerchief; upon turning round I saw the prisoner close at my heels - I believe he was in company with two other persons. I collared him, and the handkerchief dropped behind him; I said he had picked my pocket; he denied it - I took him to the watch-house. I picked it up.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

            . He said nothing of the kind at the time. I cannot swear it dropped from him, or another person close to him.

 for stealing, on the 
1st of Sept., 1 chaise covering, value 5s., the goods of

MARY JENKINS
. I am housemaid to Mr. William Smee. On Friday morning, the 1st of Sept., I was standing at our bed-room window, and I saw the prisoner standing outside our yard gate—a little time after I was looking out of the window, and saw him going away with a bundle under his arm—I asked what he had been taking—he said, "Nothing at all"—I gave an alarm, and he ran up the road—I saw him drop this chaise-cover—it is my master's.





THOMAS HILL
. I saw the prisoner go into the yard, and come out with a bundle—there was an alarm—he jumped over a hedge—I jumped after him—the chaise-cover was in the bundle.

Prisoner's Defence. I was going into the country, saw this on the chaise, and took it.





JAMES WRIGHT
 (police-constable N 127.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 18.—


Transported for Seven Years.

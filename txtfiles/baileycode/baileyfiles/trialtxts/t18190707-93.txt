            . I am articled to a solicitor in the Temple
. On the 8th of June, about ten o'clock, I was walking with a friend in Great Queen-street; just after we had passed the Freemason's-tavern, I felt a pull at my pocket, turned round, and missed my handkerchief; I saw the prisoner and a boy close behind me, and charged the prisoner with having it - he dropped it, and ran away. My friend secured him.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

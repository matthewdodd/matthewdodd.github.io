            , who rents a house at Wapping


. On the 3d of August, the prisoner and Medway came to lodge with us - I let them the bed-room, dining-room, and the use of a kitchen, at 10 s. 6 d. a week. The prisoner was to pay the rent, but the lodging was for their joint use. They left on the Monday morning, without notice - they went out very fast, which made me suspect them. I ran up, and found the door locked and the key gone - I got another key, and found the cupboard door locked; I opened it, and missed a table spoon and two tea spoons, and from the bed-room, I missed the other things. They were let with the lodging. I have recovered none of them.

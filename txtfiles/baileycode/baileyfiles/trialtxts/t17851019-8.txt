             sworn.
I live in the Minories


, I am a cabinet-maker and upholsterer
; I lost my things, the prisoners were lately my servants

, and whilst they lived with me I did not miss these things, one lived with me about two years, and the other about three; one left me about six months ago, that was Shepherd, and 
               
                  John
                   Arnold
               



             about nine months ago; on receiving an information from one Atkinson, I went to the prisoner Arnold, who I found in Spitalfields, where he lived, and kept a greenstall; he lived at another place, there I saw him, and I took him to the public house, and I enquired of him how he came by some chair stuff that he gave to 
               
                  Edward
                   Atkinson
               



             to make into chairs; he said he bought it of a man that had the appearance of a countryman, a chair-maker, and that he was very ill, and was advised by his doctor to go into the country, and could not stay to make up the chairs, in consequence of which he offered it to him who then kept a broker's shop; I asked him where this chair-maker lived; he said he did not know; where is he gone to? why, to Lincolnshire; but did not know what inn he set off from; I immediately came to 
               
                  Jeremiah
                   Shepherd
               



            , who then lived with a distiller; for they had left off partnership; when they left me they went into partnership together in a broker's shop; he was not at home, he came in, in about ten minutes with Atkinson; I asked him how he came by this chair stuff, which I said I knew to be mine; he said he bought it of a countryman, as the other did; I asked him where he sold these chairs when made up; he said to Mr. Samuel, a broker in Moorfields, for two guineas and an half, Arnold said he sold them for three guineas and an half, to a gentleman that came by promiscuously, and that the gentleman had his own porter, and took them away immediately; there their evidence differed, from whence I concluded that they were both rogues, and I took them before the Justice; while Shepherd was going to the Justice, he confessed to the runner, that if I went to Arnold's house, I should there find a feather bed, and sundry articles of my property; we went there, and the officer asked him whose bed it was, and I said whose bed is this John? why, says he, I perceive 
               
                  Jeremiah
                   Shepherd
               



             has turned my for, and therefore I will confess the whole; it is yours, and that bed furniture is yours, and I hope you will pardon me, for I was drawn in: we found at Arnold's, a bed, bed tick and bolster case, and pillow case filled with feathers, a superfine quilt, a ten quarter blanket, a sender, a checque bed furniture, consisting of sundry pieces, which I believe are mentioned in the indictment; a tea chest and a tea board, they were all that I found at Arnold's, which I took to my own house.
Were all these things acknowledged by Arnold to be yours? - All, except the tea board and the tea chest.
What did he say about them? - They escaped our notice at the time; when they were brought before the Justice, the Justice asked them, if they had stolen any other goods; Shepherd said, there was a card table, and some other things: the Justice asked him who helped to carry away those things? he said, one Ford a porter: on the second hearing, this Ford was brought before Mr. Justice Staples, and was enquired of by the Justice what things he had assisted in carrying away; the prisoners were there, and he mentioned that he had carried away a table, and sundry feathers, and a feather bed, and some pieces of Tekoa wood, which were tied up at my warehouse, I found the caddy that they mentioned, and I found a bolster, two pillows, and three blankets, the carpet and table, a coffee pot and tea board, these were all my property, except the coffee pot.

                   ATKINSON
               



             sworn.
I am a chair-maker, I worked up some stuff for the prisoners, I believe it to be Mr. Rumball's wood, but I cannot swear to it, I told Mr. Rumball of it, when these men were taken up, I went with him to Shepherd, I heard Shepherd say, he took six of the backs of the chairs, and all the rest of the stuff, and that Arnold was privy to it; I went with Mr. Rumball to Arnold's.

                   STOKES
               



             sworn.
I am an apprentice to the prosecutor; I saw Shepherd take two pillow cases out of the dwelling house of my master; he said he wanted them for his own use, and a bit of mahogany, two or three bits of Tekoa wood, and a pillow case with feathers in it.
All at one time? - At different times.
How old are you? - Sixteen.
When did you first tell your master of this affair? - After it was found out.
Court. It is a bad beginning, young man, you are very young, take care and do not connive at any such thing again.

             sworn.
I live at No. 3, Cox's court, Aldersgate street, I lodged at Mrs. Faulkner's, No. 16, opposite the White Raven; a Mrs. Bolton came there, and gave me to understand a young man, which was Shepherd, lodged in her house, and had a bed and bedstead to sell; I went to look at it in King-street, Mile-end new town, we saw it, four pounds fifteen shillings was the price; there was a bedstead, bolster, two pillows, and three blankets, the tick was very old, I was no judge of the price; I bought it of Shepherd, and he brought it me over; he said he had some more things that he was obliged to pledge, accordingly he brought me a carpet one guinea and a half, a card table, 23 s. a tea tray, 4 s. a coffee pot, 2 s. which I also purchased on the 19th of September; I removed with my furniture, and on the 25th, my friend came to inform me there was a search warrant after the things, that they were stolen; the prosecutor came and looked at them, and bid me not make myself uneasy, for I had bought them at a fair price; they were fetched from me by order of the Justice; and I hope you will take it into your consideration, and let me have them again.
PRISONER SHEPHERD's DEFENCE.
Arnold and I kept a broker's shop, about six months, and we lent a man some money, about twenty guineas that we had saved, and he ran away with it, and the goods we had by us we parted; he took his, and I took mine; I was out of place a good while, and I parted with all my things, and I sold my goods to this lady.
How came you by those goods? - We were buying and selling goods every day, as other brokers are.
How came you to tell that some of Mr. Rumball's things would be found at Arnold's? - If I said that, it is more than I know; I have no friend.
PRISONER ARNOLD's DEFENCE.
We were in the brokers way, we bought goods at different times? - I know nothing of these goods, he brought them to my house when we commenced partnership; Mr. Rumbold came in, and said, these goods are mine, and 
               
                  Jeremiah
                   Shepherd
               



            , your friend as you think, has turned your foe, and has tried to hang you; whereas when I came to the Justice the prisoner told me secretly, that Rumball had promised me lenity on previously confessing these things which he did, I work very hard for my living, and do not live by thieving: we thought our trial would not come on till tomorrow morning, then we should have had plenty of respectable housekeepers to speak for us, and counsel to plead for us.

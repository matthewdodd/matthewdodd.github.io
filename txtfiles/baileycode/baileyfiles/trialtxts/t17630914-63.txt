The two boxes were sent with the quantities of silk mentioned from Friday-street, to the Ram Inn, in Smithfield, on the 16th of July, to be delivered at Coventry; by some means or other they were packed in a sheet, and sent by the York waggon to Doncaster, and from thence to Pitsmore, about a mile and a half from Barrsley, to the house of John Wright, brother-in-law to the prisoner, where the prisoner went after them, and there said they were his property. Application being made to Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            , upon some suspicion they were gone by a waggon to Yorkshire, Sir John wrote to Mr. Wood, a justice of the peace there, to make enquiry about them, by which means they were found, and sealed with Mr. Wood's seals, and sent back to London. (Produced in court and deposed to.) The prisoner was a parter at the Castle and Faulcon Inn, Aldersgate-street.

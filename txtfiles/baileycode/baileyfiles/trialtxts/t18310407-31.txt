, in Charlton-street, Somers'-town


. On the morning of the 25th of March, about half-past eight o'clock, I was in the parlour behind the shop, and heard a noise; I went into the shop, and saw the till laying on the floor behind the counter, and 2 1/2d. in it - there had been more in it before; the prisoner was behind the counter, kneeling on one knee, and he had a parcel under his arm - he flung it down, and ran out of the shop, towards Wear's-passage; I followed him, and gave an alarm - I came home, and seeing my sister at the door, I went again to Wear's-passage, where I saw the prisoner standing between two or three men; I am sure he is the man - I had left the parcel laying on the ground, where he threw it.

            . I keep the shop. I was at home at this time - I missed some coppers out of the till, and saw this parcel of crewell laying on the ground - it had been taken out of one of the holes behind the counter, and the till was on the floor; I missed the parcel from its place - this is it.

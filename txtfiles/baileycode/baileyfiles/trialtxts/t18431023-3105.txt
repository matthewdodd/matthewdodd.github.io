RICHARD NORBURY
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
20th of Sept., 2 metal cocks, value 6d.; 1 flannel, 1d.; and 1 bell-crank, 1d.; the goods of 



George Giles Weston Thatcher; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






JAMES FAULKNER
. I am a whitesmith, in the employ of George Giles Weston Thatcher, an ironmonger and brazier, at Clapham. On the morning of the 20th of Sept., about half-past eleven o'clock, the prisoner came to the workshop—he did not ask for anything—I saw him take the tap off the board, and put it into his pocket—I did not see him pick the brass crank up—he sat there a little while—I went in to see if my master was in the front shop, and while I was gone he walked out—this is my master's property.

Prisoner. Q. Did you see me take it off the bench? A. Yes—I can swear to this tap—I took it out of the boiler myself, and put a new one on—I saw you take it off the board on the window ledge, and put it into your pocket—you did not take it from one pocket and put it into another.





ROBERT MOORE
 (police-constable V 12.) In consequence of information, I took the prisoner into custody, searched him, and found on him these taps, this bell-crank, and several small pieces of iron, which are here.





GEORGE GILES WESTON THATCHER
. I am an ironmonger, at Clapham. I have seen this tap about the premises, on the bench—I cannot swear to it—there is always a good deal of metal lying about—the prisoner never worked for me—I have known him at work at different shops in Clapham for these two years.

Prisoner's Defence. It is my own property.





SAMUEL EASOM
 (policeman.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, from the clerk of the peace for Surrey—(read)—I was present at the trial—he is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 33.—


Transported for Seven Years.

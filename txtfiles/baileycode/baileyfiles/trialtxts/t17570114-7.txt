            . On Monday was se'night a person came from Mr. Baccon's in the Strand, and said a person had offer'd to sell some pewter to him, and desired we would come and look at it.
Q. What are you?
Phips. I am a journeyman pewterer to Mrs. Willey. I went there, and found the person that offer'd it to sell, which was the prisoner's wife. After that the prisoner was taken up, and he confessed, in my hearing, he took a quantity of pewter out, and he took these two dozen more than was wanted, and left them at his own house.
The constable confirmed that of the prisoner's confession before justice Cox.

I bought the plates. My mistress's man desired me to say what he did before the justice, and told me it would be the better for me.

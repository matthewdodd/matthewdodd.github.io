            . I am a servant to Mr. Obbard, who lives in Fulham


 parish. I saw the prisoner in my master's premises, between two and three o'clock in the afternoon, on the 29th of November; he was then going from the back part of the premises, and had got through the fence. He did not see me until I came up to him; he ran through a gap in the fence, and I secured him setting down,when I was getting through. On examining our premises, I found the lead in question wrapped up in an apron in the kitchen; it had been cut from the copper in the washhouse, and then carried into the kitchen. The prisoner said he never had been there.

            . I am a constable, and produce the lead. I have compared it with the place on the copper from whence it was cut, and find it tallies.

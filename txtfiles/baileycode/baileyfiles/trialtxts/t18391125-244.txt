SARAH WOOLFE
. I am the wife of Frederick Woolfe, a butcher in Church-street, Deptford. On the 24th of November, about nine o'clock in the evening, I was coming out of the back parlour into the shop, and observed Emmerson take a dish off the counter, containing some cooked meat—the other prisoner stood outside the window—I called my husband

and pointed them out going down the street together—I missed a piece of beef and other meat.

Cross-examined by
MR. HORRY. Q. Did you give an alarm? A. Immediately to my husband, who was in the back parlour.





BENJAMIN LOVELL
. I am a policeman. They were given into my custody—Mrs. Woolfe identified Emmerson as taking the meat out of the shop.





HENRY GUY
. I am a policeman. In consequence of information from a brother officer, I went and found a small portion of the meat lying in the kennel in Church-street.

Emmersons Defence. I was coming out of a public-house, and heard somebody call, "Stop thief"—the prosecutor came up and said I had stolen the meat—somebody came up and said I had not stolen it, but some other young man—he then went and caught hold of Frederick, and kicked and illused him tremendously.





HENRY GUY

re-examined. I produce a certificate of Emmerson's former conviction—(read)—I was a witness on his trial—he is the same person.

EMMERSON—


GUILTY
 Aged 17.—


Transported for Seven Years.

FREDERICK—


NOT GUILTY

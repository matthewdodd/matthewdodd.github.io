            . I can only say the linen is my property.

            . I am servant to Mr. Fryer. On the second of this instant, in the afternoon, about dusk, I was in the shop; I heard the glass crack; I looked, and saw the two boys at the bar at the window in the street; I observed Hewit's hand in at the broken glass, almost up to his elbow, and saw him draw this piece of printed linen (produced in court) to the hole; I went out, and brought the two boys into the shop.
Q. Was any part of the linen drawn through the hole?
Watkins. I believe there was some of it through, but my master's brother took it away from the place; he is not here.
Hewit's Defence.
I was making water, and this boy (meaning the other prisoner) took and pushed my arm in through the window; I have an uncle at Lambeth; I was at the workhouse there, and I ran away from thence.
Pouting's defence.
I was apprentice to a chair-maker, and was obliged to run away for want of victuals, and I was taken up the next day; I am 14 years of age.

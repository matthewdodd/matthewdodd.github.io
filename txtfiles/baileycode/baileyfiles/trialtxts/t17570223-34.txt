            . The prisoner came into our shop, and asked for three quarters of a yard of cheque. I had sold a customer eight pieces of Irish. Then I went to serve the prisoner. When she was gone I missed a piece of Irish, which was tied up ready to send to the customer that had just bought it. I called after the prisoner. She ran away, and I after her, and took and brought her back. I call'd my sister down stairs, and she found it under the prisoner's petticoats.

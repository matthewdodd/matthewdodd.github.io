GEORGE LAND TOWNSEND
. I am a mathematical instrument maker. On 14th Aug. I went into the Rose and Crown public-house, in St. Giles'—Murray rushed upon me, puffed a mouthful of smoke in my face, and took ay watch from my pocket—he walked backwards to the bar, and offered it to two women, who refused to take it—Keef rushed in between them and took it—this is it.





FRANCIS STAIN
. I am barman at the public-house—Keef came in about six o'clock—Murray had been there about a quarter of an hour—I went up to a female, and Murray went up to him, put his hand under his chin, and took the watch, from his pocket—he came towards' the bar and Keef took it—it was found at her feet.





GEORGE BASHFORD
 (police-sergeant, F 5). I was called—I saw Keef stoop down and drop the watch at her feet.

Keef. If this man gave me a watch I do not recollect it; I was very tipsy.

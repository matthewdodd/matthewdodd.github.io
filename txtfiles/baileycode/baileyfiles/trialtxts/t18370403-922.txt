HENRY LEADER. I am a merchant, and live in Great St. Helens, Bisbopsgate. In the afternoon of the 9th of March, I was in Lime-street, in company with Mr. Flood, and when I got to a passage leading to Lea-denhall-market, I felt something touch me behind—I turned round quickly, and taw the prisoner walking away with my handkerchief in his hand—I walked quickly after him—he seeing me follow him, began to run—I fol-lowed him into Lime-street, and when within a few paces of him, he threw down the handkerchief as quick as he could from him—I took it up and called, "Stop thief"—he turned down Cullum-street, and was caught just before he got into Fenchurch-street—I am certain of his person.

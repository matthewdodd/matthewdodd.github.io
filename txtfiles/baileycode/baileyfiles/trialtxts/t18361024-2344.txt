GEORGE WEBBER
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
17th of October, 3 half-crowns, and 1 sixpence, the monies of 



John Major, from the person of 



James Knight.






JAMES KNIGHT
. I am in the employment of Mr. Major, of Snowhill. I received three half-crowns and a sixpence from Mrs. Major, for my master—I had it in my hand at Mrs. Davis's beer-shop—the prisoner was there, doing a job—I was looking at the money in my hand, and he took it from my hand, and asked me what it was for—I thought he was going home with me, and it would be all the same as if I had it, but he did not do so—he was a servant of Mr. Major's.

Prisoner. Q. You put it into my hand, I put it in my pocket, and you said, "That is right, it will be safer there than in my own," A. He took it out of my hand while I was counting it, and asked what it was for—I told him it was for a bill.





JOHN MAJOR
. I am a brass-founder and gas-fitter in Snow-hill, The prisoner was in my employ as gas-fitter—I never authorized him to take any money from Knight—I sent him to do a job at Davis's—he never paid

me this money—he absconded with my tools and money, and I never saw him again till he was apprehended—he had been drinking, but was able to work—he was only four days with me.

Prisoner's Defence. I admit receiving the half-crowns, but not with intent to defraud him—I told the lad I would give it him directly—I went to the public-house to drink something, and was under the influence of drink—I went into Long-lane, and had a glass of rum with a friend, and staid with him all day.




GUILTY
.* Aged 29.—


Transported for Seven Years.
(There was another indictment against the prisoner.)

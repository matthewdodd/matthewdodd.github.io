JOHN LOVELL
. I am foreman to William Roberts, of Wigmore-street. In consequence of information, on the 8th of July, I ran into Harley-street, and saw the prisoner with a saddle on his arm—I cried "Stop thief"—he ran with the saddle, and threw it on a wagon—this is it, it is my master's—after a long race I succeeded in taking him.





JAMES HOLLAND
. I was in Wigmore-street—I saw the prisoner running up the street with a saddle—I took it up, and took it back to Mr. Roberts's.

Prisoner's Defence. I was out of work, and in great distress; it was a great temptation.

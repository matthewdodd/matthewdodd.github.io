            . I was coming along Fleet-street


 about the 12th of December last, and a gentleman's servant asking me if I had lost my handkerchief, I answered, that I had. He shewed me the person, who is the prisoner at the bar. I took her before Justice Fielding, where she was searched, and the handkerchief found under her arm. Produced in court and deposed to. She said she did not know whether it was mine or not.
Prisoner's Defence.
I picked it off the ground, tho' the footman said I took it out of his pocket.
Q. Did you feel any body pick your pocket?
Bulkley. I did not feel any hand in my pocket. I was looking in at a print shop; the footman declared he saw her pick my pocket, and was told that he need not appear here, because the handkerchief was found upon her.

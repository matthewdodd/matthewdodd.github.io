; I keep a chandler's shop
; the prisoner came for a farthingworth of beer on Wednesday last; while I was drawing it I saw him steal my scales: he went away, and I followed him to Brewers Hall; then I took hold of his coat, and he gave me the scales; after which he ran away, and I followed him, but Mr. Buck came out of the Cheshire-cheese alehouse and stopped him.
Mr. Buck confirmed the above, saying, at that time she had the scales in her hand.

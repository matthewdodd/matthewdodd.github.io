JAMES BRIDGER
(policeman.) Between eight and nine o'clock on Saturday evening I was on duty at Enfield-highway, and saw Challis handing a sack over Mr. knight's fence to Ship—he dropped it six yards from the fence—I took him—Challis jumped over the fence and passed us towards his house—I called for assistance—Serjeant Watkins came up—this is the sack; it was three parts full.

Cross-examined by
MR. MELLER.
Q. Did Ship say" Take Challis; he is guilty?" A. He said "I should not have done it but for Challis"—I knew them both in Mr. Knight's employ—I was twelve yards from them—there is no hedge where they were, only a fence—Challis jumped over as soon as Ship received it, and before I took him—I said nothing when he passed me—I took Challis on Sunday morning—I searched for him that night, but did not go to his house.





THOMAS KNIGHT
, Junr. I am a Farmer, at Enfield; the prisoners were in my employ—this sack is mine—it has my name on it—them mixture corresponds with mine.

Cross-examined. Q. Has not Challis borne a good character? A. Yes; he has been two years with me.




GUILTY.Aged 22.—Recommended to mercy.—





Confined Three Months.

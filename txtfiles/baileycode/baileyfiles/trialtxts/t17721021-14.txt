Mr. 
               
                  John
                   Brown
               



            . I am in partnership with Mr. Phillips and Mr. Buswell; we are linen draper


s; our house is in Corbet-court, our warehouse in Corbet-alley, Gracechurch-street


. The warehouse was robbed between the 22d and 24th of August. I was out of town at the time.


                  Robert
                   Tippler
               



            . I am servant to Mess. Brown, Phillips and Buswell. I was informed some pieces were stole out of the warehouse; I went to the warehouse, and I found the latch tied up, and the lock was upon the spring; I found it had been picked. I missed about fifty pieces of linen and cottons, and eight dozen of handkerchiefs. We found out seven yards of printed cottons about a fortnight after, of the same patterns that we lost, at one Abrahams, and 12 yards were stopt by a pawnbroker.
Barak Fleming. I am a pawnbroker; these three remnants (producing them) were offered to me to pledge, by one 
               
                  Sarah
                   Long
               



            ; upon my asking her some questions, she said she bought them for 2 s. a yard, at a shop in Hounsditch.
Tippler. One of these remnants has our mark upon it; the number is altered, it was originally 5308; there are two ones put before it, but it is with a different ink and is very visible.
Mr. Brown. This is our mark: we mark the pieces progressively, and this is the number of one of the pieces lost, the two other pieces are of the same pattern, but there is no mark to them.


                  Sarah
                   Long
               



            . These three remnants my shop-mate and I bought of Mrs. Abrahams; we were to have paid for them, being disappointed of the money, we were obliged to pawn them, in order to raise the money to pay her.


                  Eve
                   Abrahams
               



            . I sold three remnants of cotton to 
               
                  Sarah
                   Long
               



            ; they were part of eight pieces of cotton which I had of 
               
                  Moses
                   Levi
               



            , about seven or eight weeks ago; and which I sold to different people in remnants. I sold this piece to 
               
                  Sarah
                   Long
               



            .


                  Moses
                   Levi
               



            . I put eight pieces of cotton into the hands of 
               
                  Eve
                   Abrahams
               



             to sell; I had them of 
               
                  Isaac
                   Levi
               



            ; he told me he wanted to raise money to pay a bill.



                  Isaac
                   Levi
               



            . I delivered eight pieces of cotton to 
               
                  Moses
                   Levi
               



            ; I bought them of the prisoner 
               
                  Isaac
                   Asher
               



             eight weeks ago, at his house in Northumberland-alley; I understood him to be a dealer; I gave him 17 d. a yard; I understood he bought them in a sale.


                  Samuel
                   Hart
               



            . On Sunday was eight weeks, about five in the morning, I met two men at the corner of Gracechurch-street, dressed in brown cloaths, and flapped hats; they had little brown bags on their backs; there were two others in company with them; they were the prisoners, Asher had a bundle in his hand, tied in a handkerchief, Bochero had not any thing. I met them all again on Monday morning; two people came out first, one was Bochero, the other was a person I did not know; they passed me, then three more men came out of the alley, two of the men were in brown cloaths and flapped hats, who had bags as before, the third was 
               
                  Isaac
                   Asher
               



            , he had a bundle in a handkerchief the same as he had before.
- Keys. I found these remnants of cotton at 
               
                  Eve
                   Abrahams
               



            . (Producing them.)
Tippler. These are of the same pattern, but there are no marks to them.
The prisoners, in their defence, denied the charge, and called several witnesses (Jews) to prove that Hart had offered to sink his evidence for a sum of money, but they unfortunately contradicted each other.
ASHER 


               Guilty of stealing, but not privately in the warehouse
            .
BOCHERO 

               Acquitted
            .
See Bochero tried No. 636, in Alderman Crosby's Mayoralty.

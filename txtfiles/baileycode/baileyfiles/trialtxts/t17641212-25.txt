            . I lodge at the George, at Ratcliff


, and this black
, the prisoner, lodged there also: I had the coat and waistcoat on, on Sunday the 11th of November; I went to bed at night, and laid my cloaths in a box, but did not lock it, and missed them on the Wednesday after; the prisoner lay in the house that night: he left his lodgings on the Monday. I went to a black, who was a servant in the neighbourhood, that had recommended the prisoner, and asked where he might be found? he said, his name was 
               
                  James 
                  Turner 
               



            , and that he was to be found somewhere in the Strand: by enquiring about, I found him at the Golden-cross, by Charing-cross: I was told the coat was pawned opposite Durham-yard. I went there, and 
               
                  John

            , the servant, told me he had bought it of a Black, and had sold it again: the prisoner had let another Black have the waistcoat, who came and brought it to me: he is since gone with his master to Ireland. (The waistcoat produced and deposed to).
Q. What sort of a coat was yours?
Walker. It is what is called Pepper and Salt, a new one; I never wore it above four times.

            . On Monday, the 12th of November, the prisoner came with the coat on, to our house, in the Strand; I lent him twelve shillings on it, in the afternoon. He came again the next day, and wanted to sell it; I gave him fifteen shillings for it, and I sold it the next day to a man that accidentally came in, a stranger to me, for a guinea.
Q. to Prosecutor. What is the coat worth?
Prosecutor. The coat cost me about two guineas.

            . I am a victualler at Cock-hill; the prisoner came with Captain Oliver's servant, on Thursday the 1st of November; the servant said he would be bound for his honesty, and begged I would let him have a night's lodging, and said he would pay for it: he lay there Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday night: Mr. Walker lodges in my house; on the Sunday night he came in late; he was in bed after Mr. Walker, and got up after him in the morning; they did not lie both in one room; Mr. Walker did not miss his clothes till the Tuesday. I saw the prisoner in St. Martin's Round-house, and heard him own he took the coat and waistcoat, and had pawned the coat at the corner of Half-moon-street, in the Strand, for 15 s. and one John Peters, a black, had the waistcoat, who was servant to a Captain, that was to be found at the Anchor and Crown, in Woolwich: he said another man conveyed them to him, and they were to go halves in the money: we went to 
               
                  Heather
               


             the pawnbroker; he said he had bought the coat right out, and had sold it again; Mr. Walker sent a letter to Peters, and he came and brought the letter and waistcoat to him.

            . I went with Mr. Walker and Mr. Noise to the prisoner in the round-house:
He confirmed the account of the prisoner's confession.
Prisoner's Defence.
I lodged near Exeter 'Change; I could not get to my lodgings, so I lay at that house: I bought this coat and waistcoat of a gentleman's servant; I first pawned the coat, and then sold it out right. I went then into the country, and when I came up again, I went to the Golden Cross, Charing-Cross; there came some people and asked me what my name was? I said, 
               
                  James 
                  Turner 
               



            ; they took me to the round-house; they asked me about the coat and waistcoat, and said I had best confess it, because a girl saw me take them out of the house.

            . He was my Apprentice

, and is about 15 Years of Age. On the 25th of November he run away: My Wife said that he had robb'd me: I went up Stairs to look into the Drawers, and miss'd the Money and Goods. There were 13 Guineas and a half, a 36 Shilling Piece, five Half Crowns, a Punch-Ladle, six Silver Spoons, eight Razors and two Wigs, My Man went in Pursuit of him. About 11 or 12 o'Clock at Night he (the Prisoner) came to my Door, and seem'd to be sorry for what he had done; I had almost all my Money and Goods again: The Constable took them from him, and I saw none of my Goods in his Possession: They were all taken from him before I came Home, which was a little after 12, and I had no Conversation with him afterwards that Night.
Q. In what Part of the House was your Money?

            . I am a Constable of Trinity in the Minories, and I was out to search for this Boy three or four Hours, and could find nothing of him. We shut up the Gate of our Parish, and I told the Watchmen, if any such Boy was seen by them, to lay hold on him; for this Boy had been seen by one of the Watchmen. I laid hold on him, and found upon him six Silver Spoons, this Punch Ladle, a Portugal 36 Shilling Piece and the Guineas and half Guinea, two Perriwigs and seven or eight Razors, which I gave to Mr. Mears before he came Home. He (the Prisoner) was ask'd how he came by these Things, and he said he took them out of the Drawers.
Prisoner. He had nothing to say in his own Defence.

. On the 31st of May, about four in the afternoon, the prisoner stood loitering about my door for some time; 
               
                  Henry 
                  Cook 
               



             came and told me he saw the prisoner take a pair of shoes from off the corner of the window; I ran out, and in an hundred yards catched him by the shoulders; I saw he had the shoes, and made him bring them back again, and deliver them at the door: I took him before the Justice; he committed him to New Prison.
Q. Where was you at the time he took them?
Taylor. I was at work in the shop, on the other side the window?

            . I live next door to Mr. Taylor; I saw the prisoner loitering by the shop, and at last take a pair of shoes from the window, and was going off with them: I went and informed Mr. Taylor of it; he went and brought him back with the shoes.
Prisoner's Defence.
I was a little in liquor; this is the first thing of that fort that ever I did.

1940. 




JOHN BROWN
 was indicted

 for stealing 1 box, value 1d.; and llb. weight of cheroots, 15s.; the goods of 




Samuel Eldridge; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






MARY MARIA ELDRIDGE
. I am the wife of Samuel Eldridge—we keep a tobacconist's shop, in Church-passage, Greenwich. On the evening of the 22nd of Aug. we had some cheroots in the window—at half-past six o'clock I left for about ten minutes, to wash my child, and put it to bed—I did not miss the cheroots till the officer brought them—I then found they were gone from the window—these now produced are them.

Prisoner. Q. What do you know them by? A. Here is a pencil-mark on the box they are in—a young man marked them for me, to sell them by, as we had only just begun shop-keeping.





JOHN WHITE
 (police-constable R 180.) I met the prisoner on Sunday evening, the 22nd of Aug., with something under his arm, and, knowing him, I ran after him, and asked what he had got there—he said, "Nothing"—I found this box of cheroots on him—he did not tell me where he got them.


Prisoner. I was on the pier; a man came out of a vessel, and brought these; he asked me to buy them; he asked 10s. for them; I said I would give him all I had, which was 6s. Witness. He never told me so—he said before the Magistrate, the first time, that he bought them of a waterman, and on the second examination he denied it.





CHARLES WOOTTON
 (police-constable R 276.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction at this Court—(read,—Convicted 30th March, 1846, and confined three months")—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 18.—


Transported for Seven Years.

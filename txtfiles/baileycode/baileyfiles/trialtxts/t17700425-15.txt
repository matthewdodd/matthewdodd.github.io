            . I am a publican
 in Prince's-street, Leicester-fields


. The prisoner came into my house between twelve and one, and called for some beer; about two an evidence I have here found him putting my coat on, and his own over it, in the room where my coat used to hang. He acquainted me with it. I let him alone to see if he would take it away for about a quarter of an hour: then I went to him and said, Your coat stands out, what have you under it? he said he had a child there; then I said I must turn midwife: I unbuttoned his coat and saw mine under it, and made him pull it off; my handkerchief was in one of the pockets.

WILLIAM BARBER
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
31st of January, 1 tea-kettle, value 1s. 9d., the goods of 



William Wood.






HENRY GIBBARD
. I live with my father, who is a shoe-maker. On Saturday, the 31st of January, about half-past twelve o'clock, I was crossing the road opposite Mrs. Wood's shop, and saw the prisoner take the kettle off the window, and carry it away—I followed him, he saw me—I followed him to the Coach-and-Horses—he took up a brick and said, if I did not go away, he would break my b—y head—I stooped down to avoid the blow, and before I could get up, he was gone—I went into Whitecross-street, saw an officer and told him.





JOHN PUMMELL
. I live with my mother. On the Saturday in question, I saw the prisoner in Twister's-alley, carrying a kettle before him.





JOHN KERSHAW
. I was on duty in Whitecross-street—a boy came to me and said a man had stolen a kettle—I found the prisoner on Monday night last at the Refuge for the Destitute—I apprehended his mother on the Saturday—she had been to sell the kettle in Plough-yard.





ANN WOOD
. I am the wife of William Wood. This is our kettle—I lost it off the window-ledge—I sell hardware.




GUILTY
. Aged 30.—


Transported for Seven Years.

Before Mr. Justice Vaughan.

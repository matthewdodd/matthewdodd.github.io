            . On the 19th of May we lost a pair of linen sheets, three shirts, two white aprons, and a coloured apron, two pocket aprons, worth all together, sixteen or seventeen shillings; I was ironing in the room above, when the things were lost; the maid came and called out I was robbed; and I came down stairs and missed the things, some off a horse, and some out of the clothes basket: my servant brought the things back, and the prisoner; her name is

             sworn.
The prisoner was in our house drinking a pint of beer: my master keeps the Guy Earl of Warwick in Gray's-inn-lane




, a public-house; the prisoner afterwards went backwards into the yard, and when he came back again, he went into the back-parlour, and took those things out, a pair of sheets, three shirts, two aprons, and three linen towels, they were on the horse; he went out of the street-door, and I ran after him; he ran up Gray's-inn-lane, crossed Holborn into Castle-street; I halloo'd out, and he dropped the things just by Magpie-alley, in Castle-street; I picked them up, and Collingridge brought the prisoner to the house: my mistress has had the things ever since.

             sworn.
On the 19th of last month I was looking through my master's shop window, opposite Guy Earl of Warwick, Gray's-inn-lane, and I saw the prisoner run out of the house with his apron full of linen. As soon as he came out, I saw some of the linen drop out of the cloth, and he did not stop to pick them up, from whence I suspected him; I ran out of the shop, and called stop thief; the prisoner ran up Gray's-inn-lane, cross Holborn, up Castle-street; I kept my eye upon him till he got nearly the top of Castle-street, and then he turned the corner of Magpie-alley; and when I got to the corner of Magpie-alley, I saw Collingridge had got the prisoner by the collar; I am positive to the man.

             sworn.
I stopped the prisoner in Magpie-alley, I was coming up Holborn, running among the rest, and did not know who the thief was till he dropped the clothes; I pursued him, and catched him; I took him to Bow-street, I took him to the house first, for the woman to go along with us, and there the property was sworn to.

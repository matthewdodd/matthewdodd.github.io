            . I am Constable of the Night; and on the 11th of November last, as I went to the Watch, they said that there was one that had stolen some Cocoa; and it being found in his Lap, I was sent for by the Watchmen to take up this 
               
                  William 
                  Barton 
               



            . I came, and there was put out of his Lap three Pounds of Cocoa at Bear-Key.
Q. Did he say how he came by it?


                  William 
                  Carter 
               



            . He said that another put it into his Lap.
Q. Did he not tell you how the Person came by it that put it into his Lap?


                  William 
                  Carter 
               



            . No; he had a Nail that he broke the Hogshead open with, and said, that there were two nam'd Ned and Sal; and that was all that I could get out of him: He said that Ned and Sal would come (us'd to come) upon the Keys and carry off Tobacco. We found of one Hogshead the Head out, and a great many gone besides what we found upon him.
Q. What, did you find a Nail upon him?


                  William 
                  Carter 
               



            . Yes, my Lord.
Q. You talk of opening the Head of the Hogshead with that Nail.


                  William 
                  Carter 
               



            . He said another Person did it; but he had the Nail.
Q. Well; now see what they are worth in your Judgement, and how many Pounds Weight you think there was.


                  William 
                  Carter 
               



            . They are worth about a Shilling a Pound.
Q. To 
               
                  David 
                  Thomas 
               



            . What are you?


                  David 
                  Thomas 
               



            . I am, my Lord, a Watchman, and I was watching the Cocoa that Night. I search'd and I found all safe; but a little after there was one (Hogshead) found open.
Prisoner's Defence. It was not I, but another Boy, that broke open the Hogshead: The (the Cocoa) were put into my Lap by another. I serv'd my Time to a Chimney-Sweeper
.

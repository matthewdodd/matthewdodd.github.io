JAMES GIBSON.
I am a boot and shoemaker, and live in Guild fordstreet, Russell-square. On the 27th of May, the prisoner and a bigger boy came and took these shoes from the handle of the bell on the door-post—the bigger boy took them and gave them to the prisoner—I went to the door and saw the prisoner walking down to the end of the street—I took him with them—these are them—(looking at them)—they are mine.

Prisoner's Defence. I was going home, a man gave me the shoes, and said, "Here is a pair of shoes for you"—directly I had got them the prosecutor came.




GUILTY.***Aged 12.—


Transported for Seven Years

 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
13th of December, 1 fowl, value 2s. 6d., the goods of 



Gilbert Warren.


MR. CLARKSON
conducted the Prosecution.






WILLIAM MAY
. I am a watchman of Highgate. On the 13th of December, about a quarter past one o'clock in the morning I was in Southwood lane, and saw the prisoner and one Rutson—I knew them both—Rutson asked me if it was after one o'clock—I said, "Yes"—they were both walking down the lane at a sharp rate—they knew I was a watchman—they were coming in a direction from Hampstead—I know the passage leading to Mr. Langford's house—they went down to this passage, turned out into the field, and then set off running across the grass—in the course of the morning I heard of a robbery, and went to Hampstead, and gave information to the police there.





CHARLES ATKINS
 (police-constable S 91.) In consequence of information on Wednesday, the 13th of December, I went down the road towards Pancrasvale, and found the prisoner and Rutson there—I took the prisoner, and Rutson ran away—I searched the prisoner and found a fowl in his hat, which Mr. Warren identified—it was about a quarter past six o'clock in the evening.






GILBERT WARREN
. I live at Highgate, and keep fowls. On the night of the 12th of December I had some—I missed one next morning—I afterwards saw one in possession of Atkins, and it was mine—I keep then at the back of my house, in a roost which is not locked, except by a hasp to the fowl-house—a man must get over a rail fence to get to it—I saw it safe on the Tuesday morning.

Prisoner's Defence. I went out on Hampstead-heath one morning with a dog, and the dog brought the fowl out of a bush, and I took it from the dog—that was how I got it.




GUILTY
.* Aged 17.—


Transported Seven Years.

Before Mr. Justice Coltman.

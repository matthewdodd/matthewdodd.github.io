MARK RUSHMER. I am a linen-draper
, and live in King's-terrace, Commercial-road


. On the 2d of May I was coming out of the shop, and saw something dark put into the window; I had had the window repeatedly cut, and thought it adviseable not to have it mended, but to have a handkerchief nailed there - I went to the door, and saw the prisoner's hand in the window, taking out the handkerchief - he had forced away the nails - I seized him, and be dropped these five handkerchiefs, partly in the window and partly out - they cost me 10s. - he had moved them entirely from their place.

            . I was near the spot, and saw a mob - I went and found the prisoner in the shop, and had these goods delivered to me - I was taking him to the watch-house, and with a desperate effort he made his escape - he was taken a short distance off.(Property produced and sworn to.)

                  JOHN 
                  M'MAHON
               





             was indicted for 


               embezzlement
            .
MR. 
               
                  
                     WILLIAM 
                     WILLATTS
                  





               
            . I am an accountant
, and live in Parliament-row



. I have a variety of debts to collect; the prisoner lived with me as clerk
 chiefly to write, it was his duty to receive money from persons who came to pay it, on my account. I had to collect 5 l. 10 s. from Colonel Frederick; the prisoner never accounted to me for any money as received from him.
COLONEL FREDERICK. I am Colonel of the Surry militia, I paid the prisoner 5 l. in bank notes, for Mr. Willatts, at the office, I cannot swear he is the person - the man I paid wrote this receipt, in my presence, and gave it to me - I gave him a 5 l. note.
MR. WILLATTS. The receipt is his hand-writing; it is dated the 30th of May - I am certain he never accounted to me for it.
Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Are you in business alone - A. Yes; my brother lives with me as clerk. I have my cash-book and the prisoner's collecting ledger. it is not entered in his book; he ought to enter money as he received it.
Q. Has it not frequently happened that his receipts of the whole day have been entered in one large sum - A. He accounted to me once a day, he entered particularly every name he received from, and the amount - It never happened to my knowledge, that sums were entered in the gross, without the names - my brother never pointed out a transaction of that sort to me - I never desired the prisoner to give receipts in his name for money which never went through his hands - he never paid me money which was not entered in his book - I give no security for debts.
(The prisoner here put in an exceeding long written defence, stating, that the charge entirely arose from the irregularity in Mr. Willatt's accounts; that he made his accounts up at night from memorandums he made on the cash he took, but cash being taken by Mr. Willatts, occasionally from his cash-box, which left him to remember the particular persons of whom he received the money - that he frequently gave receipts in his name for money that never passed through his hands, and he was frequently obliged to keep cash till next day to recollect who he received a particular sum from; he could prove mistakes had occurred; that Mr. Willatts had, at various times, written for accounts which were paid - he had frequently called at the office since he left.)
MR. WILLATTS re-examined. He came into my service in August, 1819, and left the 20th of September, 1820. I saw him often afterwards. I preferred this charge in March. There have been instances in which I desired him not to enter in his book, money which he received; it was a cheque of 400 l. which I had lent a friend, it being a private transaction. I told him not to enter it.



               GUILTY
            . Aged 22.
London Jury, before Mr. Common Sergeant.
748. JOHN M'MAHON was again indicted for the 


               like offence
            .
CAPTAIN 
               
                  MATTHEW 
                  BOYLE
               



            . I paid a cheque of 5 l. 0 s. 6 d. at the prosecutor's office, in Paternoster-row. I cannot swear I paid it to the prisoner, but the person I paid it to wrote this receipt and gave it to me (read) the cheque was returned by my bankers, as paid in - I saw but one person in the office.


                  JAMES 
                  BARNES
               



            . I am clerk to Messrs. Barclay and Co. On the 1st of September, I paid this draft with five 1 l. notes and 6 d.


                  WILLIAM 
                  WILLATTS
               



            . The prisoner was in my service on the 1st of September; his duty was to remain in the counting-house. Captain 
               Boyle
             owed money to an estate I collected for; the receipt is in the prisoner's hand writing; he never accounted to me for it. I always send my cheques through my bankers.
Cross-examined. Q. Has the prisoner a cash-box in which he puts money - A. Yes; it is an open counting-house; the desks are elevated, it is impossible a cheque can be stolen. I have taken money from his box, but always entered it on a slip of paper which lay in it - I told him to enter on the notes the names of who he received them of, to prevent a loss by forged notes; but his cash-book was to shew who he had it of, and he was to enter it as he received it.
Prisoner. Q. Have not I told you I could not remember the name of a person I received cash from; and you said, keep the cash till you remember - A. It has occurred.
Q. Have you not sent letters to apply for money, when it was paid - A. Persons have called to pay money on the day the letters were sent, before they were delivered.
Prisoner's Defence. After I left, I called on Mr. Willatts, and if I was guilty, it is not likely I should call. I received money when he discharged me, and forgot to pay it, but left it afterwards.

             re-examined. I remember a small sum being returned, having been kept back by mistake - I did not know of this loss till March.

            . I am a feather bed and mattress maker
, and live in Tottenham Court-road. Aver sleeps there as my servant. The prisoner was in my service nine days as porter
.
Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. You do not sleep in the house - A. No; I employ Aver to sleep there - he is a carpenter, but acts as my porter; he is paid according to what work he does.

            . I am a carpenter, and live in Tottenham Court-road. Last Saturday week I observed that the pin of the window was out, and on Monday, when the prisoner came I asked if he had taken it out; he said,
"I recollect that I took it out after you put it in, because I thought the shutter was not closed, and I forgot to put it in again." I left work about seven o'clock on Monday; it was dark; he agreed to go meet me at the Plough, public-house, in Carey-street, to drink. He said he was going to his brother's in Cavendish-square; he owed me 5 s. 4 d., and asked if I would have 5 s.; I said No; he put 4 s. into my hand, and said it was to get something to drink - we went about two hundred yards down Tottenham Court-road; he turned to the right as if to go to Cavendish-square, and I returned to the house - I had the key of the shop door. I went in, and sat by the fire, and in about half an hour heard somebody come to the door - I went on the stairs opposite the street door; the door was unlocked; it was locked before; I heard the lock go. The prisoner came in, and went into the shop, then returned, and bolted the street door, and called out Tom three times (master calls me Tom) he then took a chisel off the bed-rack, and broke open the parlour door at the back of the shop, which was full of beds, mattresses, and cloth; he had told me that he had carried a piece of cloth out of the cart into that room one morning; and when he got into the parlour he brought something heavy out, which I thought was cloth; he tied some cord round it, put it under his arm, and went out; I went to the door, but was so confused I could not open it; he had shut it. When I did get out I saw that he had just crossed the street - I called after him, but he had got too far. I went next morning with Dixon in Bishopsgate-street, and saw him, pointed him out, and he was taken.
Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. He knew that you slept in the shop - A. I sleep on the first floor. It happened at eight o'clock; he could not see me for the door hid me. I was put into the house to look after the house, and repair it. I might have stopped after I had finished the repairs, but I did not intend it. The goods belong to Mr. Dixon. I gave an alarm directly I got out; the watchmen were not on duty; the lamps were lighted; I could not see his face out of doors.
MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. If there had been no lamps could you have seen a man's face at eight o'clock - A. I could not. He could not see me on the stairs. I had been fitting up the house, and if any porter's job was to be done, I should do it. I had been porter at the old house in Barbican, and continued the same engagement.
COURT. Q. In what capacity were you engaged at Barbican - A. I carried out goods, and had 15 s. a-week. No new engagement was made when I went to this house, but he paid me 20 s. a week then.

            . I am in the employ of Mr. Middleton. This cloth was mine, and was placed in the back room - I saw it safe on the Friday previous, and gave nobody authority to remove it. I had the key of the room in my pocket. The prisoner had handed the cloth out of the cart - it was tied up - I cannot say whether he knew the contents; it was in different lengths. I was informed of the robbery on Tuesday morning, and went with Aver to Bishopsgate-street, where he pointed the prisoner out to me; I got a constable, who took him, and found two duplicates on him. I found some cloth like part which I had lost at Sowerby's; it was the same colour, quality, and quantity, but I cannot swear to it. I bought it of my brother Charles.
Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. How cameyou to have the cloth there - A. I was going to occupy the first floor. I had the cloth from my brother to barter or sell. I only found one length; I lost thirty yards.
MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. There were several lengths of cloth in the parcel - A. Yes; this length was among them.

            . I am servant to Mr. Sowerby, pawnbroker, Chiswell-street. On the 3d of April the prisoner pawned a piece of cloth, in the name of W. Jones; I am positive that he is the man.


                  JAMES 
                  AVER
               



             re-examined. This happened on Monday night, April the 5th.
MR. ADOLPHUS. This cannot apply to the burglary. I will proceed with the larceny.


                  CHARLES 
                  DIXON
               



            . I am brother to 
               
                  Frederick 
                  Dixon
               



            . I sold him a similar length of cloth to this; it is Oxford-mixed kerseymere.
Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. You do not swear to it - A. No. It measures two yards and a quarter; there are thousands of yards of that colour; I have no mark upon it. I never sold him but this one length of this colour. I believe this to be it.


                  FREDERICK 
                  DIXON
               



            . I had no other cloth of this colour - this is the same quality, colour, and length as I lost.


                  JOHN 
                  GREEN
               



            . I am an officer. I took him into custody, and produce two duplicates which I found on him.
Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. What account did he give of it - A. He said it was an article which he had sent out of the country by his friends, and that he pawned it.


                  JOHN 
                  LEECH
               



            . This is the duplicate I gave him; he said he lived in Sun-street.
Prisoner's Defence. I bought the cloth of a hawker in the street about a month ago, for 24 s., and in consequence of only receiving 5 s. of my wages on Saturday night I pawned it. I got drunk, which was the reason I did not go to work on Tuesday.

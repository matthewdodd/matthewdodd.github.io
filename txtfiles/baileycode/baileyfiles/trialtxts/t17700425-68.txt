            . I am warehouse-keeper
 at a merchant's warehouse in the Minories


. The warehouse having been robbed, I had men to watch. About five in the morning, on the 2 d. of March, I had notice a man was in the warehouse. I went there; we found a bag of tobacco, and the prisoner's cap, we knowing it (as he had worked for us.) He was taken up. (He is a Black.) He confessed the bag was lent to him by a man in Wapping. There was a hogshead of tobacco open, the property of Mr.

            , the same of that in the bag. The prisoner confessed he had dug a hole through the wall with a marling-spike, and had got in, and taken it out, and left it where it was found on the outside. His clothes had mortar dust on them, as if he had just been at work at making the hole in the wall. He confessed also he had robbed the warehouse twice before.

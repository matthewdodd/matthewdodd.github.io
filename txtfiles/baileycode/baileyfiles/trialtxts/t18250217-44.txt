JOHN KNIGHT. I am a cheesemonger
, and live in High Holborn


. I lost 3 lbs. of bacon on the 18th of January, about ten o'clock in the morning. I had seen it about half an hour before; the officer brought in the prisoners with it; they were strangers.

            . I am an officer. I saw the two prisoners next door to Mr. Knight's, at a linen-draper's shop, it was very wet and a window had been broken; they were trying to get something out of that shop but could not; they then went to Mr. Knight's; Williams took the bacon, he gave it to Littleton; I pursued and took them.
WILLIAM's Defence. I was going to look for some work with the other prisoner, and the officer took us.
LITTLETON's Defence. I saw the piece of bacon laying on the ground, and took it up.

            . I am Bryant's daughter-in-law. On the 22d of February, between two and three o'clock, the prisoner came in - he had formerly lived with us - he selected a set of fire-irons, brasses, and a tea-tray, and said he would send the money for them if his wife liked them, or he would return them - the boy went with him and the goods - I have not seen them or the money since.

            . I am in Mr. Bryant's employ. I went with the prisoner, and carried the goods; he took me into a public-house in High Holborn, called for a pint of beer, and told me to sit and drink while he went and showed them to his wife, and said he would bring back the money for what she kept, and return the others - I staid there three quarters of an hour - he did not return - I did not see him again till he was taken.

WILLIAM ATWATER
. I live at 25, Devonshire-street, Queen-square, in the parish of St. George-the-Martyr, and am a dyer. Last Thursday week I had two shawls, a handkerchief, and gown, hanging in my shop window, at about half-past eight o'clock—I left the shop for a few minutes, and went into the next room—there is a private entrance into the shop by an inner door—I left the shop door, at which the customers enter, locked—the other door was not locked—I returned in about ten minutes, and immediately missed the things—the shop door was still locked; the other was open, somebody had come in at that door, and taken the things—these now produced are them.





JESSE JEAPES
 (policeman, 146.) About nine o'clock on this Thursday morning I saw the prisoner, in company with another in New Ormond-street, about five or six minutes' walk from Devonshire-street—the prisoner had a bundle—I took him into custody—he said, "Jesse, it is all right"—I took from him the things produced.

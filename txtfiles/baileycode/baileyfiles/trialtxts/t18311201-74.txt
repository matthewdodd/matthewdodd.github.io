            . My father and mother live in Fetter-lane. On the 21st of October I took Lucretia Powell down the Strand - she is two years and a half old; she had a necklace on her neck - as I came back I saw the prisoner and some other boys at the beginning of Clifford's Inn


 - I heard them speak together; I came on, and a little girl said, "That boy has taken the necklace;" I saw the prisoner running, I pursued, and called Stop thief! a gentleman took him in Chancery-lane, and showed me the necklace.

            . I was in Clifford's Inn, and the prisoner ran past me; I pursued him up Chancery-lane to the corner of a court; I took him with this necklace under his jacket - I gave him in charge.

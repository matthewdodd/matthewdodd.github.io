             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am a hackney-coachman: On the 31st of October, I drove the coach, No. 66; between twelve and one at night I was hired by the prisoner Hall; I was standing in the Minories; Jones and Chapman were with him; I was hired to go to near the top of Crown-street, Finsbury-square; they told me it was to take some smuggled goods; I went to Crown-street; it was near four o'clock at that time; they took three bundles out of the coach, and I saw a crow taken out.
Q. Whose house was it, in Crown-street? - A. A person of the name of Batt; they took the bundles into the house, and the crow; then I went away; I afterwards went with the officers to the house, and shewed it to them; two of them were then taken in the house.
MARY BATT sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. On the 1st of November last, I lived at No. 19, Crown-street, Finsbury-square.

Q. Do you know the three men who were tried on Thursday last? - A. Yes; they came to my house about five in the morning, as nigh as I can recollect; they came, I believe, in a coach; I heard a coach stop at the door; they had several bundles with them.
Q. Did you see either of them with a crow? - A. I cannot recollect; they left the bundles in the house.
Q. Do you know Mr. Palmer when you see him? - A. Yes; that is him. (Pointing to the prisoner.) I saw him in the evening of that day, the 1st of November; he came to our house about these things; Jones was with him; Palmer and Jones went up three pair of stairs, where the goods were; I heard Mr. Palmer bid fifteen guineas, that was all that I heard; they staid together about half an hour, as well as I can recollect; the goods remained till the Sunday evening following; there was a promise of half-a-guinea from Palmer to take care of the goods.
Q. Do you know that, of your own knowledge? - A. No, my husband told me so; they were then removed to Mrs. Boreham's.
Cross-examined by Mr. Garrow. Q. All that you know, with respect to this business, is, that he offered fifteen guineas? - A. Yes.
Q. And then he went away, and there was no agreement made? - A. None at all.
Q. He was not present when the goods were removed afterwards, or any thing done respecting them? - A. No, he was not.
Q. Your husband is not here, is he? - A. No.
Q. Where is he? - A. I do not know.
Q. It would not be very safe to trust to any thing he says, because he is a man of infamous character? - A. He always worked very hard for his living; I have been in prison ten weeks.
Q. Were you married before your husband was here last time? - A. I have been married twenty-four years.
Q. You were married to him before he was here? - A. He was here through being very much distressed.
Q. Is he the same man who was convicted here of coining? - A. He was my husband.
Q. I do not know whether the last time was for putting the stamp of his Majesty's head upon a dollar? - A. I had nothing to do with that.

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am one of the city constables: I went to Mr. Batt's house on Monday, the 4th of November, in Crown-street; I searched the house; in the front room, up one pair of stairs, where I saw Hall and Chapman, I found this piece of paper with a piece of check upon it, and a ticket with some writing upon it; then I went up stairs into Batt's work-shop in the garret, and there I found this head of a piece of cloth with a ticket upon it, and I found an iron crow.
Q. The same things you produced upon the last trial, you produce now? - A. Yes; and in the bed-room I found a pocket-book; (produces it;) I went to Mr. Palmer's, on Safforn-hill, and searched his house, but I found nothing there; he was at home; Mr. Smith, Mr. Fearnley, and Mr. Laycock were with me when I was examining Mr. Palmer's papers and drawers; I said to him, you deal largely in this way; no, says he, I do not know; says I, you are one of the first going now; he told me, if he did, he did not do any at home; in coming along in the coach, I think he said, he might have had them, but he did not.
Q. Did he say what? - A. No; I told him that I was well convinced he had had the whole of them.
Mr. Garrow. Did you understand him to mean that they had been offered to him, but he had refused them? - A. Yes.
- FEARNLEY sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am a salesmam and slop-seller: I was present at the search of Palmer's house, with the prosecutor and several officers; after we had been in the house some time, one of the officers said, Mr. Palmer, you do a great deal of business in this way, you are almost one of the first; the reply that Palmer made was, that he did business, and seemed to signify in the way that the officer meant; but that he never did it at home.
Cross-examined by Mr. Garrow. Q. Those are the very words, are they? - A. I cannot take upon myself to be positive.
Q. Was it not, if I do, I never do it at home? - A. I cannot say.(The articles produced by Sansum were deposed to by Mr. Laycock.

Q. Look at that paper attentively? - A. I cannot write; but there was Lombard-street at the top, and, to the best of my knowledge, there was Palmer at the bottom.
Q. Do you recollect for what sum it was? - A. Yes, for ten pounds ten shillings; I am very clear of it, for I keep a coal-shed, and take many notes; she gave it me in a little box, I took it out and looked at it, and put it into a drawer, which is locked up.
Q. Had you any other paper in that drawer? - A. No; I had not one note at the time; on the Monday morning it was called for between light and dark, early in the morning, I was in bed.
Q. Were you able to hear the voice of the person who called for it? - A. Yes, it was Mr. Jones.

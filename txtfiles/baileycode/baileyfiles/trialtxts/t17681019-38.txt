            . Last Sunday I had been into Little Britain; coming home betwixt eight and nine at night, the prisoner and another boy followed me twenty yards; I felt my handkerchief going out of my pocket, I saw the prisoner give it to the other boy behind him, who ran off across the street; I secured the prisoner; he denied touching my handkerchief; he was searched, and two handkerchiefs were found about his neck and two in his breeches.
Prisoner's defence.
I am but fourteen years of age, my father is a weaver, and I am a draw-boy

            . About 5 in the afternoon, on the 4th of October, I was coming from Somerset coffee-house into the city, about five yards on this side Temple bar


 I felt a sort of a snatch at my pocket, I turned round, and laid hold of the prisoner's collar, (I had passed by him about three yards) and said I believed he had got something more than his own, and took him up against a door about a yard farther; I called my acquaintance back, and at the same time the prisoner dropped my handkerchief behind him. I took the prisoner, by mistake, to the Rotation-office, in Litchfield-street, before Justice Cox, and others, not knowing the fact was done in the city of London.
Prisoner's Defence.
As I found the handkerchief I thought it was my property, I was very much flurried when he laid hold on me, and the mob gathered round me, so I took and flung the handkerchief away.

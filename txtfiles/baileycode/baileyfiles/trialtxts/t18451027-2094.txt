ANN DAVIS
 was indicted

 for stealing 1 purse, value 1d.; 3 half-crowns, 2 shillings, and 2 sixpences; the monies of 



Richard Baker, from his person; and that she had been before convicted of felony.






RICHARD BAKER
. I am a skin-dresser, and live in Flower and Dean-street, Spitalfields. At a quarter before two o'clock, on Sunday morning, the 19th Oct., I met the prisoner in White's-row—she asked where she could get a lodging—I told her I would show her—we walked together not many paces, when I felt her taking her hand out of my left-hand coat-pocket, where I had had my purse containing three halfcruwns, two shilings, and two sixpences—I felt in my pocket, and missed my purse and

money—I told her she had taken it—she said she had not—I laid hold of her hand, and felt it in her hand—the policeman came up and I gave her in charge—she threw herself on the pavement.





SAMUEL EDGINTON
 (police-constable H 193.) I took the prisoner into custody in White's-row—the prosecutor was there—as we were taking her to the station she attempted to fling something from her—I caught hold of her hand, and took this purse with the money in it out of her hand—she began to struggle violently.





HENRY CHARLES PALMER
 (police-sergeant H 11.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction—(read—Convicted 10th June, 1844, and confined six months)—she is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 30.—


Transported for Ten Years.

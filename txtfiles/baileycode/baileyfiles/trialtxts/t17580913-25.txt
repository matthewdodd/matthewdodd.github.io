Elizabeth Bradshaw. My husband's name is 
               
                  Samuel 
                  Bradshaw 
               



            . On the 20th of February last the prisoner came into our shop, to buy a pair of gloves, he fix'd upon a pair at a shilling price; then he flung down a guinea, and desired me to give him change; I gave him half a guinea, and laid down 18 s. in silver on the counter, and was telling out his proper change; he took up some silver, and then flung down my half guinea and part of the silver, and took up his own guinea, and away he went, and said he would send for the gloves. When I came to tell my silver over, I found but 15 shillings; so I am certain he took away 3 s. with him. He was taken up for defrauding a young man, and as they brought him by my door I knew him again.
Q. Where do you live?

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. I am one of the pew-openers at Mr. Ford's meeting, at Stepney


; I live under the same roof; there is a communication from my apartment to the gallery.
Q. On the night of the 31st of March, did you take any particular notice whether the evening before the windows were broke? - A. I believe all was safe, but I cannot speak positively; about three o'clock in the morning I was disturbed by three or four watchmen ringing the bell; I got up and went into the gallery, and missed the dial; I then went into the meeting, and missed a woolen cloth, and several books.
Court. Q. The communion table-cloth? - A. Yes; every thing in the meeting was under my charge.

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. I am servant to Mr. Bingess, a cowkeeper, at Stepney, about a furlong from the meeting; I heard a noise, I looked out at the window, and saw three men come with parcels upon their backs, and deposit them in a little shed upon my master's premises; they came the back way from the meeting-house; as soon as they were gone, I went out, and found books wrapped up in a woolen cloth, and a parcel tied up in a handkerchief; I then alarmed the watchman, and came again to the spot.
Q. Did you make any observation of their persons? - A. Yes; I knew the prisoner perfectly well, it was a moonlight night; when I came back to the spot, I observed the things still there; I then went for some more watchmen, and when I came back, I found the prisoner in custody, I am certain he is the man; he was dressed in soldier's clothes, and had a light-coloured coat over his regimentals; I assisted in taking him to the watch-house.
Court. (To Ellwood.) Q. Did you observe how they got in? - A. They got in at the casementwindow of the meeting-house, by breaking it off.
RICHARD MORGAN sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. I am high constable of Stepney district.(Produces the property.)

Prisoner's defence. I had been to my mother's, and as I was coming home, I was stopped by the watchman; I known nothing of it.

            . I am a carpenter
, and live in Great Ryder-street, St. James's. On the 18th of November I was coming down Long-acre


 at half-past six o'clock in the evening, three men ran against me; the prisoner drew my watch out, I secured him instantly, and saw him hand it to his companions. He got from me, I secured him again instantly - he said,
"There lies your watch, Sir." I looked down and saw the case. Others came round, and I took him into a shop - a man brought the inside caseand the works in, and said it was thrown down an area. I was sorry I did not detain that man.
Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. It was dark - A. There were gas-lights. He was never out of my sight.

            . I am a porter to Messrs. George and 
               
                  Edward 
                  Robinson
               



            . Last Friday I went to fetch a pitcher of water; on my return I met the prisoner a yard from the door with these table-cloths in his apron. I collared him, and said he had something that did not belong to him. I put him into the passage - he said he was very sorry, and hoped I would forgive him. Another man came in, and wanted a ham bone; I told him we had not one - he said the prisoner was a poor man, and hoped I would be kind to him.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

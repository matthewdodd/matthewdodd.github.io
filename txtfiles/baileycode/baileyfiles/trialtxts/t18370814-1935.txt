 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
6th of August, 20lbs. weight of lead pipe, value 2s., the goods of 




Thomas Steppings, and fixed to a certain building; against the Statute, &c.—2nd COUNT stating it to be the goods of 



George Cullam Marchant and others.






THOMAS STEPPINGS
. I am a green-grocer, and live in Clare-market. I rent the house—George Cullam Marchant and others are the landlords—the lead pipe was all safe, fixed in the passage between the two kitchens, and on the 6th of August, about eight o'clock in the evening, I was sent for, as the water was running very fast—I went home, and in going down the stairs I met the prisoner with the pipe—I took him into custody—we have lost a great deal of pipe lately.





HENRY LAKE
 (police-constable F 103.) I was sent for, and took the prisoner, who was in the prosecutor's custody—I fitted the pipe with him—it fits exactly—it was in this sack, which the prisoner was carrying.




GUILTY
.* Aged 53.—


Transported for Seven Years.

James Black. I had missed one pair of breeches and the two aprons two or three days. I took the prisoner up, and charged him with taking them. He own'd he had taken them out of a two pair of stairs room in my house, and went with me to the pawnbrokers, where he had pawn'd them. ( The goods produced in court, and deposed to.)

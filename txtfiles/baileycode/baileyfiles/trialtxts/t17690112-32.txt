. On the 6th of Dec. last, the prisoner had been in my shop, under pretence to buy some things, and after she was gone, in about five minutes I missed the silk and cloak mentioned in the indictment. I advertised them on the Thursday following, the silk was stopped, and she also. I heard her confess she stole them from me, and also where she had pawned the cloak. I found it accordingly. (The silk and cloak produced and deposed by prosecutor and his wife.)

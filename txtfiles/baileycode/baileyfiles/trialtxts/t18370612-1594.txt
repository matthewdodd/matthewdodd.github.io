JOSEPH ROSELLI
 (through an interpreter.) I live in Soho-square, and am a doctor of law. I was at Greenwich on the 17th of May, at seven o'clock in the afternoon—I had a tobacco-purse in my side-pocket—I felt somebody touch my pocket—I turned round, and saw the prisoner with my purse in his hand—he let it fall on the ground—I collared him, and called the policeman, who took him.





WILLIAM PULLEY
. I am an officer. On Wednesday, a little before seven o'clock in the evening, I was in Greenwich fair in private clothes—I saw the prisoner, who was in company with two others, follow the prosecutor and another, and attempt their pockets several times—at last I saw the prisoner extracting the purse from the prosecutor's pocket—he dropped it, and I collared him—the prosecutor came and snatched the purse from me, and called, "Police," not knowing I was a policeman.

Prisoner's Defence. He says I took it out, and dropped it—the prosecutor says he saw it in my hand—I did not pick the gentleman's pocket—my father is head waiter at Green's hotel.




GUILTY
. Aged 20—


Transported for Seven Years.

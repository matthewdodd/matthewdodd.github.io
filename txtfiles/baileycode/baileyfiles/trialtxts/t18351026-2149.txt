HUMPHREY PERRY
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
3rd of October, I saw and spindle, value 25s., the goods of 



James Aston.






JAMES ASTON
. I live in White-yard, Whitecross-street, and am a wood turner—the prisoner worked for me—I missed a circular saw on the 3rd of October—I had been it sage the night before, in the workshop—I afterwards went to the Cock, in Golden-lane, and found the prisoner there—I asked how he could think of taking it—he said he certainly had taken it, but I had discharged him, and he could not live on the air, and he did it from want—I found the duplicate on his person.

Prisoner. I was taken to Worship-street on Saturday morning, and acquitted—in the afternoon he took me, and Mr. Aston came and said, "If you will tell me where the saw is, I will not prosecute you." Witness. No, I did not hold him out any promise in this case—I did for other things that he had stolen before, but not that one—he dropped the duplicate in the station-house, and then gave it to me.





WILLIAM MOORE
. I work on the prosecutor's premises. On the morning of the 3rd of October I went in search of the prisoner—we heard he had been taken and discharged—we went in the afternoon to the Cock—the prisoner came in, and I charged him with having committed the robbery

and said I wondered how he could do such a thing—he said he could not live upon air—I sent for the prosecutor.





JOHN BURLEY
 (police-constable G 50.) I took the prisoner, and produce the duplicate and the property.





HENRY LOOSEMORE
. The prisoner pawned the saw at our house.




GUILTY
. Aged 32.—


Transported for Seven Years.

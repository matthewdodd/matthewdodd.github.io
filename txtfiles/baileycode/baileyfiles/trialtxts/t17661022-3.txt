            . I am a master and corn-chandler
; the prisoner had work'd for me about three weeks: I was informed he was selling of corn; I found he had sold some to 
               
                  Edward 
                  Osbourn 
               



            , who keeps a horse and waters the roads; this is the sack which he had the oats in (produced in court) my property; there was three bushels and a half in his binn, which I compared with mine, and they agreed.
Q. Does the prisoner keep a horse, or deal in corn?
Rolfe. No, he does not; he works as a labourer to a bricklayer
; I found two other sacks of mine under the prisoner's bed (produced in court.)

            . I bought the oats which Mr. Rolfe saw, of the prisoner at the bar, about a fortnight ago.
Prisoner's defence.
My wife and mother-in-la w used to rake corn up, and I have thrashed them out, and that I have sold. 


               Guilty of stealing the sacks, but not privately in the warehouse

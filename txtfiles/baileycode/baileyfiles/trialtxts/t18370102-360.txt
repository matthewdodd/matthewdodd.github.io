LUCY CONNER
 was indicted for

 stealing, on the 
14th of September, 2 shirts, value 15s., the goods of 



Francis Clarke: and 




MARY ANN CONNER



 for feloniously receiving the same, well knowing them to have been stolen; against the Statute, &c.






FRANCIS CLARKE
. I live in Ann-terrace, Liverpool-road, and am a baker. Lucy Conner was employed occasionally as a char woman by me—I missed some shirts on the 6th of December—I had seem them safe perhaps a month before—she had an opportunity of going where they were—these are my shirts—Mary Ann Conner has come for a loaf of bread, but I do not think she had an opportunity of taking any thing away.





WILLIAM WEST
. I am shopman to Mr. Smith, of Lower-street, a pawnbroker. I have one shirt, pawned by Mary Ann Conner, on the 4th of November, in the name of Ann Baker.

Mary Ann Conner. I pawned a shirt about a fortnight before my mother was taken, but that was taken out again, and taken home—I did not pawn this shirt. Witness. She pawned it—I had seen her before.





THOMAS MORRIS HARVEY
. I am in the service of Mr. Goodburn, of High-street. I produce a shirt pawned by a female, in the name of Ann Baker—I know Mary Ann Conner, but I cannot say whether she pawned this.





JOHN WAKEFIELD
 (police-sergeant N 4.) I took both the prisoners, and found at Lucy's lodgings a pocket book with 52 duplicates, two of which relate to these shirts.

LUCY CONNER—

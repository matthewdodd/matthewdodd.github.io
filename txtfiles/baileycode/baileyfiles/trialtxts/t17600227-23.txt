            . About September last the prisoner was an assistant in my garden
, in cutting the trees. I had one evening missed six silver tea-spoons, and some other odd things. On the 24th of January last I had information that the prisoner had these things on his premisses. I went and got a search warrant of justice Welch, which I put in execution, and found the things mentioned in the indictment in his house. [Produced in court, and deposed to.]
Q. Where did he live?
Beete. He has a little house at Hampstead.

            . I am a constable, and found these things here produced in the prisoner's house; he said he found them on Mr. Beete's premisses.
Beete. The prisoner is a very active, industrious servant.
Prisoner's Defence.
I found these things on Mr. Beete's premisses.

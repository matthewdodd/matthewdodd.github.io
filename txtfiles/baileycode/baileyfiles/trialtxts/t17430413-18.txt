            . I am Executor to one Rhodes

. I lost four Tea-Spoons, one Pair of Silver Tea-Tongs, and two large Silver Spoons; they were the Property of Rhodes; he had a small Freehold and personal Estate, which he gave to 
               
                  John 
                  Johnson 
               



             and 
               
                  Mary 
                  Wishart 
               



            . I left the Things in Johnson's Custody.
Q. Has there been any Distribution of any Part of the Estate of the Deceased?
Lyddall. No, I have not distributed any Thing.
Q. Whose Property do you take them to be?
Lyddall. I apprehend them to be my Property, as I am Executor, on Behalf of the Legatees. I got a Search-Warrant, and had the Prisoner apprehended.

                  Johnson 
               



            . The Handkerchief and Ring are my own. - I bought the Ring with my own Money, the other Things were to be divided. The Prisoner pretended to be a Coachman. I have seen him at several Publick-Houses. He seemed to be destitute of a Lodging, and said he should be glad if I would take him in. I have known him twelve Months, and he used to appear like a Gentleman. I gave the Ring to 
               
                  Mary 
                  Wishart 
               



             to lock up; and it was locked up in the Chest of Drawers in the Bed-Chamber. He had laid in the House eight Nights before I missed the Ring. I lost the Handkerchief about two Days before. I charged him with it, and he said at first, he supposed I had it picked out of my Pocket. I left my Ring in one of the Drawers unlocked. I found my Ring and Handkerchief upon him about ten o'Clock in the Evening, the same Night that I missed them. What will you do with me now, said the Prisoner, I will give you this Spoon which I have changed at the Silver-Smith's. - He would have given me two new Spoons and my Ring to make it up with me, but I would not do it; for he had changed with the Silver-Smith, and given him seven Shillings. This Spoon is one of them which was lost, and found by the Direction of the Prisoner. He confessed the taking of them; he had the Handkerchief about his Neck, and the Justice ordered me to take it off. - I found the Spoon by his Direction at a Goldsmith's, and then he confessed the taking of them.


                  Mary 
                  Wishart 
               



            . I saw the Prisoner with the Handkerchief about his Neck, said I, How did you come by that Handkerchief? Said he, of the Maid Jenny; I said it was not his Handkerchief; and (I will not tell any Lye to be sure) says the Prisoner, If the Handkerchief is lost, some Body has picked it out of your Pocket. There were five Tea-Spoons, only I left him one of the Spoons to use; the Tea-Spoons, the Tea-Tongs, and Gold Ring, were locked up in a Drawer, and when I missed them, I could not speak for a Quarter of an Hour. I called Johnson, and told him the Drawer had been broken open, and that I believed the Prisoner had done it, and Johnson took him that Night; said the Prisoner, Mary, I am informed you have lost your Tea-Spoons; said I, so I have, and I believe you have got them; said he, G - d d - n you, you B - h, what do you mean by that, Madam? Said I, you Rogue you have them. I saw the Handkerchief and Ring taken from him before the Justice, and he owned the Fact.

                  Hastings 
               



            . I am a Goldsmith; the Prisoner came to my Shop, and brought these Tea-Spoons, a large Spoon, and a Pair of Tea-Tongs, about a Fortnight or better ago, and he gave me seven Shillings and Three-pence difference, between his old Plate and my new Spoons. Says he, If my Wife should not like these Spoons, you will change them? I told him I would. These are the Spoons I had from him, which were owned by Mrs Wishart.
Prisoner. Mr Johnson and I lodged at a Publick-House, and he said to me, Mr Birch, you are out of Place, you may lie here; but we had a few Words which occasioned a Difference; says he, As you want a little Money, there are some Things which are left between Molly and me; you may take them, and make use of these Spoons, but do not sell them out-right; and I sold them out-right without his Consent, and he charges me with stealing of them.
Johnson being asked whether he gave the Prisoner any leave to make use of them, said, that he never in his Life gave him any Leave to use, or exchange, or put them into his Custody, upon any Account whatsoever. 

               Guilty

                  Wilkins 
               



            . I believe I lett the lodging to the prisoner on the 18th of March.
Q. How many rooms?
Wilkins. One room; on the 10th of April a man that lodged in my house came and told me he believed I was robbed by 
               
                  Mary

            , he had been at the door and missed the glass out of the room; I went and met her just coming out of her room, she had locked the door and put the key in her pocket; I desired her to let me go in, she would not; I gave her all the good words I could, but could not prevail upon her so to do; then I desired her to walk into the man's room that had told me he suspected she had stole some of my things; she went in, but would not be prevailed upon to let me go into her room; then I sent for a smith to break open the door; when she saw the smith she said she would open the door; she unlocked it; when I came into the room I was very much surprized, for every thing but the bed was carried away, even as much as the chamber-pot; the prisoner told me she had got an annuity on an estate in Cranbourn-alley; I got two men to go with her to see if she could raise a friend to redeem the things; when they came back they said the people would not speak to her.
Q. Did she own she had taken the things away?
Wilkins. She did, and had pawned them.
Q. What things did you miss?
Wilkins. I missed a quilt, two blankets, a pair of sheets, two copper saucepans, and lids to them, a looking-glass, a copper tea-kettle, a pewter tea-pot, a brass candlestick, two flat irons, a pail, a frying-pan, and several other things more than are mentioned in the indictment. I went and got a constable, and took her before a justice, there she confessed where the things were pawned, some at one place and some at another. We went and found the quilt and two sheets, a blanket, one copper saucepan, and the copper tea-kettle, at Mrs. Hill's. We never could find the looking-glass. We went to Mrs. Kennet's the prisoner said she pawned the saucepan there; but we could not find it there. About a week after, Mrs. Hill went by our desire there, and asked for a saucepan in the name of the prisoner, and Mrs. Kennet gave her the saucepan, and said it was pawned for six-pence, and took seven-pence for it. The prisoner said she had pawned other things at Mr. Wood's; we went there, but could not find them; but Mrs. Hill went there, and she got them.

             the elder's defence.
The looking-glass I broke the second day I was in the room, and had the frame to a place to put a new glass into it. As to the other things, I told him where they were, and he went and got them again. He went to pick my pocket of the key, and threw me down. I told him he had no right to do so.

SARAH ROBINSON
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
28th of November, 5 yards of lace, value 5s., the goods of 



Thomas Woodcock, her master.






HANNAH WOODCOCK
. I am the wife of Thomas Woodcock, a publican,

in Broadway, Deptford—the prisoner was our servant of all-work for nearly five months—I discharged her, having missed property, and in two or three days after she was gone I missed other articles, and sent for the police—I know these five yards of lace—I missed three lace caps, and other things.





WILLIAM GARDENER
. I am in partnership with the prosecutor. The prisoner lived in our service about five months—we began to miss articles, and when she was apprehended I saw these three lace caps found on her—she denied having them at first, and then give them to me—the caps were found in her box before she left, and while I was gone for a contsable she went away.





JAMES WILD
. I am a policeman. I went to Mr. Woodcock's house, and followed the prisoner to her lodging in East-lane, Greenwich—on searching her I found three yards of lace.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

Prisoner's Defence.. They would not pay me my wages—I summoned them, and they then brought this against me.

MRS. WOODCOCK. I owed her 7s. 6d., and as she robbed me I would not pay her.

ANN WILSON
 was again indicted

 for stealing, on the 
11th of August, 1 watch, value 5l.; and 2 watch keys, value 6d.; the goods of

HERMENEGILD CASTELLAIN
. I live at Upper Clapton in the parish of Hackney. I had a watch on the 11th of August—I believe it was in the parlour, but I was in town—this is my watch.





ANN ANDREWS
. I am the prosecutor's cook. The watch was in the dining-room, to the best of my knowledge, on the mantel-piece; but I don't go into the dining-room—we had three servants sitting at tea, and one went to get the water, and saw the prisoner pass by; we went and took her before she got out of the premises—she said she had not got any property—she denied it—and I waited till the other servant went to see if the spoons were safe—they were and then I let the prisoner go—she ran off, I ran after her; and she said she had that about her she ought not, and if I would be quiet she would give it to me—she gave me the watch, and said it was the first thing she ever was guilty of in her life.

Prisoner. Directly she came to me, I said I had a watch, and it was not mine; I was going after the person who gave it me to pledge—the servant said if I would return her the watch I might go about my business—she then went and looked after her spoons, and then came and took me—I was quite taken in by this person—I should know the woman among a thousand.




GUILTY
. Aged 26.—


Transported for Seven Years longer.

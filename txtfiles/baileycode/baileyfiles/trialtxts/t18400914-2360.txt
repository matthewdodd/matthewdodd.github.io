ROGER M'CULLOCK
 was again indicted

for forging and uttering a request, for the delivery of goods.






JOSEPH CLARK
. I am one of the firm of George Marley and another. On the 6th of April, this order was brought by a little boy—I know nothing of the prisoner myself—I gave the goods to the lad, six pairs of half-fronts for boots—they were worth 18s. 6d.—the order is signed "J. Peyton," who is a customer of ours, and believing it to be genuine, I gave the boy the goods.

(Order read.)—"Messrs. Marley and Co. April 6, 1840. Please to send by the boy half a dozen footings, the same as you sent on Saturday, For J. Peyton, 2, Upper King-street, Bloomsbury.
"To Messrs. Marley and Co., Dean-street, Soho."





THOMAS BROWN
. I live with my parents. I took this order to Mr. Clark's—the prisoner told me to take it—I had known him before—he told me to go and get the things, and what I got I was to bring back to him—I got some leather at the shop, and gave it to the prisoner—he gave me 6d.

Prisoner. I never saw that boy before—where was it I gave it you? Witness. In Monmouth-street—you sold them in Connell's shop, I believe.





JOSEPH PEYTON
. The prisoner is a cousin of mine, but I have very little knowledge of him—he might know that I dealt with Mr. Clark—I did not authorise him to go to him for goods—this order is not my writing, nor is this name my writing—it is not a genuine order.





WALTER DALGLEISH
. I am an officer. I took the prisoner.

Prisoner's Defence. I did not write this order—I know nothing of it.

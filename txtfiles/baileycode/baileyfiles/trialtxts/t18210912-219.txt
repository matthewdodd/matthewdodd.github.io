. The prisoner was an occasional customer. On the 26th of August, he came for a pipe of tobacco, I looked through a crevice in the kitchen door and heard the lock of the till go. I ran out, pulled him over the counter, with half-a-crown and sixpence in his hand; he said it was the first time he served me so; I said I thought he had robbed me several times - he acknowledged robbing me six times.
Prisoner's Defence. I pulled out 3 s. to see what money I had, the gentleman came and said, "You rascal, you have been robbing the till."

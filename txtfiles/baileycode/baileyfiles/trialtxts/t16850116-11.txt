 on the 4th of January
, it appeared, that he being conversant in Halls house, and perceiving the People busie, found opportunity to possess himself of the Tankard, and with it made his escape, but not long after sending one of his Companions to a Goldsmith to sell it, it was stopped upon suspition, which obliged his Comerade, for his own safety to discover him, who resolutely denied the fact, but upon his Tryal, it appearing that assoon as it was missed he fled, not having any other reason to absent himself, and that he had challenged the Tankard, in the possession of the Goldsmith to be his, with many other pregnant reasons to believe him Guilty, he was 

               Convicted
             of the Fellony.

GEORGE HEATH. I am a watchman. After calling three o'clock I was passing Mr. Goddard's area, and saw something black over the cistern - I found it was the prisoner; I secured and took him to the watch-house. I found the lead pipe broken in three pieces, and doubled up in the area, it weighed 24 lbs. I heard something fall from him in the area.

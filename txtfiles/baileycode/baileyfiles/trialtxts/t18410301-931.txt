ELIZA CLARKE
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
20th of February, 1 sheet, value 3s., the goods of 



John Russell; and that she had been before convicted of felony.






JOHN RUSSELL
. I keep a house in the Almonry at Westminster. The prisoner and a soldier came to the house about eleven o'clock in the evening, on the 20th of February, and staid about a quarter of an hour—they were shown into a bed-room—in five or six minutes after they were gone, I missed the sheet—I went in pursuit of the prisoner, and found her that night—this is the sheet.

Prisoner. Q. Did you see me with it as I came out? A. No.





WILLIAM ARPIN
. I am a pawnbroker, and live in Westminster. The prisoner pawned this sheet with me that evening, before eleven o'clock.

Prisoner. It is false.





WILLIAM CLIFTON
 (police-constable R 50.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's conviction, which. I got at Mr. Clark's office—(read)—I was a witness on the trial—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 22.—


Transported for Seven Years.

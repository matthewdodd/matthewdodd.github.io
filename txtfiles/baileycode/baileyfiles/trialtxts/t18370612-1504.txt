1504. 




EDWARD JONES, alias
 Roots,

 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
6th of May, 1 coat, value 1l.; and 1 pair of trowsers, value 10s.; the goods of 



John Whitaker.






JOHN WHITAKER
. I live in Fulham-fields. On the 6th of May I left my coat and trowsers at the King's Head, in James-street, as I went to market, at four o'clock in the morning, and when I came back they were gone—I did not send the prisoner for them.





JANE WALTHO
. I keep the King's Head. The prisoner came early in the morning, and asked for Mr. Whitaker's great coat—I gave it to him, and I understand the trowsers were in the pocket.






WILLIAM DAY
. I am a pawnbroker, in Drury-lane. These trowsers were pawned by the prisoner on the 6th of May.





FRANCIS GILES
. I live with Mr. Russell, a pawnbroker, in Holborn. I have a coat, which I believe was pawned by the prisoner.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

Prisoner's Defence. I helped to unload Mr. Whitaker's cart that morning—he went round the market, and when he came back I was gone, and he charged me with the robbery—it is false about my going for the coat.

MRS. WALTHO. I swear he is the man.

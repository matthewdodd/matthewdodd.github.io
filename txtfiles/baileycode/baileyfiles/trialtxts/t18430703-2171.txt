PATRICK DELANY
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
27th of June, 14 sixpences, and 1 groat, the monies of 



James Watson; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






WILLIAM AUGUSTUS GOOD
. I am barman to Mr. John Watson, who keeps the Angel public-house, in Chapel-street, Westminster. On the night of the 27th of June I served a customer at the end of the bar—the prisoner was at the bar—he made a snatch at a pile of silver on the sideboard—he had no business there—I saw the money in his hand—he ran away—I ran after him and caught him—just as he got by the door he threw the money on the floor—some person picked it up and gave me fourteen sixpences and one fourpenny piece—I saw it picked off the floor—the prisoner resisted and tried to get away—I held him tight, brought him inside, and gave him in charge—I went to the 1l. worth of silver and there was 7s. 4d. gone.





JAMSS DOREY
 (police-constable B 48.) I took the prisoner—he said he need not attempt to get away, he knew that he was done.







JOHN FREDERICK BOHN
 (police-sergeant B 11.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person.

Transported For Seven Years.

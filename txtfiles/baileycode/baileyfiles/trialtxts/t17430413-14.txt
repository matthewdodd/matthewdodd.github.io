                  Harding 
               



            . On the 8th of December last, about seven o'Clock at Night, a Pane of Glass was broke in the Front of my Shop, in the Minories



, and I lost the Goods mentioned in the Indictment; (I had been robbed before, by a Pane of Glass being taken out of the same Frame) there were three Shutters put up in the Evening, and two of the Shutters were removed out of their Places. My Shop had been attempted to be robbed the Night before, but the Rogues being disturbed by some of the Neighbours, they moved off.
Q. Was the Shop quite shut up?
Harding. No, it was not. I had a Hatch to prevent People from coming in. - I know nothing of the Prisoner.

            , and myself, broke a Pane of Glass in the Shop-Window of Mr Harding, a Brasier in the Minories, and took out about twenty Papers of Buckles; there were both Bath-Metal Buckles and Steel Buckles; several Pair of Brass Candlesticks, and a round Brass Thing, which weighed about seven Pound, and some Brass Feet for Stove Grates. I cracked the Glass with a Knife, and the Prisoner pushed the Glass in.

Q. Who took the Goods out of the Shop?
Shields. We both helped to take the Things out: We put our Arms in and took them out. I sent him Home with an Apron full first, and then I got as many as I could myself, and went Home after him. We sold them in Rag-Fair for 26 s. and divided the Money between us.
Prisoner. What Part had I of the Money?
Shields. He had but five Shillings of the Money; for there was another with us who is since dead. We sold one Parcel for 15 s. and the other for 11 s. he had his Part of the first Parcel, but not of the last; we sunk that upon him.
Prisoner. I was a poor hard working Lad, only they drew me into their Company.
- Unwin. After

             was taken, this Fellow at the Bar lodged at Johnson's in Rag-Fair, who is just now discharged; and happening to meet with him in a Publick-House, I took hold of him directly. Oh, said I, What have I caught you at last? Says he, you have deserved me many a Time; you touched me last Sunday Night, but did not see me; you have sought after me many a Time but could not catch me; and you may be sure, I would keep out of your Way as long as I could. - It was his constant Practice to go a thieving, he had no other Way of living; he acknowledged the committing this Robbery. - I know him to be a grand Thief.
Prisoner. I desire to know what he gets his Living by, whether it is not by Thief-taking, for the Sake of the Reward.

            . The poor Fellow at the Bar came into my House to change Six-pence, and Mr Unwin came in, clapped him upon the Shoulder, and said he must go along with him; and, says he, Mr Harman. You must go and assist me. He said, Mr Unwin, You have deserved me many a Time. He owned he had been a great Failer. But now, says he, they have got me. - I do not know whether Shields's Name was mentioned then or not; I did not hear it mentioned. Jack, you know I never went after Mr Unwin. I know this poor Creature thinks. I went to this Man, and I swear I never was near him; if I would have had him taken, I could have done it several Times before now.

             the Goods of Josias Taylor, November 16

.
Josias Taylor. On Tuesday the 16th of November. I had a pretty deal of Business to do; and towards the Evening I ordered one of my Servants to hang the Doors on. I desired him to get what he could ready on Tuesday Night, in order to be sent into the Country the next Morning. - The Doors were shut; there is a Sash-Window on each Side of the Door, and Grates before them, which were fastened to the House. - I had 120 Pound Weight of Chocolate brought from the Office, which had been sent there to be stamped. It was brought in on the Saturday; and the Monday before the Tuesday Night on which this happened, it was put in the Window to dry, because it is damp when it comes from the Office. - It lay about two Foot from the Window. My Man was in the Shop heading two or three Barrels, and I was in the Compting-House; I saw the Chocolate fall down, and did not know but it might be the heading of the Barrels that might have disturbed it. My Man presently went to the Door, then came and called me, and told me that I had been robbed. When I came, I found that there was 26 Pound of Chocolate taken away, and the Grate was likewise taken away, and thrown into the Street, which I did not find till about two Hours afterwards. There was a Coachman going into the Green-Dragon Inn, his Horses would not go along, which was occasioned by the Grate lying in the Street, which the Coachman took up and carried into the Inn-Yard. At last seeing a good many People looking at something, I went to see what it was, and found the Grate lying in the Inn-Yard. The Chocolate was sold to one 
               
                  Jane 
                  Johnson 
               



            , who lives in Rag-Fair for 26 Shillings.

                  Shields 
               



            . The Prisoner, and one who goes by the Nick-Name of Cutos, 
               
                  Emanuel 
                  Hubbard 
               



             that is dead, and myself, went to Mr Taylor's in Bishopsgate-street



, shoved up the Window, and took out 26 Pound Weight of Chocolate, and sold it for a Shilling a Pound in Rag-Fair. - We all of us helped to take the Chocolate, every one had a Hand in it. - It was on the 16th of November.
Q. How did you get the Grate down?
Shields. This Cutos and 
               
                  Emanuel 
                  Hubbard 
               



             pulled it down by main Strength; it was so heavy that one could not lift it, and they carried it into the High-way, and laid it down there. - We shared the Money between us, which was six Shillings and Six-pence a Piece. - The Prisoner had his six Shillings and Six-pence.

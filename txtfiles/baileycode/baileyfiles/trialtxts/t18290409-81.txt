            . I am a widow
, and live in South-street, Chelsea


; I am a laundress
. On the 26th of March I lost a shirt from a line where it was drying; I saw it about twelve o'clock, and missed it about a quarter after four; I saw it the day following at Queen-square Office; I did not know any thing of the prisoners - this is the shirt.

                  John 
                  Watkins
               



             take the shirt off the line at Mrs. Wright's ground; he put it into Matthew Sellers' apron, and they all ran off in one direction - John Sellers was standing in the saw-pit. close to them, when they took it; I told my father what I had seen; there is no fence round the yard - I think it was between five and six o'clock.

                  Sellers
               



             and Watkins in the cricket-ground; Sellers was twisted up in an iron garden-roller, and Watkins was twisted up in the matting that is round the ground; I said, "What have you done with the shirt, you dogs?" they said, "We know nothing about it;" it was then about five o'clock - I took 
               
                  Matthew 
                  Sellers
               



             about eight in the evening, in South-street, where Mrs. Wright lives; he owned, when he was at the watch-house, that he had pawned the shirt in Sloane-street.

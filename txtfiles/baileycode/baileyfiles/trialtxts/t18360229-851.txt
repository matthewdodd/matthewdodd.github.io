EDWARD PATTERSON
 was indicted

for stealing, as the 
12th of February, 1 saw, value 5s.; 2 planes, value 6s.; the goods of 



John Perry: and that he had been before convicted of felony.






JOHN PERRY
. I keep the Ship and Sailor ale-house, in Church-street, Greenwich. I lost several tools—I had left home for a fortnight in February, and in my absence they were taken—I had used them the day before I left—the prisoner has frequently used my tap-room—I did not authorise him to pawn any of these articles.





EDWARD BOLTON
. I am an apprentice to Mr. Harber, a pawnbroker, at Greenwhich. On the 12th of February a saw and plane were pawned at master's by the prisoner—I recollect him—1s. 6d. was advanced for the two—I have the ticket.





CHARLES WILLIAMS
. I am a pawnbroker at Greenwhich. On Saturday evening, the prisoner came with this plane, which he wanted 4s. on—I asked him whose it was—he said his father's—I said I should like to see his father; and on the Monday he came and said, "Mr. Williams, my father says he is unable to come, and unless you advance the money or restore the plane, he shall seek further redress"—I was taken off my guard, and lent him the 2s. THOMAS LARKIN. I apprehended the prisoner at his mother's house, in Greenwhich, last Thursday—I told him the charge—he denied it, and said he knew nothing about the tools.
(Property produced sworn to.) JAMES WILD. I am a policeman. I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former condviction, which I got from Mr. Straight's office—I was present at Maidstone when the prisoner was tried and convicted there in March, 1834 (read). 


GUILTY
. Aged 19—


Transported for Seven Years.

Fifth Jury, before Mr. Common Sergeant.

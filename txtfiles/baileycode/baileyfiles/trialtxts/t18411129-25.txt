HENRY FAWCETT
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
16th of November, 1 cash-box, value 1l. 1s., the goods of 




Mary Winnington.






MARY WINNINGTON
. I keep the King and Queen public-house, in Distaff-lane. Between three and four o'clock in the evening of the 16th of November I was called down stairs—I looked into the bar, and missed a cash-box, which had been on a shelf in the bar about ten minutes before—this now produced is it—I had only bought it that morning.

Cross-examined by
MR. BALLANTINE. Q. I believe there had been parties in the bar? A. Only the bar-maid—no man had been there—the parlour and bar do not join.





FANNY CLOWSER
. I am the prosecutrix's bar-maid. I was coming out of the parlour, between three and four o'clock on the 16th of November, and saw the prisoner coming out of the bar—I said, "You have taken something out of the bar"—he said, "No, I have not"—I said, "Yes, you have, let me see what you have behind you"—I called Joe, meaning John Barton—when he came I told him the prisoner had been in the bar and taken something, but I did not know what—the policeman was sent for, and the box was round in the parlour under the seat—I had not seen the prisoner in the parlour.





JOHN BARTON
. I was called, and saw the prisoner going from the bar-door to the parlour—he went into the parlour—he was drinking with two more in the parlour—I went in to see what he had taken from the bar— the other two ran past me, and ran out—he was following them—I caught him—the cash-box was found under the seat, close by where they had been sitting in the parlour.

Cross-examined. Q. Had you seen these two men sitting in the parlour? A. Yes, not ten minutes before—these two men rushed past me—I am not the only person who serves.




GUILTY
. Aged 23.—


Transported for Seven Years.

THE REVEREND THOMAS HARMAN. I am a clergyman
. On the evening of the 24th of May I was driving down Regent-street


 - a carriage passed me, and a person in it called to me that my carriage had been robbed; I found the back apron had been cut, and this coat taken away - the prisoner was taken with it.

            . On the evening of the 24th of May I saw the prisoner standing on the hind spring of Mr. Harman's carriage, and take the coat out - he jumped down - I went and took him, and held him till a person came.

            . I was walking down the street, and saw the prisoner behind the pheaton - I saw Saunders take hold of him - he knocked off his hat, and then got away; I went up with some other persons, and said,"Gentlemen, you don't mean to let this thief go?" the prisoner said to me, "You b-r, what do you mean," and struck me in the eye - I have the mark of it now. I held him till the officer came up.

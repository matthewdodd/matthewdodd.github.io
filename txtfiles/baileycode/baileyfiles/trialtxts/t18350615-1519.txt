DAVID FRANCIS WEBSTER
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
3rd of June, at 
St. Pancras, 1 watch, value 4l.; 2 seals, value 22s.; 1 watch-key, value 12s.; 2 watch-guards, value 5s.; 2 purses, value 6d.: and 6 sovereigns, the goods and monies of 



William Charles Gault, in the dwelling-house of 



John Mann.






WILLIAM CHARLES GAULT
. I live with John Mann, in Clifford-street, Russel-square, St. Pancras. The prisoner was a joumeyman baker there with me—on Tuesday, the 3rd of June, I had a watch, seal, and six sovereigns safe in my box—I missed them about a quarter past nine o'clock next morning, and charged the prisoner with taking them—he denied it—next day I called a policeman, and searched his box, but found nothing—a cap was hanging above his box, with the duplicate of the watch concealed in the lining of it, and after that he owned he had taken the whole of the property—the watch is worth 4l.—he said, he had taken the Watch, two seals, and a key, and six sovereigns—he was charged with taking it all, and said he had—it was all in my box, and my box was broken open—I am sure he owned to taking the sovereigns as well as the watch.





THOMAS ANDREWS
. I am a pawnbroker. I have a watch which was pawned by the prisoner on the 3rd of June—I am certain of him.





RICHARD PASSEY
. I am a policeman. I took the prisoner into custody. I searched his boxes, and found the duplicate—he denied the charge, and afterwards acknowledged that he had taken the property, and put it under

the stairs, at the bottom of the bakehouse; and I there found the six sovereigns and two purses, two seals and a key—Gault took them from there.





WILLIAM CHARLES GAULT
. I found the sovereigns under the stairs—the prisoner told me where they were.
(Property produced and sworn to.)




GUILTY

Transported for Life.

Before Mr. Justice Coleridge.

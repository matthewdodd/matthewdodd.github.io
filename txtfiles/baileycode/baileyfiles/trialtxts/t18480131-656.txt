AUGUSTUS FREDERICK DANIELS
. I am assistant to Mr. James Thomas Hawes, a pawnbroker, in Whitechapel-road. I saw this vice safe on the evening of the 19th Jan., a little after six o'clock, by the stall-board on the threshold of the door outside—I missed it in half an hour—I saw, it again at Worship-street next day—it is my employer's.





GEORGE BARNES
 (policeman, K 256.) On 19th Jan., about six o'clock in the evening, I was in North-street, Whitechapel, with another officer—I saw the prisoner coming from Whitechapel in a direction from Mr. Hawes' shop—he had a vice on his shoulder—I followed him to a marine-store dealer's—he put the vice by the side of the door, spoke to a female in the shop, then took the vice on his shoulder again, and walked off—I followed him—he threw it down, and began to run—I took him to the station—he said a man employed him to carry it.





FRANCIS DEFRATES
 (policeman, K 61.) I was with Barnes, about six o'clock that evening. I saw the prisoner with a vice on his shoulder—I followed him—he threw it down and ran—he got over some fences, I went after him—I never lost sight of him.

Prisoner's Defence. A man asked me to take this vice to a marine-store shop, and inquire for a person named Palmer; I went, and was told to go three or four doors further; I went, and was going to knock; I saw the man that gave it me run off, and I was taken.





WILLIAM SMITH
 (policeman.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction—(read—Convicted Aug., 1847, and confined three months)—he is the man.




GUILTY

Transported for Seven Year.

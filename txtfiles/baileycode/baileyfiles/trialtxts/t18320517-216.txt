            . I live in George-street, Minories. On the 5th of May, about half-past ten o'clock at night, I was walking along; I felt something - I turned and missed my handkerchief; I saw the prisoner a few yards off, throwing it down - I pursued him, and he was stopped; I had not lost sight of him - this is it.

             (Police-constable G 171). I stopped the prisoner at the corner of Greville-street, Hatton-garden- I got this handkerchief from a young lady, in the prosecutor's presence: I saw the prisoner throw two handkerchiefs down, and I got another from him at the station.
Prisoner's Defence. I never had the prosecutor's handkerchief in my possession; I did not throw any away- the gentleman raised his umbrella to strike me, and I ran away.

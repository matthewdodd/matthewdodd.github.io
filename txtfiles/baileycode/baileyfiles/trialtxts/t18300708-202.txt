WILLIAM BOSHER. On the 30th of May, as I just turned the corner of King's Head-court, Shoreditch


, my hat was taken off my head, and taken away - I did not see who took it; I had a child three years of age in my arms- the prisoner ran round a corner, and threw my hat away; I came up with him as soon as the watchman had got him - my hat was in the road; it was about ten o'clock at night.
WILLIAM BURNESS. I saw the witness running near King's Head-court - he called Stop thief! and I saw the prisoner running; I crossed, and stopped him not more than a minute after I heard the alarm - I asked what he had been doing; he said Nothing - I said, "I think you have;" the boy then came up, and said, "You have stolen my hat;" and he brought the hat up.(Property produced and sworn to.)

                  Shakespear 
               



            . I live at the corner of New-street, Bedfordbury



; there is a hole in the window-shutter to let light into my shop; on the 29th of July in the night, the glass was smashed all to pieces, which was at the hole, and as near as I can guess, 3 dozen of breeches pieces, and 2 pieces of cotton for body linings, were taken out through the hole in the shutter.
Q. How big was that hole in the shutter?
Shakespear. It was big enough for a man to put his arm in; the breeches pieces were tied up in three bundles, with boards on the outsides, but we found the packthreads were cut and the boards left on the inside. We found some of the pieces upon 
               
                  Levi 
                  Hyam 
               



            , a Jew, who is here a witness; I went out that afternoon, and lay at Lambeth that night.
Q. Whereabouts was this hole in your shutter?
Shakespear. The hole is near the top of the shutter; the person must stand upon the ledge at the bottom of the window, then it was in his power to get at the things.

                  North 
               



            . I lodge at Mr. Shakespear's; I hearing a noise in the street got to the window; the watchmen were talking to my landlady; I went down and found the window was broke; this was about two o'clock.


                  Levi 
                  Hyam 
               



            . I am a colour-maker; the prisoner is a scourer; he gave to me eight worsted pieces for breeches to sell by commission.
Q. Do you know how he came by them?
Hyam. No, I do not know that: ( produced in court.)
Shakespear. Here are three of them have my marks upon them; they I swear to, the others are two threads and three threads, such I lost; I believe them to be mine, but not being marked, I do not swear to them.


                  John 
                  Noaks 
               



            . I found these pieces upon Hyam when I took him up, and have had them in my custody ever since; I hearing of a stocking-shop that was robbed, went and found out the prosecutor.
Prisoner's defence.
I was walking the street calling old cloaths; a man called me in Peter-street, Westminster; I went to him, and bought these pieces of him.
Prosecutor. I went to the prisoner to persuade him to be an evidence, as I thought there might be others concerned, but he would not; after that, when he came before Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            , he said he would discover something if he might be admitted evidence; but Sir John would not admit him.

(M.) He was a second time indicted for 


               stealing three cloth coats, value 8 l. two cloth waistcoats, value 10 s. the property of

            . I am a scourer and dyer
, and live in St. Martin's-lane



, near the church; I lost the cloaths mentioned in the indictment, and several others, out of my house, between the 6th and 7th of August; I went to bed about 11, and in the morning they were missing; they were hanging up by the window; the holes to let the light in, are cut like a club, called club-holes, through which the things were drawn; I advertised them, by which means I have met with one of them again; (produced in court) I had it to scower; all were the property of several people which I had to scower. Mr. Hutchinson came to me, and said he had bought one such as I had advertised.
Q. from the prisoner. By what do you know the coat?
Crips. Here is a slit under the collar, done by the owner's stock-buckle; it is the property of Mr. Bellamy; I have cleaned it twice, and know it well; it was taken away as it was wet, and it now appears in a rumpled condition, by drawing it through the hole.

            . I keep a sale-shop in Turnstile, Holbourn; I bought this coat of 
               
                  Levi 
                  Hyam

            . I had this coat to sell by commission for the prisoner; I had another, and that I sold.
Prisoner's defence.
I bought it and paid honestly for it; I had it of the same man I had the breeches pieces of; I have got witnesses enough here.
To his character.

            . I have known the prisone r about three years, he lived with me two of them; I never heard bad things of him.
Q. Has he a good or a bad character?
Myer. I never knew no bad of him when he lived with me.

            . I have known him between two and three years; he lived with a cousin of mine, and used to come backwards and forwards to my house for goods. He had a very honest character.

. I am a Debtor
 there, my Money was in my Breeches under the Quilt; she got her Discharge and went away the same Evening. I was very sick in Bed. She was brought into the Compter, July the 1st, for stealing Fustic. I asked her, How she could rob me? She confess'd it, and told me, she was persuaded to it by - Brown, and - Macdonald.

On or about the 10th of February, I, the Prisoner at the Bar, and the Prosecutor were all Prisoners for Debt, the Prosecutor was then sick, and attended by the Prisoner as a Nurse; she was brought in here again the 1st of July, I ask'd her, How she could be so barbarous as to rob the Prosecutor when he was sick, in distressed Circumstances, and a Wife and four Children to maintain? She said, she was persuaded to it; but if he would make a Debt of it, she would give him her Husband's Will and Powers.

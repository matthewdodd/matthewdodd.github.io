            . On the 30th of March last, as I was passing along the Strand, by the corner of Catherine-street, the prisoner came up and invited me to go with her; I refused; then she took my hat from me: in attempting to take my hat from her I lost the watch out of my pocket; (the watch produced) I am positive it is mine, and that I had it in my pocket a short time before; I missed it the instant the prisoner quitted me.

            . The prisoner took Harris's hat off, and ran into a house; Harris followed her in, and then he complained of losing his watch; I followed the woman and stopped her, and found the watch in her bosom.
Prisoner's Defence.
He had no money, and wanted to lie with me all night, and gave me his watch to raise money.

            . On the morning of the 22nd of September I saw the prisoner coming out of the prosecutrix's area over the rails, in Ampton-street; it was about ten minutes after six o'clock - he had no coat on then, but he put one on, and then I saw a bag handed to him; he took it, and I gave information.

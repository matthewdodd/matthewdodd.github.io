SARAH ANN TIDDER
. I am the wife of Joseph Tidder, we keep an umbrella-shop in Alie-street, Whitechapel. On the 8th of August, about half-past nine o'clock, I was in the parlour, and saw the prisoner enter the shop, and take five umbrellas and a parasol—he went out immediately—I ran out, gave an alarm, and he was taken—these are my husband's.





WILLIAM WILLIAMS
. I am a porter. I heard the alarm—the prisoner ran up an avenue leading to the White Hart—I pursued and took him—I took hold of the umbrellas, and said, "Where did you get these?"—he said, "I bought them"—I said, "You must return with me," and I laid hold of his arm—he said, "If you do not go away, I will stick a b——y knife into you"—I kept him, and gave him in charge.

Prisoner. Q. Did you see a knife on me? A. did not see you searched.





JOHN WILLIAMS
.(police-constable H 67.) I took the prisoner with the property—I found nothing else on him.




GUILTY

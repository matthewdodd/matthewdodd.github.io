I am a parish watchman. On Wednesday morning about twelve o'clock Isaw three or four man going along with the caravan in Drury-lane, at twelve o'clock at night; they were drawing of it, it had no horses at all; I thought it was some of Mr. Cox's men first of all; I saw them go down the lane and seeing no horses at all I made after them, and I came up to them just at the corner of Great Queen-street, in Drury-lane, and there they dropped the caravan and ran along, they saw me come over the way, and I went down Drury-lane, and I went through a court and I met Hudson coming back; the rest got off.
Q. How far was this from Mr. Cox's house? - Mr. Cox lives a good way off in Parker's-lane; the prisoner at the bar is one of the men that was shoving the caravan along; I have known him four or five years, he works sometimes in Drury-lane at Mr. Lucas's and goes with a Jack ass; he does any thing.

I am a caravan man to Mr. Cox; I was taking butts out of the Monday, and likewise was fetching them home; and on Monday night I shoved the caravan right against the wheeler's door; on Tuesday I was at work in sight of it all the day, and that the boys might not rattle it I chained it right against the wheeler's door. On Wednesday morning when I went to make use of this caravan it was missing.
Court. to White. Do you know the wheeler that he is speaking of? - There was a wheeler living in the street.
Q. How far from the wheeler's did you see it? - They had got it all the length of Great Queen-street into Lewkner's-lane.

Q. Was the watchman there when it was brought? - I don't know; I was in bed.
Court to White. What did you do with the caravan when they left it? - I left one of the girls to mind the caravan while I went down to the watch-house, and then I went down to Mr. Cox's and called the watchman to help to take it down to Mr. Cox's.

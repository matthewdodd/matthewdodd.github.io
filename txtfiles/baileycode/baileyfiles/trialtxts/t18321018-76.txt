. On Thursday, the 12th of September, the prisoner came into my shop, and I desired him to remain till I came back - I was gone about a quarter of an hour; he remained in my shop a quarter of an hour after I got back - when he was gone I missed a pair of boot-legs, which I found at Martin's; he had been in my shop several times.

            . I am a shoemaker, and live in Colville-court, Charlotte-street, Fitzroy-square. The prisoner came to my shop on the 9th of September, to the best of my recollection; he pulled out these boot-legs, and asked if I would purchase them - I told him No, but he pleaded poverty, and prevailed on me to buy them - I gave him 6d., and something to eat; they were not worth more than 1s. to me; I had known him before, and I think I had once bought a pocket-book of him.

 was indicted

 for that he, on the 
28th of April, at St. James, Westminster, feloniously did forge a certain order for the payment of 10l. 5s. 6d., with intent to defraud 



Christian Philip Dill, against the statute, &c. 2nd COUNT, for feloniously uttering, disposing of, and putting off the said order, well knowing it to be forged, with a like intent.







CHRISTIAN PHILIP DILL
. I am a baker and live in Oxford-road. I have known the prisoner about a year and a half—he lived as butler with a family which I used to serve—he came to my shop six or seven Weeks ago—my son was at home, and heard what passed—he came into the shop to my wife, and said he was now living at Stratford-place, with a family, and be wanted to have some biscuits sent to the house—he said Mrs. Cotton, his mistress, had dined out with one of my customers, and she was very foad of my bread; but the bread he could say nothing about at present, but we were to send the biscuits up before six o'clock that evening—I then went forwards—he said, "How do you do?" I said, "Very well" he said, "Can you give me change for a bill?" and believing him to be a respectable young man, I said, "Yes; "—my son was by my side, and whispered to me not to do it, but I did—I gave him change for a cheque, for 10l. 5s. 6d.—my son went directly into the City to receive the cheque, but returned in less than half an hour without any money—he went so inquire if Mr. Cotton lived where the prisoner said.

Cross-examined by
MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did you know the prisoner in Sir Richard Glynn's service? A. Yes; I thought he bore and deserved a very good character, or I should not have cashed the cheque—he did not tell me that he received it of a person who told him he was living at Mr. Cotton's—I was unwilling to prosecute him; it is his own fault he is here; I was sent for to the office, and said, "It is your own fault that you are here"—my son had met him in the street.





CHRISTIAN PHILIP DILL, JUN
. I was in the counting-house when the prisoner came to the shop—I went into the shop—he chose different sorts of biscuits, and begged them to be sent, about six o'clock, to Mr. Cotton's, 8, Stratford-place—while I was packing them up, he went into the parlour, and was speaking to my father—I followed, after finishing the biscuits, and found my father was changing the cheque—I advised him not to do it, in consequence of my suspicions on looking at the cheque, as the date was altered—any father said he thought it was good, and gave him the change—as the prisoner left, he said, "Be sure to send the biscuits by six o'clock"—I wished to go to the banker's immediately with the cheque—I went to Bosanquet's, where it was refused—I returned home, and mentioned it to my father, and went immediately to Stratford-place, to Mr. Cotton, and made inquiry—I met the prisoner accidentally about six weeks afterwards—he was on the opposite side of the way, in Regent-street—I recognised him immediately, but allowed him to pass me—he stopped, and looked in at a shop window—I passed him, then turned round, and found he had turned back—I turned into Castle-street, and saw him drinking a glass of beer at the bar of a public-house—I could not have a distinct view of him there, and let him come out again—he crossed over, and I saw that it was him—I followed him to Prince's-street, Cavendish-square—I touched him on the shoulder, and said I wanted him—he turned round, appeared rather confused, and said, "What for?"—I said, I dare say he knew—he said, "Let me go?"—I said no, I wished him to come to Oxford-street with me—he drew a paper from his pocket, which appeared the same sort of paper as the cheque was written on—I said, "You have got another of them, I suppose?"—he said, "Of what?"—I said, "You know very well"—he then put it into his pocket—a cab came by shortly afterwards—I asked the cabman to come down, as I wanted to speak to him, and in that time he put the paper into his mouth, and swallowed it—several people came round—I begged him to show what he was eating, but he would

not; and after he had swallowed it, he pulled out a piece of dry orangepeel, and said that was what he was earting—I gave him in charge for forgery.

Cross-examined. Q. Was the alteration you observed, the figure "8" to "28?" A. Yes—I should think bankers would refuse to take cheques when the date is altered—I advised my father not to cash it, on account of the alteration in the date—I do not think the prisoner heard me—he was two or three yards from me, and I spoke very low indeed I whispered very low—he could have gone out of the way if he liked I belive he was very anxious to get out of my way, or why should he pass me and turn back—I am not in partnership with my father.





JOHN HUNT
. I am a policeman. The prisoner was given into my cstody by the last witness, on the 24th of June, about a quarter after three o'clock in the afternoon, for forgiving a cheque for 10l. 5d.—the prisoner said he had not given him a cheque at all, nor had a farthing of money at all from him—I told him he must go to the station-house he said he could mot go—I said, "Why?"—he said, "Because I am a gentleman's servant and my master is waiting for me"—I said, "Where does your master live? you have no occasion to be frightened, if you have done nothing amiss"—he would not tell me where his master lived—I told him three times, if he would tell me where his master lived and he was detained at the station-house, I would go and let his master know; but I could not make him hear at all till I got to Old Cavendish-street—he then said, "I am a servant out of a situation is there any way by which I can escape?" I looked at him and said nothing—he said, "Can't you let me go?"—I said, "If I let you go, I shall lose my situation, and then we shall neither of us have a situation"—I asked where he lodged—he would not bear again—I said nothing more to him but took him to the station-house.





JOSEPH ALEXANDER COTTON
. I live at No. 18, Stratford-place. This is not my cheque, nor of any of my family-none of us bank at Bosanquet's—No 8 where it is dated from has been empty for the last two years—I never saw the prisoner till I was called to the station-house.

Cross-examined. Q. I suppose you do not sign your name S. Cotton? A. No; none of my family's Christiam names begin with S.—I am not aware that any other person of my name lives in Stratford-place—I have inquired but I cannot undertake to swear—It is not at all like my writting—I know a Mr. Sims a captain of a West Indiaman.





JOHN HUNT

re-examined. He did not state that he received the cheque of a Mr. Simms—he said he knew nothing about the cheque at all.
(The cheque, being read, was dated the 28th of April, on Messrs. Bosanquet, Lombard-street, for 10l. 5s. 6d., signed S. Cotton, Stratford-place.)

Prisoner's Defence. I am a poor man—I have lived in service but was out of employ at the time, and was glad to earn 6d.—I am entirely innocent of the charge, as it respects any knowledge that the instrument was forged, or it is not probable I should go to a person I sop well knew as Mr. Dill—he is mistaken in supposing I said I was in Mr. Cotton's service—It was the man who gave it to me—of course I am unable to bring the man forward from whom I got it, as he must be the man by whom it was forged or who knew it was so—I throw myself on the mercy of the Court.
(William Luce deposited to the prisoner's former good character.)

. In the evening of the 7th of February, the prisoner was in my house, and having observed him go to the back yard several times in a very short time, I kept my eye on him, and at last he was going to return into the room where he had been sitting; I observed something sticking out under his coat, and on examining him, he pulled out the end of the candlestick; I immediately sent for an officer, and had him taken into custody.

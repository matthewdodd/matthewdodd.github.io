            . On the 5th of this instant, between one and two in the day, I was coming down Dark-house-lane. On Sumer's key


 there were divers chests of snuff: I saw the prisoner with a canister in his hand, walking up Sumer's-key gate-way: I said, Hollo! what have you got there, my friend? he had got about 20 yards from the chests; he came back again with the canister in his hand: said he, I don't know what it is: I said, how came you by it? he said, he found it in the gateway. I had seen it in his hand before he came into the gateway.
Q. What was in the canister?
Linton. It is full of Havannah snuff; (producing it) when we came to examine the chests of snuff, one of them was opened.
Prisoner's Defence.
I was walking up, to look for some work, and found it on the ground. The gentleman said, Hollo! what have you there? I said, I don't know; if it belongs to you, you may take it.

ALBERT TAPPY
. I am a carver and gilder and live at No. 85, Crawford-street, Marylebone. I am in partnership with ray brother—we have one apartment there—it is the house of William or Edward Harris—the prisoner is my brother, and has been in our service—we had four oil paintings, framed, in our room, and two pieces of stair carpet—I saw them about half-past ten o'clock, when I had finished hanging them up, and again about half-past twelve at night when I left, the carpet was rolled up, I cannot say within a week when I had seen that—I missed the pictures next morning, about eight o'clock.





JOHN BOOKER
, shopman to Mr. Neal, pawnbroker, Duke-street, Manchester-street. I produce four pictures and two pieces of stair carpeting, pledged by the prisoner in the name of Frederick French, for his brother.





WILLIAM BEECHY
 (police-constable D 158.) On the 19th pf Nov. between twelve and one o'clock at night, I took the prisoner into custody. I told him I wanted him to go with me to the station—he asked, "What for?"—I said I believed it was for robbing his brother—he said, "Oh, I know now; I will have my revenge."





ALBERT TAPPY

re-examined. These pictures belong to me and my brother, and the carpet was under our care.

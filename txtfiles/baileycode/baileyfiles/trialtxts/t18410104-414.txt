WILLIAM JONES
 and 




THOMAS KING
 were indicted for

 stealing, on the 
21st of December, 1 coat, value 12s., the goods of 



Isaac Michael Myers and another; and that Jones had been before convicted of felony.






ISAAC MICHAEL MYERS
. I and my partner keep a general dealer's shop for slops and clothes, in High-street, Shad well. About ten o'clock in the morning of the 21st of December, I heard a pull outside my door, where my clothes hung—I ran out, and missed this great-coat—the two prisoners were pointed out to me—they were running a considerable distance before me—they were taken, and the policeman gave me my coat.





WILLIAM BRIDGES
 (police-constable F 38.) About ten o'clock I saw the two prisoners running up Albert-street together—Jones was carrying this coat over his arm—I took King—he said, "You cannot say that you have seen me in possession of the coat"—I did not see them together previously.





GEORGE JOHN BRIDGES
 (police-constable F 25.) I overtook Jones, and secured him—Gadsden picked up the coat in the course that the prisoners had run.






JAMES GADSDEN
. I met the two prisoners running—Jones put on the coat as we were running after him—he pulled it off, and threw it down, and I took it up.

Jones's Defence. I was in the Commercial-road all that morning, I was not in Shadwell at all; I was walking along when they came and took me.

King's Defence. I was walking up the street, and heard the cry of "Stop thief;" I ran, and the policeman said he saw me with the coat; I never saw Jones before.





CHARLES RANDALL
 (police-constable N 172.) I produce a certificate of Jones's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—I was at the trial; the prisoner is the same person.

JONES—


GUILTY
. Aged 21.—


Transported for Seven Years.




KING—
GUILTY. Aged 19.—Recommended to mercy by the Jury.—



Confined Three Months.

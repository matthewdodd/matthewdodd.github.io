ROBERT DRAPER
. I am a button-maker, and live in Wood-street, Cheapside. On the evening of the 29th of April I was in Milton-street—I was walking fast, and suddenly felt my handkerchief being drawn from my pocket—I put my hand down in hopes of saving one end of it, but it was gone—I turned, and saw the prisoner with it in his hand—he passed it to another man, who escaped with it—I seized the prisoner and gave him to an officer.





THOMAS MAQUIRE
. I am a constable. I was in Milton-street, and saw the prisoner stoop down and throw the handkerchief to another person, who escaped—I took the prisoner—it was eight or ten houses out of the City.





EDWARD M'DOWALL
 (City police-constable No. 76.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got at Mr. Clark's office—I was present at the trial, and know he is the man (read.)

Prisoner's Defence. This gentleman laid hold of me, and said I had robbed him—the officer took me to the station-house; and in going along, he said, "I know the one who took the handkerchief, and I will have him"—I have been in work ever since I left the Compter.




GUILTY
. Aged 20.—


Transported for Seven Years.

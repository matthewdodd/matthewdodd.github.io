            . I am the wife of Henry Moriarty; we live in Tash-street


. On the 26th of July, about half-past ten o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner in our passage - I saw her take this blanket off a line in the passage, where it hung to dry - she put it under her shawl - I was going to take hold of her, and said, "You have stolen a blanket;" she used a bad expression, and said she had not got it. I stood talking to her some time - she then dropped it, and ran away - she was quite a stranger.

I understand you received a parcel from the last witness? - I did.
What did you do with it? - The parcel was laid down on the desk, Mrs. Byde was then packing, she took the parcel and packed it in, then I took two pair of shoes, and put them in: I saw her put them in and lock the trunk: the trunk and me came to London, it was never opened during my journey; I brought it safe to the London Coffee-house door, there it was at my feet. I came to town on Tuesday, the 6th of February.
Court. Did you stop on the road any where? - Yes, Sir, I had been at Leeds and Manchester. I went into the London Coffee-house


, and was speaking about a lodging, and the postilion came in to know if I wanted a porter, and I sent for a porter immediately, and I stopped to talk to the gentlewoman at the bar about a lodging, she said, Sir, we have not a lodging, but I will get you one in the neighbourhood; when I came out the trunk was gone, I suppose I might be three or four minutes in the coffee-house; I always kept this box close by me, and I missed it instantly, it was the first thing I looked for in the chaise.
Prisoner's Council. Did you see either of the prisoners when you went out? - No.
So that all you know is, that you left the box in the chaise, and when you came out it was gone? - Yes.

You drove Mr. Byde from Barnet the 6th of February? - Yes, I drove him to the London Coffee-house: when Mr. Byde got out of the chaise, he had me unfasten the trunk, and he would send a porter immediately to fetch it in; there was a gentleman came out of the house, and he said, my lad, I want a porter to carry that trunk a good way.
Do you know that gentleman? - It was candle light.
Look about? - It was very much like that man's face (Stokes). I do think to the best of my knowledge, that it was that man came up to me; he came, and said, says he, I want a porter to carry that trunk a good way, says he, it is a very busy time for porters, and I have never a one within at this time, do you just step down to the New-Inn at the Old Bailey, it is not above twelve or thirteen doors at farthest; says I, I shall have something stolen out, says he, do you think I should desire you to leave your chaise and horses, if I did not take care of every thing that was there, he began to bully me, so I went and called a porter; I observed nobody else there: when I came back, the trunk was stolen.
Prisoner's Council. What time of the evening might this be, friend? - Between six and seven.
What kind of a night was it? - It was candle light, lamp light.
Where was you standing? - I stood with my back to the horses, and was unfastening the trunk.
Have you ever seen the man that you suppose was the man that gave you these directions as to the porter, have you ever seen him since? - Yes, I saw him once since in Bow-street.
What was your recollection as to that man in Bow-street, had not you a good deal of doubt? - Yes, I had.
You could not swear positively to him? - I could not, I cannot swear to him now.

             sworn.
You are a waiter at the London Tavern? - Yes.
Do you remember the day that Mr. Byde came there? - Yes, the 6th of February: I went out from my business to take in Mr. Byde's luggage, and when I came out of the coffee-room door, I saw a man at the chaise door taking this trunk out; I met him in the middle of the chaise, and asked him if he would permit me to take it in; I cannot be sure of the man, I believe it was the one in black (Gibson); I will not be positive, I believe it was him by his size, his hair and his features, his dress is something altered; his hair was thin dark brown hair, he had a brown surtout coat on, but to be certain I would not; he brought it, and set it down on the stone at the door, desiring me to go and take a trunk that was before the chaise, he said, take it off as fast as you can: I went to take off this trunk, and I saw no more of the man: the hat box or little trunk was gone.


                  THOMAS
                   BUCHANAN
               



             sworn.
I am porter at the London Coffee-house, I believe Mr. Byde came there on Tuesday, as near as I can recollect, I was sent out to help in with the gentleman's luggage that came in the post chaise; when I came there, I saw a trunk, and a man stand on one side of the door, and another on the other; I attempted to take it in, the man at my left hand side said, says he, let that down, you have no business with the house, If I was to see the man, I could tell you.
Look round and see if you can see him? I believe that gentleman in green is he, I am not clear enough to swear, but I have a strong idea that was the man; with that I did not like the looks of the man, I turned round and opened the door, and said to Mr. Leech says I, I do not like the looks of this man, there is some robbery going forward; I wish you would enquire where the gentleman is; and immediately the trunk was gone; I saw nothing more of the man, nor the trunk.


                  THOMAS
                   CARPMEAL
               



             sworn.
You are one of the officers belonging to Bow-street? - Yes, sir.
You had information of Mr. Byde's, having lost his trunk? - On Friday the 7th of February, about one o'clock Jealous Macmanus, and Clarke, and me, were going across Moorfield's, and we saw Stokes, Gibson, and one Barew, knowing them all we thought it proper to stop them and search them, we took them into the Red-Lion, a publick house in Moorfield's, I searched Stokes, and withinside his breeches, I found 40 bills wrapped up in this little handkerchief, I asked him what he had got there, he said he had got a rupture, and that was a truss; I said I had never seen a truss, let me look at it, I guessed what it was at the same time.
(The bills read.)
Jealous searched Gibson, and found a book which he will give an account of.
Court. What sort of a man is Barew who was with them? - A little thin man, short and very thin, about the size of Hart, but thinner.


                  CHARLES
                   JEALOUS
               



             sworn.
You are one of the officers at Bow-street? - Yes, I was walking with Carpmeal on Friday the 7th, and we saw Stokes and Gibson, and one Barew that was with them at that time; we apprehended them, I searched Gibson, and in his pocket I found the list of the different notes that Mr. Carpmeal found in the breeches of Stokes.
Prisoner Stokes. My Lord, I will be obliged to your Lordship to compare them.
(The list handed up.)
Prisoner Gibson. I can prove I had that book before this robbery was committed, and the same writing in it, it has now without doubt, my Lord, this man might put down sums to make it correspond.
Court to Jealous. Has that book been in your possession ever since? - Yes.
Is it unaltered? - Yes.
(Three of the bills shewn to Mr. Harrison)
These are three of the bills that were sent in the parcel, and delivered to this young man Beckford.
(The bills shewn to the Jury.)
PRISONER STOKES's DEFENCE.
I won these bills at E. O. the man I won them of said, if I would meet him at a coffee-house in Leadenhall-street, which is next door to the India house, he would give me cash for these notes, I was going to meet him, and on my way Jealous and Carpmeal took me.
PRISONER GIBSON's DEFENCE.
I was at work the day before, and all the week, till dark, I came from my work, and called at the Red Cross in Barbican, I went to Mr. Gammon's, a watch-maker's in Barbican, and was there at tea; the next morning I went to my master's to see if my vice was done, and I went out again to seek for a man to make me some more tools, and I was going back to fetch my vice myself, and he happened to meet with this Stokes in Old Street; and going along Jealous and Carpmeal laid hold of us, and what reason they had to lay hold of me, I know not, which am as hard a working young man as any in London. I had the book in my possession, and a person saw them figures in it when I pulled it out of my pocket the Sunday before, when I shifted myself.
Court. There is no sufficient evidence against Hart.
The prisoner Stokes called two witnesses to his character.

For the Prisoner Gibson.

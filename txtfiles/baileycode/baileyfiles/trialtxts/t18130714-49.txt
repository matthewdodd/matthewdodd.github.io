            . I am a publican
. I live at the Anchor and Hope, New-street, Shadwell. On the 4th of June, between eleven and twelve at night, I was going doing down the Minories


, the prisoner came running after me, catched hold of me, and asked me to go back with her home. I wanted to get away from her. She put her arm round my body, got hold of my watch-chain, and took it out of my pocket. Then I called the watch; the watchman came, and as the watchman came I took my watch out of her hand. The watchman took her to the watchhouse; I went with him.
Q. You had not been to any house with the woman had you - A. No. I never saw her before. This is the watch; it is mine.

            . M'Donald called watch; I came and took charge of her. I saw him take the watch out of her hand.
Prisoner's Defence. I was going through the Minories on the evening mentioned; I met the gentleman; I asked him where was the Mitre. When he was before the Lord Mayor he did not know that I was the person. He was intoxicated on that evening.
Prosecutor. I was not sober.
Q. to Parton. When you came up you saw him taking the watch out of her hand - A. Yes, I did, and she said he had torn her gown.

                  Chapman 
               



            , a baker
; I left my basket, with the quantity of bread in it as mentioned in the indictment, in Holbourn, at the corner of Leather-lane


, last Wednesday morning, between ten and eleven; I went with two loaves, one to Brook's-market, the other to Clerkenwell: when I came back about a quarter after eleven, my basket and bread were gone: in looking about, I saw the prisoner coming up Fetter-lane with a basket on his shoulder; I was pretty sure it was my basket; I followed him to near Holbourn-bars, and ask'd him if he had ever a stale loaf to change for a new one; he said he had no stale bread in his basket; I was resolved to follow him while he set it down; he went down Gray's-Inn-Lane, and never look'd behind him: at the end of the lane I met 
               
                  John 
                  Gray 
               



            ; I asked him to go with me, and see me take that basket off the man's shoulder; I thought it to be mine, and I wanted a witness, fearing he should charge me with stealing it; I told him what bread was in mine; then I went and took it from the prisoner's shoulder, and said, Is this your basket? the prisoner said, Yes, it is, I brought it from my master's just now; I then saw it was my basket, with the same quantity of bread in it: I took him by the collar, and call'd for a constable; then he begg'd of me to let him go, and said he had never stole any before; he made a deal of resistance, and attempted to strike up my heels; I got him into a house, and sent for a constable; he said he lived with a man in Petticoat-lane, and brought bread to two customers in Leather-lane; and that, coming down Leather-lane, he, by mistake, took my basket instead of his own: he mentioning the two customers names, the Justice sent me and 
               
                  John 
                  Gray 
               



             with him to these two customers. When we got about half-way down the lane, he took up a stone, and swore the first man that came nigh him he would knock down, and ran away; I followed and took him, took the stone from him, and cut the waistband of his breeches, and dragg'd him along to the Justice again, and he committed him.

                  Gray 
               



            , who met the prisoner and prosecutor in Gray's-Inn-Lane, confirmed the account given by the prosecutor.
Prisoner's Defence.
I am a journeyman baker, and served two customers in Leather-lane: this man assaulted me, and said I had his basket; I did not know I had it; he knock'd me down, and tore my cloaths; I did not know I was in any fault; I stood in my own defence.

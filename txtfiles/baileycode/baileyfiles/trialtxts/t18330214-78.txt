             (Police-constable, K 34). On the 28th of January, between seven and eight o'clock, I was walking along the Commercial-road; I saw the prisoner go up to the prosecutrix's window - I passed on about thirty yards, then crossed over and concealed myself; I saw him take something out of the window, he crossed towards me, I collared him, and took him back to the shop - I found these articles in his hat, and in his pocket this nail, with which glass is generally cut - he said it was his first crime, and starvation had driven him to it - there were two others with him.(Property produced and sworn to.)
The prisoner put in a written Defence, pleading poverty.

                  Wade 
               



            . I am deputy to 
               
                  Samuel 
                  Saville 
               



            , Esq; one of the clerks fitters at Wood-Street Compter. On the 5th of August last the prisoner came with a letter of attorney, and made affidavit that 
               

                        Margaret 
                        Campbell 
                     



                  , otherwise Mercer




            , was indebted sixteen pounds and upwards, for so much money received of the commissioners of the navy for wages due to 
               
                  James 
                  Neal 
               



             in his life-time.


                  William 
                  Mercer 
               



            . 
               
                  Alexander 
                  Wilson 
               



             extorted nine pounds and a note of hand for twelve pounds five shillings and sixpence under false pretences. He got my wife arrested by her maiden name, on the 5th of August, 1768, when nothing was due to him.


                  John 
                  Macoon 
               



            . I arrested 
               
                  William 
                  Mercer 
               



            's wife, by order of the prisoner, and was paid part in money, and part in a note. It was for sixteen pounds and upwards, at the suit of one 
               
                  Jane 
                  Nichols 
               



            . When the money and note were given, the prisoner gave me an order to discharge the woman out of custody.
Mercer. I paid the money. My wife having a child quite green with the small-pox, I was advised to pay it for the sake of attending the child. I was told, if it was not right I might easily recover it. I am satisfied my wife did not owe the money.


                  John 
                  Creswell 
               



            . I belong to the Pay-office.
Q. Do you know any thing of money being paid to 
               
                  Margaret 
                  Campbell 
               



            , due to 
               
                  James 
                  Neal 
               



            , or 
               
                  Neal 
                  Nicholls 
               



            ?
Creswell. I myself was accused by a letter with having received Neal's money due to 
               
                  Margaret 
                  Campbell 
               



            , for wages due on board the Ludlow Castle.
Q. Is that money paid, or still due?
Creswell. It is still due for what I know. I have a letter here to assure me that the money is not paid. The books are now at Portsmouth. I never did receive a farthing of that money.
Q. Was there wages due to 
               
                  James 
                  Neal 
               



             of the Ludlow Castle?
Creswell. There was.
Q. Do you know any thing of the prisoner?
Creswell. I never saw him till to-day, to my knowledge.


                  John 
                  Matthews 
               



            . I am a sea-faring man. This power of attorney, which I had of 
               
                  Wilson
               


             the prisoner, had another name to it that is scratched out; but not so much but it may be seen, and this name put into it. It was 
               
                  Neal 
                  Nicholls 
               



            , now it is 
               
                  James 
                  Neal 
               



            . ( Produced and inspected.)
Q. When had you that power of the prisoner?
Matthews. I had it of the prisoner that very day that Wilson was arrested by Mr. Mercer for the money that he had extorted from him.
Q. Has Mercer got his money again?
Matthews. No, he has not. The note is here in Court for the 12 l. At the same time Mr. Mercer's wife brought me the real letter of attorney, signed by Capt. Bateman, of the Ludlow Castle. The clerk searched and found out 
               
                  John 
                  Miller 
               



            ; that was the letter of attorney of 
               
                  John 
                  Miller 
               



            . Neal's money is open, and not paid now.
Q. What did Mercer's wife produce that letter of attorney of 
               
                  John 
                  Miller 
               



             for?
Matthews. To shew she received the wages due to 
               
                  John 
                  Miller 
               



            , not James Neal. When the prisoner saw this, he held up his fist and put his hand to his mouth and said, What a stupid rascal am I, to mistake the wrong name! It ought to have been 
               
                  John 
                  Miller 
               



             instead of 
               
                  John 
                  Neal 
               



            .


                  Margaret 
                  Mercer 
               



            . I have been married four years the 19th of October. My maiden name was 
               
                  Margaret 
                  Campbell 
               



            . I had a power of attorney to receive the wages of 
               
                  John 
                  Miller 
               



             about six years ago. I know nothing of a 
               
                  John 
                  Neal 
               



            . I know neither man nor woman of that name.
The prisoner in his defence owned he had made a mistake in swearing to what he had no knowledge of, and that the power of attorney was sent him up out of the country.



               Guilty

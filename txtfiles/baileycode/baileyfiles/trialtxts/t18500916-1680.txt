MARTHA TREVORS
. I am the niece of Mr. Dunman. I was walking with him and my aunt on 27th Aug. in Albany-road—I saw a little boy at a distance—he came up to us and took hold of my aunt's frock, put his hand in her pocket, and took her purse out—he ran across the road—I spoke to my uncle, and pointed out the person—he ran after him.

Cross-examined by
MR. HORRY. Q. Were you following behind? A. I and my uncle were behind, and my aunt was in front—the boy came in front of me.

ESTHER ANN DUNMAN
. I am the wife of the last witness, and was with him and my niece on 27th Aug.—my niece spoke to me, and I missed my purse, containing a sovereign and two shillings, out of my pocket—this is it; it is my own knitting—I had it safe when I was in the Dover-road—I missed it 200 or 300 yards from there.





JOSEPH WOODING
 (policeman, M 100). I received the prisoner in charge in the Borough-market, and at the same time I received this purse from a gardener in the prisoner's presence—he said he saw the prisoner throw it into a wagon—the prisoner did not say anything—it contains a sovereign and two shillings—the prisoner had passed by the wagon.

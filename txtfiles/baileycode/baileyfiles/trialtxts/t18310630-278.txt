            . I am a pawnbroker, and live in Gilbert-street, Grosvenor-square. On the evening of the 21st of May the prisoner came to pawn this box; I asked how he became possessed of it - he said he was the manufacturer; he seemed confused - I saw a paper sticking out of his pocket, which I took out, and found a shop-mark on it; I took him into custody; he then said he hoped I would not give him in charge, and acknowledged stealing it from his masters.

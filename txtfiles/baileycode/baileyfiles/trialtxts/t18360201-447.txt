JOHN HOLLAND
 (police-constable N 234.) On Sunday morning, the 10th of January, I was on duty in the Lower-road, Islington, and saw the prisoner with two bundles—I stopped him—he said what he had got was from his sister, who lived in Upper-terrace—he made a great resistance, and ran away from me twenty yards—I took him again—he then said he had stolen what he had in his possession—he had two half-quartern loaves, 5lbs. of veal, some dripping and butter, and other articles—this was about a hundred yards from the prosecutor's house—I have one piece of pork here.

Cross-examined by
MR. DOANE. Q. What time was this? A. Seven o'clock in the morning—he said, "I am guilty of stealing what I have"—I saw him before, without any thing, at the back of some houses.





FRANCES CLANIS
. I am servant to Mr. Richard Bolton. The officer showed me these articles at the station-house, on the 10th of January—I had seen the property all secure on Saturday-night, at ten o'clock—it was taken from the pantry in the area on the morning of the 10th—the safe was not locked.

Cross-examined. Q. Were you the last person that went to bed? A. No; I saw the whole safe, at ten o'clock at night—I can swear to this piece of pork—there are two servants—I am housemaid—I would have sworn to it any part of London.





JOHN GRINES
. I produce the certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—the prisoner is the person (read.)

Prisoner's Defence. I was coming along the road, and picked it up.




GUILTY
. Aged 38.—


Transported for Fourteen Years.

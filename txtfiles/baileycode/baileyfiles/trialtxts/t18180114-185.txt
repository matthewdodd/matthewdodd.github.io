            . I am an ironmonger, and live in High-street, Marylebone, opposite Mr. Padmore's; I saw three men standing by his door, the prisoner was one of them. One of them 
               drew
             the cloth out of the pile, which was inside the door - They had all three been talking together, and all three ran away together; I pursued, the linen dropped from one of them. I seized the prisoner, the others got away. I never lost sight of him. I am sure he was one of them.
GEORGE PADMORE. I am a linen-draper, and live opposite Mr. Allen's. The rope that fastened the pile was cut.
Prisoner's Defence. I know nothing about it.

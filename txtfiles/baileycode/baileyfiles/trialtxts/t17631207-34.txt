            . I am a journeyman coach-harness-maker
, and live in Drury-lane


; on the 21st of Oct. I went out about 2 o'clock, and left my watch hanging over the mantle-piece, with my wife and wife's sister in the room; I came home about five, and the watch was gone. The next morning I had information about it, and found it at Mr. Kates's, a pawnbroker, in Chandois-street; after which I heard the prisoner own he carried it there to pawn, and it was stop'd.

            . I am wife to the prosecutor; after my husband was gone out, I continued in the room till about half an hour after four, then I left the door open, and went down stairs; the prisoner came as I was standing at the street door, pass'd by me, and went up stairs; he returned again in about three minutes: I asked him what he wanted? he said he wanted Mrs. Foy, a washerwoman, who lived at the next door. I went up stairs about a minute after, but being attending my child, I did not miss the watch for a quarter of an hour.

            . I lodge in the same house, up two pair of stairs; the prisoner knocked at my door, about 4 o'clock; he asked for Mrs. Foy, a washer-woman. I told him she lived at the next door, upon which he went down.

            . I am a pawnbroker. On the 21st of October, about 4 o'clock, the prisoner at the bar came with a watch, and offered it to pledge; he brought the watch in one hand, and the key in the other: I had some suspicion of its not being his own, and he not answering cleverly to some questions I put to him, increased my suspicion; I thought proper to stop it: he went away, and said he'd fetch the man that owned the watch; he returned in about a quarter of an hour, and said the man that owned it was a cook at a tavern in Covent-Garden, that he was not at home. In the morning, one of Mr. Fielding's men came and told me it was a stolen watch. I knew the prisoner before; he appeared to be then much in liquor.

            , I am keeper of the Gatehouse; when the prisoner was brought in, he appeared in an odd manner, as if he was not in his senses.
The prosecutor and his wife said they had enquired in the neighbourhood, and found the prisoner did bear a good character before.
Prisoner's Defence.
I was very much in liquor, and am very subject to fits, and at times, incapable of knowing what I do.
To his Character.

            . I have known the prisoner 20 years by fight; he is a taylor, and work'd under the Ax and Gate, King-street; he bears the character of a very honest industrious man.

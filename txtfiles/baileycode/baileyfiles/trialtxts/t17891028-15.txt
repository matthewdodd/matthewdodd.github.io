                   Smith
               



            ; the prisoner took a shilling from out of my pocket, on the 5th of October, he took it from the room where I slept; I was in bed, sober, and awake; the prisoner slept in the next room; he came in half dressed, about six in the morning; it was light; he took my breeches from under my head, and took one shilling out of my pocket, and ran into his own room; I had two shillings more, and two or three halfpence; I ran after him, and taxed him with it.
Why did not you seize him? - I did not think proper; I thought it was proper to let him go into his own room with it, and take it away first; I went into his room as soon as I got my things on; he had not the shilling, but he told me wherehe put it; and I told him it would be the worse for him.

The prosecutor and prisoner worked for me, and lodged in my house; on Monday morning about six, the prosecutor charged the prisoner with robbing him; he denied it, but afterwards acknowledged that he took it.
Prisoner. I took it.

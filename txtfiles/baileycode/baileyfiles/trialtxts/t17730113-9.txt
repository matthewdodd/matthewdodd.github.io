            . On Tuesday the 22d of December, I was called by my daughter, when my young man (
               
                  Francis
                   Drake
               



            ) told me he missed a pair of silver buckles; he charged the prisoner with taking them; he denied it; I told my young man to fetch a constable, upon which the prisoner took my buckles out of his pocket (produced and deposed to by the prosecutor.)

            . The prisoner came to my master's shop, and desired to see some new buckles; I took out a drawer of new buckles; I turned my head, and immediately I missed this pair of silver buckles; I sent my master's daughter to call her father, who came down, and upon my being ordered to go for a constable, the prisoner took the buckles out of his pocket.
Prisoner's Defence.
I wanted to change a pair of buckles for these; I had them only in my hand.

            . His own buckles were very good ones: he had not money enough to pay the difference.

            . These are not the buckles he was cheapening but another pair.

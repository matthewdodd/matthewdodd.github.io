HENRY NOBLE
 was indicted

for uttering a forged request for the delivery of a dozen of port wine, with intent to defraud 



Edward Moseley.






EDWARD MOSELEY
. I am a wine merchant, and live in Gloucester-street, Queen-square. On the 19th of Jan. the prisoner came to my counting-house with this letter—(read—"Uxbridge-house, to Mr. Moseley, wine merchant, Gloucester-street, Theobald's-road, Jan. 19, 1843—Miss Mercer sends her compliments to Mr. Moseley; he would oblige Miss Mercer if he would send her by the carrier to-day, one dozen of the best port wine; Miss Mercer will call on Monday next—Please to send it good, and send the bill to Miss Mercer, Uxbridge-house, Uxbridge-hill, Middlesex—to Johns, carrier, Rose Inn.")—I had no dealings with a person of the name of Mercer, but in consequence of this order I sent the wine as directed, believing it to be sent by the person—I questioned the prisoner if he came from Miss Mercer—he said he did, and I sent it, after referring to the Directory, and finding there was a person of that name there.





MARY ANN MERCER
. This letter is not my handwriting—I know nothing about it—I did not authorize any one to write it.





JOHN BLOOMFIELD
. I belong to the Rose Inn, Farringdon-street—the prisoner came to me for a hamper directed for Miss Mercer, Uxbridge—I gave him in custody—he wrote an order for the delivery of it, but I could not deliver it for that.

Prisoner's Defence. I was employed by a gentleman to take the letter to Mr. Moseley, aud tell him to get the wine, and send it to the Rose Inn.

            . I saw the prisoner's in company with another in Drury-lane, following a gentleman. I followed them through Broad-court; they continually attempted the gentleman's pocket - they drew up close behind him in Plumtree-court. In a moment I saw Davis turn, and run down the court, doubling something under his apron - the other two passed the gentleman. I followed Davis, laid hold of him in Broad-street, and found the handkerchief under his apron. I took him into Plumbtree-street, and called the gentleman who claimed it. The gentleman is gone to Ireland - my brother secured Hendrick. The gentleman's name was 
               
                  Henry 
                  Longman

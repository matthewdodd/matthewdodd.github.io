GEORGE NEWBURY. I live in Hereford-street, Commercial-road


, and am a haberdasher
. On Saturday, the 17th of December, about twelve o'clock in the forenoon, the two prisoners and another lad came into my shop - my shopman attended to them - I heard all that passed; they asked him to show them some gloves - he showed them a parcel, and they made some objection to them, and came to the part of the shop where I was, for another parcel; I said, "Take care of those boys, for they are thieves;" as soon as he returned he sung out, "These boys have stolen a length of brown Persian." I jumped over the counter and collared the prisoners, the other got away - Connelly dropped one roll of silk from under his coat - it had been lying on the counter near them.

            . I am an officer; the prisoners werebrought to the office - I put them into the lock-up place, and was called out by the Magistrate - when I had turned the key, I looked over the door and saw Sullivan take this roll of silk from his person, and put it under the seat; I went in and got it out.(Property produced and sworn to).

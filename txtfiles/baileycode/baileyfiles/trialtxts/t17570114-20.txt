.* 

Jane Morgan. I had three washing tubs in my yard, in Green-Arbour Court, near the Little Old-Bailey


. The prisoner came at divers times and took them away.
Q. How do you know that?
J. Morgan. Because she confessed it to me, and told me all the places where she had sold them at.
Q. When did she confess this?
J. Morgan. On Monday last before justice Fielding.
Q. To whom did she say she sold them?
J. Morgan. She said she sold one to a person named Mary M'Can, and the others in Field-Lane.
Mary M'Can. The prisoner came to me on Saturday last, and asked me to buy a tub that she had fetch'd out of pawn; saying, she wanted twopence to pay for her lodging. She asked me a shilling for it. She had it with her, and I bought it for nine-pence.
Q. Has

                  Morgan 
               



             seen that tub since?
M. M'Can. She had since been with me and own'd it, and I gave it up to her.
Prisoner. That evidence has known me seven years. She can give me a character.
M. M'Can. I have known her about eight years ago, she was then in a very good place; I have known but little of her since. I know she has been in distress.

WILLIAM THOMAS ABUD
. I am a refiner, at St. James's-street, Clerkenwell. Mary Williams was in my service three years—she represented herself as a widow—the things mentioned in the indictment are my property, and were kept in verious drawers, which she had charge of—they were never locked, but were under her control, and all the domestic matters—she was the only servant in the house—on 18th Jan., I received information, and missed all these articles.





HENRY ISAACS
 (policeman.) I received information, and went to Mr. Abud's—I knocked; Mary Williams?"—she said, "No," and tried to shut the door—I said, "Is Mr. Abud at home?"—she said, "No"—I went to the next door, which is the counting-house, and found Mary Williams in conversation with Mr. Abud and his son—I produce this property—I found some of the articles, and the duplicates of others, at John William's lodging—I took Mary Williams to the station—John Williams was there—they were confronted together, and denied all knowledge of each other—I went to Mr. Abud's and found some boxes had been forced open, and one was empty.





MARY STEADMAN
. I live at 8, New-row, Deptford. John Williams had a room in my house—Mary Williams came there twice for Mr. Williams, whom she called her husband—I pointed out John Williams's room to the officer.

MARY WILLIAMS—

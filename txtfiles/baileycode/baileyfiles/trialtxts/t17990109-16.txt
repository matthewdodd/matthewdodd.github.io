             sworn. - I saw the prisoner go into Mrs. Joshua's house before eight o'clock in the morning; the street door goes with a latch; I saw her lift up the latch, and in about three minutes and a half she came out with the property; I asked her what she had got there, and she said, what was that to me; she dropped the frying-pan, and attempted to run away; I followed her, and brought her back; I then took up the frying-pan; I have had it and the saucepan ever since.
Mrs. Joshua. I know the saucepan to be mine, for I boiled a suet dumpling in it the day before, and it stuck to the bottom of the saucepan; and the frying pan is mine, for I fryed steaks in it the day before, and they stuck to the bottom of the pan.
The prisoner did not say any thing in her defence.

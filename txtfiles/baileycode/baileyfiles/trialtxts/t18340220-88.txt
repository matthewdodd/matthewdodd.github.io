             (police-constable C 30). On the 18th of January, in the evening, I saw the two prisoners in Soho - I watched them for some time - there was another with them - they went to a bookseller's shop, and then to Mr. Rourke's - he is a tailor
, and lives in Great Chapel-street


 - the two prisoners remained outside; and the one who is not in custody went into the door, and took out a coat - they then ran off - I pursued, and took the prisoner Watts in Frith-street, with the coat - I took it to the shop, and it was owned - on the Monday afterwards, I took Wyatt - he denied all knowledge of the robbery, but said he had been at the Plough public-house at the time.

             - this is my father's coat, and was hanging on a clothes horse near the door.
(Watts put in a written Defence, stating, that a man had met him in Frith-street, and given him the coat in a bundle to hold, while he went into a house in the street.)

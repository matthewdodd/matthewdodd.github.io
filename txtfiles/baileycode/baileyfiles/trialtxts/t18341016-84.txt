            . I live with my mother - the prisoner Hanton is my brother - Shuffrey is an acquaintance of his - in the beginning of September I discovered that my box had been broken open - I missed a cloak, a frock, and a shawl - I went the next day to Tabernacle-walk - I saw the two prisoners, and Shuffrey asked me if I would be satisfied if I had my property returned, and he said he had got 8s. 6d. towards getting them out - I said that would not do for me - he said, "Then you must put me into custody" - I got an officer, and gave him in charge - I knew he had taken my property, because a young man, who lodges with my mother, had lost some property - I afterwards found this cloak and shawl at a pawnbroker's - they are mine.
Shuffrey. While we were in the Barking Dogs, Mr. Whiting asked you if you would compromise the matter. Witness. You asked me as well.

            . I am a pawnbroker. I produce a cloak and shawl which were pawned by Shuffrey for 12s.

            . I am a pawnbroker. I have a gown pawned by Shuffrey, on the 4th of September.(Property produced and sworn to.)
Shuffrey's Defence. I went with Hanton to the fair - I could not get employ as a musician, and I returned home- he then asked me to pawn these things, which I did, in the name of Smith - the prosecutrix's mother stated at Worship-street that I was in conversation with her till I left the house, and she saw her son give me a bundle through the passage.

            . I am the prosecutrix's mother. I believe I did say that Shuffrey was in conversation with me, but I did not say my son gave him a bundle.

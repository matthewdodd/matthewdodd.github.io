- Smith. I caught the prisoner pulling the scane of silk out of a bale at Gallay's ky; he threw the silk away; he had cut the bale open with a knife.
Q. How can a man have an opportunity to cut a bale of silk in the middle of the day?
Smith. He stooped down behind the bale to do it. The bale is the property of Mr. 
               
                  Andrew
                   Haldimand

Prisoner's Defence.
He did not take it out of my hand; he took it off from the ground; it was never in my hand. My friends are all in the country.

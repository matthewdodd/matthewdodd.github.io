 for stealing, on the

MARY ANN CROOK
. I live with my grandmother in Clerkenwell. On the 26th of May, about eleven o'clock at night, I was in Fleet-street—I saw the prisoner following a gentleman, and saw him touch the gentleman's pocket—I did not see him take the handkerchief out, but I saw him throw it into a doorway, directly the officer went after him—there were three of them.

Cross-examined by
MR. PAYNE. Q. How came you to be in the street? A. I had been to Deptford, and came home by the steamer to Hungerford-market, about half-past ten o'clock—I am not often in Fleet-street—I did live in Charles-street, City-road, with my sister, who keeps a shop, but I have left her.

Q. Have you never said that you saw the prisoner draw a white silk handkerchief from a gentleman's pocket? A. Yes—I said to-day that I did not see him take it, more out of compassion to him than any thing else—the officer saw him throw it into a doorway—I did not go after the gentleman—I went after the prisoner—I told the policeman, and he took him.






HENRY BAYLEY
 (City police-constable, No. 169.) I saw the prisoner loitering up and down Fleet-street, attempting several gentlemen's pockets in company with two others—I watched him some time, and when he saw I noticed him, he ran across the road—I ran after him—he threw the handkerchief into the doorway of No. 167, Fleet-street.

Cross-examined. Q. Which side were you? A. On the left hand in going to Temple Bar—the witness was on the same side—I did not see the prisoner take the handkerchief—I told the magistrate that I saw him trying other people's pockets—I had never seen him before.

JAMES CONNELL
. I live at No. 13, Lascelles-court, St. Giles', near Salutation-court—there is one house which divides the two courts from each other—the prisoner lived at No. 2, Salutation-court, and Pedley, the deceased, at No. 1—the court is not a thoroughfare—I was in that court a little before eleven o'clock, on Saturday night, the 6th of June I saw the prisoner there, and the woman he lives with—she goes by the name of "Ann Benson"—they were in Pedley's room—Benson was quarrelling with the prisoner—Pedley was trying to part them—I was looking into the window, and could see them—the room is on the ground-floor—Benson had a poker in her hand, and Pedley was trying to part them—he was advising them to go out of the house—the prisoner apparently wanted to hit Benson, and she had the poker up to defend herself—Pedley was quarrelling with Potter—I could not hear what words passed—he was not touching him—I did not perceive them strike each other—there were persons collected together, looking in at the window—I should think the words between Pedley and Potter continued five or ten minutes—the deceased got Potter and the woman out of the house—they went out themselves—he used no violence—Potter then came into the court and fought with a young man named Carr—they did not strip—Potter did not appear sober—he got Carr into his own passage, and Ann Benson too, and shut the door—Carr hallooed out," For God's sake, somebody open the door!" I shoved the door in myself—I did not see the prisoner, as it was dark—Carr went out of the Court, and I went after him—I returned into the court between five

and ten minutes after—the people then said, the prisoner had a knife in his hand—I did not see the knife—I saw the prisoner there—I do not know whether he heard what the people said—they told me to keep away from him, and I did—I saw Mrs. Cormack come; she said she would get a policeman; she had just turned the end of the court, when I saw the prisoner make a thrust at the deceased—he had to move to make the thrust at him—the blow struck him on the right side of the lower part of the belly—when Mrs. Cormack said she would get a policeman, the deceased exclaimed, "Mrs. Cormack! Mrs. Cormack! come back, I am stabbed, I have got it here;" and I saw his guts in his hand—he was supported into his own room, and put into a chair, and a doctor was sent for—I remained there till he was taken away to the hospital—I do not know positively how long it was before he was taken to the hospital—it was about a quarter of an hour that he sat in the chair—the surgeon did not come till after he was gone to the hospital.

Cross-examined by
MR. BODKIN. Q. What countryman are you? A. Irish—one part of the court is inhabited a great deal by Irish, and the other is not—I do not know what countryman the prisoner is—I have known him about three weeks, just by sight, but not to speak to him—I had spoken to him once before this took place—I had a quarrel with him myself, about a quarter of an hour before this happened—it was not that quarrel which led me to Pedley's house—after that I went down the court away, and when I returned he was in the deceased's room with his girl—I was gone down the court between five and ten minutes—I was standing in Broad-street, and he was standing with the girl he lives with—he knocked her up against an old woman's basket, and I told him to mind what he was about—we went up the court, and had a quarrel, and I struck the prisoner—I did not strike the woman—I had no provocation to strike her—she was not there at the time—I did not strike the woman with my crutch, when he pushed her against the basket—I did not lift it—the prisoner did not say to me," Do not strike the woman, if you want to strike any body, come out and fight like a man"—he said nothing of the sort to me.

Q. What was your reason for going to Pedley's house? A. I was going up my own court, and saw people round the window—I went down to look—I had struck the prisoner before I went to look into the deceased's room—I struck him with my hand—I saw nobody near me but the prisoner then—it is not true that I and four or five others followed him up the court to Pedley's house—they might have gone to look in at the window, as I did—but what Carr quarrelled with him about I know nothing of—he was thrown down by Carr when he was fighting—he was not knocked down at all—I did not see him down—he might be knocked down before I got to Pedley's, without my seeing it, because I went down the court—I went to the bottom of the court, and waited there—I might have gone out of it; it leads into Broad-street—I did not go farther than Broad-street, and when I returned, the prisoner was in Pedley's house—I swear Benson had a poker in her hand—I saw it—the door opens into a passage—I saw them through the window—there was a light in the room when the quarrel was between the prisoner and Benson—nobody else quarrelled—the deceased had words with the prisoner, trying to persuade him to desist—there was nobody at the door quarrelling with him—there is one lamp in the court—between numbers two and three.

MR. PAYNE. Q. How long was it before you saw Potter in Pedley's room, that you quarrelled with him? A. Between five and ten minutes.






JAMES THORNTON
 I am a shoemaker, and live in White Hart-street, Strand. I was in Salutation-court, on Saturday night, the 6th of June, Abour eleven o'clock—I saw Potter there, and the decesased, Pedley—I saw The deceased standing at his own door when I went into the court—he had nothing in his hand—I heard no words pass between Pedley and Potter—I saw no blows struck at that time by them—the prisoner went to his own door—that is next door to the deceased's—some man, whose name I do not know, followed him to his own door—it was not the deceased—I next law Parker look out of the first-floor window, and in one or two minutes after I saw him in the court again—I saw nothing in his hand—he ran at the deceased and struck him—he ran directly from his own door to the deceased, that was about three yards—I was about two or three yards from him at the farthest—he struck him somewhere about the belly, on the right side—I thought he had only struck him with his fist—after he had struck Pedley, he ran into his own door immediately—Pedley said, "For God's sake, fetch a doctor!"—he was taken into his house—when the prisoner ran into his own house, the door was left open—the deceased was taken into his own room—I remained there till the policeman came—when the policeman came, the door of Potter's house was locked—some people in the court broke it open—I went up stairs with the policeman, and saw the prisoner lying on his bed with a woman—I do not know her name—they both had their clothes on—the door of that bed-room was shut—we had to burst that open—I saw the policeman pick up a knife, which was on the floor—there were stains of blood on the knife—two knives were found—I only noticed blood on one.

Cross-examined. Q. How long had you been there before this happened? A. About a quarter of an hour, or twenty minutes. I did not see the beginning of the affray—all was quiet when I came into the court—I did not see the prisoner down on the ground before he went into his house—I saw no quarrelling going on with him before he went into his house—I saw one man run into the house after him—two or three at the door pushed the door open, and got the man out—I was two or three yards from the deceased at the time the blow was struck—there were two or three people in the court at the time, and two or three about the door—I did not hear any one say," Don't go to him, for he has a knife. "





ELIZABETH CORMACK
. I am the wife of John Cormack, and live in Church-lane, St. Giles's. John Pedley, the deceased, was a collector of rents for my husband—my house is about five minutes' walk from Salutation-court—in consequence of hearing a disturbance there, I went there—it was twenty minutes after eleven when I left home—I went to Pedley's house—there was nobody but Pedley there—I went to the window, and looked out into the court, and saw Potter come out of his own door with a knife in his hand—I did not see any one in the court when I went—Pedley went out at the door, and when I saw Potter with a knife in his hand I told him that I saw him with a knife, and told him to come in—he did not come in; he said the prisoner would not hurt him—I went to go past Pedley and Potter to fetch a policeman—I did not see the prisoner violent or making a noise, he only came out with the knife—I told Pedley I would go and fetch a policeman, in consequence of hearing Potter say he would stab the first person who came near him—after I said I would go and fetch a policeman, he made a blow, but whether it was at Pedley or me I don't know—he turned round, about three steps, to make the blow—I had a basket in my hand, and the knife glanced down the side of the basket

and scratched my hand a little; I have the mark of it now—I had the basket down in my hand, and I held it out when I saw the blow coming—the deceased was close to me, almost as near as he could stand—Potter drew back his hand immediately, and struck a second blow at Pedley; but where he hit him I could not see—I went to get a policeman—the deceased said, "For God's sake come back, I am stabbed, I shall faint!"—I did not go back—I went on for a policeman, and found one at the end of Drury-lane—I might be five minutes out of the court.

Cross-examined. Q. How many persons were about at the time? A. I saw none but Thornton—I saw nobody else in the court—I did not see James Connell—I do not believe he was in the court—I did not meet any persons till I got to the top of the court, and then there were several—I was called to the court by hearing a disturbance; but that was in Broad-street—the court is not two minutes' walk—I do not know whether Connell was one of the persons I saw—I did not observe him—there were several, as there always are, at the top of the court in Broad-street—they were not in the court, but at the top of it, in Broad-street—the persons did not appear to be coming from the court—not above a minute elapsed between my seeing the prisoner with the knife, and the blows being struck—he struck one blow which struck me, and the other which struck the deceased—the basket was on my side nearest to Pedley—Potter was between us.

COURT. Q. Then the side he struck was nearest to Pedley, and if the blow had continued without being drawn back, it might have gone into Pedley? A. Yes.

MR. BODKIN. Q. Did the second blow follow immediately? A. Immediately, as quick as he could lift his arm—I do not believe it mattered who he struck—I believe he would have struck the first person he met.

COURT. Q. How far is Pedley's house—are there many houses in the court? A. Pedley's house is the first house in the court—it is very near the mouth of the court, and the prisoner's is next door—Pedley's house is a little room to itself—only one room—it has only one window—there are two turnings before you get into the court without any houses at all—Pedley's house is not more than six or eight feet from the mouth of the court—the turnings are small passages—a person standing in the mouth of the court, in Broad-street, might hear a disturbance six or eight feet off, but it would be impossible to see—when I got there I heard no disturbance at all—I did not see any persons running out of the court, and the lame young man following them—Pedley had not lived there a fortnight.





DANIEL HORROGAN
. I live in Charles-street, Drury-lane. I knew both the prisoner and the deceased by sight before—I was standing at the bottom of Lascelles-court, Broad-street, about eleven o'clock—I saw the prisoner coming along Broad-street—he went up Lascelles-court, and turned down Salutation-court to the right—I did not see any body with him when he went up the court—I heard a noise afterwards, and went up the court—I saw Potter and Pedley, and the woman he lived with, in Pedley's room—I was standing outside by the window—I saw the man and woman quarrelling, and Pedley went between them—I did not see him with any thing—there was a light in the room—I saw Potter try to strike the woman with his fist—I did not see Pedley strike Potter at all—if he had done so, I must have seen it—I afterwards saw Potter come out of Pedley's house, and go up to his own house—the woman went first—I saw nothing happen before he went in—I saw him come down stairs afterwards—(I had not seen him at the window before that)—he had a knife in his hand

—I saw part of the blade of the knife—I do not recollect seeing Mrs. Cormach there—Pedley was standing about a yard away from where Potter lived, at the door in the court—I saw Potter run to him, and make a thrust at him—I think he struck him some-where about the belly—Pedley came up the court then, and said, "Mrs. Cormack, Mrs. Cormack, my guts are out!"—I had not observed her—I went to fetch a doctor, and when I came back I saw Pedley taken on a shutter to the hospital.

Cross-examined. Q. Did you see any thing of any previous quarrel? A. No; I don't recollect seeing him quarrel with Carr—it might have been before I went up the court—I heard of it—no one went up the court with me—I think I saw Connell in the court; but I am not certain—I was looking at Pedley at the time the blow was struck—I can't say where Mrs. Cormack was, for I did not take notice—directly it was done, somebody called to me to fetch a doctor, and I ran directly—there were a good many persons about—I dare say there were as many as ten.

COURT. Q. Did you hear what the deceased was urging in his room; was he not urging them to go home? A. He was urging them; trying to make peace with them, and they went out of his house—I don't recollect seeing the prisoner fighting with a man in the court before he went into his own house—I know Carr—I do not recollect seeing him fight with the prisoner—it might be before I went up—I saw him afterwards at the bottom of the court—I cannot tell whether he was in the court—he might be among the people.





EDMUND DAVIS
 (police-constable E. 74.) I was called in to take the prisoner into custody—Johnson was with me—I found his door fast—I broke a shutter, in the first instance, and got in, and while I was inside, the outer door was forced open outside—I went up stairs, and found the room door fast—I broke that open—Potter would have to go ninety feet five inches from Pedley's door up into his own room and back again—I found him lying on the bed alongside of a woman—they were both dressed; he said, "I know what you want me for, I know I done it; I done it in my own defence"—he said nothing more—I searched the room, and found a knife up in the corner of the room, all over wet blood, and the fat of the entrails was on it at the time—I saw Pedley in the hospital—I saw him after he was dead—he died on Monday, the 8th of June, at half-past three in the morning.

Cross-examined. Q. Did you find any poker? A. I did not—I did not look for one at Pedley's—I did not search his room—I have been stationed in that neighbourhood about six years—the lower Irish congregate there very much, and disturbances very frequently occur.

COURT. Q. Were you present at the Middlesex hospital, when Mr. Laing, the magistrate, was there? A. I was, on Sunday, the 7th of June—the prisoner was present—I took him there—I knew the deceased—I only knew him by the name of Blucher—Mr. Laing examined him in my presence, and in the presence of the prisoner—the prisoner heard all that was asked him—I saw him sworn—the prisoner did not put any questions to him—after it was taken down, it was read over to the deceased by Mr. Laing in the prisoner's hearing—the deceased was sworn while the prisoner was in the room—he was very much fatigued at the time, but perfectly understood what he was about.





WILLIAM JOHN JOHNSON
 (police-constable E 156.) I went with Davis to apprehend the prisoner—I found him on the bed—I did not see the knife found.






CAMPBELL GREIG DE MORGAN
. I am house-surgeon at the Middlesex hospital, and was so on the 6th of June—I was not present when the deceased was brought in—I saw him about a quarter of an hour after—a very few minutes after twelve o'clock—I saw a wound on the right side of the belly, and a portion of the bowels protruding—the wound was inflict with a cutting instrument; such a knife as this would produce the wound, if used with great force—I believe the wound in the abdomen was the cause of his death—he died on Monday morning, at about half-past three o'clock.





THOMAS GREEN
. I am servant to Mr. Pedley, the brother of the deceased—I have heard his brother say his name was Henry—I heard that before his death—I saw him once or twice—I only knew him by his coming once or twice there—I have heard Mr. Pedley say, "That is my brother Henry"—I have seen my master and the deceased together, and have heard them speak together.





ROBERT JENKINS
. I am a police inspector of the E division. I was present at the Middlesex hospital when the magistrate took the deposition of the deceased Pedley—I saw him put his signature to it—it was read over to him before he signed it—I saw Mr. Laing put his signature to the deposition—I saw the deceased put the name of Henry John Pedley to the deposition—Mr. Laing asked him if his name was Henry John, and he said it was.





HENRY TOBIN
. I am brother-in-law to the deceased, and live in King's-road, Chelsea—he went by the name of Henry John Pedley—his sister told me so when she saw this in the newspaper—I never knew him by any other name.





ALLAN STEWART LAING, ESQ
. I am a magistrate—the whole of this deposition is in my hand-writing, and this is my signature to it—this is the signature of the deceased—it was taken by me in the prisoner's presence, and read over to the deceased in his presence—I took down every word exactly as he stated it.
(Deposition read.)"
The said Henry John Pedley says, I live at Salutation-court—the prisoner was ill-treating or beating his wife, or the woman he lives with—I interfered, and told him he ought to be ashamed of himself—the woman and the prisoner had a scuffle, and at last they got outside my door—the prisoner was very drunk—there was two or three more chaps came down the court, and had a fight with the prisoner, who then ran up stairs, and ran down again, with a knife, and ran it into me—but whether he intended it for me or the others I do not know."

Prisoner's Defence (written.) The facts of the case have been very much misrepresented by some of the witnesses—the whole of the provocation I received from Connell and his associates, which drove me to a state of frenzy, have been kept out of view; but that I was provoked almost to madness, I think you will feel, when you have heard my witnesses—feeling my life in danger, I hastily seized the first thing that presented itself, and what happened afterwards I cannot state, for I was in that excited state; but I solemnly declare, I was acting under an impression that I was defending myself from violence, but not towards the deceased—we were always on the most friendly terms—I trust you will hear Benson's evidence—I deplore that I should have been, however, innocently, the cause of the death of the deceased.





ANN BENSON
. I am acquainted with the prisoner. On the night in

question I was coming home with him, about half-past nine o'clock—he was very tipsy—I never saw him so drunk—when I entered the court, there was a fellow with a crutch (Cormack) and five or six more—the prisoner had his hand on my shoulder, and he happened to touch the fellow with the crutch with his elbow as he passed by, and he struck me on the nose with his crutch—I got the prisoner down the court, away from them, and then they followed him down, five or six of them, and they knocked him down—I picked him up, and then they knocked me down, and ill-used me, and pulled me by the hair of my head—Horrogan struck me, and Thornton knocked me down—the prisoner was with me at the time—I got up, and went into Pedley's house with Potter—Pedley was there—when we entered Pedley's house, I fastened the door, and they burst it in; and they hit Potter inside—he went in to pay his rent—the witnesses forced the door, all three of them, and they all three hit him—Pedley told them to be quiet—we staid in Pedley's house about ten minutes—there was not a word took place between Potter and Pedley—when we came out I fastened myself in the passage of No. 3, because they flung stones—(I live in No. 2)—I ran in when the stones were flung—I was frightened to go into my own house—when I heard the man say, "I am stabbed," I came out—he said, "I am stabbed, I am stabbed; send for Mrs. Cormack"—I then came out—I saw nothing but people—I was so frightened, I did not see Potter—I never saw him any more till I saw him at the station-house next day—after I came out of No. 3, I went into my own place, No. 2—Potter was there—I remained there with him till the policeman came and took him—I have been acquainted with him about twelve months—he is a very quiet man, except when drunk, and that is very seldom—he is a smith—I did not know Pedley for more than a week—the prisoner and Pedley were on very good terms—they had not a word of dispute—I did not notice what state of mind Potter was in when I found him in the room, directly after this; for I was to ill-used myself, I was in no state of mind to notice any body.

MR. MAHON. Q. Had you and the prisoner any quarrel in Pedley's room, and in his presence? A. No; we had about eleven o'clock in the. day-time; but no quarrel that night—Pedley interfered when these men struck me—the prisoner and I were not quarrelling that night—Pedley did, not say that the prisoner ought to be ashamed of himself for treating a woman like me in that way—I did not hear him say so—he might say it—the prisoner took up a toasting-fork in Pedley's house, and I broke it in halves—I had nothing in my hand but the bit of the toasting-fork—I had no poker—I thought he was going to do mischief with the toastingfork, and I broke it in halves—I am not related to the prisoner—I have lived with him about eight months.

Q. On coming through the court, and seeing the lame man with the crutch, was Pedley there? A. No; Pedley did not strike or offer any violence to me or the prisoner—he was in his own place, and not interfering at all—Connell struck me first—Horrogan struck me, and Thornton took me by the hair of my head—they struck me without any provocation—I know nothing of any previous quarrel the prisoner had with them—I never saw him quarrel with any body—they burst Pedley's door in—I was inside—I had my back to the door, keeping the prisoner in, and they burst it open—there was no fastening to it, but a bolt—they came into the room, and struck both of

us in Pedley's room—they did not strike Pedley—they struck me on the nose, and pulled the hair of my head—I was a witness at the Coroner's inquest—I stated this before the Coroner in the very same way—I was sent out of the room—they said I was tipsy—the Coroner did not send me away—he said I might go—this knife was shown to me then—I have never seen that knife before—I have never seen it in the prisoner's possession, or in his house—I never saw it at table.

COURT. Q. You were very sober? A. I was as sober as I am now—Potter was very drunk—he went to pay his rent to Pedley.





EDMUND KEAGAN
. I live in Lascelles-court, and sell fruit. I have known the prisoner by sight for three years, but never spoke to him in my life—on the night this happened, I was in the street, near the court—I saw the prisoner pass by and go up the court, seeming to go to his lodging—there was a woman before him—he was mobbed by two chaps who stood against a lamp-post—they insulted him—they followed him up the court, and I followed them out of the street—I saw the lame man strike the prisoner, who went away, and made no resistance—he returned no blow whatever—there was no fight at that time—I saw nothing but his naked hand strike him—the prisoner entered into Pedley's room—some words passed there—I could not hear what was said—I heard Pedley say, "Go out of here; I will not have rows here"—some of the men were then outside Pedley's house—Connell called out," Turn the man out, (meaning the prisoner) we will wait for him"—Pedley's door was open at that time—I did not see how it became opened—I withdrew into my own room, as I thought the dispute too tedious—my room is just round the comer—it divides the two courts—I went home to get my supper, and in a short time I heard the loud screams of a woman—I went to see what was the matter—I saw this woman in the middle of the court—I saw nobody strike her, but I saw Connell come from her with a sort of satisfaction—she then went in doors to No. 2, seemingly into her lodging—I cannot tell what house she lodged in—she went in and fastened the door, and stopped there so long, I do not know what time she came out—I did not see her afterwards—I saw these fellows forcing the door in after the woman—she was crying "Murder" still, and one of them entered in, and the door got fastened in upon him—he cried to his partners outside to get him out, and they got the door open, and let him out—I heard the cry of a man being stabbed, when I was in my own room at supper—it was ten minutes or a quarter of an hour after the first confusion that I heard it—I do not know where the woman was then.

COURT. Q. You were selling fruit in the street? A. I was standing by my basket—I left my basket in Broad-street, and went into the court; but my wife minded my basket.





HENRY FLETCHER
. I am in the employ of Mr. Mason. I have known the prisoner for three years—he is an inoffensive man—on the night in question he was so tipsy, I was obliged to assist him home to the court—he did not know where he lived.

COURT. Q. What time did you take him home? Q. At half-past ten or a little before eleven—I took him to the end of the court, and persuaded him to go home.





SAMUEL HORROGAN

re-examined. I never knocked that woman down—I never touched her—I did not see her till I went up and saw

her in Pedley's room—I did not see the poker—I never touched her that night, or him either—I did not see Thornton there—I did not hit the prisoner at all that night.





JAMES THORNTON

re-examined. I did not knock the woman down—I did not see her till I went up stairs, and saw her on the bed—I never pulled her hair or knocked her down—I did not see any body touch her.





JAMES CONNELL

re-examined. I never touched the woman with my crutch—I never lifted it from under my arm—I struck the prisoner, but not with my crutch—he made use of bad language to me when I asked him to mind, and not run up against the woman's basket, which stood at the end of the court—he was tipsy and staggered against the basket.
(Thomas Mason, coach-smith, Neale's-yard, Seven Dials; and John Hobbs, wheelwright, Bowl-yard, gave the prisoner a good character.)

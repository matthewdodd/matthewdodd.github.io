            . I had two keggs with some rum in them (not full) and eleven bottles in a case, which had some rum in them likewise, in a warehouse at Bull Dock


, Wapping; I put them there on the 4th of October, in the evening, and missed them the 6th; I found the two keggs, at Mr. Reeves's afterwards, and the bottles at Jones's house, and Jones acknowledged he and Lamb had taken them away.

            . On the 6th Jones came to my warehouse, pulled out a small bottle of rum, and offered it as a sample of some he had to sell: I did not like it at first; Jones came again with Lamb in the evening; they sold me the two keggs of rum for 8 s.
- Reeves confirmed this evidence.
The prisoners, in their defence, both said they knew nothing of it.

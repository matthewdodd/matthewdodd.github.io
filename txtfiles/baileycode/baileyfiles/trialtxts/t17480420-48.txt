            . I saw the Prisoner with these goods on the 6th of April, between five and six in the morning, near Ratcliff, and I went into the Red Cross, a publickhouse, with him to drink; he tore a corner of the paper, and asked what that stuff was worth a yard; so I stopped him, and carried him before Justice Dennett.

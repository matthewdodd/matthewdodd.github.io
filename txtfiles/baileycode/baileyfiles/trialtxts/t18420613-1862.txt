1862. 




GEORGE OAKLEY
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
29th of April, 1 ham, value 6s., the goods of 



Samuel Rogers.






HENRY ROGERS
. I live with my brother Samuel, in Kingsland-road, Shoreditch. At half-past four o'clock on the 29th of April, my brother lost this ham—I had seen it safe about ten minutes past four—it was brought back about half-past four.





CHARLES SHOREY
. I am shop-boy to Mr. Hemmings, in Kingsland-road. I saw the prisoner coming along the road, at past four that day, in a direction from the prosecutor's, with a ham under his apron—I informed a man that was passing, and he ran after the prisoner—he is not here.


Cross-examined by
MR. HORRY. Q. Do you know Mr. Rogers's shop? A. Yes—I first saw the prisoner about two hundred yards from there—he was nearly opposite my master's shop.





JAMES WALL
. On the 29th I was on duty near Shoreditch church, about half-past four o'clock in the afternoon, and saw the prisoner running with something in a black apron—he threw it away when he got about ten yards farther—it contained a ham—I took it back to Mr. Rogers's, and he claimed it.

Cross-examined. Q. Were you close by Shoreditch church? A. Yes—the prisoner was about four yards from me when I first saw him—I could not see the prosecutor's shop from where I was—when I was before the Magistrate on the Saturday I did not stop to be examined—I was examined on the Monday—the policeman did not come to me between the Saturday and the Monday—I went of my own accord—I was not threatened to be taken into custody about this ham.




GUILTY.* Aged 18.—



Transported for Seven Years.

             and I are partners. I hired the prisoner in November last, to be our ware-house man
, and I intended to send him into the country as a rider: I was informed, by one of my servants, some of our hats were stolen.

            . I am a haberdasher; I bought three hats of the prisoner at the bar on the 14th of November, I gave 18 s. for them; he brought them to my house, and offered them to sale; he pretended, these were sent to him out of the country.
(Produced in court, and deposed to, by Mr. Rossiter, as the property of him and his partner.)

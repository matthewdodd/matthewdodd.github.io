. On the 9th of July, about half-past eight o'clock at night, the prisoner and two others came to my house, and had some bacon and eggs. As they went out Hixon alarmed me - I went out and took the prisoner, his companions escaped. I found four candlesticks on the prisoner - two in his breeches, one under his waistcoat, and one under the back of his coat, which were taken from my club-room. I do not know that the door was locked.

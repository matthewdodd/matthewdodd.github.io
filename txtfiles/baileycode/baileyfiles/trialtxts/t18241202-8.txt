JOHN SAWYER. I am an engraver
. On the 28th of November, about six o'clock, I was going up Long-acre


, to chapel; the prisoner met me, and rushed up against me, and at that moment I felt the watch drawn from my pocket; I am certain of his person; he ran away, and I after him, to the corner of St. Martin's-lane - he was taken in that lane. I came up to him, and some one picked up the watch, and gave it to me. I took him to St. Martin's watch-house.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

            . I live with my father, in Castle-street, Long-acre. I was in Long-acre on Sunday night, and saw the prisoner run up against Mr. Sawyer, who immediately cried Stop thief! I ran and seized the prisoner by the collar; he had thrown something behind him, but I do not know what it was - it appeared white. I saw some person give Mr. Sawyer a watch case. I never had my eyes off the prisoner.
Prisoner's Defence. I had been to dine with a young man, and on returning through St. Martin's-lane I heard the cry of Stop thief! I ran, and three or four gentlemen laid hold of me, but I am totally innocent.

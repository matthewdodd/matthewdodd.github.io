WILLIAM GREEN
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
23rd of March, 2 nose-bags, value 10s., the goods of 



Charles Barclay, and others; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






JAMES SMITH
. I am a policeman. On the 23rd of March I saw the prisoner at the corner of Angel-alley, Whitechapel, with these two nose-bags across his shoulder, at a quarter before six o'clock in the evening—I asked him How he came by them—he said they were given to him to hold by a man named Hookey, who was gone into the City, and who worked for a lady—I found that to be false, and found the owner—I took him to the station-house.





BENJAMIN JOHNSON
. I am a drayman to Messrs. Charles Barclay, and Co., brewers. I was out on the 23rd of March—my dray was in Billiter-street, very nearly half a mile from Angel-alley—my horses were standing there—they had the nose-bags on—I put them on before I went—I was absent about half an hour from the dray—when I returned I found one off my shafts, and one off my mate's—I do not know the prisoner—I never saw him till at Lambeth-street—I know these to be ray master's property.





EDWARD BRABY
. I superintend the nose-bags and harness of Messrs. Barclay and Co.—these two nose-bags are my master's.

Prisoner's Defence. I was coming from Angel-alley—a young man asked me if I would mind these two nose-bags for him till he came back out of the City—I put them across my shoulder, and had them when the officer came up—he asked me How I came by them—I told him—he took me to the station-house, and found out who they belonged to.





JAMES HOWARD
. I am a policeman. I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—I was a witness against him—he is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 23.—


Transported for Fourteen Years.

Before Lord Chief Justice Tindal

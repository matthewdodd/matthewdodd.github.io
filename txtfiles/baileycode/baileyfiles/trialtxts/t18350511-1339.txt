THOMAS SHEPPARD
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
20th of April, 1 handkerchief, value 1s., the goods of 



William Rhodes, from his person.






WILLIAM RHODES
. I live upon my property, in Claremont-place, Old Kent-road. I was at Greenwich fair on the 20th of April—I went into a booth, but did not miss my handkerchief till I was told of it—this is it.





JAMES WILD
. I am a policeman. I was at the fair, and saw the prisoner sounding several gentlemen's pockets, about twelve o'clock at night—at last he went behind the prosecutor, who was listening to a song—I saw him walk suddenly away—I went and asked the prosecutor if he had lost any thing—he said, yes, his handkerchief—I told him to go with me, and we found the prisoner blowing his nose with the handkerchief—I took him, and found on him these snuff-boxes, this other handkerchief, these cigars, and cases.

Prisoner. I had not the handkerchief—it was at my feet—I had been in a booth—this man came and took me, and took the handkerchief up from my feet.




GUILTY
. Aged 21.—


Transported for Seven Years.

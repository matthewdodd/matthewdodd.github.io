Compton Morris. The Prisoner came to my Shop for a Quarter of a Yard of printed Linen, for Robings, which she bought, and paid me 6 d. for. I had another Customer in the Shop, and a pretty many Goods lay tumbled on the Counter. I observ'd the Prisoner to be very busy about those Goods, and as she was going out, I suspected she had taken more than she should, and so I call'd her to come back, and said, Hussy, you have stolen something; but she ran away, and I jump'd over the Counter, and follow'd her. I came up with her at the Sun Tavern Door, and took her by the Collar, upon which she threw this Linen from under her Coats, and it fell upon the Threshold. We have been so pester'd with these Vermin in our Shops, that I vow and protest, there's no living for them, I have lost above ten Pounds by them since last Month. The Prisoner had been in my Shop before this time. 


               Guilty 4 s. 10 d.

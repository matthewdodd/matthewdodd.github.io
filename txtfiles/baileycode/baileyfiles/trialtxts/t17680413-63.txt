            . Just as my Lord Mayor was going to St. Brides church, on the Wednesday in Easter-week, there was a crowd at the Mansion-house


; Stroud was looking in at the gate, his pocket did was in, so that his handkerchief might be seen; the prisoner went in and peeped in also; I stopped down and saw the prisoner draw his handkerchief out of his pocket; I tapped my hand on Stroud, and said you have lost your handkerchief; he said so I have; said I, this is the fellow; I had hold of the prisoner; Stroud said mine has the letter P upon it, I showed it him; (produced in court) Stroud did appear at Guildhall to find the bill, but I fancy he has been played some trick with; I am told he is gone down into the country, and will not appear.

             was called on his recognizance, he did not appear.
Prisoner's defence.
I never saw the handkerchief till I saw it in this man's hand.

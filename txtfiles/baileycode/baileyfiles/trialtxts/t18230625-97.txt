            . I live in Southampton-buildings. On the 24th of June, between nine and ten o'clock at night, I was with a friend looking at a fire in Featherstone-buildings


, and put my handkerchief quite to the bottom of my pocket to secure it - somebody said my pocket was picked; I looked round and saw Camp in custody, and the officer take it from his bosom. Purse was taken immediately.

            . I am a constable. I stood at the corner of Bedford-row, and saw the prisoners come up following Mr. Crow, and watched them, having seen them attempt people's pockets just before. I saw Purse take a handkerchief, out of Mr. Crow's pocket, and immediately give it to Camp, who put it in his bosom. I seized and took it from him.

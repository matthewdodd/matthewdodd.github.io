EDWARD FREWIN
. On the 14th of August, about half-past eight o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came to my shop, and ordered me to send butter, bacon, and eggs, to Mrs. Fox, in Guildford-street, and change for a sovereign—I sent them by my boy.





EDWARD SAVAGE
. I am in the prosecutor's service. On the 14th of August I went to take some butter, bacon, and eggs, to Mrs. Fox—as I was going along the prisoner met me, and asked whether I was going to the Portland Arms public-house—I said, "Yes"—he said he had made a mistake, he was going to order a larger piece of bacon and some more butter—he asked if I had got the change—I said, "Yes"—he asked me to give him the bacon, and butter, and change for Mrs. Fox, and he gave me this sovereign, which is a counterfeit—I am quite sure he is the person.

Prisoner. Q. Where did I meet you? A. In John-street—I said at the station-house that you were the man.





ELIZA FOX
. I did not send the prisoner for any thing on the 14th of August, nor did I receive any thing from him, or see him, till he was at Hatton-garden.

Prisoner's Defence. When the boy was first at the station-house he was asked I if was the man; he hesitated, and was asked a second time, when

he said he thought I was the man—he was asked if he was sure; he then said he was, he said he knew me by coming to his master's shop.




GUILTY
. Aged 53.—


Transported for Seven Years.
(There was another indictment against the prisoner.)

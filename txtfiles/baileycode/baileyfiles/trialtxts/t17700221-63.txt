            . My husband is named Anthony. On Tuesday the 13th of this instant I was in my own room. I saw the prisoner go past my window; seeing her run, I went down and missed my gown. I mistrusted her. I got a warrant to search her room. I could not find it. Then I asked her to look about her clothes. I took up her upper petticoat, there I found my gown. (Produced and deposed to).




               Guilty. 10 d.

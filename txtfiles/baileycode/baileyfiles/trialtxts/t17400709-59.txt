Warren. The Prisoner came into 'Squire Merrick's Barn at Southall


 , last Midsummer Day at Night. and took away a Pair of Sheets, and two Shirts. He took all the Things I had from me. One of my Shirts I found upon his Back; the other he said he had pawn'd, and the Constable and I went and found it according to his Directions. When he was before the Justice he had nothing to say,- only he told the Justice he bought the 2 shirts of a Woman, but he did not know her Name, nor where to find her.
Prisoner . And do you swear to 2 Shirts again?
Warren . Yes.

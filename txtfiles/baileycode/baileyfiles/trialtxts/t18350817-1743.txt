SARAH DAVIS
 was again indicted

 for stealing, on the 
14th of July, 56 yards of lace, value 3l., the goods of 



Joseph Clow.






THOMAS ISITT
. I apprehended the prisoner on the last charge—I asked Miss Clark to search her, and the prisoner herself then pulled from under her shawl this fifty-six yards of lace, and chucked them under the table—I made inquiry, and found they belonged to Mr. Clow.





MATILDA CLARK
. I searched the prisoner—she gave this lace up to the office—I cannot recollect that she threw it on the table—I am sure it came from her—I told her I was sure she had more, and she gave it up.





THOMAS SHARP
. I am in the emply of Joseph Clow, of Ludgate-street. The Prisoner came to the shop on the 14th of July, for tbread-edging or lace—I showed her some, and she went away without purchasing—I did not miss any till the officer brought this—I then missed it—I had shown her lace of this description—this belongs to Mr. Clow—she came about one o'clock, and the officer brought it next morning about ten o'clock.

Cross-examined. Q. How do you know it? A. By the private mark—I swear it has not been sold—we had obly one card of one pattern in the house—here are three cards with our private mark on them.





JOSEPH CLOW
. I have no partner—this property is mine, and has our private mark on it.

Cross-examined. Q. How many cards of lace might be in the box? A. About twenty, I should think—I had counted them a week before, but not that morning.

Prisoner. I beg for mercy for my three children.




GUILTY
. Aged 21. 


Transported for Life.

Before Mr. Justice Bosanquet.

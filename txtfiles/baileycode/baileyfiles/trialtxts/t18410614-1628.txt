WILLIAM SEABROOK
. I keep the Cart and Horses public-house in Turn-mill-street. The prisoner was in my skittle-ground on the 15th of May—I saw him with this cruet-stand—I said he had got something belonging to me—he said he had not—I took his apron up, and saw the cruet-stand, and told him it was mine—there were seven or eight more persons in the ground—I took him to the bar, and called a policeman.





SAMUEL DOYLE
 (police-constable A 197.) I took the prisoner, and have the property—it is a very respectable house, but there are very bad characters use it.

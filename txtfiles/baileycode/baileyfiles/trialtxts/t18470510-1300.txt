HENRY LOCK
 was indicted

 for stealing 31lbs. of lead, value 5s.; the goods of 



Henry Hunt Piper, his master; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






HENRY HUNT PIPER
. I live at 42, Eastcheap—the prisoner was in my service at work at a building at Dulwich—a constable produced some edges✗ of lead to me which are mine—-the prisoner had no business with them.





JOHN HARRISON
 (policeman.) On the 19th of April, about twenty minutes to seven o'clock in the evening, I met the prisoner on Camberwell-green—I saw something bulky in front of his trowsers, stopped him, and asked him what it was—he said he had got nothing—I felt something, and asked him what it was—he said it was only a piece of lead which he had found—I took him to the station—I have fitted the lead to the building belonging to the prosecutor—it fits exactly—I found 31lbs. of lead on him altogether.





HENRY HUNT PIPER

re-examined. I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction—(read—Convicted June, 1839, of stealing lead, and confired six months)—I was prosecutor on that occasion, and am certain he is the man.

Cross-examined by
MR. HORRY. Q. I believe he has been twenty years in your service? A. More—I took him from gaol into my service again—he had 21s. a week, generally more—I had rather not say how he has behaved.




GUILTY
 Aged 33.—


Transported for Seven Years.

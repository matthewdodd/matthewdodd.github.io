            . I am a linen-draper
, and live at Yarmouth. On the 30th of April, between eight and nine o'clock at night, I was in Bishopsgate-street


 - I had a watch with appendages fastened by a gold chain - the prisoner ran up against me; I am certain of him; he kept close to me - I could neither get backwards or forwards - two or three others were in his company. I felt three or four violent pulls at my chain, it gave way; my fob was twisted. He immediately ran off; I pursued him, calling Stop thief! the prisoner was stopped - I had never lost sight of him. I have not found the property. I gave him in charge.

            . I am a constable. I received the prisoner in charge.

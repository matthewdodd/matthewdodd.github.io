RICHARD LEVITT
. I am an ironmonger, and live in Broad-street, Ratcliff—I have one partner—between seven and eight o'clock, on the 9th of Feb., I had some shovels at my shop—I missed them on receiving information from Horney—these now produced are them—no other person makes the article, and every article is marked with our name.





THOMAS HORNEY
. On the 9th of Feb. I saw the prisoner take six shovels off Mr. Levitt's steps—he had one foot on the steps and one foot off—the shovels were inside—he went on a little further, and up Orchard-street—I said to him, "Jack mind what you are after"—I went and gave Mr. Levitt information.





JAMES WILLIAM WEST
. These shovels were found with me—the prisoner left them at my house.

Prisoner. I never left any shovels at his house.

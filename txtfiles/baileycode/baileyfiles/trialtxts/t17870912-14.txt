I took the clothes out of the prisoner's lap in my master Mr. Jayes's yard; it was on the 16th of July; between three and four in the afternoon, the linen was hanging on the lines in the yard to dry, and had been there sometime; I was in the kitchen, washing, and the door was open, and I saw him coming from the yard with these things in his lap; the passage faces the kitchen door; I took hold of his coat, and bid him stop, and followed him into the kitchen, and took the clothes from his lap, and throwed them down on the kitchen stones.
(The property produced, and proved by the witness.)

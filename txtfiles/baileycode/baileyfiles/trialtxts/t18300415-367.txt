PETER WELCH. I am in the boot and shoe line
, in Field-lane


. The prisoner was in my employ; I sent him with three pairs and an odd shoe to take to the binders, on the 23rd of January, and never saw him again till the 24th of March, when I saw him by St. Bride's, Fleet-street; I asked what he had done with my shoes - he said he knew nothing about me; I said, "Is not your name Joseph Jennings" - he said No; I asked if his name was his step-father's name - he said No; I asked where he lived - he said in Winkfield-street; I said I would go there - in going along he said he had sold the shoes in Playhouse-yard; I went there, and the house was shut up - I then gave him in charge of an officer; a better boy than he was, was not in England before.

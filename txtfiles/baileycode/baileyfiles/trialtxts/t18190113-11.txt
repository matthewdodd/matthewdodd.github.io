JOSEPH COPELAND BELL. On the 12th of January, about six o'clock in the evening I was in Cheapside


. There was a crowd round a print-shop. I moved towards the road to pass, and thought I felt a catch at my coat-pocket, I turned round, and saw the prisoner scrambling my handkerchief in his hand, he had got it out of my pocket - two other boys were with him. I seized him, and he passed it to one of them. I laid hold of him, and he passed it to the third boy. In trying to take him I lost the other, but never let the prisoner go.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

            . I took the prisoner in charge, but found nothing on him. He said he did not know the boys who were with him.

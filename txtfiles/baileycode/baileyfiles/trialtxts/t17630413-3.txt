            . My husband's name is 
               
                  William 
                  Bell 
               



            . I lost the things mentioned in the indictment at separate times. The prisoner washed for a person that lodges in my house, and chaired for me. I suspected her; I taxed her with taking them; she confessed she had taken them, and delivered part of them to me, and told me where the rest were pawned, which I found accordingly.

            , a pawnbroker's servant, facing Hungerford market, produced a pair of ruffles and a table-spoon. The first he took in from the prisoner, the other was taken in by some other person; deposed to by the prosecutrix.
The prisoner in her defence said, it was the first fact she ever did.

WILLIAM CARROLL
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
13th of May, 1 check-brace, value 2s. 6d., the goods of 



George Martin, Esq.






JAMES GINDER
. I am coachman to George Martin, Esq.—at a quarter after nine o'clock in the evening of the 13th of May, I was driving the carriage in Regent-street—I observed by the shadow of a lamp a lad hung on the foot-board behind the carriage—I was driving on at the time at a walking pace—I drew the carriage alongside the curb-stone to get off to see what he was doing, and he got off—I drove on and he followed the carriage close again—I stopped again and told him if he did not make off, should apply the whip to him—I drove on to Frederick mews, and when got there I missed the check-brace from behind the carriage—I went down Portland-place, and met the prisoner coming into Langham-place—accused him of having the check-brace—I gave him in charge, and found this brace on him—it is my master's.





WILLIAM TINBEN
. I am a policeman. I took the prisoner and the

brace—I found this other brace round the prisoner's middle, under his waistcoat, and four other smaller ones.
(William Huntsman, slater; and Thomas Madgin, gave the prisoners good character.)




GUILTY

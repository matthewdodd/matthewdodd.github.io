EDWARD HENRY GWYNNE
. I am shopman to Mr. Hubbard, a cheesemonger in White chapel. On the 17th of Nov. I saw Shaw at Mr. Chidley's shop, at the corner of Court-street—I heard a whistle, and a cry of "All right"—I then saw another person, who is not here, roll a cask of pork away.





WILLIAM CHRISTMAS
. I am in the service of Mr. William Chidley. I saw Shaw with the cask which was ray master's, trying to get it through the posts—another man was helping him—Shaw was taken, and a great straggle ensued.





WILLIAM COOPER
. I am errand-boy to Mr. Chidley. I  saw Martin walking backwards and forwards by our shop a little before eight o'clock on the 17th of Nov., in company with Shaw—the pork was stolen about ten minutes afterwards.

Marin. Q. Did you see me along with a woman? A. Yes.





MICHAEL KELLY
 (police-constable K 141.) I saw Martin and one who is not in custody, in company together—I saw no woman—this was about five minutes before the cask was stolen from the door.





JOHN FRESHWATER
 (police-constable K 146.) Between seven and eight o'clock that evening I watched the prisoners and another—they were within three or four doors of the prosecutor's shop—I was sent away, and left them there—I then heard of this robbery, I went to the Queen's Head, and found Martin. MARTIN—


NOT GUILTY

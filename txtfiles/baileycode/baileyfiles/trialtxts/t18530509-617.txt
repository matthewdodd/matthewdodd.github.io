JOHN DOVE
. I am a weaver, and live at No. 16, Minerva-street, Hackney road. On 21st March I drew from the Osborne-street Savings' Bank 20l. 5s. 3d.—there was a 10l.-note, a 5l.-note, five sovereigns, two half-crowns, and a 3d.-piece—I put the notes, and sovereigns, and half-crowns, into a little leather purse, and put the purse into my left hand trowsers pocket—I kept the 3d.-piece in my hand—when I left the bank, I went into the Nag's Head—it was after 1 o'clock I am certain—I called for half a quartern of rum, a little warm water, and sugar—I asked the landlady to allow me to go into the parlour, and warm myself—she said, "There is a good fire in the tap room;" and I went in there—the tap room appeared to be full of people, but they made room for me to go to the fire—I was very cold—I can recognise two of the prisoners being there, who were Fletcher and Atkins; but whether they were there when I went in, I cannot tell; if

not, they were in a few minutes afterwards—they both spoke to me, but I believe Fletcher was the first—he got into conversation about trade; he said he was a weaver, and had work from a warehouse in the City—we had a good deal of talk together—Atkins, and another man who was there, conversed with Fletcher—the three appeared intimate together—one of them, either Fletcher or Atkins, offered me a glass of rum; I think it was Atkins—I refused it at first; but they urged it, and I took it out of the glass which they handed to me—it was a small glass—I had a second glass offered to me by either Atkins or Fletcher—I believe it was Atkins—I did not take the second glass; I refused; and on my refusing it, Fletcher popped it into the remains of the rum and water that I had in the glass which I brought from the bar—I did not take any of it—I said, "It will be strong enough; you can put some water in it, and drink it yourselves, for I will have no more of it"—I left the house, and walked down Mile-end-road; and when I was opposite the London Hospital, I saw Atkins—I said, "Are you coming this way?"—he said, "Yes, I live this way"—I do not recollect anything else that occurred till I got to the Dyers' Arms—I went by myself till I got near the door of the Dyers' Arms, and then Fletcher and Atkins, and one or two more, wanted me to go in, and they came and dragged me in—I was just at the door of the Dyers' Arms when I saw Fletcher and Atkins, and one or two more—I know the Three Cranes—I have no recollection of being in there—I recollect they offered me something to drink at the Dyers' Arms; I refused it, and they urged me to drink; I cannot recollect whether I took any or not—there was a seat at the Dyers' Arms, and after standing some time I sat down, and one of them said, "This man wants to go to the water closet"—on that I went into the back yard; Fletcher and one or two others went with me—I went into the water closet, and when I came out, a number of them got round me and robbed me—I was completely penned in—I was nearly paralysed, and one put his hand into my pocket, and I saw him drag my purse out with the money in it—I saw it in hit hand—I cried out, "I am robbed! landlord, I am robbed!"—on my crying out, the men that were about me went away—this occurred just out of the water closet, under a covered skittle ground, within a yard of the water closet—they then went away—there were five or six persons—I cannot speak to any of them but Fletcher—he was one of the five or six—he took me into the back yard; I walked along with him—I cannot recognise any of the other prisoners as being in the back yard but him—I have an idea it must have been somewhere about 4 o'clock when I got to the Dyers' Arms—Fletcher was brought back in about five or six minutes after I cried, "Landlord, landlord! I am robbed;" I cannot say exactly how long; I was very much confused—two other men were brought back, but I could not recognise them positively at that time; but I had an idea of them—I swear I saw the purse in one of their hands—I saw the band distinctly, and the purse in it, but I did not see who it was—I could not see his face; he was behind me.

Cross-examined by
MR. RIBTON. Q. After you had received your money, was the Nag's Head the first house you went into? A. Yes; I know a public house at the corner of Great Garden-street—I did not go in there; I never went near it—I do not know a public house called the Red Lion—I did not meet anybody near Great Garden-street with an extraordinary silk handkerchief, and who I had conversation with; nothing of the kind—I had no conversation about a handkerchief—I am sure the Nag's Head was the first place I was in—I came out of the bank—I had not dined—I had a bit of bread and cheese before I came from home, that was all.


Cross-examined by
MR. READ. Q. Do you work at home at your business? A. I have not worked at it for some years—when I left home, my daughter gave me a bit of bread and cheese, and I went into West's brewery, and had a glass of 4d. ale—it is a respectable place where I call sometimes and look at the paper—it was after 10 o'clock that morning when I left home—I cannot say how far my house is from the bank, it is a mile or more—I cannot say how long I bad to wait in the bank—I had to wait my turn—I should think I was there more than half an hour—the house I have named was the only house I was in before I got to the bank—the Nag's Head is round the corner, in Whitechapel, opposite the church—I went in there intentionally; they gave me an odd 3d. piece at the bank—I put the other money in my purse, but that I thought I would go and have a half quartern of rum with, and some warm water; I was very cold—I was not dressed as I am now—I had another dress on, which was older than what I have on—I did not want to go in the Dyers' Arms; I was forced in.

Cross-examined by
MR. LILLEY. Q. Did you know the Nag's Head? A. I was in it; I am not used to go to any house—I do not suppose the Nag's Head and the Dyers' Arms are more than 100 yards from each other.

Cross-examined by
MR. RIBTON. Q. How far is it from the bank to the Nag's Head? A. Not more than 150 yards; the Nag's Head is in Whitechapel; you have to go down the main road to get to it—I did not take out my purse at the Nag's Head, nor at the Dyers' Arms—I was not the worse for drink when I got to the Dyers' Arms—I never said I was tipsy—I was so afflicted I could scarcely walk; I bad a great deal to do to get down to the bank—when I got to the Dyers' Arms I was quite sober, and also when I went to the water closet—it was a small leather purse—I am quite sure I saw the purse in his hand.

MR. O'BRIEN. Q. Had you occasion to draw out your purse at all during the time you were in the public house? A. I never drew it out at all; I paid for the rum with a 3d. piece, that I had put between my teeth—I would not put it in my purse in the bank—from the time I left the bank till I got to the Nag's Head, I was not in company with any one—I am a stranger in that neighbourhood.

Fletcher. Q. Did not you say that you went into the nearest public house in Osborne-street? A. I am a stranger in that neighbourhood; I thought I would go into the first public house, but it appears it is the third house—I stated that it was exactly opposite the church—I gave that explanation at Worship-street—previous to the witness being brought forward from the Nag's Head, I said I did not know the name of the house—I said I went in the first house, it being very cold—I said the house round the corner—when I was at Worship-street, I fancied I bad gone into the first house—when I was before the Magistrate I said I was robbed—I did not say you were the person—I said I was hustled and robbed by you and others—I cannot say which of them it was that did actually draw the purse from my pocket.

Cross-examined by
MR. READ. Q. When you got near the Dyers' Arms, did you tell the people that were going to force you in that you were not well? A. No; I did not speak to them—I turned round that street to go home, and Fletcher was with me, and another or two.





JOHN RAWLINS
. I am potman at the Nag's Head public house, in Whitechapel road—I heard of a robbery—the day before I heard of it, I remember the prosecutor coming into my master's house about 12 o'clock as near as I can tell—he was going in the parlour, but he went in the tap room—the landlord and barmaid told him there was a good fire in the tap room

to go in—there was nobody with him when he came in—he had half a quartern of rum and a drop of hot water, that he brought from the bar himself—the prisoner Price was in the tap room, Price, Fletcher, and Atkins came in together, after he was in—I should say in ten minutes or quarter of an hour, I saw them get into conversation with the prosecutor—Fletcher alone did first, and Fletcher offered him some rum—after he drank that, Fletcher offered him another glass of rum—he did not drink that glass, he just sipped it, and Fletcher then emptied the contents into the prosecutor's glass—the prosecutor did not drink that; he told them they might put some hot water to it and drink it themselves, and he went out, and they remained there about half an hour after he left—I had not seen any of them before—I next taw them at Worship-street—I did not take particular notice what day I was there.

Cross-examined by
MR. RIBTON. Q. Were any of the prisoners in before the prosecutor came in? A. No; I am sure of that—Atkins and Price came in one after the other, as fast as they could come—I was in and out of the tap room all the time, and from there to the bar—the prisoners staid about half an hour after the prosecutor left.

Cross-examined by
MR. READ. Q. Was the prosecutor quite sober when he came in? A. Yes

Cross-examined by
MR. LILLEY. Q. Where wereyoustanding when the prosecutor came in? A. In the tap room, cleaning knives—I cannot say which of the prisoners came in first.

Fletcher. Q. Was it not a fortnight afterwards beforeyouheard of the robbery? A. No; I heard of it the next day—it was a fortnight before I gave my evidence—I first heard of it by people coming into our house—they asked me if I knew the old man that was in our house? I said, yes—they said he bad been robbed of his money—it was not any of the persons outside, or any of the officers of police who informed me.

MR. O'BRIEN. Q. How far is the Nag's Head from the Dyers' Arms? A. I should say about a mile—the prosecutor remained in the Nag's Head an hour and a half, or from that to two hours—there were others in the tap room when the prosecutor went in, but I did not notice them particularly—I do not know how many were in.





JAMES HENRY WILLIAMSON
. I keep the Three Cranes public house, Mile-end-road; it is about half a mile from the Nag's Head. I saw Mr. Dove there on Monday, 21st March, between 4 and 5 o'clock in the afternoon-Fletcher came in with him—I had never seen Fletcher before—I saw Fletcher again at the police court—Fletcher called for half a quartern of ram, and asked for some hot water, which I gave him—they drank it together—after that the prisoner Price came in, and another, who is not here, and Johnson, in company with two, who are not here, came in almost directly after Price-Price and another man stood at the bar, drinking with Fletcher and Dove-Johnson went into the tap room—after Fletcher and the prosecutor bad taken what they had, they sat down on a seat, conversing together, as if they had known each other for years, and then they left together—Johnson and Price followed immediately after them—I have no doubt that Johnson was one of the men—Dove was very collected indeed; he did not appear to me to be in a state of intoxication.

Cross-examined by
MR. LILLEY. Q. Ton had never seen Price before? A. No; I did not see which way they went—I went to the door; I could not see them—Price stood at the bar, and drank what he had.





SARAH ANN HAYDON
. My father keeps the Dyers' Arms, in Cleveland-

street. On 21st March I saw all the prisoners come in—three more persons, who are not here, were in the house at the time—the prosecutor was with them—they came in, but not altogether—Fletcher and Jones, and another, who is not here, were with the prosecutor—one of them had hold of each arm, and another had hold of his back—they wanted him to go in—he refused—they forced him into the house—he said he did not wish for any more to drink—one of them, I cannot be positive which, called for a pint of 6d. ale—Jones paid for it—my mother served it, and I took the money t—Jones and another man, who is not here, put the glass of ale to Dove's mouth—I had never seen Jones before—I saw the prisoners again on Saturday, 2nd April, at the police office—I am quite certain they are the men.

Cross-examined by
MR. READ. Q. You say Dove was forced into your door? A. Yes; two of them bad hold of his arm, the other was pushing his back—they said he was quite welcome—I heard him say he did not want any more to drink—Jones paid for a pint of 6d. ale, offered it to him, and said he was quite welcome—there is a tap room to our house.

MR. B. THOMPSON. Q. Where did the prosecutor go after the ale was held up to his mouth? A. Into the back yard, and Fletcher and another man, who is not here, went with him—Jones remained in front of the bar—after Dove was gone into the yard, Price followed him—Atkins and Johnson, who came in together, remained in the house, and then they went out—they went out before Dove came out of the back yard—Atkins and Johnson did not join with the other men; they did not seem to have any conversation with them—I heard somebody in the back yard call "Landlord"—after that I saw Fletcher come out of the yard, and the other men with him; they all followed one after the other, Price' and two more men, who are not here—Jones sat there, and when the others went out he followed them—Price had bad some beer; he did not drirlk it, very nearly the whole pint was left—when Dove came in from the back yard he told my mother he was robbed—my mother and I went to the door, and I saw the whole of the prisoners at the top, all walking together very quickly—Cronan, who was in the tap room, was called out, and he ran after the men—Fletcher, Atkins, and Johnson, were brought back to our house—Dove was there when they came back—he said he could not swear to them, only to Fletcher—Fletcher did not say any thing—Price was not brought back.

Cross-examined by
MR. RIBTON. Q. You say that before they came back from the yard, Atkins and Johnson had left? A. Yes; I saw all the five prisoners walking at the top of the street—I went to the door to look after them—the top of the street is about as far off as the corner of this court—their backs were towards me—they were walking away—I had never seen Atkins or Johnson before—I am able to swear that they were two of the men who were walking away—I did not see their faces, only their backs; yet I will undertake to swear they are the men, because I saw them in our house, and Fletcher, Atkins, and Johnson were brought back almost directly, in five minutes—when we went to the door we saw five men walking—we did not call for Cronan exactly, we called for some of the men, and he came—my mother said, "Some of the men have robbed this old gentleman; go and see if you can see them; they are all gone that way;" and he followed them.

Cross-examined by
MR. READ. Q. You say that Jones, Fletcher, and another person came in with the prosecutor? A. Yes; I cannot say who ordered the pint of ale, but Jones paid for it, and he offered some to Dove, saying he was quite welcome—Dove sat down on a chair, Jones and Fletcher

sat down on a seat—Jones did not have any conversation with the others; he had conversation with Fletcher and another man, who is not here—when they went in the yard, Jones remained in the house—it was about five minutes after they had been in the yard that I saw the people leave the house—Jones left the house after some of them came out of the yard—Jones's pint of ale was very nearly all drank before they went in the yard—Jones did not go in the yard; he was separated from the others by remaining in the public house—he left after the others left—they left the same moment, one after the other—it is not unusual to see three or four men come in at the same time, and go out at the same time—Cronan was in the house that afternoon—I went to the door directly the men left—they had not got up the street—Cronan came while we were at the door; we called him—he did not come out while we were standing at the door—we came in when he came out—my mother told him where the persons were, and he left and went up the street after them—Dove came in from the yard directly after they had left.

Cross-examined by
MR. LILLEY. Q. Who first came out of the yard? A. I could not positively say who came first—Price had conversation with a man who is not here—I had never seen Price before that day.





MARY ANN HAYDON
. I am the wife of William Haydon, who keeps the Dyers' Arms. On 21st March Dove and several other men came in altogether—two or three had hold of Dove—one of them was Jones—I do not recollect that any of the others were with him—Jones bad got bold of his arm enticing him in—they came in, and not two minutes after Atkins and Johnson came in—Jones called for a pint of 6d. ale—he offered some to Dove; he said, "Take some of it, you are quite welcome"—I do not know whether Dove took any—I afterwards saw Johnson and Atkins—I do not remember seeing the other prisoners till they were brought back by the police—I suppose they did not stay at my bar five minutes before Dove went in the yard with some of them, but I do not know who—neither Jones, Atkins, nor Johnson went into the yard—after that I heard Dove call out "Land lord" several times—I said to Jones, "Why don't you go and look after your friend? they are hurting him,"—he said, "O no, they are not, it is all right"—after that they all came in out of the yard, and made their way out of the house—I cannot recollect who they were—I can recollect two of them, but they have not been taken into custody—when Dove came in he appeared to me to be very tipsy—he did not appear to be anxious to come in—he did not want to come in—I consider he was dragged in—I called Cronan out of the tap room—he went after the prisoners.

Cross-examined by
MR. READ. Q. You now say he was dragged in; you said before enticed in? A. I consider them much about the same—they had hold of his arm—they were supporting him—they dragged him by force—they forced him—pulled him—Jones did not go in the yard—none of them left the house till the persons came out of the yard—they all then left, not exactly together, but at the same time—I do not know that Jones remained behind to finish his pint of ale after some of the men had left—I did not notice his remaining—I do not think he did—I looked up the street—Cronan was not there till I called him out of the tap room—I pointed out the men, and he followed immediately.

Cross-examined by
MR. LILLEY. Q. You saw Dove come in and saw the persons come out of the yard? A. Yes; I was in the bar parlour, and in and out of the bar—I cannot see from the bar parlour through the bar, nor into the passage.

Cross-examined by
MR. RIBTON. Q.
 Were you and your daughter at

the door together? A. She taw me go to the door and come out—I saw Jones, Atkins, Johnson, and another man with an umbrella, all walking together—I had not seen them drinking in my house till that day—when I saw them walking away their backs were towards me—I can say that these are the men that were in the house—I saw their backs.

Fletcher. Q. Did you see me in the house till I was brought back? A. I do not remember you at all till you were brought back.





MICHAEL CRONAN
. I was in the Dyers' Arms. On 21st March, from about 3 o'clock till 5, I heard an alarm, and heard Mrs. Haydon call "Mike"—I went out, and when I got to the top of Cleveland-street, I saw Fletcher running across the road towards Assembly place—I went after him and caught him—I said, "Are you the man that was in the beer shop just now?"—he said, "Yes; but I am not the man that robbed him"—I had not accused him of robbing him—I gave him in charge—I asked him whether they were his two friends that were going along?—he said, "Yes"—that was Atkins and Johnson—I followed and came up with them—I asked them whether that was their friend that was in custody?—they said, "No"—there were two officers with me—I told them to bring them back to the beer shop, which they did—when they came back they were noticed by Mrs. Haydon as having been there having some beer—Atkins and Johnson were not running, but walking arm in arm—I saw Dove and Fletcher going through to the back yard a little before 5 o'clock, but did not take notice of them—I was then in the tap room—I was able to see Fletcher distinctly—there were three or four other men there, but I did not notice them—Fletcher was behind them—they were going through into the yard towards the water closet—I heard a noise from Dove, but I did not take notice till they all hastened through the house into the street, and Dove came in and said he had been robbed of 20l. and two half crowns

Cross-examined by
MR. RIBTON. Q. Had you seen Atkins and Johnson in the bar? A. No.

Cross-examined by
MR. READ. Q. Was Mrs. Haydon at the door? A. Yes; she told me they had gone round the corner; that was to the left—I should say the corner is fifty or sixty yards from the Dyers' Arms—I went out immediately—I saw three persons; that was all—the street was pretty clear; there were other persons about—these men were on the path, not on the pavement—I never saw anything of Jones.

Cross-examined by
MR. LILLEY. Q. Did you ever say you would not say anything against these people if you got a sovereign? A. No; I take my oath positively to that.

MR. ROBINSON. Q. You did not see Jones there; you do not say that he was not there? A. I will not swear either way; I did not notice that he was

Fletcher. Q. Was not the officer there when you asked if the other two were my friends? A. He was coming up Assembly-row; I asked whether you had been in the beer shop, and said the man had been robbed—you said you were not the man—you did not deny being in the back yard.

COURT. Q. Did you say anything to him about the back yard? A. Yes; I said, "You were in the beer shop in the back yard"—he said, yes, but that he was not the man who had robbed him.





JOHN PEARCE
 (policeman, K 178). I took Fletcher into custody—Cronan asked him if he was in the beer shop when the old man was robbed—he said he was, but he had not committed any robbery—Cronan gave him in charge to me—there had been some conversation with Cronan and Fletcher before I

came up; I did not hear it—Cronan asked him if those other two (Johnson and Atkins) were not his friends—he said they were—two of my brother officers went and brought them back, and we took the three back to the beer shop to see Dove, but he was so feeble and so defective he was hardly able to give us any account.

Cross-examined by
MR. RIBTON. Q. Are the two officers here who took Atkins and Johnson? A. No; Fletcher was the only one against whom there was any charge—there was a remand, and he was the only one on the second occasion, and on the third occasion the other prisoners were brought in—Atkins and Johnson were not detained at the station; they were not locked up at all; they were discharged; they were taken afterwards by sergeant Whicher.

Cross-examined by
MR. READ. Q. In what street were they first taken? A. In Mile-end Road—you have to turn a corner to go to the Dyers' Arms, but very little; it is nearly opposite—I might be 200 or 300 yards from the Dyers' Arms when I took them—I was on duty, coming towards the Dyers' Arms.

MR. ROBINSON. Q. You say that Atkins and Johnson were discharged at the station? A. Yes, for want of evidence—the inspector sent for some one from the beer shop, and Sarah Haydon came—Dove was at the station; he was apparently the worse for liquor—there were two examinations of Fletcher—none of the others were in custody then.

Fletcher. Q. When you came up, did you not bear Cronan say a man had been robbed at the Dyers' Arms? A. Yes; and you said you had not robbed any one.





JONATHAN WHICHER
. I am a detective police-officer. On 1st April I saw the prisoner Johnson in the Strand, in company with an old man, and Jones was following about twenty yards behind—I saw Price on the other side of the way, in the company of another man, whom I knew to be a companion of Johnson—Price and Jones apparently were watching Johnson-Johnson and the strange man then went into a public-house in the Strand—after Johnson had gone in, Price went and spoke to Jones, who was outside the house—Jones then made a motion with his hand towards the side door of the public-house, and Price went in at the door, and Jones followed him—I then saw Atkins standing outside; I had not noticed him before—I knew him to be a companion of Johnson—I went to Scotland-yard, and returned in about twenty minutes—I then saw Jones and Price come out of the public-house, and speak to Atkins—Johnson then came out of the public-house, leading the old man that he went in with, who was then very drunk—we followed them to Holy well-street, and there they were all apprehended—Johnson was leading the old man, who could scarcely walk—the others were following behind—I have known Johnson, Atkins, and Jones, as companions, for about eighteen months—I had heard of this robbery at the time I saw them in the Strand, and that was the reason I went to Scotland-yard to get assistance to take them—Jones, Atkins, and Johnson, gave false addresses-Jones said he lived at No. 28, Marigold-street, Rotherhithe; Johnson gave his address at some street in Pentonville; I do not know the name of it—I made inquiry the next day, or the next day but one; there is such a street, hut no such person was known there—Atkins gave his address in Brunswick-street, Hackney-road—I made inquiry, but no such person was known—he gave a number; I think it was 20; I found he was not living there.

Cross-examined by
MR. READ. Q. You say they were with an old man?


A. Yes, whom I found afterwards to be a pensioner, who bad just received his pension.

Cross-examined by
MR. LILLEY. Q. Price did not give a false address? A. No.





JOHN MARTIN
. I am a constable and messenger at the Westminster Savings Bank, in St. Martin's-place, Charing-cross. I know Fletcher, Johnson, Jones, and Atkins; I do not know Price—I have seen the four together, more than five or six times, loitering about outside our Institution, at the corner of St. Martin's-lane, and have seen them together more than once at a public-house at the corner of Chandos-street—I have seen them from first to last for about two years—the most recent time was about five months from this time.

Fletcher's Defence. My business occasions me to go into many different public-houses; I serve persons with boot-laces for the trade; I do not deny that I was hurrying when I was taken; I am obliged to hurry; I did not say anything about the robbery till the witness mentioned it to me; it is false that Martin has seen me.

Witnesses to character.






THOMAS JENNINGS
. I live in Bird-street, Lambeth, and am a coal agent. I have known Price ten years to the present time—he is a furrier—I know nothing at all detrimental to his character—he has lodged with me.

Cross-examined by
MR. ROBINSON. Q. Did he lodge with you to the present period? A. Yes—he is a furrier; he works for a lady in the London-road—he mends and cleans furs—I have never seen him at the place—I do not know of his going by any other name—I do not know of his going by the name of Priest—I do not know any of the other prisoners—I am agent to Coles Child, of Belvedere-wharf, and have been so for about twenty-five years—I will swear that I did not tell the officer Whicher that I did not know how Price got his living—Whicher came and asked me a few questions, which were tantamount to legitimate questions, and I gave him a full answer—I mean to swear that ever since Price has been with me he has always gone by the name of Price—his mother's name is Price, not Priest.

MR. LILLEY. Q. Does he support his mother? A. Yes; and I never heard anything detrimental to his character.





SARAH CLEW
. I carry on the business of a furrier, in the London-road. Price has been in my employ for twelve years—he had a two years' character, and I found him perfectly honest in everything.

Cross-examined by
MR. ROBINSON. Q. Has he worked for you to this time, every day? A. Yes; he goes out sometimes with work—he was away one day at the time he was taken—I recollect 1st April—I do not know whether he had any work about the Strand that day—he goes to many different parties—he goes out frequently—I pay him 18s. or 20s. a week—I do not recollect the 21st of March—I pay him sometimes 18s., and sometimes 20s.; it is according to the business—I never knew him to go by the name of Priest.

COURT. Q. Am I to understand that he has been in regular work with you till this time? A. Yes, cleaning and making up furs, carrying them home, and fetching work.





JOHN HAYWOOD
. I am a wood turner, and live in Church-row. I have known Johnson about eight years—he has always borne a very good character for honesty—I never heard anything against him—he is a hair preparer—I do not know where he works.

Cross-examined by
MR. ROBINSON. Q., Did you ever know him by any

other name? A. Yes; Batchelor is his right name—I Deter knew him by the name of Johnson—I cannot say that I knew him to live at Pentonville—he lived in Fuller-street, Bethnal-green Road—he lived there at the time he was taken—he has been lately working at the boot trade—he has lost one of his eyes, and has not been able to work at the hair trade lately.

COURT. Q. What have you known about his character; is he a companion of yours? A. No; I kept company with a sister of his; she did not live with me.

COURT
to
JOHN PEARCE. Q. Do you remember, when Johnson was first taken and discharged, what name he gave? A. The name of Batchelor.
(John Lawley, a cooper, in Red Lion-court, Spitalfields, and Thomas Hardy, an appraiser, in Union-street, gave Fletcher a good character.)

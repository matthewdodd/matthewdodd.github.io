            . I live with Mr. Chessey in Great Eastcheap


. On Saturday last as I was in the back part of the Shop, between three and four in the Afternoon, the Prisoner came in at the Shop Door, took up a Piece of White China and went out with it, and shut the Door after him; upon seeing this, I presently pursued and took the Prisoner with the Piece under his Arm when he was not got above ten Yards from our Door - What do you do with this, says I. Sir, says he, Is it yours? Yes, says I, What Business have you with it? Pray Sir be easy, says he, pray be easy.
Court. Was the Door lock'd?
Smith. I can't be sure of that, but it was shut to.

            . I was going home to Mr. Chessey's, and met the Prisoner with the Piece under his Arm. Smith, and I seiz'd him - Smith asked him where he was going with that Piece. The Prisoner said, Is it yours; and Smith answered, yes; and the Prisoner reply'd, If it is yours, pray be merciful.
Prisoner. I was very much in Liquor, and did not know what I did.
Perrin. I did not perceive that he was in Liquor at all.
Smith. Nor I neither, for he walked off with the Piece very soberly.

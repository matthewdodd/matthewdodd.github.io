            . I live in Essex-street, Whitechapel


. On the 2d of June, about two o'clock in the morning, the watchman called me out of bed, and said he caught the man getting over the wall with this fowl - I know it to be mine; it roosted in the yard: I have known the prisoner about the neighbourhood - I have lost twentytwo fowls in the course of the last winter.

            . I am a watchman. About half-past two o'clock in the morning I saw the prisoner on the wall with a fowl in his hand; I took him - he was searched at the watch-house, and five skeleton keys found on him - some of them sit Mr. Snell's house.
Prisoner. Q. Where were you when you apprehended me? A. In Greig's-court.
Prisoner's Defence. I had been drinking, and had been up that court in conversation with a young woman; as I was coming out, the watchman caught me, and two young men passed me.

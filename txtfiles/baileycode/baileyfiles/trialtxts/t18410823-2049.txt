WILLIAM BELCHER
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
16th of July, 1 pair of boots, value 17s., the goods of 



Henry Hussey.






HENRY HUSSEY
. I am a shoemaker, and live in Greek-street, Soho. On the 16th of July, at eight o'clock in the morning, I placed these shoes partly outside and partly inside my door—I did not miss them till the policeman brought them at half-past eight—those produced are them.

Cross-examined by
MR. PAYNE. Q. How do you know them? A. By their make—they are my own cutting Out—I made them for a gentleman—I will swear they are mine by the make, cutting, and every thing—there is a peculiarity about them—the binding of a button-hole was frayed, and I intended to send them back—I am certain of them.





ROBERT TAYLOR
. I am a policeman. On the 16th of July, soon after eight o'clock in the morning, I found these boots under the prisoner's jacket in Queen-street, Seven Dials.

Cross-examined. Q. How came you to go to Mr. Hussey? A. He came in that direction, and it was the nearest shop—he was three or four hundred yards from there—he said a man had given them to him to carry.




GUILTY
.** Aged 18.—


Transported for Seven Years—Ship.

ANNA MARIA BEEVES.
I am one of the Matrons of the Refuge for the Destitute. The prisoner was an inmate there under me, and had been there thirteen or fourteen months—on the 9th of June I missed her between five and six o'clock in the evening, and on examination I missed the various articles stated in the indictment—five of them have been found since—I have looked at them before—they belong to the various customers, and we must make them good.

I apprehended the prisoner on Friday, the 13th of June, in Maidenhead-court, Wheeler-street, Spitalfields, dressed in these articles—I have the Act of Parliament incorporating the Society.

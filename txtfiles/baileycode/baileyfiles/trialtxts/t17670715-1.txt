            . I am a messenger of the Navy-office
. On the 26th of last month, about ten at night, coming out at the Post-office, Lombard-street


, I felt something tug at my pocket; I turned about in about three or four yards going, and laid hold of the prisoner; (I was in a little crowd;) I said, I believe you have made free with my pocket; he said, me no understand English; he had his hand behind him; I pulled it forward; he had my handkerchief in his hand; I took him to the watch-house.
Prisoner's defence.
I found it under a coach.
Prosecutor. He had not time from the time I missed it to stoop, much less to take it from under a coach.

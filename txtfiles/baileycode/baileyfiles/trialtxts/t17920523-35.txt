I am headborough of St. George's. I apprehended the prisoner on the 15th in St. Giles's: and I found in a closet six bridles and one martingal; and on the sacking of the bed on which he lay I found six pick-lock keys.
(Welch deposes to the bridles.)
The prisoner said in his defence that a countryman of his had left the articles for him to take care of.

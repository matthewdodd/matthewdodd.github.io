            , junior. On the 5th of the present month, the patrol came and told me that a man had rolled a barrel out of the yard. I went with him to the watchhouse where it was lodged, and looked at it. I saw it was my employer's cask. I went down to the brew-house and told the clerk. We examined it together, and found it contained beer grounds. I went in the yard, and fastened the men in the yard. I questioned the men upon it, and one of the men confessed.
Q. What was the prisoner - A. I knew him by sight; he had worked there some time before.

            . I am a brewer's servant. The man came to me, and asked me if I could get him a barrel of grounds. He said, he would stand ten shillings in the course of the night. The man did not come for it, and so the watchman started the ground vat over again. The next morning the man came. I assisted in rolling the cask down the yard, and the prisoner took it by the gate.
Mr. Alley. You rolled it across the yard; he was there ready to receive it - A. Yes. He was not with me when I took it out of the ground vat.
Q. You rolled the cask down the yard; where was the prisoner - A. He was in the yard by the stable door; he took it of me before it got out of the gate, and he rolled it out, and the patrol stopped him with it.

            . Q. You are a brewer's servant too - A. Yes. On Thursday night I was in my master's employ. Mr. Lawrence asked me if I had any objection to remain in the yard as a watchman. I was informed by 
               
                  Joseph 
                  Hobbs
               



            , that the prisoner had been to enquire to get a barrel of grounds. He said, that he had made an agreement with the prisoner to let him have a barrel for ten shillings. He was to come at five o'clock in the morning. He did not come. The gate was locked. About half after five, the draymen came into the yard. I took and started the grounds into the vat. I went into the stable to look after the horses.

             filled the barrel, and the prisoner and him took it out.

            . I am a patrol. A little better than half after five in the morning of the 5th, I was going past the gate of this yard. I saw the prisoner rolling this cask out of the gate, and I saw him rolling it down Drury-lane. He rolled it into the coal-yard, and he placed it behind a cart. I then watched him. He went to the top of the coal-yard and looked about, as if he was watching somebody. I and my partner took him to the watchhouse. He at first said he bought it at the other end of the town; at last he said he bought it of Combe's stock. I saw him come out of the gate.

            . I am a patrol. I told my partner to conceal himself, very likely he would come and take another. He returned to the Duke of York. He said, if I give you and your partner five shillings a piece, that will satisfy you. I said, that will not do. We took him to the watchhouse. I returned to enquire if any such thing had been stolen from there.
Mr. Lawrence. That is the cask of my employers.
The prisoner said nothing in his defence, nor called any witnesses to his character.

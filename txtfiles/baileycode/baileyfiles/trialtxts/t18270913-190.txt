            . I am the wife of Robert Goodson - he lives in Rosemond-street, Clerkenwell


. Between two and three o'clock in the afternoon of the 25th of July, I was sweeping the parlour, and on turning round I saw the prisoner on the wrong side of the counter; he appeared to be returning from the till; I was frightened, and let him go: I then called Watkins out of the bake-house, who pursued - he ran down Corporation-lane, but was taken; he had taken two handsfull of silver, and left the till open: there was 8s. 6d. found on him, but I missed more than that; I had seen the till safe not two minutes before. The prisoner was a stranger to me.

            . The prosecutrix called me - I pursued the prisoner, and caught him in Ashford-street; he had 8s. 6d. in his hand; he offered it to me, but I refused to take it.

            . I am an officer. I received charge of the prisoner, and produce the money, which I have had ever since.

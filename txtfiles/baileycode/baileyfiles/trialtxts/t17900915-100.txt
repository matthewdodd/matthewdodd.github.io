             sworn.
I live at No. 7, Tottenham-court road


; I missed the things in the indictment, and the prisoner was gone; I took her in as an act of charity: the pawnbroker produced a gold pin, pledged by some person, but whether by the prisoner or not, he could not say; but the prisoner came afterwards, and said she had pledged such a one.

             sworn.
I am a cook, out of place; I lodged at the prosecutor's, and heard somebody at her drawer on the night of the robbery, and at the till, and the prisoner was gone in the morning.

Prisoner. I did it through distress.

MARGARET REARDON. On the 7th of November I missed my gown from No. 4, Greyhound-court


 - I had slept there with the prisoner two nights; the gown hung on a nail in the bed-room; the prisoner told me afterwards that she had stolen it, and was sorry for it - she gave up the duplicate to the constable: I did not know her before these two nights - I went out at six o'clock in the morning, leaving her in bed; I returned at eleven, and missed it. I am a servant, but was then out of place.

            . I took the prisoner up. I found two duplicates on her - one is for this gown; she said she took it, and had pawned it.

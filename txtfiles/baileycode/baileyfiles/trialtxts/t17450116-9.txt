            . The 25th of December the Prisoner came to my shop in the Cloysters


, and said, he came from his master (who I knew, but I did not know the boy
) he said I must send two frocks, a waistcoat, and two pair of breeches, and a bill of parcels, with a receipt, and he would pay the money. I did so, and sent them by a work woman and a servant, and he snatched them from her, and run away. He was taken up upon another account: he said he was a naughty boy to use me so; he had the breeches on then.

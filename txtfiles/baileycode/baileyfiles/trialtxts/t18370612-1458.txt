. I am the prosecutor's brother, and live in Great Warner-street, Clerkenwell. On the afternoon of the 24th of May I was going up stairs, and met the prisoner with a bundle under her cloak—I went up stairs afterwards to make inquiry if any thing was missing, and then ran after her—I overtook her about a hundred yards off with the bundle—she dropped it when my brother came up—I fetched a constable, who took her into custody.





ANTHONY TAOIOLI
. I live with my brother—he came and asked me about a strange woman—I went down stairs, and found the prisoner in his custody with these articles, which are mine—I had seen them five minutes before.

MARY ANN KEYWORTH
. I live in Charles-street, Whitechapel. The prisoner hired a ready-furnished room of me—she brought a man at her husband—she paid the rent—on the 9th of March they left the room locked—I had a broker and opened it, and missed all the articles stated—all the things had been taken out of the room—the prisoner hired the room, and said the man was her husband, but I have since found that he is not—they took the lodgings in the name of Charles and Mary Denny—when both came together she said the man was her husband, but since that she has said he was not her husband—these are some of the things.





WILLIAM BUTLAND
. I live in Whitechaptl-road. These fire-brasses, blanket, and pillow, were pawned by the prisoner on the 24th of February, 4th of March, and 7th of March.





JOHN MCGUIRE

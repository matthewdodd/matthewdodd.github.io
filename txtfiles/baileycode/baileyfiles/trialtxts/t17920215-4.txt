             sworn.
I am a grocer
; I lost two hats, and two spoons, on the 20th of January; I missed them a little after six in the evening; every thing has been found but the spoons.

                   JOHNSON
               



             sworn.
I am on a visit at Mr. Dennis's; I missed the articles in the indictment from Dennis's parlour; they were there between five and six; it is a silver watch; they laid on the table; I saw the things on Tuesday following, in the constable's hands.
- DENNIS sworn.
I am clerk to my brother; I missed my great-coat on the 20th; I saw it about three o'clock; on the following Tuesday I saw it at the Mansion-house.

                  ROBERT
                   GRAVES
               



             sworn.
I am a constable: I was out about the 20th of January last, in Old-street; I heard the cry of stop thief! I saw the prisoner Alford run, and he fell down; I took him into custody, and brought him to the public-house; this was a mile and a half from where the robbery was committed; we did not search him then; Alford wished to be admitted King's evidence; he said, if he was admitted evidence, he would tell me all he knew; he delivered me this watch (produced); I found also a knife, and two pocket-pieces; Metcalfe was then also in custody.

             sworn.
Between the hours of six and seven, I and three officers were coming down Old-street; we saw the two prisoners and Munday; Munday had the hats; I laid hold of him.

                   WRIGHT
               



             sworn.
I am an officer; I took hold of Metcalfe; my reason for stopping him was because I knew him before; I ran after him; he fell down, and I picked him up; I had hold of one arm, and my brother officer had hold of the other; we took him to the watch-house, and there he delivered up a watch.


                  CHARLES
                   MUNDAY
               



             sworn.
I was an accomplice; I was to meet these two at the Red-lion, Moorfields; I went; and we went out in the afternoon, on purpose to do some robbery; we went into Thames-street


; between five and six, we saw a door open; 
               
                  James
                   Metcalfe
               



             went up stairs, and brought down a great-coat and a hat; he gave them to 
               
                  Richard
                   Alford
               



            , and he went to the corner of Trinity-lane; it is near the house; Alfred stood there, to look out, and I stood facing the house; and he put the coat on his back, and the hat on his other hat; then Metcalfe went up again into the house, and brought down a single hat; he went up a third time, and brought down a pair of silver table-spoons; I did not know any thing of the watch; he gave them all to 
               
                  Richard
                   Alford
               



            ; he gave me the two table-spoons, but I gave them to 
               
                  Richard
                   Alford
               



            ; he had all the things: we went up Trinity-lane, and up to Cheapside; going up, he gave me the two hats, and I put them into my handkerchief; he had the great-coat on his back; he had it taken off his back where I was admitted an evidence, at the Mansion-house: we went into Old-street, and sold the two table-spoons to Mr. Harris; I did not go in, but they two went in, and they told me, when they came out, they had sold them for 15 s. Just after they two came out, I was at the side where the Dolphin is; they went the other side of the way; it was about seven o'clock in the evening; we had been about a quarter of an hour from the house. (The hats deposed to.) One has a mark in the inside.

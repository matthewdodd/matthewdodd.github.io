JOHN SHAPCOTT
 was indicted

 for feloniously uttering a forged request for the delivery of 5 1/2 yards of woollen-cloth, and 5 yards of silk serge, with intent to defraud 



John Boyd; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






HENRY TUCKEY
. I am in the employ of Mr. Dewdney, who superintends a woollen-draper's shop, No. 29, Ludgate-hill. On the 25th of August, the prisoner brought an order to me, stating that he brought it from Mr. Chivers, of Eaton—I gave it to Mr. Dewdney, who authorised me to execute it, which I did—I gave the prisoner 5 1/2 yards of woollen-cloth, with a bill—he left the order with me—I had seen him previously—I did not know him to be in the employ of Mr. Chivers.

Prisoner. Q. Did you execute the order according to what was stated in the note? A. I did not, not having the silk serge by us—I did not send it—I gave the same quantity of cloth as was stated, in the note.





JAMES CHIVERS
. I am a tailor, and live at Eaton. The prisoner was in my lervice, but left me on Saturday the 21st of August—I did not authorise him to get any goods for me, either when he was in my service, or afterwards—this order is not my writing—the whole of it is the prisoner's writing—I have seen him write when in my service—(read.)





JOSEPH SHACKELL
. I am a police-inspector. I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark, of this Court—(read)—I know the prisoner to be the man who was convicted—I was present at his trial.




GUILTY
. Aged 24—


Transported for Life.
(There was another indictment against the prisoner.)

Fourth Jury, before Mr. Recorder.

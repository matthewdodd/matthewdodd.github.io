: On the 5th of January, I lost a she ass and a foal, from Highgate-common; I received information of it about a quarter after eight in the morning; I pursued, and overtook the prisoner in Colney-hatch-lane; he was leading the mother by a halter, and the colt following; I told him he had taken it off Highgate-common, and he said he had not; I told him it belonged to me, and he must go back with me; I brought him back to Highgate, took him before Mr. Bennett, and he was committed; I bought it three or four months ago; I knew nothing of the prisoner before; I am sure it was my ass.

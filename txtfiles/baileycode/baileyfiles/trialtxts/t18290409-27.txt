            . I am in the employ of Mrs. 
               
                  Sarah 
                  Dennis Goulding
               



             and Thomas Dalmain, music-seller

s, of Soho-square


. The two prisoners were in their employ, as blocking-in boy

s; this is waste paper belonging to my employers - I know it by having deposited it in the kitchen, about a month before, and I saw it safe about a fortnight before it was taken; the prisoners had no right to it - here are about 20 lbs. weight of it.


                  CHARLES 
                  HAINES
               



            . I am a cheesemonger, and live in Little Newport-street. On the 4th of March, 
               
                  Alexander 
                  Giddes
               



             came to me with this paper, and asked if we bought waste paper; I said Yes - he went to the other counter, and gave it to Issac, our butterman; he said "What do you want for it?" he said, 2d. per lb. - I said "Look at it, it is worth double that money:" Issac gave him the money for it, and we sent Watson to the prosecutors', where he said he brought it from.


                  THOMAS 
                  WATSON
               



            . I saw Alexander Giddes bring the paper - he wanted 2d. per lb. for it; Mr. Haines told Issac to send me with the money - I went out with Alexander to go to Goulding and Co.'s, and when we just crossed, and got into Hayes-court, we met Henry Giddes; he joined his brother, and they talked together, but I did not hear what passed: when we got about half way up Greek-street, 
               
                  Alexander 
                  Giddes
               



             offered me a shilling not to go in, for fear they should lose their places - Henry must have heard that, as they were close together; he said it would be the cause of them and two others losing their places - then Henry offered me 1s. 4d. not to go in, and while I went in they ran off; I ran and caught Alexander - Henry was taken a few minutes afterwards.

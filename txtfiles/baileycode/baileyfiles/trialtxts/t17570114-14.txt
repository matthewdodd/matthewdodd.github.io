            , I left the prisoner in my room while I went to market.
Q. Where do you live?
E. Davis. I live in Strutton Ground


. My husband's brother gives me spatterdashes to make, which I give out to poor people to do. The prisoner came to our house and asked me for work, and I let her have some to make up, about three weeks before I was robbed. She came to my house on Saturday the 11th of December, and work being slack she was there all day.
Q. How long have you been acquainted with her?
E. Davis. I had been acquainted with her but about a fortnight, from the time of my giving her work, on the Sunday morning being the 12th. Her landlord came to me and asked what I had done with Mrs. Gray, for she was not come home. Then I went into my closet and missed my teaspoons.
Q. How many did you miss?
E. Davis. I missed three.
Q. Did you ever find them again?
E. Davis. I did.
Q. Give an account how?
E. Davis. I met with the prisoner on the Tuesday following in St. Anne's Lane in the morning. I asked her where my spoons were; she said, she knew nothing of them. I told her if she would tell me, I would not hurt her. Then she told me where they were, and went with me to where they were pawned; she told me two of them were pawned for half a crown, and the other for 16 d. but I found the two were pawned for 3 s.
Q. Did you promise her, you would not hurt her?
E. Davis. I did, but that was not in my power, for my husband was the man.
Q. Where did you find the spoons?
E. Davis. I found them in Orchard-street, at two different houses.
Q. Did she own she took them?
E. Davis. She did. (The spoons produced in court and deposed to.)
Q. From prisoner. Did not you give me a coat to mend of your husband's?
E. Davis. Yes I did.
Prisoner. The spoons were in one of the pockets of the coat.
E. Davis. There was never a pocket in that old coat.

Prisoner's Defence.
I worked for this woman my prosecutrix, and she being out of work, and I too, she bid me come to her house for a coat of her husband's to mend. I found these spoons in the coat pocket, and I being out of business and my landlady threatening to turn me out of doors, I was obliged to pawn them; she came to me and told me she would not hurt a hair of my head if I would let her have them again, and so I did; it was meer necessity that obliged me to do it.

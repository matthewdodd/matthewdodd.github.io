for stealing, on the

WILLIAM FIELD
. I am a policeman. I was on duty, and saw the prisoner in company with two pickpockets, in Short's-gardens, Drury-lane, about six o'clock in the evening of the 3rd of December—he had these brushes under his arm, tied in a handkerchief—I stopped him, and the other two ran away—I asked what he had there—he said a set of brushes, which he had from his father—in going towards the station he said he had bought them to sell again—I made inquiries, and next day found the prosecutor.





JOHN SMITH
. I am shopman to Frederick William Martin, an oil and colourman, in Hampstead-road—I hung these brushes up inside the door-post on the morning of the 3rd of December, and missed them about four o'clock—I did not see the prisoner—I never sold them—they are my master's.

Prisoner's Defence. I bought them for 4s. 6d. to sell again.




GUILTY

Transported for Seven Years.

DANIEL RUSTON RENATUS JOHNSON
. I live in Edward-street, Portman-square. On the 27th of January the prisoner called at my house—. he said he called from my laundress for my washing—(my laundress's name is Mary Firth)—I gave him three shirts, four collars, two pairs of socks, and a handkerchief—I am sure he is the person—I have never seen the things since.





MARY FIRTH
. I did not send the prisoner for the linen from Mr. Johnson—he is a neighbour's child—I did not authorize him to get this linen, and he never brought it to me.

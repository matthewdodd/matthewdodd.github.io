            . I am shopman to Henry Keymer, linen-draper
, of Bishopsgate-street


. On the 12th of May, between five and six o'clock, this cotton was on a shew-board in the shop, near the door - I heard a noise, ran out, and saw several persons in pursuit - I picked up this print a few yards from the door.

                  CROOSE
               



            . I am a grocer, and live next door to Mr. Keymer. I saw the prisoner on his knees, drawing something from the shop; I thought he might be at work there, but he got up, and I saw him folding this print in his apron, he passed my door, I caught at him - he dropped it and ran off; I lost sight of him in turning the corners, but always saw him again on turning myself, and am certain he is the man - I saw him taken - he dodged us up and down.

            . I am an officer. I heard an alarm - went in the direction, and found Croose holding the prisoner - he appeared quite sober, but afterwards either shammed or was drunk.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I was very much intoxicated; the officer said "You foolish fellow to get drunk."
JOHN GREEN. I did not say so; I told the Lord Mayor that he was not sober, but was perfectly collected.



               GUILTY
            . Aged 19.

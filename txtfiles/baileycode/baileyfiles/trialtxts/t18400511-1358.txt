THOMAS RICKARY PRESTON
. I am captain, of the brig Mary Ellis, which was lying at Wapping. On the 30th of April, I was in Aldgate, near the Minories—I felt a click at my pocket—I turned round and the prisoner had my handkerchief in his hand—I collared him—I cannot say what became of the handkerchief—this is it—(examining one)—I know it to be mine—I am certain it is the same—I saw him take it partly out of my pocket.





THOMAS JONES
. I heard a confusion as I was standing at our house, and saw a handkerchief in our lobby—it was close by where they were—I took it up, went to the door, and there saw the prosecutor collaring the prisoner—I said I would get a policeman.

Prisoner's Defence. I was walking along, and this gentleman caught hold of me and said, "You have got my handkerchief."—I said I was willing to be searched; he said he was sure I had it; a lady held up a silk handkerchief and said, "Here is a silk handkerchief "—I did not have any handkerchief in my hand.

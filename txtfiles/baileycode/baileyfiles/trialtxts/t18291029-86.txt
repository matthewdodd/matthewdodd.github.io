. On the 17th of September, about a quarter-past seven o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came and requested to look at some black veils; I reached down the box, and placed half a dozen on the counter, not intending to show them to him; I then took out one veil, and showed it to him - he did not like that, and I threw it into the window -I was about to show him another, when he seized the half dozen on the counter, and rushed out: I jumped over the counter, pursued, and never lost sight of him till he was taken - two of the veils were found.
Prisoner. Q.Are you certain it was me? A. Yes, quite; I said I thought you had a ring on your finger, and I think so still.

            . I am a Bow-street officer. On the 17th of September I was on duty, and heard Stop thief! called - I saw the prisoner going from the shop; I chased and took him - he was running fast; as soon as I took him he threw down this veil; I took him to the watch-house, and saw he was doing something to his finger - I said,"What are you doing?" he said, "What is that to you?" and he put his hand behind him.

            . I am in the service of Mr. William Dudley, a hosier
. On the 15th of September, about half-past eight o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came in, and asked for some black silk handkerchiefs; Mrs. Webb shewed him some - he said they were not good enough; she shewed him some others - he then made a sudden dart, with intent to strike us both, took up twelve handkerchiefs, and ran away; I ran out, but he made his escape down King-street - I am sure he is the man: the property has not been found.

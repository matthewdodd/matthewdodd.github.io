            . I am the wife of William Smith - we live up two pair of stairs, at No. 13, Henry-street, Hampstead-road


. My child's jacket, waistcoat, and trousers, were on a chair in my room - I left my room for about ten minutes, and when I returned, they were gone, but I did not miss them till the next morning; I knew the prisoner, but had never given him permission to take my things.

            . I keep this house. On Sunday, the 10th of June, I was standing at my door with my mother, when the prisoner passed by me and went up-stairs; he came down again with the clothes under his arm; I saw the sleeve of the jacket quite distinctly; the next morning I heard the things had been stolen; I did not stop him, because I had no suspicion of him; he had been there on the Friday night.

            . I lodge in this house. I was standing at the door with Mrs. Gribble, and saw a man going out with the child's dress; I knew the jacket, but I cannot say that it was the prisoner.

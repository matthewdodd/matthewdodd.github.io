             - he is a hosier
, at No. 98, Grafton-street


. On the evening of the 1st of May, about nine o'clock, a woman said two boys had run away with a hat - I saw the two prisoners carrying a hat, and running away together, about fifty yards from the house. I pursued them; they turned round Windmill-street, and dropped the hat - I took them both myself. They denied any knowledge of the hat. I gave them both in charge. We had missed a cap on the same day.

            . I am an officer, and took the prisoners, and found this cap on Lynch's head - he had no hat.
LYNCH'S Defence. I met this boy, and asked which was my way, and while we were talking the man came, and seized us. I had not seen the hat. I bought the cap ten days before.
LEE'S Defence. I was walking by the gateway, and the officer seized me.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

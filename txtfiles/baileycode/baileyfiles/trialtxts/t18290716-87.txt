             is my sister's little girl - she had a necklace on; her father's name is

            . I was standing at the street door on the 23d of June - she was playing opposite; I saw the two prisoners close to the child; I saw Williams unsnap the necklace, pull it, and it fell on the ground; the other did not do any thing, but he was in company with him - my sister ran over, and took them both; the necklace was picked up, and the girl, who had been nursing the child, gave it me - I know it was the same the child had on: the prisoners were both secured.

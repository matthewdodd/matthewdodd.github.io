            . I am shopwoman to Mr. Thomas Flint, haberdasher
, Fish-street-hill


. On the 11th of April, about nine o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came in and asked for buttons; I shewed him several gross of wire buttons; he bought three gross, and then asked to see pearl ones; I shewed him four gross. I was called away, and on returning to him found only three gross on the counter; I had counted them, suspecting him before - I charged him with taking one; he denied it; we desired him to give them up, Mr. Flint came down; he then offered to pay for them, saying, it was of no consequence whether he had them or not; there was the money. He at length pulled them from under his coat.

            . I was fetched down. The prisoner denied the charge; I sent for a constable; he then endeavoured to force me to take the money; and after very intimidating conduct he produced them from under his coat.
Prisoner's Defence. As soon as I produced them I offered the money for them; Mr. Flint would not take it.

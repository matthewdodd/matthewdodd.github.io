On the 1st of May, a few minutes before twelve o'clock, I was in the Belvidere-road at the entrance of the Suspension-bridge—I felt a tug at my pocket—I turned, and saw my handkerchief in the prisoner's hand—I seized him by the collar, and told him to drop it—he dropped the handkerchief, and Evans took it up—it is mine—this is it—I gave him to the officer.





THOMAS EVANS

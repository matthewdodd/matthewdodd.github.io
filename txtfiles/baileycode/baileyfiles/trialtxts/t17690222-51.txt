. I saw the prisoner at the bar go and take these eight cheeses from off a pile, and go away with them. I followed and took them from him. This was on the 22d of this instant, February, about seven in the evening.

A man came and asked me if I would earn a pot of beer to carry eight cheeses. I took them up, and was taken up with them. I am a lighterman by trade.

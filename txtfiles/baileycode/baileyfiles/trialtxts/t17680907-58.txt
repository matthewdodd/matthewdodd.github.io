, and live in Shoe-lane


; on the 24th of August at night we missed a tea-chest, with the spoons and tongs in it. as in the indictment; I cannot take upon me to say the prisoner was in my house that day, as many people come to dine daily.

            , a Jew. I got a constable, and secured the prisoner, and asked him how he came by them; he said they were his uncle's property; there were three tea spoons and a pair of tongs (produced in court)
Adlington. These are my property, they were in the tea-chest when it was taken away.
Marks. The prisoner owned he went into a cook's-shop in Shoe-lane, and took them away; I went to the prosecutor's house, his wife told me she had lost a tea-chest and these things the night before.

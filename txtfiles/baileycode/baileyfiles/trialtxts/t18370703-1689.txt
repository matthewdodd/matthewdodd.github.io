HERRIETT NICHOLOSON
. I am the wife of Robert Nicholson, who keeps a shoe and stay-shop, in Ernest-street, Regent's Park. the prisoner came into the shop, on the night of the 13th of June, with a man—she asked for some shoes—she threes would fit her—she then asked for some at half-a-crown—I had some on a line—she said she together would fit her—she then wanted some with Brunswick tines, but she objected to them, being leather—I observed the window was tumbled and missed a pair of fours which I had shown her—I asked her about them, and then she said she had not seen a pair of fours—I said they had been there, and they should be found before she left the shop—she looked about the shop, and said "Here is a pair, sure enough"—but is saw them drop from under her cloak—I gave her into custody.

            . I am a coal-merchant
, and am in partnership with my brother Henry; we live in Great Scotland-yard. The bridle was taken off the horse's head in the street.
JOHN FURZEMAN. I am a constable. I stopped the prisoner in George-street, St. Giles's, about seven o'clock in the evening on the 5th of January, with the bridle tied up in two aprons; Beavington was carrying it. I asked what he had got? he said it was a bridle which they had picked up in Berners-street; I detained them. Next morning, I found it belonged to Messrs. Pickworths. The prisoners were in company together. Templar ran away immediately as I took Beavington.

GEORGE NUTLEY SEARLE. On the 9th of May, about quarter past 9 o'clock in the evening, I was in Fleet-street


; I thought I felt my handkerchief taken from my pocket - I turned round and saw the two prisoners in possession of Herdsfield - I took hold of Rosetta, and saw the handkerchief drop from one of them.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

            . I was in Fleet-street, and saw the prisoners coming together towards Fleet-market: I saw them again in about twenty minutes, and Rosetta's hand was towards the gentleman, but I did not see him take any thing - I laid hold of them and saw the handkerchief fall.
Cross-examined. Q. How near were you to them? A. Six or seven yards off.
BENNETT'S Defence. I know nothing of it - I never saw this person before - I was going my way and suppose he was going his.

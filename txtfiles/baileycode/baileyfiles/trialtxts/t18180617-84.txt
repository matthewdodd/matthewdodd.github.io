. On the 2d of June I the prisoner came to the shop, and asked to look at some thread lace. Mrs. Stobbs shewed her two boxes; she looked at them for a quarter of an hour, but did not buy anything, and immediately left the shop. Soon after, Mrs. Stobbs missed the lace. Mr. Hunter brought the prisoner back.

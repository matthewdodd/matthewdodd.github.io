            . On the 24th of December, between eleven and twelve o'clock at night, I met the prisoner in Great Tothill-street; she asked me to give her some gin, and pleaded hard for it, as it was very cold - I said if she would show me where I could get a glass fitted to my watch I would give her some; she pointed out a shop at the corner of Little Tothill-street


 - I got a glass there; I had two half-crowns and some halfpence in my pocket - the man said it came to 6d.; I said I would give him 5d., but I had not been accustomed to give more than 4l. - I changed one half-crown to pay him, and put the change into my breeches-pocket; I turned out of the shop and the prisoner with me - she pressed me to go home with her, and said she had a good fire; I said, "I want nothing to do with you, I have a good partner at home" - she met another person, and they staid a little behind: I walked on at a good smart pace - at the corner of the street the prisoner came up to me; I said, "I will not be worse than my word, I promised you some gin" - I put my hand into my pocket, and was stunned at missing my money; at that moment I was pinioned behind, and the prisoner took my watch - I got from the clutches of those who held me, and but for a blow she gave me, I should have succeeded in taking the prisoner - she turned down a turning; I followed very near her, and had not the door of a house been open I must have caught her; I went in and followed her up stairs, and only for the thoughts of the consequences I might have found her - I returned down and told the landlord.
Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q.How many children have you? A. Two; I had not been in any gin-shop that night - I had been in two public-houses that day; I was as sober as I am now - it was not a particularly dark night: there were shops all the way; I did not say I did not think she was the woman, but the voice was like hers: I swear to her person and her voice - she was not discharged by the Magistrate, nor by the night-officer; there were two drunken charges in the watch-house, but she never went out - I understood she was told to go about her business, but I interfered; I do not remember the Magistrate saying, if I could not give a better account she must be discharged - I positively deny saying at the watch-house, that I could only swear to by her voice; I never mentioned such a word as that I did not think she was the person; there was no row when the watch was taken from me, nor when she was taken into custody - I saw no one but her; I felt some one pinion my arm - I followed her into a house about one hundred and fifty yards off; it was not exactly a straight road, but I am quite sure I did not lose sight of her - I saw her into the house; she might be with me a quarter of an hour - I understood she was taken a quarter before twelve o'clock; no other woman was taken on this charge - I was talking to the Police-man when the prisoner came up to know what the row was: I do not know what the row was about - I positively deny that it was about my charging another woman with stealing my watch; I am sure the prisoner is the woman.
COURT. Q. You said you had seen her conversing with some one before you lost your watch? A. Yes; I pursued her up stairs in the house, but from fear that something might happen, I came down and spoke to the man in the parlour - he said he could not give me any advice what to do; while I was talking to him I heard some one come down and go out at the street-door - I ran out right and left, and the door was shut - I could not find the house again.
ROBERT CAMPPEN. I am a Police-officer. On the night of the 24th of December there was a drunken woman fell down in the street; my fellow-officer and a woman were by - the prisoner came up the street, and the prosecutor said that was the woman; he did not hesitate a moment - I had seen him about five minutes before; I thought him sober.
Cross-examined. Q. Did he give a clear account? A. Yes, of his being robbed, and the time; he and the prisoner were on the opposite side to where the row was- he said she was the person; he did not say he could swear to her by her voice - the watch-house keeper did not say if he could not give a better account she must be discharged; there are gas-lights about where he was robbed.
COURT. Q. Was she set at liberty? A. No; the Magistrate did not say any thing about his not telling a clear story.
Prisoner's Defence. I was looking at the row when he looked at me and said, "Take this woman;" I said,"What for?" he said, for his watch, and if I would tell him who had it, he would not take me; he said he knew me by my voice - the night officer said he would not take the charge from such a drunken man, and he said I was discharged; I staid a few minutes, and the prosecutor said he would insist that I was the person - the Magistrate asked if he was not drunk - the Police-man said he was a little in liquor, but not so drunk but he could tell the person; I had gone out for some butter when I was taken - they asked for the key of my room, and I gave it up; I had not been out ten minutes; the prosecutor said he did not think I was the person, but I was one of the party - the Police-man swears false, for he heard the officer say he would not take me on the charge of such a drunken man; I will send for my landlord, and persons who saw me, to say I was at home all night - it does not appear very likely that I would stand looking at him.

SUSANNAH GIFFORD
. I am the wife of William James Gifford, a cabinet-maker, in Buttesland-street, in the parish of St. Leonard, Shoreditch—it

is his dwelling-bouse. About twenty minutes past nine o'clock this morning I was cleaning my room, the first floor lodger called me, and said I had been robbed—I went into the street, and followed the prisoners—I called, "Stop thief," and he threw down this article in the street—I took it up—it turned out to be a pair of trowsers in an unfinished state, or a piece of calico and two yards and a half of fustian—he had got in by throwing up the lower part of the window, and opening a pair of short blinds—I had left the room safe a few minutes before, and the window shut—I had been at work on these trowsers a few minutes before.





MARY ANN VERANT
. I lodge in the prosecutor's house—my husband is foreman in a warehouse. I was looking out of my window, and saw the prisoner looking over the blind of the parlour window—I watched him—he threw up the window, pushed the blinds open, took out these trowsers, and ran down the street—I called the prosecutor, and pursued the prisoner—he dropped the trowsers—I still pursued him till Mr. Smith took him.





FREDERICK URLING SMITH
. I was going down Pitfield-street at twenty minutes past nine o'clock this morning—I saw the prisoner turn from Butterland-street, and drop these trowsers—Mrs. Verant followed him, and called "Stop thief"—I caught him and took him, about two streets off.

 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
30th of January, 1 dead pig, value 20s., the goods of 



Thomas Hatton and another.—2nd COUNT. For stealing 52lbs. of pork.






THOMAS HATTON
. I am a meat and poultry salesman in Newgate-market, and have a partner. I had six pigs delivered to me for sale on the 29th of January—about half-past five o'clock the next morning, my son gave me information, and one was gone—it weighed fifty-two pounds—it was a dead pig, which is called a porker.





CHARLES SELBOURN
. I watch the market. On the night of the 29th, I saw six pigs at the prosecutor's premises—a man gave me information—I went and missed one pig—I went as far as the bottom of Holborn-hill—I found the prisoner in the watch-house, with the pig—there was a ticket inside the pig, with the name of Franklin on it.





THOMAS BATTON
. On Friday morning, 30th of January, about twenty minutes to three o'clock, I was calling the time up Robin Hood-court, and observed the prisoner coming down the steps with something on his shoulder—I am a watchman—he saw my lantern, and shyed from me, and turned back—I followed, and took him—he had got a dead pig covered with a coat.





THOMAS HATTON

(Joseph Perkins, carpenter, Ship-yard; James Clark, publican, Richmond-street; Robert Hamly; and Sarah Willet, deposed to his good character.)

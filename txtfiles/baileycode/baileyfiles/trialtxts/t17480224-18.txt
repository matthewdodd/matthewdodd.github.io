            's door; I saw the Prisoner make a motion with his hand, and saw him put it into his coat pocket. I had some papers and things of value in my pocket-book, which he missed: I walked by the side of him till I came as far as Corbet's Lottery-Office, and then I pushed him into the house and secured him, and he dropped the handkerchief in the shop.
Q. You did not see him drop it?
Woodfall. No, I saw it upon the floor in the shop.

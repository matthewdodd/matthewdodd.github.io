About half-past seven o'clock in the morning, just as the warehouse was open, I saw the prisoner take this cotton, which was near the door - there were two other servants in the warehouse, but they were at the back part; I was about seven yards from the door - my back was towards the prisoner when he came in, but my face was to him when he took it; he went out with it - I went after him, overtook him with the print on his shoulder, and brought him back; he had five pieces of cotton.

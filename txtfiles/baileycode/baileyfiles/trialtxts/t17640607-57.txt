            , and live in King-street, St. George's, Middlesex. On the 23d of April, between two and three in the afternoon, I was in Stepney church-yard



; there were many people; as I was going by the posts, I was obliged to stop, the crowd was so great; and when I got by the posts, I put my hand in my pocket, and missed my purse, in which were the things mentioned in the indictment; the guinea was a Queen Anne's guinea, a 5 s. 3 d. piece, four shillings, and three silver groats. I never heard of my things, till Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



             advertised them the Wednesday after. I went to Sir John's, on the Thursday, and he bid me come on the Saturday, at 12 o'clock. When I came there, I told him what I have said here: I saw none of my things, but the ring, which the evidence has now here. (Produced and deposed to.) I remember seeing the evidence in Stepney church-yard at the time, and remember I was very angry with her for shoving me.

                  Brinklow 
               



            . On Easter Monday, the prisoner and I went from her lodgings together. I have known her about two or three years, and became acquainted with her before Mr. Brinklow, my husband, and Mr. Elger, her husband, were transported: we used to meet at houses together. (See No. 289, in last mayoralty, Brinklow's trial; and No. 176. in Sir 
               
                  Samuel 
                  Fludyer 
               



            's mayoralty, Elgar's trial.) I had lived with her about a fortnight, in Eyre-street-hill: we went from her lodgings on Easter-Monday, about 10 or 11 o'clock in the forenoon; we were to meet at 
               
                  William 
                  Holiday 
               



            's, at the Wine-vault, facing St. Ann's church; we went there, and had some rum, and went away for the city; he went with us to the Mansion-house; we met 
               
                  John 
                  Martin 
               



            , at the fruiterer's, opposite the Mansion-house; after that, the prisoner, I, and Mr. Martin, went as far as Leaden-hall-street, where we left him, and went and took coach in Whitechapel, and drove to Stepney-church, between one and two.
Q. What was your intent in going there?
A. Brinklow. We went there with intent to pick pockets. Sermon was almost over when we got in: we went into the church, and in going in, the prisoner picked a gentlewoman's pocket of 2 s. and a piece of mother-o'-pearl: when we came out, the prisoner signified to me, to get before this gentlewoman; in getting by her, I brushed her, and she said she would give me a slap on the face. Somebody trod the heel of my shoe down, and I stooped to pluck it up before her. When I had put my shoe heel up, I looked round for the prisoner, and she made a motion for me to follow her. I did, and we went into the first public-house we came to, and to the necessary; the prisoner sat down, and turned out a gold necklace, two rings, a guinea, a 5 s. 3 d. about 4 s. in silver, a pair of gold bobs, two sleeve buttons, and three groats: she gave me one of the rings with stones in it; I had the 5 s. 3 d. piece, and 4 s. and the 2 s. which she took out of another gentlewoman's pocket: then we made the best of our way for London, to her lodgings.
Q. Do you know the gentlewoman which you stooped before?
A. Brinklow. It was the prosecutrix. I was taken up for carrying a watch to pawn from New-prison, and then I was admitted an evidence.
Prisoner's Defence.
I was not out that day, much more I was not at Stepney: I had been but a fortnight out of the Gate-house, along with Watson and 
               
                  Francis 
                  Parsons 
               



            . I never was at Stepney in my life.

384. (M.) She was a second time indicted, with 
               
                  
                     William 
                     Holliday

                  Martin 
               



            , not taken, for 


               stealing a metal watch, with a tortoise-shell case, value 40 s. a steel chain, seal and key
            , the property of

            . On Tuesday, the 24th of April, going from Cornhill to the bottom of Bartholomew-lane



, about one o'clock at noon, at the time the blue-coat boys were coming out of the 'Change. I was coming in on the right hand side of the gate, and there were four or five people seemed to make a crowd; I went by, and said, there was room enough to go by, they need not crowd: 
               
                  Mary 
                  Elger 
               



             stood straight before me, and hindered me from going in. As I tried to go on one side, she was before me, and stopped me; when I tried on the other side, she was still before me: there was a man on my right side that hindered me, which I believe to be the prisoner, Holliday. I said to the woman, what need you crowd so, here is room enough; she said, it is true, there is; this whole was but about half a minute. I was going to put the chain of my watch in the inside, and missed it. I never saw my watch again.
Q. What fort of a watch was it?
Ogier. It was a metal watch, with two seals; the outside case tortoise-shell, and a steel chain. I am certain I had it about half an hour before: I had looked at it when it was about half an hour after eleven: I recollected the woman's face very well, and I think I recollect her voice: it appeared as if she had some design in stopping me. As soon as I felt for my watch, the place was so clear that any body might pass without the least crowd.
Cross Examination.
Q. How near was she to you?
Ogier. She was close to me, before me.
Q. Which way was her face?
Ogier. It was towards me: she was near enough to me to have taken the watch.

                  Brinklow 
               



            . Mrs. Elger, Holliday, I, and

                  Martin 
               



            , were all together, at the Royal Exchange



: the boys were coming out to attend my Lord Mayor, on the Tuesday in Easter-week; Holliday was on one side the gentleman, Martin on the other, and Elger right before him, with her face towards him, and I close after her: he was coming into the 'Change.
Q. What were you doing there?
A. Brinklow. We were picking pockets, and please you, my Lord. Mrs. Elger went up to him, and took his watch out of his pocket, but which way she got it out, I cannot tell; they hindered him from coming either on one side or the other. As soon as she had got it, she delivered it into my hand; it was a figured tortoise-shell spotted case; I never examined it, to look full at it, but I directly gave it to Holliday, under the Piazza's. I don't know what he did with it; we all left the place directly; and made the best of our way to St. Bride's church; Holliday went from us, and said he had put the watch safe: I never saw it after. Then we all went to an eating-house, in Flower-de-luce court, in Fleet-street, and dined: after that, we met at the two Blue Posts, facing Brook-street, Holborn, a place where we generally met at: there we divided a guinea and a crown piece, which we had out of a gentlewoman's pocket. Holliday left us after we came out of the two Blue Posts, intending to fetch this watch, from where he left it in the city; Martin was to have it; we met at Sadler's Wells: Holliday came to us there: we got a watch at the Wells, which Martin had. I heard there was Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            's warrant granted to take me up, and I enquired of Elger if she knew whether Martin had sold the watches, or not? she said, he had not; but when he had, I should have my share of the money: I never got a farthing of it. I was taken up for pawning a watch for Lewen. Your lordship remembers I was here to give evidence, and have been in custody ever since.
Elger's Defence.
I was not there, is all I have to say.
Holliday's Defence.
I have had no connection with the woman in all my days.

For the Prisoner.

            . I know Mrs. Brinklow. On the Sunday before Easter, she went to Newgate, to see a Jew there, whom she lived with: she was gone two or three days from me: she had been at our house all last winter, in Palace-yard, Whitecross-street: my husband is a tea-chest maker. She was a person of such a bad character, that nobody would take her in: my husband went with her to pawn a watch; he once fetched her ring out of pawn; and I heard her say, she would swear forty lives away, before she would go herself. She is a very wicked person: I used to talk to her to go to service; but she said, she would whore, thieve, or do any thing, rather than go to service; and if that would not do, her husband, that lives in good Cow-cross, must maintain her; he lives in good credit: she never was married to

            . I live in Hart-street, and keep the house where Elger lived. I have known her about half a year; she bears a very good character.

                  Brinklow 
               



            ?
A. Pickard. I do not. I never saw her, to my knowledge, in my life.
Q. Was she not at your house on Easter Tuesday?
A. Pickard. She was, and lay with my children.

            . I have known Holliday 5 years; he is something in the coach business, and lives near me, but does not work near me; he always had an extreme good character. I never knew to the contrary but that he was an industrious man.
Q. What are you?
Bell. I am a cork-cutter.

                  Anderson

            . I have known Holliday five years, or better. I am a coach-joyner, and live in Great Rupert-street; he has worked for me two or three years.
Q. How long is it since he worked with you last?
Dearing. About a year and half ago: he behaved extremely well, very civil, and very honest, and is as good a workman as any in London.

                  Laycock 
               



            . I am a master coach joyner. I have known Holliday between 10 and 11 years; he worked in the same shop with me, during my whole apprenticeship; he is a very civil sober man, and an exceeding good workman. I now believe him to be a very honest man, and was he at liberty, I should be very glad to employ him.

            . I am a baker, and live within two doors of Mr. Holliday's mother; I have known him seven years and upwards, and have been intimately acquainted with him; he was always reckoned a very just and good man, quite sober and industrious, and a good workman.

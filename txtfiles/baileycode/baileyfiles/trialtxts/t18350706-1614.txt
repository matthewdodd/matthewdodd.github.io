JOSEPH BEDDER
. I am a clerk in the office of Woods and Forests. I was in King-street about half-past nine o'clock in the evening and I had a white pocket-handkerchief and did not feel it taken but I am certain I had

it safe there—I have not found it—I saw the prisoner in the custody of two gentlemen about a yard behind me—they called out that I had lost my handkerchief, and I immediately missed it.





EDWARD CHESTER
. I am in the East India House. I was in King-street and saw the prisoner lift the prosecutor's cost tail up and take a handkerchief out of his pocket—there was a person close behind him, and in his company but I did not see him give him the handkerchief—I collared the prisoner immediately; he struggled to get away and dropped the handkerchief—I cannot say who took it up—fifty or sixty persons came round in three or four minutes.





GEORGE SILVERSTER
. I am a butcher. I was in king-street and saw the prisoner drop the handkerchief as he was secured—I do not know who took it up—he endeavoured to get from the gentleman.




GUILTY

Transported for Seven Years.

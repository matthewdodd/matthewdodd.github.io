            . I live near Mr. Phillips's stables. About nine o'clock in the evening of the 16th of December I saw Dunn go by with some hay; I ran after him, and catched him with it upon his back; I thought it was Mr. Phillips's, as they came out of the alley where his stables are.
Q. How old is Bray?
Onley. I am told ten years old; I did not see him that night; Dunn owned next morning that they took the hay from Mr. Phillips's stables.

            . I am a servant to Mr. Phillips. Some tiles were taken from the roof that night by which means they got into the stable, and then threw it out at the window. I heard the little boy confess before the Justice that he was concerned in stealing it.
Elizabeth Hill. I met both the prisoners with hay upon their backs; I can swear to Dunn's person; the other is the same size the boy was; I believe him to be the same.
DUNN 

               guilty
            .
BRAY 

               acquitted
            .

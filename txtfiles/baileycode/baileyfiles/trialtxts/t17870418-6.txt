             sworn.
I keep a school at Islington



; I do not apprehend there was any more breaking the house than lifting up the latch, and going into the school, which is on the ground floor; I know nothing of the robbery; these books are the property of the father of two young gentlemen who are boarders in the house, and therefore they consider them under their care day and night; one of them locks them up every night.

I am at school at Mr. Davis's; part of these books are mine; I saw them there the 8th of March.
What were the books? - They were navigation books; they are here; they were kept in the Latin school room; I missed them between six and seven on the morning of the ninth; I was not present when they were found.

             sworn.
The day after the robbery I went to the prisoner's room, and found this box, and some books; I went to the woman's room, the man was abed, and the woman was up; I found this pistol there, and this handkerchief was tied up; it contained some books, and waste paper and pens.
Did the man say any thing? - He said he found them the night before in a field by Sadler's Wells.

Mr. Garrow. Who advised the indictment for burglary? - I cannot say, I believe Mr. Davis himself first mentioned it.
Is this woman, or does she pass, as the wife of the other prisoner? - That I cannot say.
Upon your oath, do not you know that she went in that character for some time past? - I should suppose by finding them both together, that they lived together; she did not go by his name; I never knew her before that day.
- BRACKNEY sworn.
I found a duplicate in the bed; I went and found out the pawnbroker, and he delivered this book to me, which was pawned the 9th March; it is a bible.
Prisoner Peters. I leave it to my counsel.
Sarah Allen. I leave it to my counsel.
Mr. Davis. She said before the Justice that they slept together, but they were not married.
The prisoner Allen called one witness, who gave her a good character.

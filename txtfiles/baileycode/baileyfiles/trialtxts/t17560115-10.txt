            . The prisoner was my servant
 about 4 days. He got up early one morning, and made off. We found he had cut a hole in the cupboard, where we put money; but my mother coming down stairs prevented his taking any. I missed a hat. I advertised it, and he was taken; then I charg'd him with it, and he own'd it to me, and where he had sold it.
Mr. Whitacker. I heard the prisoner own he had taken the prosecutor's hat, and had sold it at Westminster.
The prisoner had nothing to say.

            . I lodge in Limehouse causeway


. On Sunday, the 2d of March, about four o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came and took a lodging for a week; he fetched his chest and clothes; I helped him carry them up stairs - he came down and sat by the fire, and then went up stairs; the landlady went up soon after, and found him in the room where I slept; he had no business there. A young man missed his night cap about eight o'clock; I then missed my clothes; he was in bed - I went to him, and asked if he knew anything of them, he said, No; but I found them in his bag. I sent for the watchman, and gave him in charge.

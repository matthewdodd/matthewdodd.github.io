            . I brought this butter in a flat from Buckinghamshire. I unloaded my waggon early last Monday morning at Mr. Jenkins's, in Swallow-street, Oxford-road


. I put the flat into the care of 
               
                  Elias
                   Revard

                  Elias
                   Revard
               



            . I received the flat of Mr. Fenix; I put it among other things under my master's window. The two prisoners were drinking at my master's house at the time the waggon came in. They went out. They came in again, and had more drink. They went away; I followed them about thirty yards from the place. I found one of them was helping the flat of butter upon the other's shoulder. I called for assistance, and secured them. I got the flat of butter back, and it appeared to be the same flat that Mr. Fenix had unloaded in the morning.
The prisoners said, in their defence, that they found the flat of butter in the road, and that they were going to carry it back to the inn.

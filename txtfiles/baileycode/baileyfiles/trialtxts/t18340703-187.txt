                  ELWINA 
                  DICAS
               



            . I am the wife of John Dicas. Before the 18th of June I had a watch and some jewellery, and £160 in Bank of England notes, and a £30 bill of exchange, a pearl necklace, a pearl brooch, a garnet ring, and brooch, and the other articles mentioned in the indictment - on Tuesday, the 17th of June, between eight and nine o'clock in the evening, I saw them all safe - the maleprisoner had been in our employ between eight and nine months as servant boy - the property was placed in a box, which was locked and put in the bottom drawer of a chest of drawers, in my bed-room - on the night of the 18th of June, between six and seven o'clock, I left our residence to go to the theatre with my husband - the prisoner was at home, and shut the door after us - I returned a little after twelve o'clock, I think - the prisoner was not there - I had not given permission for him to leave - on Tuesday, the 20th of June, the prisoner had not returned - I went to the drawer between eleven and twelve o'clock, and found all these articles missing - the drawer and box were locked, as I had left them, except that the articles were gone out of the box - I lost a £50 note among others.


                  JOHN 
                  FORRESTER
               



            . I am a City constable. In consequence of information, I went to Mr. Harris, a cornchandler, on Saffron-hill, to the first-floor room, and burst open the room-door, which was fastened - I found Joseph Denny there concealed between the mattress and the bed - I searched him, and on him found a bill of parcels - he had his coat off, but the rest of his things on - I do not know about his shoes - I then proceeded to search a box in the room, and in it found 115 sovereigns - and a 5l. note in a purse, 9s. and a watch - the prisoner asked what I wanted with him; I told him - he said he knew nothing at all about it in any way - The female prisoner was taken into custody, and brought to the compter while I was there - she was searched, and two keys found tied to her petticoat-string with a piece of ribbon, one of which unlocks the box the money was found in; I tried it, and the other key opened a small box which was shown to me at Mrs. Dicas's - I did not find any jewellery myself - the box in the prisoner's room was locked - I broke it open - I afterwards applied the key found on the female prisoner to it - it unlocked it - I have not a doubt of its being the key - I had broken the lock off, but not injured it so as to alter the wards.
Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. How long after you went to the room was it that the female prisoner was in custody? A. I should think an hour and a half, or an hour and a quarter - Harris gave her in charge - I saw her in a policeman's custody, who is not here - I did not show her the lock - I merely took the keys from her - she said,"What do you want with them?" - I said, "I shall take them" - she said, "Let me have one of them" - I said, "I can't now" - she did not say she had just received them from her son - she said the keys were hers when I took them from her - I left her to be searched more accurately by a woman - I found a new gown - here is the box - it is a common lock.


                  WILLIAM 
                  BARTON
               



            . I am a sergeant of the police. On the 20th of June, I searched the room occupied by Mrs. Denny - I have been on duty there the last four years, and know she resides there - I was present when the money was found - I went with Forrester to the station-house - I found this pocket-book, a pearl necklace, a pearl brooch, a gold ring, a garnet ring, and a snuff-box, in the box where the money was found - I also found a bill of exchange for 30l. - I was present when the female prisoner was brought to the compter - I found this bonnet in the room.
MR. BODKIN to JOHN FORRESTER. Q. Now the lock is opened, look at it, would not any key open it that would go into it? A. It is a common lock; any key which goes into it would turn it, certainly - the box the property was found in, was a kind of sea-chest - some of the male prisoner's clothes were in it, and there was some female apparel there - the property laid more at the top of the box than the bottom - the money was covered with some of the clothes - the new articles of dress which I found in it, laid at the top - the money and pearls were under the things which I produce - I found a new carpet-bag under the bed - these things were in the box, and there was a coat or two in it - the woman might certainly have opened the box, without seeing the jewellery and money in it.
COURT. Q. Did you find any key on the male prisoner to open the box? A. No.


                  FRANCIS 
                  CLEMMO
               



            . I live in Cranbourne-street, Leicester-square - on the 19th of June, I think it was, the two prisoners came to my shop, (looking at a cloak,) I believe this to be the cloak which they purchased - they paid for it with gold and silver - I exchanged a 10l. note for Mr. Applebee, my next-door neighbour, and gave him ten sovereigns for it- I have the note in my pocket - I took the ten sovereigns into Applebee's shop, and found the two prisoners in the shop - they had brought me the note without any address - I asked for an address, and the male prisoner wrote on it"Mr. Dicas, Falcon-court, Fleet-street."
Cross-examined. Q. Are you aware the woman cannot read or write? A. No; the lad wrote his master's name and address in her presence.


                  JAMES 
                  HARRIS
               



            . I am a corn-chandler - the female prisoner lodges at my house, in the room the officer searched - on the 19th of June she was behind hand in her rent 1l. 7s., which she paid me on the 19th - before that I believe she had been in very poor circumstances.
Cross-examined. Q. She had owed you as much as that before, and paid you? A. Not so much - she has owed me 15s., but did not pay that in one sum - she never paid me so large a sum before.


                  AMELIA 
                  MEDLER
               



            . I am shopwoman to Mr. Applebee, who keeps a straw bonnet shop in Cranbourne-street, Leicester-square. On the 19th of June, I have some recollection of seeing both the prisoners at the shop - they bought a bonnet, which I tried on the female prisoner, and some feathers, which came to 2s. 6d.; altogether, £1 5s. 6d. - I have every reason to believe this is the bonnet - they gave me a £10 note, which I took to Clemmo, for change - when they produced the note, I was joking the young man, and asking him if he had not come from sea, as most generous young men come from sea - the mother said, he had not been to sea.
COURT. Q. Who paid you the £10 note, the man or woman? A. The man - but he handed it to me before his mother.


                  JOSEPH 
                  SAVAGE
               



            . I am a pay clerk in the Bank of England. I have a £50 bank note, which I recollect being presented for payment, on Thursday, the 19th of June, very early in the morning - I do not recollect who by, whether it was by a male or female - the person wrote an address on the note.


                  FREDERICK 
                  JAMES WILLIAMSON
               



            . I am clerk to Mr. Dicas. On the night of the 18th of June, the male prisonerleft the office about half-past six, after Mr. and Mrs. Dicas were gone to the theatre - he returned about ten minutes to seven - (looking at the fifty pound note) here is "Joseph Scandon and Co., 3, Falcon-court, Fleet-street," on this note, in the male prisoner's handwriting; and here is also Mr. Dicas's name and address on the ten-pound note, in his handwriting.


                  JOHN 
                  KEMPSTER
               



            . I am a clerk in the Bank of England - I produce a twenty-pound note, and two ten-pound notes, which were paid into the Bank - the twenty-pound on the 19th of June, for which I gave twenty sovereigns - the other two came into the bank, the one through Hoares, and the other through Dixons - I do not recollect who gave me the twenty-pound note - I believe it was a female - an address and name was on it at the time; but it being in a place that would be punched out, I asked the person the address, and I wrote on it, by her direction, "5, Charles-street, Hatton-garden."
Cross-examined. Q. You do not remember whether it was a male or a female? A. I believe it to be a female, because I remember she would enter into some conversation with me, which I wished to avoid - I recollect it was a woman, but cannot recollect her person - "Norah Denny" being on the note, of course it was a woman - if a man gave me a note, with "Norah Denny" on it, I should certainly notice it- I recollect her telling me she had saved it in service.


                  WILLIAM 
                  MONK
               



            . I live in Farringdon-street. On the 30th of May, I received a twenty-pound note and a five-pound note from Messrs. Hankey's, the bankers - I paid them to Mr. Dicas on the 31st of May - I also gave him this bill of exchange - it has my endorsement.


                  WALTER 
                  WHITE
               



            . I am cashier to Messrs. Hankey, bankers. On the 30th of May, I cashed a cheque for twenty-five pounds, drawn by J. L. Jones and Son - I gave a twenty-pound note for it, No. 17085, dated 30th of April - (looking at a twenty pound note) this is the note.
JOSEPH DENNY to JANES HARRIS. Q. I paid you the rent myself? A. Yes; you gave me a sovereign and a half-sovereign, and I gave you three shillings back.
Cross-examined by Mr. BODKIN. Q. You swore the woman paid it? A. They were both there - she gave the order to the son, to pay it to me.
JURY. Q. By whom was the room taken of you? A. By the mother, in August last - she was present when the money was paid - I did not see where the boy got the money from - I do not know on what day he came - I saw him there on the Thursday, and Wednesday, the 17th and 18th of June, and on the morning of the 19th they paid me - I do not know at what time he came on the 18th.
JOHN DICAS (looking at the £50, £20, and £10 notes). There was no endorsement on the notes when I received them - the words, "Norah Denny," I believe to be the handwriting of the male prisoner, and the endorsement on the other two notes also - I believe them all to be his handwriting - there is £40 short of the money I lost - the whole house is in my occupation.
Cross-examined. Q. How long had he been in your service? A. About eight months - he was as good a servant as I ever had - I have occasionally sent him to change me notes (£10 notes), but not so large as £20 - I always sent him to the grocers, North, Graham, and Co., Fleet-street.
JURY. Q. Were you in the habit of sending him to the Bank for change? A. Never.
COURT. Q. Was the female prisoner aware that her son was in your service? A. Yes: I saw her at my house on the Saturday previous to the 14th - I heard a knock at the door late in the evening, and it was her bringing home his clothes which she had to wash - he had asked me to advance him half-a-sovereign to give to his mother who was in great distress - his wages were £5 a year, and I was to give him clothes at the end of six months, which I did - his mother was certainly aware that he was in no condition to earn £10, or £20.
Joseph Denny to WILLIAMSON. Q. You left me in the house when you went out? A. Yes; when I left for good I left you up stairs.
MRS. DICAS re-examined. This jewellery is all mine, except this seal and key, which I know nothing of - this is my daughter's purse, she knit it - this watch belongs to a young lady who has left us for France.
Joseph Denny to JOHN DICAS, jun. Q. Used not you to take me out with you of a night to singing places, and places of amusement, when master and mistress were gone to bed? A. Never - I did not take you to a house of ill-fame in Bell-court, and treat you. The prisoner behaved very attentive to me when I was ill - he would come up two or thee times a night to me.
MR. DICAS re-examined. I had a good character with him, and he conducted himself well.(Three persons gave the female prisoner a good character.)

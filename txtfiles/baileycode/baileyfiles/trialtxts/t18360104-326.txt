 was indicted

for stealing, on the

Edward George Peache.






EDWARD GEORGE PEACHE
 I drive a cart for Charles Ritchie, who is a baker and miler. On Saturday, the 9th of December, I had a coat which Joseph Boulter gave me to sell for him—I had my master's van in Newport-street, and left the coat in the boot—I was going in and out of a basker's shop in the street unloading the van, and the coat was taken away by somebody—I saw it again on Monday—I lost it between seven and eight o'clock in the morning.





JAMES NEIGHBOUR
. I am a pawnbroker, and live in Broad-street, St. Giles's On Saturday, about the middle of the day, the prisoner came and pawned this coat. in the name of David William's, for 1l.—the prosecutor afterwards applied to me about it—I have known the prisoner four or five years by pawning at our house—I understood him to be a dealer is clothes—he has pawned clothes before with me.





GEORGE COLLIER
. I am a policeman. I took him into custody at his lodging, on Tuesday morning—he denied ever pawning the coat—I said he must go with me to the pawnbroker's—he said, he never pawned the coat, and was not there on the Saturday at all—but the pawnbroker identified him.





JOSEPH BOULTER
 This coat is mine—I gave it to Peache to dispose of.

Prisoner's Defence. I bought the coat on Saturday morning in Monmouth-street, just under the window of the King's Head public-house, but cannot find the man I bought it of—I took it to the pawnbroker's, who has known me five or six years, and gave my right address—I know nothing

about its being stolen—I was told on Monday morning an officer had been looking for me, but I went home on Monday night—I was certainly rather tipsy when he took me.




GUILTY

Transported for seven Years.

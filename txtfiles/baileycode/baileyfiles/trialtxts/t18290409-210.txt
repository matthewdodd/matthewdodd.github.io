. I lost a pair of blankets on the 8th of April, about half-past nine o'clock in the morning - I had seen them safe about ten minutes before, on the bed in the first floor front room; the prisoner had asked me to allow her to wait there for a friend, and I took her up stairs.

            . I took charge of the prisoner at a house in Crown-street, between nine and ten o'clock in the morning; she had these blankets under her clothes - she did not give me any account of them, but she told the Magistrate she bought them of a Jew in Monmouth-street.(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. This woman said a man at her house wanted a girl, and if I would go he would give me a little money; I went, but did not stay long - I bought the blankets of a Jew in Monmouth-street.

Pell Stutter. I live near Wapping-Dock


; I am a Mercer
. Yesterday Morning between eight and nine o'Clock, the Prisoner comes into the Shop; I have backward a Pane of Glass that commands my Shop, and I saw the Fellow look about him, and I think he gave a little Knock with his Finger, to find, I suppose, if any body was nigh, and immediately he whips up three Yards and a half of Damask, and he carries it out; thinks I I'll be after you presently; I ran after him, and catches him by the Collar, and brought him back to the Shop-door, and sent for a Constable; we had him before Justice Manwaring, and he committed him to Newgate; he bears a very bad Character.
The Prisoner in his Defence said, that it was not taken from under his Coat, but from off the Ground.

            . Yesterday Morning between eight and nine o'Clock, I was standing by my own Door, and I saw the Prisoner at the Bar coming along, and I saw Mr Stutter stop him in the Street, and he said he had robb'd him, and I saw Mr Stutter take the Piece of Stuff from under the Fellow's Coat. He did not offer to make any Resistance, or to get off, and indeed I was determined he should not.

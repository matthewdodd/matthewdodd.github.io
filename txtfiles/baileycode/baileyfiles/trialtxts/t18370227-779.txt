JOSEPH GARDINER
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
29th of January, at 
St. James, Westminster, 10 sovereigns, the monies of 



Joseph Airey, his master, in his dwelling-house.






JOSEPH AIREY
. I am a surgeon, and live in Coram-street, in the parish of St. James's, Westminster. The prisoner was my errand boy for about ten weeks—on Monday morning I missed ten sovereigns from a drawer in my desk, in my surgery—it was locked—I had seen them on the Saturday—I found the drawer still locked, but the money was gone—I charged the prisoner with taking it, and he denied it—I had no reason to suspect him particularly till last Monday, when, in consequence of information, I watched him—he went to a coffee-shop in Windmill-street—I then sent for an officer, and had him apprehended, and on his person was found 17s. in silver, and some few halfpence—he said he had found the 17s. on Saturday last, near the Pantheon—I went to the prison to him, and told him it was impossible he could have found the 17s. as I had heard of his changing two half-sovereigns—he then told me the other sovereigns were in Duck-lane—I went to where he named, and found six sovereigns.





GEORGE AVIS
. I am a policeman. I took the prisoner in charge—I Knew him before, and advised the prosecutor to keep him and watch him, and last Monday I took him—I found 17s. on him—he said he found it, but on the day of the examination he said it was part of his master's money, and the six sovereigns also.




GUILTY.* Aged 14.—Recommended to mercy by the Prosecutor.

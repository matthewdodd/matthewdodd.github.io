The Prosecutor depos'd, That he sent a Parcel to the Lancashire Carriers, and it not being their Time to go out, he sent for it back, and opening it miss'd the Piece of Linnen.
Mr. White, the Master of the Rose and Crown Inn in St. John's Street, depos'd, That when the Porter brought back the Parcel and said the Goods were missing, he look'd into it and found it was no common Thief that had taken the Linnen, for it was sow'd up very neatly, and stuffed up with Hay, which caused this Deponent to make a strict Enquiry amongst his Servants, if none of them were culpable and hearing that the Prisoner had borrowed a Packing Needle and some Packthread, he enquired still further, and found he had been enquiring for one to make him some Shirts; upon which he charg'd the Fact directly upon him, and after some Hesitation, he confess'd he did it, and that the Cloth was hid in the Hay-loft, where they found it; upon which the Jury found him 


               guilty to the Value of 10 d.

 the 13th of July, near six in the morning, I felt something against my pocket, I put my hand back, and I catched hold of the prisoner's flannel waistcoat, and he dropped the halfpence down on the ground; he says directly, your halfpence has dropped from your pocket; says I, no, you have took them out.

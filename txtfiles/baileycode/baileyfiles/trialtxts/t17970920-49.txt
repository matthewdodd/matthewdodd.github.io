JOSEPH GOSS sworn. - I am a coal-dealer and wharfinger
; I was coming through Cannon-street


, on the 16th of August, between twelve and two o'clock; I thought I felt something in my pocket; I turned round; one man passed me, and went down Crooked-lane, and another crossed the street, and went up Clement's-lane; I went up Clement's-lane, and saw the prisoner take something from the inside of his coat on the right hand side, and put it in the left hand side; I caught him by the collar, and unbuttoned his coat, and there I saw my handkerchief, (produces it); this my handkerchief; a constable was sent for, and I gave charge of him.
Prisoner's defence. I picked it up in the street, and carried it in my hand, and nobody owning it, I put it in my pocket; the prosecutor came after, and said, he had dropped a handkerchief; I told him, if that was his, he was very welcome to it; I went with him directly.
Prosecutor. He certainly went with me very freely.

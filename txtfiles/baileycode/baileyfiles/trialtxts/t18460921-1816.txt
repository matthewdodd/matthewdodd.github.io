1816. 




WILLIAM THOMAS
 was indicted

 for stealing 56lbs. weight of lead, value 7s., the goods of 



David Ivall, and fixed to a building:—2nd COUNT, not stating it to be fixed; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






GEORGE ABBOTT
. I live at Paddington, in the service of Mr. David Ivall. There is a house at the bottom of the garden—I went there on the 21st of Aug. and the lead was gone from it—we took the lead there that was found at the station, and it fitted exactly in every place—it belonged to my master.





PHILIP STEVENS
 (police-constable S 200.) I saw the prisoner in Caroline-street on the 21st of Aug., at twenty minutes past nine o'clock, with a basket upon his head—I crossed over and stopped him—the basket contained the lead which I have here—I have fitted it to the premises—I am quite certain it came from there—he said he found it under a hedge.





JOHN HENRY PRICE
. I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction at this Court by the name of William Bowden—(read Convicted the 3rd of March, 1845, having been before convicted, and confined eight months.)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 19.—


Transported for Seven

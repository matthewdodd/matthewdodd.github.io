            . I superintend a saw-mill
 at North Mimms. On the 22d of June, between twelve and one o'clock, I was in Lombard-street


, coming towards the Mansion-house - I stopped while a cart passed me, and when I moved I felt something at my pocket, and missed my pocket-book; upon turning round I saw the prisoner put it under his left arm; he was making off - I pursued him; he walked off very fast, and then ran by Pidding's lottery-office, and dropped it. I picked it up, and pursued him into Princes-street, where he was stopped without my losing sight of him. The pocket-book contained accounts and memorandums.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

            . I am a shoe-maker, and live in Hart-street, Mile-end. I was coming down Princes-street, and heard the cry of Stop thief! the prisoner was running - I stopped him; he asked me to let him go.

            . I was on the steps of the Mansion-house; I saw Callen follow him close, calling Stop thief! I took him in charge - I found nothing on him.
Prisoner's Defence. I am in the habit of holding gentlemen's horses; I ran after a gentleman to hold his horse, and was stopped in Princes-street.

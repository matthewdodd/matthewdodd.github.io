TIMOTHY LEARY
 and 




JAMES COTTER
 were indicted for

 stealing, on the 
9th of December, two shifts, value 8s.; 4 shirts, value 12s.; 1 table-cloth, value 10s.; the goods of 



Jeremiah Donovan: and 1 pair of stockings, value 1s., the goods of 



Joseph Badger.






MARY DONOVAN
. I am the wife of Jeremiah Donovan, and live in Granville-street. On the 9th of December, about nine o'clock in the morning, I hung out some clothes to dry in the back-yard, and at five o'clock in the evening I found the articles stated gone from the line—these are them—(produced)—these stockings belong to Margaret Badger, our lodger—I know the prisoners, as living in the neighbourhood.





JEREMIAH DONOVAN
. My wife alarmed me about five o'clock—I ran out, and in Kirby-street saw the two prisoners coming down a passage, a short distance from my house—I asked what they were doing that way—they said they had been for a walk—I said it was a nice walk in summer, but not in winter—they then said they had been to ease themselves—I said I had lost some clothes within the last twenty minutes—they said, "You don't mean to say we have taken them"—I said, "I don't mean to say you have, but I wish you to step down to my house to measure your

footsteps"—I called a policeman, and the clothes were found on them—we did not measure their footsteps.





CHARLES HAGAR
. I am a policeman. The prosecutor called me, and I took the prisoners—this property was found under their waistcoats, next their bodies—each of them had a portion—Cotter had on one stocking which belongs to the lodger—the things were quite wet.

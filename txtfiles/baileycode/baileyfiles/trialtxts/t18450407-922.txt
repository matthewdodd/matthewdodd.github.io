GEORGE WIDGETT
 was indicted

for stealing 30 printed books, value 4l.; and 1 box, 5s., the goods of 



Henry Clarence White; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






HENRY CLARENCE WHITE
. I am a tea-broker, and live in Eastcheap. On the 24th of March, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I was going into my office—I met the prisoner and another boy coming out of my counting-house with a box—I took the prisoner and the box—the other boy got away—the box contained these books, which are worth about 4l.—the prisoner said it was given him by a young woman to take to Mr. Bannister's—he had a butcher's apron on—there is a young woman in the house, but she was not there.

Prisoner. A. young man had this box in his possession inside the passage, he asked me to help him with it on his shoulder; it was the other young man said a young woman gave it him.

Witness. I really cannot swear which it was—this box was in a room which we occupy very seldom—it is more than one person could bring down by himself.





GEORGE FOSTER
 (City police'Constable, No. 425.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got at Mr. Clark's office, (read—Convicted the 4th of March, 1844, and confined twelve months) he had also been tried before that.

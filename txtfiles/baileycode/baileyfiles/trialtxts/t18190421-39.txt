ANN PAYTON. My husband is a tailor
, and lives in Cursitor-street, Chancery-lane


 - his name is William. On the 7th of April, about half-past eight o'clock in the morning, I went into the kitchen, and on my return found the street-door open, and a man looking in. I shut the door, and found the prisoner in the parlour with the coat; I collared him, screamed out, and Mr. Fitch, our lodger, came and took him.
WILLIAM FITCH. Mrs. Payton called me; I ran, and and took the coat from the prisoner. He said he wanted Mr. Jones; he did not live there. He afterwards said he wanted Mr. Davis.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

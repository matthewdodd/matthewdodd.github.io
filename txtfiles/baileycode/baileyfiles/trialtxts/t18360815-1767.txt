MARY ANN M'ADAMS
. I am single, and am servant to Mr. James Burns of Hyde-street, Museum-street, Bloomsbury. On Thursday the 7th of July, I was nursing the child, Ann Burns—I went into the potato-shop in Broad-street, St. Giles's—in coming out I was looking into my basket, I turned my head round and saw the prisoner's hand on the child's neck—she had a necklace of five rows of coral on—I saw it in the prisoner's hand—he ran up Lascelles-place with it—a policeman was coming along, he ran after him, and stopped him without my losing sight of him.





JAMES RICHARD CLARK
. I am a policeman. I live in Pickett-place, Strand—I stopped the prisoner about a dozen yards beyond No. 12, Lascelles-court—he

had passed that house in running—I found the necklace down the area of No.12—it was picked up in my presence.





FANNY BURNS
. I am the wife of James Burns, and live in Hyde-street, Bloomsbury—he drives a cab—this necklace is what my child wore—her name is Ann.

Prisoner's Defence. I came out about a quarter to ten o'clock and as I was running in Broad-street, the policeman came and stopped me, I asked what he wanted—he said, the girl gave me in charge for stealing the necklace, and at Bow-street, she said I took them at ten o'clock, and the policeman said afterwards that she gave me in charge at half-past nine o'clock—she said at the office she did not see my hands on the child's neck.





MARY ANN M'ADAMS
 (re-examined) It happened at ten o'clock—I saw his hand on the child's neck, and the necklace in his hand.




GUILTY

Transported for Seven Years.

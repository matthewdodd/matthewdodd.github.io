Constable. My Lord, the girl confessed she sold all the things to the old gentlewoman, and she did not deny it.
Winter. My Lord, she told me she would pawn her apron to make it up to me. I asked her what she had for the things; and for things that stood me in three-pence halfpenny, she said she gave her a halfpenny for; and a bag of buttons, which stands me in five shillings and six-pence, she bought for three pence halfpenny. She said Painter gave her gin and beer, and made her drunk, and said, if she would bring her goods, she would buy them, and she should live with her I lost several other great quantities of goods; they were found in the custody of

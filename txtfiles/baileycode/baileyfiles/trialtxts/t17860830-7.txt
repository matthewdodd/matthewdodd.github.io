             sworn.
I left town about three on Sunday afternoon.
What day of the month? - It was in July, the latter end of July; I think the gentleman at the bar was apprehended on the 4th of August, and it was the Sunday before that.
When did you return again? - Between nine and ten the same evening; when I returned I opened my drawers to take out a night cap or something, and I found that my drawers had been opened, and every thing of value taken out; I left the drawers unlocked.
Mention a few of the things that were lost? - There were several shirts, and three pair of black silk stockings; the marks are cut out of most of the things; there were two pair of sheets, and near two dozen of stocks, several pairs of breeches, handkerchiefs, neckcloths, stocks; I suspected the prisoner on account of my uncle having lost some things a few days before; and he suspected him, and said he would speak to his mother; I immediately called up the maid and told her, she said, she knew nothing of it; I said no more of it that night, the next morning I went to Bow-street; the prisoner acknowledged nothing.
Was any thing found in consequence of that? - I believe it was the Saturday following some of the property was found.

             sworn.
I permitted the prisoner to sleep in my house out of humanity and charity with his brother, knowing the mother to be a very worthy woman; this was while the family were in town, and when the family were removed out of town, I thought it would be an additional safety, supposing them to be honest; I went up to my wardrobe in my bedchamber, and found only one shirt instead of three; I returned home between ten and eleven, and made particular enquiry, and found there were two shirts and a pair of silk stockings missing; I came to town the next day to speak to his mother; I did not find her; I went home and saw the property in my nephew's room; between two and three in the morning the things were all gone; we examined them at Bow-street, and nothing came out; we advertised the things and circulated handbill, and on Monday or Tuesday morning some of the things were found on the prisoner.
Mr. Garrow, Counsel for the Prisoner. I have only one question to ask of you, you have already answered it, you before supposed him to be a person of character? - That I certainly did.

             sworn.
I am a pawnbroker in Berwick-street, Soho; I produce three shirts, two pair of cotton stockings; on the 4th of August the prisoner came to me and pawned these things; he said, his name was

            ; but on looking at the shirts, I observed them to be very good new shirts, and the marks seemed cut out; I asked him whose they were; he said, they were his, that he bought a whole piece of cloth, and gave three shillings and sixpence a yard for it; but I told him it did not appear to me as the marks were cut out; I took him to Bow-street; he had another shirt in his pocket, and another pair of stockings.
Mr. Garrow. Did he go out of your shop at all till you took him to Bow-street? - We secured him in the shop.

             sworn.
I produce two shirts, two pair of stockings, and one handkerchief, I had them of the prisoner on the 4th of August in the name of

            ; I am sure the prisoner is the man; I did not know him before, he came between twelve and one; I asked him what the shirts cost him, he said three shillings and sixpence a yard; the marks had been taken out, I did not observe that at the time I took them in; he said, he lived at No. 4, Tottenham-court-road.

             sworn.
I searched the prisoner, and in his pocket I found a duplicate of the shirts that were at Hoxton's, they were pawned for twelve shillings; and in his pocket I found two half guineas and a shilling; I asked him where the rest of the things were, and he told me immediately where I might go for them; I found a duplicate in his pocket, a shirt on his back; and a flannel waistcoat, a handkerchief round his neck, and a pair of stockings which the gentleman believes to be his; there was a vast quantity of property, and I asked him where the rest of the things were.
Was there any promise of favour if he would tell where the rest of the things were? - No, my Lord, we never do; he gave me a direction voluntarily where I might go and find these things that are mentioned, in a large deal box at a Cheesemonger's, in Wild-street; he said he had a lodging there, and had just taken it; I found the key of the box in his pocket before; I found seven pair of breeches, a quantity of shirts and silk stockings, of Mr.

I know these breeches perfectly well, but they are not marked, I have no doubt of them.

PRISONER's DEFENCE.
I have nothing to say but what I did before the Justice, that going out of Mr. Plowden's house at night I discovered a man going towards Queen-street with a large bundle, which then appeared to me to be a black; he threw it down, I came and took it up, and took it to my cousin's, and told him it was a parcel of my clothes, and I would call for it in the morning; I afterwards heard of the robbery, and was in hopes the things would be advertised; I was not sure they were Mr. Plowden's things, but not finding them advertised, I began to dispose of them.
Mr. Garrow. My Lord, as to character I know there were several people who would have attended, but I told his mother and several more people that it was unnecessary.
Prisoner. I have given notice to several persons, and three capital merchants to attend.

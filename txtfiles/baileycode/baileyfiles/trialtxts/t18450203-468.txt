CHARLES MORRIS
 was indicted

 for stealing 2 1/2lbs. weight of ham, value 1s. 6d., the goods of 



William Dixie Mills; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






WILLIAM EDMONDS
. I live with Mr. William Dixie Mills, a cheese-monger, in Westminster; he sells ham. About twelve o'clock on the 13th of Jan., Mr. Shaw beckoned me—I went out of the shop, and saw a boy running—he went round Peter-street, and dropped this knuckle of ham, which I can swear is my master's; I cut it myself—I cannot swear who it was dropped it.





JOHN SHAW
. About twelve o'clock that day I saw the prisoner go to the board at Mr. Mills's shop, and take the ham off—he walked a little way, and then ran—I did not see him drop it.





DAVID WALSH
 (police-constable B 54.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got at Mr. Clark's office—(read—Convicted 27th Nov., 7th Vict, and imprisoned three months)—the prisoner is the person; and he has had three months' imprisonment since then, for attempting to steal boots or shoes from a shop door.




GUILTY
. Aged 14.—


Transported for Seven Years.

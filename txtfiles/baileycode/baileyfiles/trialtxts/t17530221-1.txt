I had been at work, and a woman bid me take those things, saying, they belonged to her, she was to give me 2 d. to carry them to Alderman-bury ; she went away, I never saw her since.

Q. to M. Parrock. Did she say, a woman told her they were her things when she was taken?
M. Parrock. No, my lord, she did not.

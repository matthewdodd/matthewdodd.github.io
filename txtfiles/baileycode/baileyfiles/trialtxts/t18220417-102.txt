            . I am a carpenter. I saw the prisoner looking into Wood's cart; he got on the tail board and pulled the coat from the front, and put it against the tail board, went a few yards further, and then pulled it quite out, and ran off twisting it round his arm; I pursued, he ran as hard as he could and dropped it. I saw him taken.

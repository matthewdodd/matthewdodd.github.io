            . I am a Police-constable. On the 15th of March I was on duty in Jermyn-street; I saw the prisoner, in company with two others, in St. James'-street; I then saw him again in company with one person - I followed them on to Mr. Plant's, a hosier's shop, at the corner of the Haymarket, in Piccadilly 


- I saw the prisoner near his door; a person passed by; he left the door, and joined his companion; the prisoner then returned to the shop door, and took a pair of drab trousers off a rail - he rolled them up, and ran down the Haymarket; I followed him, but did not get the trousers; he fell, and I took him - I do not know what became of the trousers, but I am quite clear he is the person who look them off the rail; I had never lost sight of him from the time I first saw him in St. James'-street; I had seen him for nearly three-quarters of an hour - I took him back to the prosecutor's door, and inquired if they had lost any thing, and they said "Yes, a pair of drab trousers.
Prisoner. Q.Where were you when you say the person took the trousers? A. On the other side of the way - it is not very wide; it was after eight o'clock- there was not a great many people or carriages at that time; I never lost sight of you, but I never saw the trousers afterwards.
COURT. Q.Had you known him before? A. No, but I had him in view for three quarters of an hour.

            . I live at Mr. Robert Plant's near the corner of the Haymarket. On the evening of the 15th of March the officer came to our shop with the prisoner, about eight o'clock, and I missed a pair of drab trousers, which I had seen on a small iron rail within the door, about an hour before - a person going by could reach them by stretching out his hand.
Prisoner. Q. Did not the Policeman ask you if you had lost any thing? A. Yes, and I said I did not know - he then said he saw them taken from the left side of the shop; I looked, and missed them; he told me the colour of them.
Prisoner. My friends have been to the prosecutor, and asked if he would take the money for the trousers, as it would be the means of my losing my work; the witness said his master told him if they brought the money he would take it, and my friends took 17s. 6d., and he said he would say the trousers were sold. Witness. Two young women called on the day after the prisoner was taken, and said they would pay for them on condition that I would not appear; I said Mr. Plant was not there, and I could not make any promise, but he would be there the next day; when he came, I told him, and he said they might leave the money if they liked, but I was not to compromise the matter; they then came, brought the money, and a stamped receipt; but I would not wirte any receipt, nor make any promise; I said I would not take the money on a promise not to a appear, but if I was called upon, I must go.
COURT. Q. Did you keep the money? A. It lays in the till now; but I particularly expressed for them not to leave it, unless they pleased; but they wished to leave it, and they wished me not appear at Marlborough-street.
Prisoner's Defence. On the evening in question I was going to my employer's, in Duke-street, to finish some work; as I was going down the Haymarket, a person ran violently against me, and knocked me down; the Policeman then came, took me to this shop, and said what you have heard.
JURY to 
               T. B. 
            HORSEFALL. Q.Did you see the prisoner with the trousers in his hand? A. Yes; I saw him take them down, and roll them up - he joined his companion at the corner, and I suppose gave him the trousers - the prisoner then fell, for me to fall over him.
COURT. Q.How near was his companion to him when the trousers were taken? A. About twenty yards - the prisoner ran in the direction he was standing.

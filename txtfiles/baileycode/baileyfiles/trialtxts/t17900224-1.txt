I keep the Black horse in Kingsland-road







. I fastened up my house the night before it was broke open; the inside shutter of the bar is so heavy, that nobody can put it up but myself; it is a moveable shutter, takes up and down: there is a very good outside shutter, which I fastened also; there is a large bolt, and two bolts at the bottom; they were all fast: I was alarmed, to the best of my knowledge, at past two o'clock in the morning by the watchman: I came to the bar door, and found it was fast; I opened that door and went into the bar, and found the inside shutter of the bar window taken down, and reared against the bar door; I pushed it down when I unlocked my bar door: the outside shutter was broke all to pieces, and the sash of the window was thrown up; then I saw the hole in the wall, which I suppose they must have come through; there were four rows of bricks under the bar window taken away, four in heighth and six in length; that was plenty of room for a man to get in: the inside shutter had been taken down on the inside: that had not been forced. In the bar I found this burner of a street lamp; I found nothing else in my house; I found this street lamp with another burner in it outside of my window, missing from a lamp iron; after that I went and found a lamp directly near where these men lodged, which was about two hundred yards from my house: I missed six, and I believe seven, casks of different spirits, five china bowls, about seven shillings in halfpence, about seven shillings in farthings, one part of the farthings were in the work basket, the rest were in the till: I missed a work basket in which was a bit of tape, the string of my blue apron, which I knew: I gave information, and saw the man Wilson in Armstrong's custody: I went with the officers to Wilson's house, and there I saw 
               
                  Jane
                   Wilson
               



            , who I understand to be Wilson's wife; the man Wilson was at his lodgings, and in his presence nothing was found: the wife said in his presence, that my linen, that he had taken, she had carried to a neighbour's house; I do not know their names; the woman went with me, and in the garden of that house I foundmy things; I first found of mine the apron string wrapped round a bundle, then I found a piece of linen cloth, and a piece of cotton, and some sleeve buttons, and seven balls of worsted, and a piece of edging, and a great many other articles; Armstrong was present: I saw my casks of liquor in Armstrong's custody.

             sworn.
I live at the sign of the Gentleman and Porter, Kingsland-road, about two hundred and fifty yards from Mr. Wood's house. I have seen the two men prisoners, and 
               
                  Jane
                   Wilson
               



            , and another woman, and a child, and there was 
               
                  William
                   Leicester
               



            , the accomplice: I saw them at my house on the Friday before this burglary: Leicester was there I believe about two hours before the rest; then Wilson, and East, and the two women, and the child came in, and called for a pot of beer; they were in company together there, and drank together till half past eleven at night: in the course of this time East took a handkerchief out of Leicester's pocket; he was standing with his back to me, and his face to the company: I stepped to East, I said, young fellow if you will please to give them to Leicester, I will be obliged to you: they all went together about half past eleven, and in about a quarter of an hour the two women came in to my house with one of the King's Head pint pots, and had half a pint of gin put into it.

             sworn.
I live in Shoreditch. I am a publican. I have seen the prisoners at my house the 23d of January, about nine; there were Leicester, and East, and two women; they asked me to buy some china bowls; I did not see them: they said there was some liquor to sell: I told them I had nothing at all to do with it; and they went away: I never asked them any thing, how they came by it.

             sworn.
I am an officer, attending the public office in Shoreditch. On Saturday the 23d of January, having information of one of the prisoners, I went to Whitecross-street, Playhouse-yard: on going along Golden-lane, to Mackaway's house, we saw the man prisoner, Wilson, 
               
                  Jane
                   Wilson
               



            , and 
               
                  Mary
                   Linton
               



             in company together; they were coming from the way to the house: we took them into custody: I believe nothing was found at Mackaway's: then afterwards Wilson and his wife took us to their lodgings, that Leicester had informed us that there was a crow and some linen at their lodgings; and we went there with Mr. Wood: the lodgings were at Haggerstone, about five hundred yards, facing Wood's, across the fields; when we got there the woman, Wilson, went to the closet and pulled out an iron crow; Armstrong has it; the crow was all over brick-dust and mortar, and has it on now; then Jane Wilson said the things were not there, but she would take us where they were: the man, Wilson, was present then, and when the crow was found: we all went to some gardens belonging to a neighbouring house, and there 
               
                  Jane
                   Wilson
               



             took out these things in the presence of her husband: Armstrong found some other things: I was present when the prisoners, Wilson and East, were taken before the magistrate: we took East and Leicester together in a clothes shop.

                   ARMSTRONG
               



             sworn.
I produce a crow. I joined Shakeshaft soon after he took Leicester and East to the office; and in consequence of something that Leicester said, we went to Mackaway's, from there we went to Wilson's lodgings; and this crow was produced by Wilson's wife, in the presence of Wilson: I went with the rest to this garden, and we saw some things taken out of some mould, and these cags I found in the apartments of 
               
                  Ann
                   East
               



            ; the man East was not present; the woman was there, and without her shoes: I found these things in the Back-lane, Bethnal-Green: me and Harpur went into the room, and the woman, East, was there: I looked under the bed, and I found nothing: and by the bolster, uponthe bed, covered by the bolster and a piece of the rug; they were laid length ways; I found nothing else at any place: I do not know that East, the man, lived there; I knew it was her's; but I did not know it was his; nor I do not know it now.
Prosecutor. Three of these casks I can safely swear to positively; and one I believe to be mine; here is my hand writing on the end of each, and a letter of the liquor: I wrote my name Wood, and M. for peppermint: here is the apron string which I am sure I tore off; and it tore off a little bit of the apron; it was torn in turning out a fat hog: I always mend my own clothes; I know them all: I know this piece of linen; it is very oddly cut at both corners; I had seen it before: this piece of cotton is a part of my wife's gown: and this linen sleeve is mine.

             sworn.
I know this piece of cotton; the same as the gown I have on: the sleeve is mine; I know it by the ravelling, and by a piece of tape on it: this apron string I know; and all these things are mine: I cannot speak to the casks.
Armstrong. The casks had liquor in as they have now; brandy, peppermint, and rasberry.

                   Wilson
               



             and me were drinking together at the Gentleman and Porter, which Webb keeps: we came out of there about half after eleven at night: the women were in company; but they went forwards: 
               
                  William
                   Wilson
               



             and me and 
               
                  James
                   East
               



            , went to East's house, about an hundred yards from the Black Horse, which was broke open; we staid there about half an hour or an hour: we went together to Mr. Wood's. East took a crow from his pocket, and broke a piece of the outside shutter of the bar window, and then put up his arm, and unbolted the bolt of the outside shutters, and broke a pane of glass, to hoist up the sash: Wilson broke the pane of glass, with the same crow; the sash was fastened so that we could not open it: East took the crow and made a hole through the wall, and got in through the hole underneath the frame, and took down the inside shutter of the bar window, and placed it against the bar door: he hoisted up the sash, and came out from the inside: we crossed the road all three together; we had no light: East got up the lamp post, and took the burner out alight: he came back to the window, and delivered the burner into my hand; and afterwards, East got in; nobody else: East took the burner out, and we all went together to another lamp, and took the glass and burner both alight: then we all came back to the window with the glass lamp, and the burner alight in it: East gave it into my hand, while he got in at the window; he handed out a small basket with some linen in, and tape and worsted; and then handed out the till with some halfpence: the halfpence were emptied into Wilson's pocket, and the till left the outside of the window: East came out of the window, and we all three took the things into the field facing the house: we moved them out of the field, up to Wilson's house: we only just rested in the field: Wilson's house was just across the field. The small trifle of linen was sold to Wilson's wife for eight-pence: we took the seven kegs of liquor down to one Lewis's in Hackney-road; Wilson's wife and 
               
                  Mary
                   Linton
               



             brought the five china bowls down to Lewis's, in the morning: I was there then: afterwards, Wilson's wife and 
               
                  Mary
                   Linton
               



             took each a cask apiece from Lewis's, and the five china bowls: Wilson's wife carried the bowls: I followed them down; they took them to the house of one Mr. Handfield; we were all in there together: East went backwards to Mr. Handfield, and asked him some questions which I do not know: we went to Handfield's to try to sell the goods: then East came back to us into the tap-room, and said that Mr. Handfield would have nothing to do with them: then we all came out together, and went from thence to Golden-lane, to the prisonerMackaway's; the two women brought each one cask and the five bowls away: we left the other two bowls at Lewis's: we all went into Mackaway's entry; and East and I took the two casks and the five bowls from the women, and left them at the door, and Wilson with them: we saw Mrs. Mackaway, and told her we had seven casks of liquor in the whole; she would say nothing to them; East and I left the two casks of liquor at Mrs. Mackaway's house, and sold the two bowls to her for four shillings; she told us to leave the two casks till the others were brought up at night: for she would give us no answer till her mother came from Woolwich: the five china bowls we sold to Mrs. Mackaway's daughter for four shillings; we left the two casks there; then we came out, and Wilson and his wife and Linton went one way, and East and me went another way: and in less than a quarter of an hour, going through Play-house-yard, East and me were taken: I was buying a pair of old shoes at a clothes shop: I have nothing to say against the woman 
               
                  Ann
                   East
               



            ; she had nothing to do with this robbery: I cannot tell what became of the rest of the casks that were left at Lewis's: Lewis keeps a smith's shop in Hackney-road; they were put in an empty room before he was up in the morning; the door of which was open: I never was in East's apartments, nor do I know who lived there.
Jury. Whether when he was at Mackaway's it was an absolute sale, or was it a loan? - They were sold to her: East asked her five, and she would give but four.
Was not it a contract to bring the rest of the things? - No; she gave us four shillings for the five bowls; nothing else.
Shakeshaft. The bowls were never found.
Mr. Garrow. Nothing was found at Mackaway's.

            's DEFENCE.
I have this to say; Leicester came to my house about two o'clock, and he said, East, get up and let me in; I did so: he was much in liquor; I advised him to go to his lodgings; and I put on my clothes, and went to see him home at Lewis's; I crossed the road opposite Mr. Wood's house; and he said, I have some kegs of liquor laying here; I will be obliged to you to let me leave them at your house? I said I would not; he said he bought them of a smuggler; and Wilson and him agreed to take them to Wilson's house.

            's DEFENCE.
Leicester came and knocked at my door, when me and my wife were in bed; I would not get up to let him in; he told me I might as well; then he said he had some things; he would not tell me where he got them; and he asked me to let them be at my house? I said, no.

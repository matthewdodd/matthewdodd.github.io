JAMES ESSEX
. I live in Park-street, Camden-town, and am a tobacconist. I missed some cheroots at a quarter before eleven o'clock on the morning of the 2nd of December—I had seen them safe about a quarter of an hour before I missed them—I received information, went after the prisoner, and found him with these cheroots in his jacket pocket, they are the exact quantity I had lost—they exactly corresponded with mine.





CAROLINE ESSEX
. On the 2nd of December the prisoner came into the shop—he bought some cigars—immediately after he went I missed this bundle of cheroots.

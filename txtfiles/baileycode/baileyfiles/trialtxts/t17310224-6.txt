                     Henry

                  Henry 
                  Moore 
               



             depos'd, He was Field-Keeper
 at Islington


, and the Oxen were in the Ground the Night before; that he had News brought him of their being in the Green-Yard, in the Morning, whether he went and found them.


                  George 
                  Round 
               



             depos'd, That he being a Watchman, was at his stand at Moore-gate , and seeing the Prisoner driving the Oxen between 1 and 2 o'Clock in the Morning, he enquir'd where he had them, and where he was driving them; That he pretending to have found them astray in Goswel-Street, he secur'd the Oxen and the Prisoner, and went the next Morning, and enquir'd for an Owner for them, and the Prosecutor came and own'd them.
The Prisoner in his Defence pleaded, It was another Man that had the Oxen, who went away and left him, but this did not appear; and the Watchman depos'd, he saw no other Man. The Fact being plainly prov'd, the Jury found him 

               Guilty
             of the Indictment.

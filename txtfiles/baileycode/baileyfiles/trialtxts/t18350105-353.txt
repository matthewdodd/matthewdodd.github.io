HENRY SMITH
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
29th of November, 3 sovereigns, and 1 £5 Bank-note, the monies of 



James Terry, his master, and that he had been before convicted of felony.






EDWARD WILLIAM TERRY
. I live with my brother, James Terry, a grocer, in Shoemaker-row, Blackfriars. We had employed the prisoner on two or three occasions to go on errands—on the 29th of November, my brother, who was ill, sent three sovereigns and a £5 note, with a note, desiring me to send the money to Mr. Winter, in Friday-street—I enclosed the money in a piece of paper, so that I thought no one would have had an idea that it was money—I sent it by the prisoner—I sent my little boy with him—the prisoner did not return—we did not see him again till the 24th of December, when he was brought by a policeman—the money has never been found.





JAMES WINTER
. I am acquainted with James Terry—I expected three sovereigns and a £5 note from him on the 29th of November—the prisoner never brought it to me—I have received it since from Terry.





THOMAS EVANS
 (City police-constable No. 81.) I apprehended the prisoner on the 24th of December, at half-past four o'clock—he said he knew he was guilty, and if he was not taken then, he should at another time—I had not told him what it was for.





BARTHOLOMEW SCANDLING
. I am a patrol of Castle-Baynard Ward. I have a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from

Mr. Clark's office (read)—I took him on that occasion, and know he is the man.




GUILTY
. Aged 21.—


Transported for Seven Years.

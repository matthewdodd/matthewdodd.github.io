; my copper was fixed safe at ten o'clock at night,on the 31st of May, and next morning it was gone, when I got up; here it is - I am certain of it - I have compared it with the place it came from.

            . I live at the Crown public-house, Glasshouse-street. I got up about five o'clock in the morning, and saw the prisoners walking up and down the street; I saw Skinner get over the gates of Hardy's-yard - Askin walked to and from till he found an opportunity; Skinner then lifted the copper over the pails, and Askin's received it from him - I got two men to assist, and took them both - Hardy claimed it.

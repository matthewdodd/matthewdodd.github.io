            . I am an officer. I met the prisoner with this bundle on the 16th of May; I followed him to Ironmonger-row, St. Lukes - I asked what he had got; he said if I went a few doors farther he would show me - he went on to a passage, where there was a woman, and he called out to her by name "Is not this yours;" I cautioned her not to say that it was, if she did not know it- she said "My God no, Charles what have you been doing?" I went into the room, opened the bundle, and found the cloak - he sent me to one place with it, but it was not right - I then found the owner.
JOHN REEVE. I live on Snow-hill. This cloak was taken from my stable in Aldersgate-street


 - I had left it there.

            . I am an ostler. I left this cloak at Mr. Reeve's stables; I saw it safe about half-past ten o'clock on the 16th of April, and missed it about three o'clock; I have seen the prisoner in the yard - he came to speak to one of the grooms.
Prisoner. He has reason to know me: he has more right to be here than I have - I was going down the yard, and met a person I had some knowledge of; he asked me to carry the cloak for him.

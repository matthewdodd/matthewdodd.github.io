            . I belong to the wharfinger. The prisoner is a ticket porter
. I saw him attempting to put a bag of ginger in at a hole in a cellar window. (Produced in court.) This is it. When he saw me he drop'd it, and ran away. I secured him, and took the bag into my care.
Q. Did you see him take it?
Beaumont. No, I did not. I and my partner were ordered to watch it.
Q. Whose property was it?
Beaumont. The property of his majesty. It was taken in a French prize.
Q. Where had the prisoner it from?
Beaumont. It was not taken from a warehouse, but it lay with many more bags under a gateway. The cellar window was under the same gateway, and belongs to an alehouse near the Custom-house.
Q. What do you know it by?
Beaumont. The French mark is D. H. P. No. 149. The English mark is F. No. 189.

            . I am the constable that had charge of the prisoner. We took him to the Cock and Anchor in Thames-Street, the house belonging to the cellar where he went to put the ginger. There he owned the fact, and desired we would be as favourable to him as we could. The warehouses, in which these goods were put, are locked up, and the king and the commissioners have each a lock upon them.
Prisoner's Defence.
I took the bag up in my hand, laid it down again, and went up stairs directly.

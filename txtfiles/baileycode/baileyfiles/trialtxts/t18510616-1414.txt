William Creebo and another; Whinstone having been before convicted: to which


WHINSTONE pleaded

Transported for Seven Years.






WILLIAM PERRY
. I saw the prisoner and another man go down Oakley-street, and followed them to the Westminster-road—they stopped at a tailor's-shop, and looked at some trowsers and coats which were hanging outside—I saw Norman and the other man walk on a few yards, they then turned, looked at Whinstone, and he put up his hand and reached down a pair of troswers, which fell on the pathway—he shoved them towards the front of the shop, picked them up, and went down Oakley-street with them—they all three then went into a public-house, and they came out together, and walked up the New Cut—an officer came, and the prisoners were taken—the other man got away—I saw Whinstone throw the trousers down—I went and told Messrs. Crebo.





ISAAC WHATLEY
. I am in the employ of Creebo and Haines, of Mount-street, Westminster—these trousers are ours, and have the ticket still on them.





VALENTINE TITE
 (policeman, A 496). I took the prisoners—the man dropped the trousers, and the woman said she knew nothing about it.

NORMAN—


NOT GUILTY
.

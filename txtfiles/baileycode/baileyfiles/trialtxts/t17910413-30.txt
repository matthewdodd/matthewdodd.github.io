                   BAKER
               



             sworn.
I get my bread by washing; I am a widow; I live in the house of 
               
                  Elizabeth
                   Rackett
               



            , widow; her house was broke open on Monday, the 4th of April; there was Mrs. Rackett and others of her family within; the two pair of stairs room was broke open; I live in that room; the prisoner came in at the street-door, which is always on the latch; I was in the one pair of stairs room; I had locked my room before I came down; I heard somebody coming down, and I opened the one pair of stairs room door, and I asked the prisoner what he wanted; he asked if Mrs. Jackson lodged there; I told him no; a person asked what she was; he said, a boot-closer; another asked me if my door was fast; I said, yes, I am sure I locked it; he went down into the street, and I went up stairs and missed my watch; and a witness and me went down after him, and we took him about the middle of the street; he was walking along very leisurely;

                   Abbott
               



             stopped him, and we brought him to our house again, to the first floor; and coming up the stairs, we found the watch on the stairs; he consented to go very quietly back; we sent for a constable; this is my watch; it is metal; I gave three guineas for it; it would sell for 40 s and the chain 3 s. the watch was over the mantle-piece, I saw it not half an hour before; the prisoner is the man; he was a stranger to me.


                  SUSANNAH
                   ABBOT
               



             sworn.
I go out a nursing; I happened to be there on the Monday; I come sometimes to mend stockings; and this young woman said her room was robbed, and her watch gone; and I ran down stairs, and I followed the prisoner; he walked very leisurely, and I ran after him, and in the middle of the street he turned round to see if any body was coming, and I caught hold of his two shoulders, and I said, you dog, you have got my watch; I said so in my fright; he tried to get away, and Mrs. Baker came to my assistance; then he asked my pardon, and said he would give us the watch again; and I said to him, that he should carry the watch where he took it from; and going up stairs, I saw the watch on the one pair of stairs, as he was going up the stairs: Mrs. Baker took up the watch: we put the man in the one pair of stairs, and sent for a constable; we asked him where the wooden case was that the watch was in, and he said she would find it up stairs; he was fumbling something out of his pocket, and he dropped these keys (picklock keys produced); we tried the keys to Mrs. Baker's door, but could not make either of them do.
Mrs. Baker. The lock was not hurt or spoiled at all.

- RACKETT sworn.
I am son to the widow Rackett who keeps the house; she was at home, she is incapable of going out; there was another brother at work in the upper story with myself, I heard the alarm, and ran down, and saw the prisoner taken and brought back; I heard Mrs. Baker, as he went up stairs, say, here is the watch. The prisoner's behaviour was very submissive indeed; he knelt and held up his hands, imploring pardon; he sat on a chair, and I perceived him fumbling in his pockets, and we found the keys in the chair that he arose from.

                   BEAMISH
               



             sworn.
I belong to the public-office in Hyde-street; I apprehended the prisoner with Treadway.
Prosecutrix. In my fright I could tell nothing of the marks, the wooden case was laid in a chair behind the door; I did not see the keys taken from the prisoner.
Court to Mrs. Abbott. Were these keys in his pocket? - He shuffled them out of his pocket.
Mr. Rackett. I am a watch-maker; I cleaned this watch, I told Justice Walker it was a flat metal watch, but I did not know it further.
(Shewn to him.)
Is that the watch you repaired? - Yes, I think I can safely say it is the watch that belongs to Mrs. Baker.
PRISONER's DEFENCE.
My Lord, Sir, I was walking up Dean-street, Holborn, and coming towards King-street, the short lady laid hold of me; says she, you rascal, you have my watch; I said I did not know what she meant, but to satisfy her, I would go any where with her; and in the mean while the owner of the watch came, 
               
                  Mary
                   Baker
               



            , and they both laid hold of me by themselves, and I walked quietly, and they took me into King-street, and took me into a house, and I got into the room, and another man and 
               
                  Mary
                   Baker
               



             next, and the lady next, and so got into the room, and a man was between the stairs, and I heard them halloo out, here is the watch. 
               
                  Mary
                   Baker
               



             began storming and swearing, and asked me for the case of her watch; I told her I knew nothing at all about it, and I supposed where she left it she would find it; I was then at the other side of the room; the lady went to the chair, I heard something gingle as she shook the chair, and these things fell out. Then she sent for a constable. I went to the office, and the lady came at six o'clock; she told the Justice that she did not know the name or number of the watch: she did not know what sort of a seal it was. The Justice asked her what was between the cases, and she could not tell; then the Justice said the watch was not her's; she said it was; and the watchmaker could not swear to the name or number; but he knew that 
               
                  Mary
                   Baker
               



             had a flat metal watch; but the watch was delivered into her custody, and so she has had the watch all this time; she can tell you I had several witnesses that would have come here and sworn; and the constables, if you put them on their oath, will tell you that she did say she could not swear to the watch. None of these keys unlocking the door, how could I open it and lock it again; I had no instrument to open it with. I hope your Lordship will look into and mind what she says; for the woman said before that, that the keys were taken from me, and now she says this second time, that I was fumbling them out of my pocket.
The prisoner called one witness to his character.

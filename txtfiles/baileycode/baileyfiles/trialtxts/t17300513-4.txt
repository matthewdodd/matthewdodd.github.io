The Prosecutor depos'd, That he keeps the Crose-Keys Inn
 in Barbicane


, and that the Prisoner was employ'd as an Assistant to a Waggon which Inn'd there
, and that having lost Goods from time to time when that Waggon was there, and not any other times, he suspected the Prisoner, and order'd his Servants to watch that Night in the Hay-loft.

             depos'd, That he being order'd to lie in the Hay-loft to watch , did, about Two o'Clock in the Morning, see the Prisoner come down into the Yard, go into the Stable, and let out the Dog, took out a Sack, and went up with it empty into the Bean loft, and came down with it full, and threw it into the Waggon; that there standing Sacks of Flower in the Yard, he saw him fill two Bags , and put them in the Waggon; and the like he did by the Peas which stood there in Sacks, first taking them out into his Hat, and then putting them into a Bag, and having thrown them into the Waggon likewise, went into the Stable to strike a light, but not being able to do it, went out of the Gate to get a Candle lighted by the Watch; that then they went down, and at his coming in apprehended him. This was likewise confirmed by 
               
                  John 
                  Worth 
               



            .
The Prisoner having but little to say in his Defence, and the Fact being so plainly proved, the Jury found him 

               Guilty
             of the Indictment.

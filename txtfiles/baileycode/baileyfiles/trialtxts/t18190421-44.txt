SARAH M'DONALD. I am the wife of William M'Donald, who is a printer
; we live in Craven-street, Strand


. On the 12th of March my servant left the area gate open, and these spoons were stolen out of the kitchen; somebody must have come down the area, and took them.

            . On the 12th of March I saw the prisoner, and another boy, go down the street, with apples in his hand - my master had had his windows cut twice, which made me watch them - the prisoner went lower down the street than the other. I lost them, and afterwards saw them in the Strand; the prisoner crossed over, and sat on some steps - a man took him; I saw the spoon hanging under his coat, and told the man of it; the prisonerimmediately pulled the spoon out of his pocket and ran away; a gentleman stopped him. I am certain he is the boy.

            . On the 11th of March I saw a mob, and took the prisoner in charge; a spoon was given to me, and another dropped from him.

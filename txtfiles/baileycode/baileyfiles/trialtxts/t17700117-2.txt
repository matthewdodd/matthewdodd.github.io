            . I am servant to Mr. Hillman, who lives in Craven-street, in the Strand



. On the 22 d of December last, the prisoner came and knocked at our door, (this was a little after seven at-night) I opened it. He asked if this was Mr. Hillman's? I said yes. He said, there is a basket directed for him to be left while called for, at the bell inn, Wood-street; he said he was book-keeper there, and was coming that way, and he called to let my master know of it. He pretended to set down the direction; I asked him into the parlour to set it down: in the mean time came another and knocked at the door. I went and opened it. The man asked for some doctor that I did not know. I directed him to the globe tavern, where he might hear if any such person lived near. I was returning back towards the parlour, and met the prisoner coming out. He gave me a paper, and said, this is the direction; if you send any servant, he would take care he should have the box. I suspected he had something under his coat, by his going out with one hand behind him under it. I went into the parlour, and found the candle lying on the table, and the silver candlestick was gone. I ran after him, and catched him in Church-court, near St. Martin's church, about 200 yards from my master's house: I laid hold of him, and received several blows from him. He instantly threw down the candlestick; one 
               
                  John
                   Thomas
               



             took it up: and one 
               
                  Charles
                   Clark
               



            , a sailor, who is now gone abroad, he assisted me; we took him and the candlestick to Sir 
               
                  John
                   Fielding
               



            's, and he was committed. The extinguisher was missing at the time; that we never found. When he found he was conquered, he said he did not care if we took and hang'd him up in that place (The candlestick produced and deposed to.)

                   Thomas
               



            . I was going across Church-court; I heard a running up the court; I made a stop just at the corner; by that time, the prisoner and this young man came up; he catched the prisoner by the coat. The prisoner turned round, and dropped the candlestick from his left hand. I took it up directly. He fetched the young man a knock, but with assistance he was soon secured. I went with him to Sir 
               
                  John
                   Fielding
               



            's.
Prisoner's Defence.
I was going about my business up Church-court; this man came and laid hold of me, and called out, Stop thief! I never saw the candlestick. It is possible, I might knock it out of his hand in the scuffle. I never was at his master's house.

(M.) He was a second time indicted for 


               stealing a silver hilted sword, value 5 l. and a silk belt, value 5 s. the property of 
                     
                        Francis
                         Roberts
                     



                  , Esq. in the dwelling-house of the said Francis

            , Esq
. I live in King-street, Golden-square



. On the 20th of December last, I lost a silver hilted sword, and silk belt; but I was not at home at the time.
Q. When had you seen it last?
Mr. Roberts. I had seen it hanging up in the parlour that day before I went out, about four o'clock in the afternoon. When I came home, between seven and eight o'clock, my maid gave me a direction to go to the swan and two necks, in Lad-lane, for a box. I went there the next morning, but no box was there for me. (That direction I left at Sir John Fielding's ) When I came home, I asked my maid what sort of a man it was that left that direction? She said, he was a very tall, thin man. Such was the prisoner. In looking round the room, I missed my sword; I went and got it advertised, and the Saturday following, Mr. Fielding sent for me to come to him on the Monday, at eleven o'clock. He said a man was taken up for stealing a silver candlestick, and he thought he might be the man that had stole my sword. I went and found the prisoner there, and my sword (produced in court.) This sword is my property; I have wore it five or six years.

            . I am servant to Mr. Roberts. On a Wednesday in last month, the prisoner knocked at our door. He asked if Mr. Roberts was at home? I told him no. He asked what time I expected him in? I said that was uncertain. He said he was book-keeper at the swan and two necks in Lad-lane, and there was a box left there for my master, and had been there above a week, and he called to let us know, fearing there might be something of consequence in it. He asked me leave to write a direction. I asked him to walk into the front parlour; and gave him a pen and ink.
Prosecutor. The sword hung in that parlour.
J. Jones. While he was writing the direction, another man knocked at the door; I went to answer at the door, and left the prisoner in the parlour. The man at the door asked if a captain did not lodge here? I told the man we had no lodger at all. He said, a friend of his had fell down in the street, and broke his leg, and he would be very much obliged to me, if I could direct him to a captain, naming a name, to assist in getting his friend into the hospital. While I was talking to him, the prisoner came out of the parlour, and delivered a direction to me, and desired me not to forget to deliver it to my master, and went away.
Q. What time was this?
J. Jones. This was about a quarter after six in the evening. I thought it very odd, he should come so out of the parlour. I went in after he was gone, but did not miss any thing then. The next morning I missed the sword and belt, and told my mistress of it. When my master returned  he soon missed it. I am sure the prisoner is the man that came in and wrote the direction; he had the same great-coat on he has now: he had it open. I know his face and his voice; and am certain he is the man.

            . On the 20th of December, about seven o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came and pledged this sword with me; I lent him 25 s. on it: two days after that, I saw it advertised, and I carried it to Sir 
               
                  John
                   Fielding
               



            's.
Prisoner's Defence.
I know nothing of it. If they have a mind to take my life away, I can't help it. I did live with Mr. Bland, a single gentleman, in Essex; and I lived with Col. Sands; and after that, I was eleven months in the horse-guards; and it was my intention to go into the army again.

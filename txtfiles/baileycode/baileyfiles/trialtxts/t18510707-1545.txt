JOHN JACKSON CROSSLEY
. I was at Vauxhall-gardens on Monday evening, 23rd June—I had a watch, a chain, and a key with me in my right-band waistcoat-pocket—I had a silk guard round my neck, with two knots in it; it had been cut once before—I was near the barrier between 10 and 11 o'clock—I had noticed the prisoner before he pushed against me, but there being a crowd I did not take notice of it—I then felt a twitch—I put my hand to my pocket, and my watch was gone—I turned and seized the prisoner by the collar, and said, "You have robbed me"—he said, "I am a gentleman; I dare you to give me into custody; I have a gold watch of my own"—I said, "I shall try it on at all events"—I seized his right-hand, and he had my watch-chain between his fingers—he dropped the watch and chain—I took it up—I said, "You have not got it now, but you had it a moment ago. "

Cross-examined by
MR. BALLANTINE. Q. Were you sober? A. I was as sober as a Judge—I am quite sure I saw the chain in his hand, and saw him drop it—I have not the least doubt about it.

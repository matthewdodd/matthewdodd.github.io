            . I was on duty on Tuesday morning, the 29th of June, and met the prisoner in Vittoria-street, Islington, with a bag; I asked what it contained - he said locks; I found it was five locks, and four pieces of leaden pipe - I took him to the watch-house, and found on him four skeleton-keys, two screw-drivers, and a little saw; I found the prosecutor's house at No. 24, Vittoria-place


 -one of the skeleton-keys fitted the door of the house; I fitted these locks to the different doors, and have no doubt they belonged to them - the pipes exactly fitted the other pipe left there.
RICHARD SMART. Mr. John Woodcock is the holder of this house - I collect the rents for him. My man fitted these locks to the doors - I matched this pipe, and it fits exactly; I had seen it all safe a day or two before - I have tried these keys; I believe they will open any lock.
The prisoner put in a written Defence, stating that he was a locksmith, and the locks had been given him to repair by a shopmate whom he had met.

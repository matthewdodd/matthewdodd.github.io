            . I am clerk of Woolwich parish. I produce the register of marriages, and find that on the 11th of May, 1809, 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Gordon
               



             was married by banns to 
               
                  
                     Harriet 
                     Cole
                  



               
            . I witnessed the register.
Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you print this bill - (producing it) - A. My son printed a thousand of them by order of Miss Lawes.

            . I have frequently seen the prisoner write, and am particularly acquainted with his hand-writing. The signature T. Gordon to the register is his. In 1814 he shewed me a certificate of his marriage, on the coast of America. He said he was married, and that was the certificate of it; he said he had got it from his wife, and that was all he wanted. In June, 1815, when we came to Portsmouth, he told me he had heard his wife
 had been with the boatswain's mate.
Cross-examined. Q. When did you see Miss Lawes - A. I saw her five or six months ago at Chatham, She asked me if I knew anything about it? I knew thirty guineas reward was offered for persons who would give evidence. The prisoner was on board the ship in October, 1813, when I joined her at Lisbon.



                  SARAH 
                  SHOTT
               



            . My husband keeps the Navy Arms, at Woolwich. I knew 
               
                  Harriet 
                  Cole
               



             and the prisoner, they went from my house to be married in 1809. He said he was going to be married and was short of money; I lent him 1 l. 12 s. They returned to my house before dinner, and slept there. He was then gunner of the ship Venus, which laid in Woolwich ordinary. They went on board the day after their marriage, remained there, and frequently came ashore to my house.
Q. In February last year did you see the prisoner - A. Yes, at my house, and told him Mr. Frazer, our minister, had sent to me concerning his being married to 
               
                  Harriet 
                  Cole
               



            . He said,
"Mrs. Shott, I am afraid of no one living but you, and if you will swear I am not the same man that married Cole, I will make over half the property to you and your children that I have got by my present wife." I said if he had got as much money as 
               George
             the Third I would not do such a thing, for he was the man. He said it did not signify, for he could get a man named Collard to write him a burial certificate, to say she was buried at Munster. I said I thought that was a ready way to hang them both, and said in a jocular way,
"You had better get him to swear she fell overboard and was drowned."
Cross-examined by MR. BRODERICK. Q. Do you know the present Miss Lawes - A. Yes, she has been to me. I was subpoened here. I went to Chatham and Sheerness with her to find Cole. I saw some of the bills posted at Sheerness and Woolwich.
Q. Do you remember seeing a man named Bone at your house a few months ago - A. Very probably I might, but I do not know him by name. I never said it was of no importance whether Cole was alive or not, so that I got the reward, nor that there was a lady in London who would give 100 l. to a man to swear Gordon's first wife was alive.

            . The prisoner lived with me in King-street, Deptford; he came to lodge with me again the beginning of 1813 or 1814, he was then with a woman, whom he called his wife; she lived three or four weeks with him, and then escaped out of the back parlour window - he had locked her in the room, as they had words, and when he came home she was gone. I saw her about twelve months after with a child. I saw the prisoner two or three times after. He called in the beginning of 1819, and asked if I had seen his wife? I said not since I saw him. He desired me to save his neck - I asked him what he meant? I understood him to say he was going to be married, or was married. I had seen his wife about four years before that.
Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Might it not have been 1810 or 1811 that you saw her - A. No; I can tell by my child's age; he was nine years old on the 27th of August, and he was a little boy at the time.

                  BAKER
               



            . I live at Brompton, near Chatham; my husband is carpenter of the ship Cadmus. I first became acquainted with the prisoner eleven or twelve years ago; he was gunner of the Heroine, formerly called the Venus. He frequented our house - I was cook of the Venus. He had a woman with him, whom he called his wife, he always called her so. I saw her on the 4th of March, 1819; I know that was the day, because the ship sailed without me that day. A man named Owen bought 
               
                  Harriet 
                  Gordon
               



             a bonnet that day. I am sure she is the woman who lived with the prisoner as his wife.
Cross-examined. Q. How do you know it was eleven or twelve years ago that you first saw her - A. Because I left England soon after, and went round the Cape with my husband. I saw her again in August, 1818, and in 1817 I saw her on board the Cadmus with Owen.
Q. Did she go by Owen's name - A. No, they called her Lady Gordon. The prisoner knew me immediately he saw me at Marlborough-street. She was not so tall as me, and of a fair complexion.

             re-examined. That is the description of 
               
                  Harriet

            . I am boatswain of the Cadmus. I know 
               
                  Harriet 
                  Gordon
               



            . I saw her go past Chatham dock-gates in July this year, and have seen her in Baker's company. I saw her in 1818 in the brig with 
               
                  John 
                  Horn

                  GRANT
               



            . The prisoner lived at my house in 1817, about the latter end of the year. He told me there was a lady at the west end of the town, possessed of considerable property, if he could get married to her now, but he could not marry for two years, as his first wife had not left him five years. He said he left her for dead on the floor at Mrs. Stains's, in King-street, and had locked her in the room, and when he came home she was gone; that he went after her, and had sharpened his knife ready if he could have found her.
Q. Subsequent to this, did he live with you - A. Yes, after his second marriage, at the latter end of 1818, or the beginning of 1819. He came alone, took the apartment, and brought his wife next day.

             re-examined. It is the prisoner's hand-writing.

            . I have the register of marriages at St. Marylebone

, 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Gordon
               



            , batchelor, was married to 
               
                  
                     Frances Eliza

             re-examined. The signature to this register is the prisoner's writing.
MISS 
               
                  SUSAN 
                  MATILDA LAWES
               



            . I had a sister, 
               
                  Francis 
                  Eliza Lawes
               



             - the signature to the register is hers. She lived about two years ago with my mother; she afterwards went to lodge at the prisoner's brother, and married the prisoner - she afterwards died. Before her death I told the prisoner I should see about his previous marriage. He said he never had been married to any other woman but my sister. He afterwards confessed it, and asked for mercy. He had behaved very insolent, and next day he requested permission to see me and asked for mercy. I said,
"How can you expect mercy, when you married a second wife, knowing your first was alive?" He then said he did not know whether she was alive or dead. My sister had about 2000 l. in the Bank, and other money - about 180 l. a year altogether. He said severaltimes he would give up the d - d business if I would allow him 40 l. a year. I said I would allow him nothing.
Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Your sister's money was left her by her mother at her sole disposal - A. Exactly so. I had no claim to it. She died about the beginning of March.
Q. Did you employ a Mr. Pugh, an attorney - A. He wrote to the trustees in January, 1819, my sister was then alive, she died last March. I had some bills printed and circulated at all the sea-ports before her death.
Q. Do you know one Nebemiah - A. There was a man of that name who tuned my instrument. I never offered him 20 l. to swear the prisoner's first wife was alive. I do not believe I ever said a syllable to him about the business.
MR. ALLEY. Q. Solemnly on your oath you never did - A. I never did. My sister lived with the prisoner till her death - I could not separate them. She was quite of infirm mind, and had a paralytic stroke, which affected her speech. Dr. Thornton and others have made affidavits of it.
Prisoner's Defence. The word
"Batchelor" in the affidavit, was done solely by mistake.

            . I had a niece named 
               
                  Harriet 
                  Cole
               



            , she married the prisoner - she led a very indifferent life. I saw her after her marriage, she told me he was gone to sea and applied to me several times for money. It is nine years since I heard any thing of her. I live in New-street, Dorset-square. I think she is dead.

             who married the prisoner, was my niece. I have not seen her for ten years, and have made every enquiry.


                  WILLIAM 
                  GORDON
               



            . I am the prisoner's brother. Miss Lawes lived in my house at Woolwich. He was about to marry her - I only knew of his intent ten days before the marriage deed was executed. Before that I made diligent enquiry for his first wife of Mrs. Brooks and Jones, at his particular request. Miss Lawes knew he was a widower - it was occasionally a topic of conversation, for they were in my house a month before they were married. My brother told me his wife ran away from him in 1813. Miss Lawes was present at her sister's death.
MR. ALLEY. Q. How long was that young lady in your house before he married her - A. About a month, and my wife had known her thirty years; in fact Miss Lawes was a tenant of mine some years ago. I made the enquiry about the years 1814 and 1815, not since. I never mentioned to Miss Lawes that my brother was about to marry her sister - they were acquainted about a month before they were married.
MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you know whether they agreed to marry at first meeting - A. They walked out daily.
COURT. Q. As you knew Miss Laws so long, did you not call upon her, and say you was glad you were going to be related to her - A. She was out of town.

            . I am a rigger. and live at Poplar. I know the prisoner, the last time I saw him with his wife, was in 1813. I afterwards met her under the Piazza in Covent Garden, and went home with her. The last time I saw her was in 1815 - she went by the name of 
               
                  Mary 
                  White
               



            , she was in a very bad state of health, and I persuaded her to get an order from the Lord Mayor to go to the Hospital.

                  MILLINGTON

                  Harriet 
                  Cole
               



            , she lived at Woolwich when I first knew her. I saw her married to the prisoner in 1809. I saw her in 1813 at Deptford, she then went by the name of 
               
                  Mary 
                  White
               



            . In 1815, I met her in the Borough; she said she was going to try to get in the hospital. I went next day, and saw her there, she had just expired - she was the same woman who married the prisoner.
Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Did not the prisoner lodge in the same house with you - A. Yes, in 1813, before his first wife died, he supported me - I lived with him from 1813 to 1816. I have been married two years.
COURT. Q. Have you been to the nurse that attended her - A. She is not there - I have not been to see. I am sure it was 1815, because I was going to town at the time. I was at the marriage, but did not sign the register. She was in Magdalen ward - she was laying dead upon the bed. I told the prisoner I saw her dead - it was in the Summer of 1815.
Q. Did you ever converse with Miss Lawes - A. I did.
Q. On your oath, did you ever tell her the prisoner's first wife was alive and at Plymouth - A. I did; but when I am on my oath I must speak the truth. It was a year and a half ago that I said so, and referred her to one Harris, who could give her information. She said she should send to Plymouth.

                  White
               



            , and she was going to try get into the hospital. I have not seen her since. She said she went by that name as Gordon might be looking for her.

            , who was admitted on the 6th of June, and died on the 8th, in Magdalen Ward. When patients die they are removed in twenty-four hours.

                  Mary 
                  Whites
               



             in the hospital - A. Yes, I was not applied to about this till six weeks ago - she had the foul desease.

            . I am a blacksmith, and live in Gray's Inn-road. I know Mrs. Shot - several persons were in her tap-room, I heard her say
"What does it signify whether the first wife is alive or not, what odds is it, so as we can get the reward," and that she knew a lady in London, who would give 100 l. for any one to swear against Gordon, that his first wife was living. I have known Shott ever since 1813. I would not believe her on her oath, for I have often seen her drunk - I have no other reason.
MR. ALLEY. Q. Are you a journeyman - A. Yes. This happened last Sunday eight weeks at her house. I have not been examined about this before. A gentleman asked me what I knew, and I told him. Mrs. Millington fetched me to the gentleman's house. I had not seen Shott for twelve months before.
MR. BRODERICK. Q. When did you first see Gordon - A. In 1813. I knew Shott when I was on board the Pomona, and when I worked in the Warren.

COURT. Q. To whom did you first mention what Shott said - A. To the prisoner's attorney. I never told any other person of it. I never saw Shott between 1816 and then.
Two bills were then put in and read, offering a reward of thirty guineas to any person who could prove, that

                  Gordon
               



             was living at the time of the prisoner's second marriage. The marriage settlement was also read, conveying the property of Miss Lawes to the prisoner in case he survived her, after his death to their children, and in case they had none, to their survivors.
- ROACH. I am a bookseller, and a trustee to the settlement. I knew both parties before their marriage. I understood Gordon had been married, but heard nothing of his former wife. Miss Lawes knew he had been married before, as she said she was very sorry he had been so unfortunate as to marry a bad woman.
COURT. Q. Which of the two was your friend - A. Mr. Gordon, he introduced me to her.

            . I am a silver refiner


, in partnership with William and John Hornblow Turner; we live in Barbican, the prisoner was our servant
. On the 3d of May, I went to his house, in Long-alley, with the Officer, as I suspected him-the officer found some silver shavings in his box, which are our property; he had been shaving two bars that day, which weighed 88lbs. I always weigh it before I give it out - I had missed more than this on that day.
Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. Q. Are they all the same sort of shavings that he had been working on - A. We never take men in our employ if they work for themselves. I had missed double the quantity that I found; when his box was opened, he said he did not know it was there. He said he did not know that he had any silver in his possession.

            . I am an officer. I searched his box, and found the silver.

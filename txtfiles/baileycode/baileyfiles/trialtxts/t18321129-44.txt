             (Police-constable K 240). On Saturday, the 1st of October, I was walking in Whitechapel


 with my wife; I was in plain clothes; my wife gave me information, and I took the prisoner from her- I saw him pull my handkerchief from his bosom, and throw it down; as I was taking him to the office he got from me, and I got my coat torn by some persons - I took the prisoner a few days afterwards, and know he is the man.

            . I was walking with my husband in Whitechapel, between four and five o'clock; I looked over my shoulder, and saw the prisoner with my husband's handkerchief - the end was just going out of his pocket; I took the prisoner, and dragged him to my husband - he took the handkerchief from his bosom, threw it down, and then told me to search him; I am certain he is the person.
Prisoner. I know nothing of the handkerchief.
ALEXANDER DOUGLASS. I took him at his mother's, in North-street, Whitechapel - he gave his right address at the watch-house; he said some more boys threw the handkerchief at him.

            . I am quite sure he had the handkerchief, and I saw no other lads there.

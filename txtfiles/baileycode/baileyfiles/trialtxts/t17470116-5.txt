             and

             the Goods of 
               
                  
                     Thomas 
                     Clark 
                  




                
             of Wapping , the 10th of December
.


                  Thomas 
                  Clark 
               



            . The Prisoner, Woodward , was my Servant
, he lived with me three or four Years; he confessed he had robbed me for six Months together lately.
Q. Where was this that he made this Confession ?
Clark. Before the Justice.
Q. How much did you miss?
Clark. The Evidence has sworn to a hundred Weight, my Servants found the Goods upon him.
Q. to 
               
                  Peter 
                  Mellard 
               



            . Do you know of any Rope lost from Mr Clark?
Mellard. Yes, my Lord, on the 10th of December 
               
                  John 
                  Woodward 
               



             , the Prisoner, was at work with us, about 10 o'Clock at Night, at which Time I saw a Man draw up his Boat close to my Master's Back-door.
Q. What was it he brought up his Boat for?
Mellard. For to take the Rope in, I saw him take in some.
Q. Where did he take it from?
Mellard. From the Shore the first Parcel; then I saw 
               
                  John 
                  Woodward 
               



             carry down a Parcel, and give to him. He likewise did the same again, then he looked up and saw me, and that put a Stop to him. When the Waterman had put them in, and going away, I called to him, but he would not come back; there was a Boat by, and I took it, and went after him, and got into his Boat, and he had the Rope in his Boat that is the Property of Mr Clark. When I accused him with it, he did not speak one thing nor another a great while; 
               
                  Luke 
                  Anderson 
               



            , the Prisoner, said at last he staid for an Order from John. 
               
                  John 
                  Woodward 
               



             confessed before Justice Duckenfield , that he had done it once a Week for six Weeks past. He did not deny but that they were my Master's Ropes.
Q. Was Anderson, the Prisoner, before the Justice?
Mellard. Yes, my Lord, but he made no Confession at all.


                  John 
                  Petty 
               



            . I saw this 
               
                  Luke 
                  Anderson 
               



             take the Rope off the Ground, and put it into his Boat; and when he had got into his Boat, he was trying to get away; so we went and overtook him, and got into his Boat, and brought it to our Back-door.
Q. Did you bring Anderson in it?
Petty. Yes, my Lord, and we took the Rope out of his Boat.
Q. How much Rope might there be?
Petty. About a hundred and half. I heard Woodward make a Confession before the Justice, that he had robbed his Master once a Week for six Weeks.
Q. Did he acknowledge he had robbed him the 10th of December?
Petty . Yes, he said 
               
                  Luke 
                  Anderson 
               



             had tempted him to do it.
Q. Did he say that in the Presence of 
               
                  Luke 
                  Anderson 
               



            ?
Petty . I cannot say whether 
               
                  Luke 
                  Anderson 
               



             was by or know .


                  Luke 
                  Anderson 
               



            . Will you ask the Witness any Questions?
Anderson. No.
Woodward. What have you to say for yourself?
Woodward. My Lord, I cannot deny but it was a Parcel of old Stuff that they make brown Paper of, but I never wronged him of an Inch of Rope that was good. I should never have thought of such a Thing, if Anderson had not told me how he could dispose of it; he drawed me in, he made me drink several Times before he could bring me to it.


                  Thomas 
                  Peacock 
               



            . I have known Woodward and his Father, and the whole Family of them for many Years, ever since I was a dozen Years old, and I never knew or heard any Dishonesty in the Family. I was very much surprized to hear such a Thing alledged against him.
Culburth Jackson. Woodward has always had a very good Character, I have known him for four Years.
To the Prisoner. Anderson, what have you to say for yourself?
Anderson . What he has said of my tempting him, there was no Need of it, he is Rogue enough of himself, without my tempting of him. Both 

               guilty
            .

GEOROE BAKER
 (City police-constable, No. 58.) At half-past seven o'clock on the evening of the 25th of November, I was in company with Starling—I saw the two prisoners, they went up towards Temple-bar—they returned, and followed a gentleman—Sullivan put out his hand, and took this handkerchief from the gentleman's pocket, and gave it to Ay-ton—as soon as he took it, I seized him with it—I sent after the gentleman, but he did not return—I have not been able to find out his name—there is a hole in the handkerchief—I found another handkerchief on Ayton.





FRANCIS STANWAY
 (City-police constable, No. 311.) I was in company with Baker—I saw the two prisoners together—Baker beckoned me—I went, and took Sullivan—he took Ayton, and took the handkerchief from,

his breast-pocket—we sent an officer after the gentleman—he could not make out which the gentleman was—I have not made out his name.

Ayton's Defence. They sent after the gentleman, and he said he had not lost any thing. Witness. No, he did not.

Sullivan's Defence. I met Haydon at half-past four o'clock—he asked me to take a walk, and he bought the handkerchief going along of a Jew.

Ayton. I bought the handkerchief for 4s. 6d.

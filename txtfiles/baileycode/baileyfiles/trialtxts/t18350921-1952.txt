GEORGE MAYERS

On the 13th of September I saw the prisoner, in company with two others, in Barbican, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening—I saw him follow the prosecutor, and lay hold of his pocket with his right hand—I went across and got between them—I saw the prisoner take the handkerchief out of the prosecutor's pocket, with his left hand and put it behind him, and he put it into my hand instead of his companion's—I touched the prosecutor on the shoulder, and he claimed it.

Prisoner. Two other young men stood behind me, and chucked it is my face.

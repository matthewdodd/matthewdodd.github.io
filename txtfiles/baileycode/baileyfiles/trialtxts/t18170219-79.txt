            . I am a gardner On the 22d of January, about two o'clock in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner creeping on his hands and knees under the hedge where the things hung, I went and told Mrs. Collyer;-when I came away, he was half out of the field - He saw me and ran away. I did not lose sight of him till he got to Ball's-pond. He tried to hide himself in an old house there. Collyer was with me; we secured him. I am sure the prisoner is the man.

            . The last witness told me, the prisoner had been taking the linen. We found him - I never lost sight of him, till I took him. I went to the drying ground and saw the things stated in the indictment, lying on the ground, and the place broken.

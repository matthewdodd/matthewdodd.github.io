            ; I lost the things mentioned in the indictment about three weeks ago; they were taken away while I was in bed; the prisoner sat up with me all that night; I was very ill; I saw them all over night, and missed them in the morning; I found my stays upon her; she was brought to me by a relation of mine. I am positive they were my stays found upon her.
Prisoner's Defence.
I put the stays on in a mistake.

DAVID PROWETT. I am a purser
, and live in Nelson-square. On the 9th of February, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, I was in Fleet-street


, walking towards Bridge-street. Somebody called out, I turned round, and found the officer had got the prisoner; I found my handkerchief gone.

            . I am a patrol. On Friday evening, about half past seven o'clock, I saw the prisoner. with another man, close by Chancery-lane - I watched him - I saw him go up to Mr. Prowett, and put his finger and thumb into his right-hand pocket, just by St. Dunstan's-church - He pulled the handkerchief a little way out - I could see him very well; the man who was behind appeared to follow him - I still watched him till he got to Fetter-lane, he then pulled it out a little further. When he got a few doors from Fetter-lane there is a dark place, he then took it quite out, and put it into his hat - I laid hold of him; three or four men then surrounded me, and one of them took my stick away.

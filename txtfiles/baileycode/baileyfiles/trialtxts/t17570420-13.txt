            . I was standing at my door on the 8th of March, about four doors from the prosecutor's. I heard a cry of stop thief. I saw the prisoner running. I pursued her, and found she had these two pair of shoes in her lap. I stop'd her, brought her back, took them from her, and delivered them to the prosecutor.
Prisoner's Defence.
I never was in such a place before, and I don't know what to say; I hope the court will be favourable.

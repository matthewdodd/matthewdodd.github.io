            . Mr. Swain is a corn-chandler
. On the 11th of October I saw the prisoner and three others looking into my shop, which is within two or three doors of the prosecutor's; I suspected they were young thieves, and went to my door - they then went to the prosecutor's shop, to see who was there; a person was in the shop, and they waited till he was gone - the prisoner then went in, and they took up a parcel; he put that down, and took up these curry-combs; he came out, and I stopped him - the prosecutor came out, and took him with them.
STEPHEN SWAIN. These curry-combs are mine. The witness called my attention to them - I know nothing of the prisoner.

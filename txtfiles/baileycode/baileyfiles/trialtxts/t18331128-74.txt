            . I am an officer. On the 9th of November, at four o'clock in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner in front of me as I was crossing the road; there was another person with him - the prisoner put his hand into a gentleman's left-hand pocket, took this handkerchief out - and put it into his own trousers - I secured him, put my hand into his trousers, and took the handkerchief out: in consequence of the pressure of the crowd, and an attempt at rescue, I could not find the gentleman.
Prisoner's Defence. I went to see the Lord Mayor's show. I trod on something; I stooped down and took up this handkerchief; the officer then laid hold of me. I did not know whose it was. Why did not you secure the gentleman you saw me take it from? Witness. I saw him take the handkerchief from the gentleman, but there was such a crowd I was obliged to take the prisoner down Lamb's lane before I could secure him.

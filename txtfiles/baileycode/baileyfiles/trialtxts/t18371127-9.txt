THOMAS FRANCIS BROWN
. I am an officer of Bridewell Precinct. On the night of the 30th of October I saw the prisoner near Mr. Flint's shop, at the corner of Ludgate-hill, lurking about—I knew him, and watched him for twenty minutes—I saw him go into the shop, take the flannel under his arm, and walk off quite rapidly—I followed him—he pulled off his apron and covered it over—I immediately secured him with the property which he had taken from the door-way.

Prisoner. A man gave it to me to carry. Witness. No one gave it him—I saw him take it.





JOHN CARTER
. I was in the service of Mr. Ebenezer Flint, of Ludgate-hill. I can swear to this flannel being his.




GUILTY
. * Aged 28.—


Transported for Seven Years.

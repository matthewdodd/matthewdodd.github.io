            . On the 30th of December last, I was in Guildhall


. A person came and tapped my shoulder, and told me there was a thief. I turned round, and at the same time I felt the prisoner pull my handkerchief out of my pocket. (A blue and white linen one.) I saw him cram it into his bosom. He left one corner of it hanging out. I laid hold of him. He wanted to call me on one side, but I would not go. I took him before Mr. Aldermen Stevenson, at Guildhall, who sent him to the Compter. (The handkerchief produced and deposed to.)

            . This handkerchief was delivered to my custody before the Alderman. I have had it in my custody ever since.
Prisoner's Defence.
Here is a paper that the prosecutor wrote, signed by his own hand, not to prosecute me. (Producing it.)
Prosecutor. I did sign this paper, but did not know what I was doing. I being young, did not know how to prosecute. They told me it would be expensive.

            . I live at Mile end


, I am master of a ship
; on the 30th of November, I was just come from Jamaica; coming home, at 11 o'clock at night, I saw my house on fire; I was informed it began about half an hour after 9; I was like a distracted man; I found my wife and two children at a neighbour's house, the other two children were burnt in the flames; my wife had nothing but her shift and night-cap on; she got the two children out of a two-pair of stairs window; the other witnesses can give a farther account.

            . I being a carpenter and joiner, and had put the fixtures up, went in to take them down at the time of the fire; I looked round to see who I knew; I saw Mrs. Barne, and a great number of people below; the upper part of the house was then on fire; (the prisoner keeps a public-house, the Blue Anchor at Mile-end;) I said to her, Pray give a look out that no body takes down the furniture, to tear things down; as I was taking the chimney glass down, she was at the cupboard, taking the china and things out into her apron; after that, the things were handed out by one and another, the next day I let the Captain know Mrs. Barne took the things out of the cupboard and beauset; he sent me to her, to know what she had taken out; I went into her tap-room; I told her the Captain desired to know what goods she had taken to her house; she said she had nothing of plate but a milk-pot, and some china, and a large bowl, which she broke; I think she mentioned a tea-board and bonnet, and she would deliver them as soon as they were sent for, and wished there was ten times as much; I returned, and told the Captain what she said; I don't remember that I saw

            . I lived servant with Captain 
               
                  Payne
               


             at the time of the fire; I heard, four days after the fire, that Mrs. Barne had some of the china and tea-spoons, a punch-strainer, and a pair of silver tea-tongs, that I put into a jug in the beauset, before I went to bed that night; my mistress and I went to bed just at 9 o'clock; I went and asked Mrs. Barne after them; she told me she had some of the china, a tea-board and a silver milk-pot; I said I would tak e my oath I put the spoons, strainer, and tongs into it, I call it a jug; she gave me some china, and the tea-board and milk-pot, and said they were all she had ofMr. Payne's things; I repeated two or three times, I could take an oath I put them in together before I went to bed; she two or three times over said, Young woman, these are all I had ofMr. Payne's things; I was taken out at a two pair of stairs window.

            . I am an officer in the hamlet of Mile-end; Mr. Payne brought me a search warrant; I went with him to search Mr. Barne's house; neither he nor his wife were at home; this was about a month or five weeks after the fire; in a corner-cupboard in their bed-room, we found some china, which Mr. Payne owned, half a dozen cups and saucers, a tea-pot, some silver tea-spoons and a silk bonnet.
Capt. Payne. I know the china and spoons to be my property. I had them before the last voyage; here is a small tea-spoon, marked O.P. I have had some time; when we took the woman at the bar before the Justice, she owned she took them from my house; she likewise owned she took my eight-day clock which was found; she said, she was led into the scrape by another woman.

            . I had lodged in the prisoner's house about four months before the fire happened; that night my husband and I went to bed about seven, the fire broke out between nine and ten. Mrs. Barne had been at the fire, and came home and called me up; I went there, but she was gone again before me; she was coming with things in her lap, down the captain's steps of his house; some man gave me a large tea-board and bonnet; I brought them home, and put them into my landlady's care; I saw the clock standing in her bedroom; the next morning they were all in the club-room on a table; there was a great deal of china, a punch-strainer, a milk-pot, and some teaspoons; I saw them there a day or two before Christmas-day; I said to her, I thought you had said you had sent the captain's things all home; she said, for God's sake do not make a noise, I will send them home by somebody; on the Friday after Christmas I was making my bed, she brought half a dozen cups and saucers, and said, as my husband was out of work, I might make some money of them; I would not take them, but advised her to carry them to the captain, or I would tell the captain of them; when I came down, she said to me, she was ashamed to carry them home then; I said, hire somebody, I dare say the captain will be glad to have them again; then she desired me to take them, and she would give me some money, and forgive me a debt which we owed her; I said, I would tell the captain of them, and went over the way; she followed me, and begged I would not; I did not then, but I did tell him yesterday fortnight.

            . This day fortnight, about half an hour after seven in the morning, the woman at the bar came to my mistress's, Mrs. Cornish's, opposite the new infirmary; my master is in the Marshalsea prison, in the Borough; she desired me to go and tell her sister to come to her directly, but not to say where she was; I brought her; after that she and I went in a coach, to her friend in Fishmongers-alley, in the Borough; I took care of two bundles of things, the winder of the clock was in one, and I heard the clock strike in the coach; I delivered the bundle to the publican, at the Mermaid, facing the Marshalsea.

            . On Sunday was sen'night, the captain had taken the two prisoners; he sent for me; I took them to the watch house; I staid with them at the public-house all night, at the sign of the Hayfield; the captain came the next morning; then Mrs. Barne took six silver tea-spoons, a strainer, and a pair of tongs, out of her pocket, and delivered them, on the road, going along, she told me she had left the punch strainer at a house; we went, and it was delivered to us; (produced in court, and deposed to;) she gave the captain directions where to find more, which were the eight-day tableclock, and china.
Prosecutor. I wrote an order, and

            's defence.
The things that I took out of the captain's house, I delivered again; I know nothing of those things; Anderson knew I had the things in my house; she wanted me to give her seven guineas to conceal them, and I would not; she brought in many things, and said she would have them herself; my husband made me bring them down, and deliver them to the captain's maid.

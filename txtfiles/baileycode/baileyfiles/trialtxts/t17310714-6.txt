            , the 4th of June
 last.
It appear'd by the Evidence, That William Carnegy was Servant
 to the Prosecutor; and that Bennet being observ'd by the Neighbours to wait about the Prosecutor's House daily, (while the Prosecutor and his Wife were gone to 6 o'Clock Prayers at St. Sepulchres Church) and frequently to carry away Goods, and that thereupon the Prosecutor desir'd a Neighbour, to watch and mind rightly, on the Day mention'd in the Indictment, and the Prisoner was apprehended with the before-mentioned Goods.
It appear'd also, That the Goods were deliver'd to the Prisoner Bennet, by Carnegy, the Prosecutor's Servant.
The Prisoner Carnegy confess'd that he had various Times given his Master's Goods to the Prisoner Bennet.
Bennet pleaded, That he bought the Goods of the Prosecutor's Servant 
               
                  Carnegy
               


             ; but could bring no Proof of it; and this being contradicted by Carnegy, and the Fact being plainly prov'd, the Jury found them both 

               Guilty
             of the Indictment.

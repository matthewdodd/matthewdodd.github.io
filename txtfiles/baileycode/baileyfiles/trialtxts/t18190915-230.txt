            . I am a grocer, and live at Kingsland. I saw Harris go into Mr. Carter's garden, and take the coat - he came out and gave it to Taylor. Knight was with them. I had seen all three together before - they all three ran away. I went home and told my master. They were all three apprehended together about a quarter of an hour after; I had noticed them lurking about together for sometime before.

            . I am a publican, and live at Kingsland. I saw the three prisoners run by my house, Taylor had the coat. I called Stop thief! and some brickmaker's stopped them. Taylor threw it down.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

. On the 19th of August, in the morning, I left my coat and waistcoat safe in my box; the prisoner, who slept in the room, was then getting up; I went up after he was gone, and missed them; I followed him down Petticoat-lane, and got assistance; I then said to him"Where are my clothes?" he said "Here they are, I don't want to rob you; I was going to the tailor's to get a suit made like them;" he had them round him, under his coat.

            . I took the prisoner in charge. After I looked him up, I looked into the cell, hearing a bustle, and saw the clothes there; he had them wrapped round him under his coat.(Property produced and sworn to.)

             sworn.
I am sextoness of the parish of St. Dunstan, Stepney


; on the 21st of January, two men came to me for the key of the church, to mend some leaks on the lead; I asked them whom they came from; they said from Mr. Meadows, the plumber, and that they should come the next morning for it; I told them they might have it as soon as it was light; they did, and I gave the key, and they brought it back again at night, about five in the evening: and on the next day, Saturday morning, they came again for it, and I gave it them then, and about the hour of four or five, they brought it me again on Saturday afternoon, and then said they were done. I did not hear any lead was taken away till the 30th of January; I cannot swear to the men, they were dressed very smart, in long coats, clean shirts, and very tidy.

                   PORTER
               



             sworn.
I am a plumber and glazier; on the 21st of January I was at work on the top of the Ship at Stepney, facing the church; I saw two men on the top of the church pulling at something, as though it was the lead; the church parapet raises about four feet, I saw their backs, and when they saw me, they appeared to use a rule as if measuring the lead; I went down, and said, there are two men on the top of the top of the church, doing something they should not do, it is fit somebody should go to them, and the grave-digger went to them, and brought them into the public-house; I am sure the prisoner is one; they said they worked for Mr. Meadows. Whilst these two was there, my iron was in the fire; observation was made that they were going to prayers; one of them said, that makes no difference, we can go to work; so they went on the top of the church again.
How soon afterward did you see the prisoner after he was apprehended? - It was about a fortnight ago.
How long did you stay in the public-house with them? - About ten minutes, or a quarter of an hour.
Had you ever known them before? - No, I had not known them, but I have seen them.

             sworn.
I am one of the pew openers of Stepney Church; on Saturday the 22d of January, I met the prisoner in the church, he told me he was a plumber. When I came back to do my work, he was out, and was gone from twelve to one; the prisoner came to my door and asked me for that key to go out; I told him I would not. From curiosity I went up to see what way the church was made; and I saw a chopper like a sugar chopper, and looked about for the prisoner, but could not see him there; on Sunday week following I heard there was four hundred pounds weight of lead gone.

             sworn.
I am a grave-digger; I was up in the steeple chiming the bells, I cannot say to the day; the prisoner came up into the steeple, and said he had been at work on the top of the church, and wanted to go up to the top of the steeple, to see if there was any work to be done there: I let him go up; he came down again in a few minutes afterwards; says I, young man, is there any thing wanted to be done on the top? no, says he, it is all tight, and clever, and neat: I also saw him at the Ship, and am sure he is the man.

             sworn.
I do the business of the church as a plumber; I know nothing of the prisoner at the bar, nor did employ him on the 21st of January, nor any time else.

                   JOHNSON
               



             sworn.
I am partner with Mr. Meadows; the prisoner was never employed by me nor Mr. Meadows, to my knowledge, nor were any of my men employed at that time about the church. I went up on the church, and by a calculation I had made of it, there appeared to be three or four hundred pounds weight of lead missing, the value of which must be upwards of three pounds, taken from the body of the church. I did not go upon the steeple.
Mr. Knowlys. Did you take particular notice, whether this was taken from the body of the church or the chancel? - From the body of the church.
How long before that time had you seen the church? - About twelve months.
Mr. Garrow. Were any repairs done to the church in the last ten days? - No, none.
Court. Could you discover whether this lead had been recently taken away, or been lately cut or torn? - I cannot answer, it was taken away from where it lapt over.
Will not lead carry an appearance of being cut, when it is done lately? - Not when it is lapped over.

                   NEWELL
               



             sworn.
I am one of the beadles; I went up and found it just the same as Mr. Johnson represents it.
Mr. Knowlys. When did you see this lead before? - I do not know that ever I was on that part of the church before in my life.

             sworn.
I went up to the top of the church and found the lead recently cut, by the brightness of the lead; they took some from the top, where the rain would have come in.
Did you point out that to Mr. Newel? - Yes, we both remarked it; Mr. Newel has forgot it at least. I never saw this man till I saw him before the Justice.

             sworn.
I work for Mr. Porter, and was at work with him, and saw two men working on the church; the prisoner was one, pulling and hauling the lead, as if he wanted to divide it asunder; I saw him also in the public-house.
Mr. Knowlys. You did not go on the church? - No.

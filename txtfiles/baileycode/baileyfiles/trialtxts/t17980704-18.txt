            , a pawnbroker
: On Friday, the 1st of June, between seven and eight in the evening, the prisoner at the bar came in, and said she had lost the duplicate of two handkerchiefs; when she went away, I went to the door, and missed a cotton gown that was hanging up at the door; I saw her cross the road not a dozen yards from the house, she had a bundle in her apron; she went through a public-house, which is a throughfare into Bishopsgate-street, I immediately pursued her, and took the gown from her, it has a private mark upon it in my own hand-writing. (Produces it). I have kept it ever since.
Prisoner's defence. I was very much in liquor, a young fellow gave it me to pawn for him, and as I was going to pawn it for him, this young man came up and took it from me.

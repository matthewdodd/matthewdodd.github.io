. The prisoner was our servant
; he had lived one year with us; his duty was to collect money. In the month of January, I sent him to several persons, one of whom was Mrs. Wildsmith, to collect some money - He rendered me no account of any he had received. In February last, I asked him if he was paid; he told me, Mrs. Wildsmith said, it was not convenient for her to pay it; he has never paid me any money he received from her.

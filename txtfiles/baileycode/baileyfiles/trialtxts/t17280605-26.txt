             depos'd, That as he was walking along Cheapside


 with his Master, Mr. Webb, he saw the Prisoner, who, he thought, look'd like a Pick-pocket; that he bid his Master take Care of his Pocket; that presently the Prisoner came close up to his, and took his Handkerchief out of his Pocket, but Mr. Webb, and this Deponent pursuing him he ran down a Turning, and went into a Baker's Shop, where they following, saw him fling four Handkerchiefs into the Bin, and they searching him strictly, found Mr. Webb's Handkerchief crowded into his Breeches. He said in his Defence, that coming cross Stocks-Market, he found them all Bundled up together; but the Excuse of a Pickpocket having but very little Weight, the Jury found him 


               guilty to the Value of 10 d.

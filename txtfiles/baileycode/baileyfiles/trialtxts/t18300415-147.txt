            . I live at the Post-office, at Acton


, and keep rabbits. On the 24th of December I missed them; they were in a warehouse, and I had fed them the day before; when I went that day I found the latch-door and the window open - the warehouse is across a little yard; there is a gateway belonging to three houses - I missed a rat-trap also: they had taken the key, gone down, and got out, and had broken five large squares of glass to get in.

            . On the 24th of December the prisoner came and asked me to buy two rabbits, as I was standing at the turnpike-gate - I knew him before, and went to school with him; he said he had bought them at Brentford-market - I gave 2s. 10d. for them; one I gave away, and the other is here.

            . I have had this rabbit ever since; Pratley delivered it to me.
WILLIAM COLLET. I know the rabbit by many ways he has; if you were to put out a glass of beer, he would run round like a cat after milk.
COURT. Q. Was this done in the night? A. Yes; I had fed them the night before, and we suspected this boy, who lived with me.

            . On the 22d of June I found this property on a boy of the name of Yewman, who said he had bought it of the prisoner for 5 s. On the next morning I took the prisoner into custody, and accused him of having stolen this property from his master; he said he had. I had not told him it would be better or worse for him. I produce the property.

            . This chain and seal are mine; there was no watch attached to them - the value of it is about 3 l. I heard the officer ask the prisoner how he came possessed of it - he said he had taken it from me to give to Yewman, and he was to get a hat in return. He had been about six weeks in my service.

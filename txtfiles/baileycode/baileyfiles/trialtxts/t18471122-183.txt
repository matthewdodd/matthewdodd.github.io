WILLIAM FLIGHT.
 I am a shoemaker, in Church-street, Lisson-grove, On Monday evening, 15th Nov., about half-past five o'clock, the prisoner came for a pair of clogs—she tried several pairs on, none would do, and she went out—after she was gone Mrs. Hanton told me something, and I went after the prisoner, stopped her about twenty yards from the shop, told her she had something, and saw the toe of a Wellington boot under her shawl—I took her back to the shop, and found the fellow boot under the chair she had sat on—I sent for a constable, and gave her in charge—they had been hanging on a nail at the back of the chair she sat on.





AMY HANTON.
 I was in the shop, and saw the prisoner put her hand behind her—when she arose, I saw a boot under her arm—she went out, and I told Mr. Flight.





THOMAS HAZELDINE
 (policeman, 104 D.) I took the prisoner, and told her what it was for—she said she knew nothing about it.

Prisoner's Defence. I laid down a gown in the shop which I had with me, and when I took it up I picked up the boot with it, and did not know it—it was drink that did it.





THOMAS HAZELDINE

re-examined. I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction—(read—Convicted Dec., 1845, and confined six months)—I was present at the trial—she is the person—she was convicted before that, and several times since.




GUILTY. Aged 26.—


Transported for Seven Years.

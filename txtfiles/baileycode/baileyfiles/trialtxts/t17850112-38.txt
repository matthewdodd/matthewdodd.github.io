I am a haberdasher and hosier
, No. 87, Tower-hill


; on Friday the 24th of December, about a quarter past eight in the evening, I was in a little back room close to my shop, the candles were all lighted, and hearing a pane of glass break, I ran out, and heard the cry of stop thief; I saw a person running, and I saw him run into Rosemary-lane, and he was knocked down.

On Christmas eve at night, about a quarter past eight, I was coming over big Tower Hill, and I saw the prisoner standing on the pavement, almost facing the prosecutor's door, and hearing a pane of glass break, I saw the prisoner with something in his hand, which came from out of the window which he had broken; I cried out stop thief, and he hove them down and ran away; I picked them up, and ran after him; he was never out of my sight, I am sure he is the man.
(The shawls produced and deposed to.)

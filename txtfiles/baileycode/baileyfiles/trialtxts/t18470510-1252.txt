James Whatmore; and that Davis had been before convicted of felony; to which


DAVIS pleaded 


GUILTY
. Aged 19.—


Transported for Seven Years.






CHARLES RANDALL
. On the 3rd May, about eight o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoners together, in Islington—David Holton and Knight went into Mr. Whatmor's, a confectioner's shop, in the Lower-road—the other two stood at a little distance, and passed the shop together—Davis then went into the shop, William Holton waited a little way off; after Davis had gone in a minute or two, David Holton and Knight came out, and directly afterwards Davis came out; they were joined directly by William Holton, and all four went them into custody—they got into Upper-street, and I and another constable took them into custody—I searched Davis at the station, and found a pair of spectacles on him—one of them, Davis I believe, said, "The spectacles will sell us."





THOMAS WITHERS
 (policeman.) I was watching with Randall—I saw all the prisoners in company—I saw Davis go into the shop, and David Holton and Knight come out followed by Davis in about half-a-minute—William Holton passed and repassed the shop while they were there—they joined, and all went away together—they were stopped and taken to the station.





SARAH WHATMORE
. My husband's name is James—he keeps a confectioner's shop in Lower-street, Islington—these spectacles are mine—they were lying on my counter at a quarter past eight that evening—I did not know they were gone till I was told of it—I was looking about for them at the time.

William Holton's Defence. I know nothing at all about it.

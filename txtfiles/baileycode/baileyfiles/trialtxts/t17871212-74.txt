I keep a public-house
 in Duck-lane


; I happened to go out in the morning on the 10th of September last, at eleven in the forenoon, I did not return till the day following; I left word with the maid that I did not know, (having a friend with me,) whether I should be able to return till the next day; when I returned the next day, I found the window of the closet had been broke open and all the things taken away which my wife can give a more particular account of; the money that I had taken for three weeks was all taken away, but a few halfpence out of one of my drawers.

                   Mason
               



            , we keep the Ship, in Duck-lane, I was not out all day on the 10th of September, I was the last person that was up that night, I shut the door, and it was all safe and secure when I went to bed, but it was broke open before I went to bed; there were some people in my house on the Monday, the house had been broke open before on the Wednesday, and I set a man to watch every night; I desired the man to go to bed and wait till I went to bed, and then I would call him up; my husband was from home; the man went to bed, and before I went to bed which was about eleven, I found the house had been broke open near upon ten; I was asked very particularly, whether I was sure my husband was out, by a person whose name is Bullen, I have seen all the prisoners in my house, they were all in and out of my house that night; I know them all; I know their names; I did not know Todd's name till after he was taken; I did not suspect them in the least; they did not frequent my house, but they called now and then, they always behaved civil in the house; I knew Todd by sight, being a lodger of Mrs. Burkitt's who lives opposite to me, but his name I knew not.
Had that person you employed to watch your house been watching it that night? - After he had finished his work he came home, and he said, Mistress, will you want me to night? he had been sitting up four nights before; I told him he might go and come down about ten, he had not been on the watch in my house that night; when I went to go to bed, I found myself fastened out of my bed-room, the door was bolted within; I went down and I called the watch, the watchman came in, I told him to open my door; there were people in the tap-room, I cannot say whom; they told me I was a foolish woman, for my husband was certainly in bed, and had bolted me out for fun; the watchman opened the door, and I at first found nothing amiss; I discovered only one small drawer taken; Iordered my doors to be shut, and I found I had been robbed of my money, silver and gold; some loose halfpence lay on the table, and the articles mentioned in the indictment; there was an empty house next door; and under the window, the next morning; when I arose up early, I picked up some loose halfpence and farthings, I made it a point to go up in my bed-chamber three or four times after the first robbery, and I particularly watched my windows, and the closet window was fast at candle light that night; I had not seen the things that evening; the linen was not all put up; there was a basket of linen laid that had not been meddled with; I know the window was fast, when I put up my parlour shutter at candle-light; I first saw my things at Sir Sampson Wright's.

                   BARLOW
               



             sworn.
I bought this piece of cotton of Mr. Fleming; I know nothing of the prisoners.
(Deposed to.)
FRANCIS FLEMING sworn.
The prisoners were apprehended in consequence of my information, all but Higgins, he was apprehended before; when I was at Sir Sampson Wright's on Sunday the 2d of December, I told Sir Sampson I had dealt with the prisoners, and what things I had bought of them; I told him that I had bought the several things mentioned in the indictment of them; but neither of the prisoners brought the things in my house; they were brought in by a person who calls herself 
               
                  Sophy
                   Brown
               



            , every thing mentioned in the indictment except the tea-spoons; she left them, she went away directly, and said nothing.
Who is 
               
                  Sophy
                   Brown
               



            ? - I believe she has a connection with the prisoner Brown, but I do not think he is married to her; presently after Todd and Watson came into my shop, that was on Monday evening the 10th of September, between nine and ten; about two or three minutes after, Higgins and Brown came into my street-door, and went into the parlour, while Watson and Todd were in my shop, and Higgins and Brown in the parlour; I looked at the things mentioned in the indictment, except the spoons; after I had looked at them, Higgins and Brown came into the shop; there was one 
               
                  John
                   Vanderberg
               



             in the parlour; I believe Brown went to the parlour again to him; then there was Higgins, Brown, and Watson in the shop; they were on one side, and I on the other; after I had looked at them, one of the three asked me the price of them, and they asked me three guineas for them.
Did they say they were their own property, because they were brought in by another person? - I apprehend I am not at liberty to give my opinion on that subject; but they asked me three guineas for those things which Brown had brought in; that was more than I could afford to give; I gave two pounds seven shillings and sixpence for them; while I paid for them, Brown came into the shop; then they went away.
Who took the money? - I think it was Todd; but I will not venture to swear that; there was a division of the money in my shop; they all went away at one time; I have sold the gowns, and I think all the other things; but I am sure of some to one Saunders, a Jew; and I believe one of the gowns he has to produce; he had one of them by him, and I sold these seven yards of cotton to Mrs. Barlow.
Was that piece of cotton a part of the property you bought of the prisoner? - It is impossible for me to swear to this; it is a common pattern, but I sold Mrs. Barlow seven yards of the same pattern and sort of cotton.
EMANUEL SAUNDERS sworn.
I purchased some things of Mr. Fleming, and one gown I have left here, what I produce; I cannot recollect the time I bought it.
Fleming. I do not think it is in the same state it was when I sold it to Saunders; it has been picked to pieces.

To Saunders. Has it been altered at all? - No, it has not.
Fleming. I sold him a gown of this pattern, and I think it had the stain in the back, which is in it now.
Mrs. Mason. I swear this to be my gown, I described the mark in it at Sir Sampson's, before it was open, which is a mark of blood in the body of it, and there it is.
Prisoner Brown. That woman that you mention might be a principal, and we might be accessaries after the fact: Did I ever sell you any thing particularly, or ever call at your shop, any otherwise than to pledge my things? - Todd and Watson came into the shop, and Higgins and Brown went into the parlour; then they came into the shop, and after the money was paid, they all went away together.
Prisoner Watson. Did I ever sell you any thing? - Yes.
Fleming. The next day he came into my shop and bought a pair of shoes, in the presence of 
               
                  Ann
                   Bullen
               



            , and was talking about the things.

                   TOWNSEND
               



             sworn.
I know nothing of the robbery, but I found this blue and white pullicat handkerchief Vanderberg's and Keep's.
Fleming. This is the handkerchief that came with the goods.
Mrs. Mason. I will swear this to be mine, by my washing, and not perfectly washing the corner clean, and I have another to match it.
Townsend. Keep said before Sir Sampson that he did buy this handkerchief of Fleming, but he said he did not know how it came.
Prisoner Brown. You heard the next morning that this house was robbed; your house was searched for it; was it not? - It was searched in the presence of Saunders, and the property was not found there on the Monday morning.


                  THOMAS
                   YOUNG
               



             sworn.
I watch in Duck-lane; on the 10th of December, just as the clock struck ten, I was crying the hour; and as soon as I came to the door; the lady of the house called to me; I went and broke open the door by her orders; the door was bolted; says she, you shall break it open, if you break it in pieces; when I broke open the door, we went into the closet, and the closet casement window was open, and hanging on one hook, and the glass was broke where they undid it; I observed nothing about the house; we did not come on until ten at that time of the year.
PRISONER WATSON's DEFENCE.
I know nothing of it; I was drinking at the house with a young fellow till about half after ten, and the young fellow went home with me, which is one hundred and fifty yards below there; I went there every day; I was there from six o'clock; I always went there whenever I had seven farthings to spend; and if not, Mr. Mason would always trust me with a pint of beer.
PRISONER HIGGINS's DEFENCE.
I know nothing at all of it; I went to this man's house, and slept there; at the same time I was not at the house in Duck-lane; I was at Watson's lodgings that night.


                  GEORGE
                   TODD
               



            's DEFENCE.
I never sold Mr. Fleming any thing in my life; I was not in Westminster the night this thing was done, but I cannot recollect where I was; I lodged at Clare-market at my sister's; I did lodge at Mrs. Burkitt's.
PRISONER BROWN's DEFENCE.
I was in the house that same afternoon, about half after eight; I asked Mrs. Mason what it was o'clock, and she told me half after eight.


                  JOHN
                   JONES
               



             sworn.
I know the prisoner Watson, I was in company with him that night; he and me and another young lad and a man's wife were at supper together at the prosecutor's house; we staid there till; tea; we both went home to bed directly.

Do you live together? - No; I parted with him just at his own door in Duck-lane; I live opposite this public house; it is not far off.
Then you was present when the Watchman came in and broke open the door? - Yes, I was eating my supper at the same time, and he was with me.
Did you go up stairs with them, or did you see any thing that was going forward there? - No Sir, I eat my supper quietly; I did not interfere at all in it; I left him at his own door.
Court to Mrs. Mason. This boy, John Jones, who was last examined, says, he, together with Watson, and a woman and man, was at supper at the time the watchman came in, and went up stairs? - Not to my knowledge; it is common for people to bring their victuals and sit in the tap room to supper; when I called in the watchman at ten o'clock, I instantly ordered every body to be turned out; I do not remember this boy Jones to be there the whole evening.
Do you know that boy? - Very well; he lives just opposite; I will not swear he was not there, but I do not remember him.
Jury to Fleming. Was the woman Sophy Brown ever in custody? - Yes; she was taken; she denied bringing the property to my house, and then Sir Sampson discharged her; I do not know for what reason she denied it, but she did deny it.
Jury to Fleming. Was there no body in your shop but yourself? - No Sir, Mr. Vanderberg was in the parlour; I do not think he heard any thing that was said.
Court. This depends almost entirely on the testimony of Fleming.

. He suddenly let go my arm, I turned round, and saw the prisoners - he had hold of them, and my handkerchief laid at the feet of Collins. I gave them in charge.
MR. ROBERT MUTRIE. I was walking with the prosecutor, turned my head, and saw Milton pull the handkerchief out of Mr. Thompson's pocket, and hand it to Collins, who saw me and let it fall at his feet. I seized them both.

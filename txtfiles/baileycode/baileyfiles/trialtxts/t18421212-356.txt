GEORGE ILES
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
4th of Dec, 1 table-cover, value 4s., the goods of 



Elisabeth Meredith; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






HENRY JOSEPH SNELLING
 (police-constable G 203.) About half-past twelve o'clock on the 6th of December I was on duty in White cross-street, St. Luke's—I saw the prisoner with this table-cover doubled up under his arm—I went up, and asked him what he had there—he said, "A piece of green baize"—I asked where he got it from—he said he had bought it in Petticoat-lane—I asked what be gave for it—he said, "Two shillings"—I said, "This is a table-cover"—he said, "Yes"—I took him to the station—I received information, and took it to Mrs. Meredith, of Earl-street, Finsbury.





MARTHA ALLEN
. I am in the service of Elizabeth Meredith, of Earl-street. This table-cover is my mistress's—I saw it safe on the table on Sunday afternoon, the 3rd of Dec, at five o'clock, and missed it about six—the parlour-window was lifted up—I bad seen the prisoner lurking about the place on Thursday and Friday—I am sure it was him.

Prisoner. Q. Had you seen me on the Monday before? A. I am not positive—I saw you on the Thursday, and about in the evening of Saturday.

Prisoner's Defence. On the 5th of Nov. I got into a bit of a bother; I got taken to the station, and committed for a month; I did not come out till the 3rd of Dec.; so it was impossible for Allen to see me on the Monday or Thursday.






JOHN ARCHER
 (police-sergeant G 8.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
.* Aged 22.—


Transported for Seven Years.

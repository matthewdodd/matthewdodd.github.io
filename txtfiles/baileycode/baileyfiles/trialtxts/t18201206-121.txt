            . I am a hosier. I was going past Jerusalem-court, on Friday evening, the 8th of December, about a quarter-past seven o'clock, and saw three boys coming down the court. I knew it was no thoroughfare, and suspected them. The prisoner had an iron plate in his arms - as soon as I began to speak he threw it down. I laid hold of him, and the others ran away.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

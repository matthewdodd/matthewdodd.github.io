             On the 11th of April, I was going to take water at the Old Swan, between the hours of twelve and three, as the watermen were round me, the prisoner passed me, I found an uncommon motion, a sort of a jerk at my pocket, I put my hand in and missed my handkerchief immediately.
Q. What handkerchief was it?
Grahurst. It was a silk one, produced in court and deposed to.
Q. When did you see it last before that?
Grahurst. I put it clean in my pocket, I believe not an hour and a half before, from out of my buroe: before the woman was got above four or five steps from me, I said, that woman has picked my pocket, a waterman laid hold on her as she was turning into a little alehouse, he turned her cloak on one side, there I saw my handkerchief, he took it from her and gave it to me; she began crying, I don't recollect any thing she said; the watermen were for ducking her.
Prisoner's defence.
I was going by water, I thought I'd have half a pint of beer, as I was going into an alehouse I picked the handkerchief up, I never found any thing before in my life.
Q. to the prosecutor. Did you see her stoop to pick any thing up?
Prosecutor. I did not see her, and I had my eye upon her all the while.




               Guilty, 6 d.

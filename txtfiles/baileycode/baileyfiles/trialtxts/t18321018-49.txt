, and am a shoemaker
. On the afternoon of the 15th of September the prisoner came to my shop, about one o'clock, and asked for a pair of shoes; he was fitted with a pair by my young man - he left 6d. deposit, saying he would call at night and take them; he returned, and said his father wished him to have a pair of a higher price, and while he tried on another pair he took three pairs of shoes, and put them into his basket - I was informed of it, and he was asked what he had got in his baket; he said he was only a poor glazier's boy, and had got nothing; we found the three pairs of shoes in in it, which are mine.

EDWARD HERBERT. I am a labouring man
. I live in George-alley, Field-lane


. The prisoner lived with me about three months. On the 20th of June the prisoner went to my wife for the key. He said, he wanted something of his; instead of that he took nine shillings, a pair of breeches, a pair of stockings, and a shirt. He left the lodging for about a fortnight, and then I found him with the things on his carcase. I took him up.
MRS. HERBERT. The prisoner came to me at the Market. He asked me for the key. I gave him the key. He left his lodgings for a fortnight.
- COOK. I am an officer. I saw the clothes on his back. He went to the jail in the clothes. I cannot find them now.
Prisoner's Defence. I bought the breeches of the prosecutor; I gave him sixpence for them, and the stockings he gave me. I drank a pint of porter with the prosecutor. He rifled my pocket with force. A gentleman passing liberated me. He has been twice to Newgate, and agreed to compound felony for twelve shillings.

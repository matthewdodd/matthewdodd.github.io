James Sadd.






WILLIAM HOPKINS
. I keep the Three Johns public-house, in White Lion-street, Pentonville. These four pewter pots are mine, and have my Dine on them—one of them I saw on the premises on Wednesday, the 28th of March, and the rest I had seen in the beginning of that week.





JAMES SADD
. I keep the Penton Arms, in Baron-street, about fifty yards from Hopkins's—this pint pot is mine—I do not know when I lost it—I have been in the house three years, and it may be the first I ever lost THOMAS HOBBS KINO (police-constable N 22.) I saw the three prisoners together, walking along High-street Islington, about half-past eight o'clock on the night of the 28th of March—I apprehended them, and found two pint pots and a measure in White's pocket, and this pint pot, belonging to Mr. Hopkins, in his hat—some were between his shirt and skin one on each side his breast—my brother-constable brought West and Chapman into the station-house—I found three pots on each of them belonging to other publicans not mentioned in this indictment—I stopped them about two or three hundred yards from Mr. Sadd's house, and nearly a quarter of a mile from where the other publicans, claiming the other pots, lived—when the; saw me making towards them, the two women ran away.

White's Defence. A man asked me to hold the things—he was longer away than I expected before he returned, and I concealed them about me.

Chapman's Defence, The property found on me was given me by a stranger.

WHITE—

. Aged 22.—


Transported for Seven Years.

CHAPMAN and WEST—


NOT GUILTY

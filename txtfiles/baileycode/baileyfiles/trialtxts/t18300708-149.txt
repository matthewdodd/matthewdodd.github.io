            . I am a clerk
 in the Excise. On the 29th of May I was on Tower-hill


, about eleven o'clock in the morning; I felt my handkerchief taken from my pocket; I turned quickly, and saw the prisoner trying to conceal it - he had not got it all in his hand; he put his hand behind him, but the corner blew out - I saw it; it had been removed from my pocket.

Prisoner's Defence. I took a walk on Tower-hill - the gentleman accused me of this, and pushed me into a shop; I said I had not the handkerchief - he saw it in another man's hand, and let him go about his business; I never had it.

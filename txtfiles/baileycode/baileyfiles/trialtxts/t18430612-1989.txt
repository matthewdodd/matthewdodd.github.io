CHARLES JOHNSON
. I am a shoemaker, and live in Palmers-row. About half-past eight o'clock on Monday morning, the 15th of June, my girl beckoned to me—I went out—she ran out of the shop, and brought in Williams—she said, "This is the boy that stole the boots"—he said, "It is not me, it is the other"—Kent was running off—I held Williams, and called "Stop thief"—one of the boots were at Williams's feet when he was stopped—the policeman brought Kent and the other boot—these are my boots.





EMMA HOLBORN
. I am the prosecutor's servant. I saw the prisoners standing at the window—I am sure these are the two—Williams unhung the boots from the door—I got up, and beckoned my master out—I ran to the door and caught Williams—Kent received the boots from Williams, and ran away—one of them was dropped at Williams's feet—Kent was brought back.

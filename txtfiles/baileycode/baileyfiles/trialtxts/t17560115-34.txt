                  Burr 
               



            . I lost the goods mentioned in the indictment.
Q. Why do you charge the prisoner?
Burr. Because he owned the fact.
Q. In what words did he own it?
Burr. He said the last thing he stole was the rug and bolster, and that he design'd to come next for the bed.
Q. Where did he make this confession?
Burr. This he made before Sir Samuel Gower; and said that he stole them at divers times, and that he sent them by a woman, who sold some of them for him.
Q. Did he own which way he got into your house?
Burr. He said he came in backwards, as we were forwards, about six in the evening, at the back door.
Q. Was the door-fastened ?
Burr. It was. There was a bolt upon it, which was bolted on the inside.
Q. Can you swear the door was bolted before 6 o'clock that evening?
Burr. I can, and will, swear it safely.
Q. Have you got any of your goods again?
Burr. Some of them are in court. We found some of them again by his direction. We have all but one sheet and bolster.
Produced in court and deposed to.
Prisoner. He says the door was bolted, but it was not, when I went in.

            . A woman was going by my door with this rug to sell. I challenged her with it, and stop'd her, knowing the rug. I had lay'd it on the prosecutor's bed several times. After that the woman brought the prisoner, and told us where the rest of the things were.
Q. Where is she?
A. Reynolds. She is now in Newgate. Her name is 
               
                  Catherine 
                  Frazier

                  Dunn 
               



            . I heard the prisoner say he conveyed himself into the prosecutor's house backwards, about 6 o'clock at night, when he took the things mentioned, and named which he took first, which the next time, and which last.
Q. Where did he own this?
B. Dunn. Before Sir 
               
                  Samuel 
                  Gower 
               



            . I would not say a wrong thing, because it is a pity; if he can say I falsify my word, let him speak it, there he is.
Prisoner. I leave it entirely to the mercy of the court.




               Guilty of felony only
            .

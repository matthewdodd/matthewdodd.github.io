Prisoner's Defence. I am not the person who took it; I was going by the Strand, a man in his shirt sleeves ran past me; the prosecutor was looking about - I took up the jacket which the man had dropped, and gave it to him; I stood ten minutes, and the officer came up and took me.(Property produced and sworn to.)

MARIA SIMPSON
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
23rd of December, 1 blanket, value 12s.; and 1 counterpane, value 7s.; the goods of 



Thomas Willocks.






MARY ANN SEAMOUR
. I live with Thomas Willocks, in Wentworth-street Whitechapel—he lets lodgings by the night. On the 23rd of December, the prisoner had a lodging there—she had lodged there before—she went away in the morning about nine o'clock—I missed a blanket and a counterpane from different rooms—not the room she had slept in—these are them—they are my master's—she paid 1s. for her lodging.





MAURICE MOLOY
. I am a police-constable. I took the prisoner—she told me to have mercy on her, and she would return the things.





JOHN UPSALL
. I am a pawnbroker. I produce the articles which were pawned by the prisoner on the 24th December.




GUILTY
. Aged 26. 


Transported for Seven Years.

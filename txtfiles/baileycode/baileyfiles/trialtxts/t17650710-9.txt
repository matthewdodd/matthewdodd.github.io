            . I live in Carey-street


; the prisoner was seen going out of my yard with a saddle. I went after him, and took him with it upon him, in Chancery-lane. It belongs to Mr. Grigg, who has a horse stands at livery at my house; but I am accountable for it, if lost.
Prisoner's Defence.
A young man desired me to carry it for him to Holborn; I took it to carry in a good natured way.

            . I am a builder. On the 7th of August my son came and told me that a man had taken a pot, and put it under his apron. I went out and saw the prisoner running in Augustus-street, Regent's-park - he jumped down the area of an unfinished house - I could not tell which, but I waited a short time - two men came up, and I beckoned to them to watch; I went into a house, where I saw him standing. I asked where the pot was; he said he knew nothing about it; I brought him out, and then he said if I would let him go, he would tell me where it was; we then went into the house, and one of the other men found the pot behind some bricks. I took him to Mr. Morrison.

            . I am the son of this witness. I saw the prisoner take the pot off the rails, and went and told my father.

            . I am a constable. I know Mr. Walter Morrison - he keeps a public-house
 in Augustus-street, Regent's-park


; this pot is marked with his name; he cannot attend - he has put his mark upon it - it is marked"W. Morrison, Regalia, Augustus-street, Regent's-park."
Prisoner's Defence. I was returning home to Water-lane, a person overtook me, and said I had a pot, but I had none.

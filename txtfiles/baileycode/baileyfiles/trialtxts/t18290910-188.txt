            . I am a journeyman butcher
, in the employ of Mr. Henry Jones, of Tottenham-court-road


. About two o'clock, on the 31st of August, I was hanging up the meat, and when I was going for the second piece, three lads came and said, "Butcher, a lad has taken a piece of beef;" I turned, and missed a piece that I had salted, out of a dish; I ran out, and saw the prisoner and two other boy
s; they ran up Percy-street, and into Rathbone-place; I turned back, went up another street into Rathbone-place, and saw the persons in Church-street; the prisoner went on to Soho-square, and to Carlisle-street; - he dropped the beef; I took it up, and took him; the two other boys had left him.

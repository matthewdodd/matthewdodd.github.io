; as I was at dinner on the 7th of March I heard something below stairs; I ordered my servant to go and see, there was the prisoner on the outside the door. She was asked what she wanted: she said she came to enquire for one Mrs. own. My servant said there is no such e, and asked what she had in her apron; prisoner said she might go look. She went my servant pursued and took her; I went out to assist, and found in the prisoner's apron a gown and a pair of shoes of my wife's; the prisoner would not part with them for some time, (produced and deposed to) they were taken from a back room up one pair of stairs.

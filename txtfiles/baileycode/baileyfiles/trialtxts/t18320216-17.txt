            . I live in Essex. On the 10th of January, about one o'clock, I was in
Cheapside


, and felt a hand at my pocket - I turned round, and saw the prisoner close at my elbow, with my handkerchief in his hand - I secured him; I dropped my umbrella, and while I did that I lost sight of my handkerchief - I kept the prisoner till the officer came; I did not take my umbrella up.

            . I am a coach-maker, and live at Chester. I saw the prisoner and another boy
 escaping out of a crowd at the end of Wood-street; I saw the other boy draw the handkerchief - I suppose he took it from the prisoner's hand; I did not see it taken from the prosecutor; the prisoner was in the prosecutor's hands, trying to get from him, when the other went off with the handkerchief.

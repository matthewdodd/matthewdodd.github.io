JOHN M'DOUGALL
. I am in the service of Eliza Drury, a hair-dresser, in Southampton-row, Bloomsbury. On the 8th of May, about half-past nine o'clock Douglass came in and asked for a half penny worth of hair pins—he was not in the shop a minute—I had had two razor-strops there, and missed them in about three minutes—I had not seen Johnson at alt—I ran out into Great Ormond-street—I there caught sight of Douglass again, and Johnson was in his company—I followed and watched them, and gave

information to the policeman, who took them as they were looking into a silversmith's shop in Lamb's Conduit-street—these two strops were found on Johnson, and are what had been on our counter.





JAMES SHEEN
. I am a policeman. I took the prisoners, and found these strops on Johnson—he abused roe, but did not say any thing about them.

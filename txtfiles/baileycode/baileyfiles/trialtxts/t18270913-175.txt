            . I am a warehouse-keeper
, and live in St. John-street, Smithfield. I lost two odd shoes on the 2d of August; the officers brought them back to me, and the two prisoners. I had seen them in my shop window about an hour before.

            . I am an officer. I was going to work, and saw the prisoners lurking about Mr. Pearcy's shop window; I saw Clarke go into the shop and return in about half a minute, with something under his coat - Gillmore then went into the shop, but came out again directly, and they went away together; I went up to them and found these two shoes (which I produce,) on Clarke.
GILLMORE's Defence. As I was going along I met this lad, he saw these two shoes lying at the door, and took them.
CLARKE's Defence. I saw these shoes near the door, and I said to Gillmore, "Shall I take these up, and give to the beadle?" he said "Yes. if you like." I took them.

            . Aged 16.
CLARKE - 

               GUILTY

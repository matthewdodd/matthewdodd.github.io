            . I live in Gutter-lane


.
Q. Did you miss any silver?
Cafe. No, I did not; I cannot say he stole it; but, by his own confession, when brought before me, he then owned that he had rob'd me of some pieces of silver that weigh 12 ounces; for which he asked my pardon, and beg'd forgiveness: afterwards he said he took it out of the dirt in the cellar.

            . I live with Mr. Cafe, I know nothing of the prisoner's taking the silver; but, by his own confession, he said he took it out of the wind-hole; that is a place where we melt our silver; he had been our porter.
Mr. Stowers. I sell silver buckles and other things. The prisoner came to my shop, to sell some melted silver in a lump; I asked him where he lived? he said with the duke of Bedford; I asked him, how he came by this silver? he said, he was one of the watchmen, and he found it in sifting the cinders: I asked him, why he did not acquaint the steward with it? he said he told the men in the garden of it, but they did not know of such a thing: I bid him leave it till the afternoon, and then I would let him know the value of it; he came accordingly, I gave him 7 s. for it: he proposed to bring me more, saying, he believed there was more in the dirt. On the Tuesday following he brought two ounces more; I desired him to leave it, and I would weigh it; I bid him call again in the afternoon. When he was gone, I went to justice Welch, and we went to the duke of Bedford's; the steward said, he did not know such a man. The prisoner came the next morning to my shop, and then we stopt him I search'd his pocket, and found a letter in it directed to him at Mr. Cafe's, in Gutter-lane: he deliver'd me the key of his box, and said it was at the brown bear; there I went, and found 8 ounces more. There is in the whole 12 ounces 4 penny weight of it. (The silver produced in court.)
Prisoner's defence.
I pick'd it out of the ashes in the cellar, I thought it was pewter hardened, or dross.
To his character.

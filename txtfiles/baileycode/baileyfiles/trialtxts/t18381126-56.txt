EUNICE BATTCOCK
. I am the wife of Charles Battcock, and live in Montague-place, Cox-court, Little-Britain. The prisoner came to lodge at my house on the 4th of October—on the morning of the 5th of November, I went into his room, and missed all the articles stated—some of them are here now—they are the things that were then missing, and what I let him with the lodgings.

Prisoner, Q. Why did you wish to buy the candlesticks of me on Saturday morning? A. I did not do so.

Prisoner. I brought them all out of the country. Witness. I can take my oath that they are all mine—the pillow-cases are marked.





HANNAH PEARSON
. I live in Monkwell-street, and am a monthly nurse to the prosecutrix. All these things are the prosecutrix's—I have had them in my hand at times for these two years.





EDWARD SCHOFIELD
. I live in Montague-place. At half-past six or seven o'clock on the morning of the 5th of November, I saw the prisoner run down Montague-place—I ran and stopped him—he had two bundles—he threw one away, and had one in his hand when I took him—these are the things that were in the bundles.

Prisoner's Defence. There were one or two after me, and being a country young man, I was frightened, and dropped them-if I could have brought the carrier that brought the things to London, I would.




GUILTY
. Aged 39.—


Transported for Seven Years.

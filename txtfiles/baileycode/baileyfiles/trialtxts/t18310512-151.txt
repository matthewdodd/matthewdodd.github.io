. I was behind the counter on the 9th of April - I saw the shadow of some person; I came round and saw the prisoner in the act of putting this gown into her apron - I took her with it; I had seen it safe two minutes before.
Prisoner. I did not take it down - I met my sister; we were both at the door, and my sister took this gown and looked at it; when she saw him coming, she threw it on my arm and ran away; he came and took me. Witness. There was another person at the door, who got away.

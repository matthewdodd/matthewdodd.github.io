            . I am a grocer
, and live at Rumford. On the 25th of May, about one o'clock, I went to Mr. White's oil-shop, Aldgate, High-street


, leaving my coat on the cart at the door. Having lost a coat twice before, I kept my eye on the cart, and saw the prisoner and another man; the other man took the coat out of the cart and gave it to the prisoner - he pulled at it twice before he got it. I ran out and secured the prisoner with it on his arm - I gave him in charge.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

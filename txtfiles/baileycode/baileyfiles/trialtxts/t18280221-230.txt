            . I am in the employ of Thomas Nicholls, a pawnbroker
, of Gray's Inn-lane


. This handkerchief was pinned inside the shop door, with about half a dozen others; a person must have put his arm inside the door, but he need not step into the shop; I had seen the prisoner there about five minutes before - I did not see him take it; Bennett pointed out a man to me - I jumped over the counter; I went out after him, but could not see the prisoner till he was at Hatton-garden, about half an hour afterwards; there was a ticket on it, of the price for sale; that had been taken off it.

            . I am a labourer. About a quarter or twenty minutes before one o'clock, I saw the prisoner put his hand into the shop - he took a handkerchief, and put it into the flap of his trousers; I gave information of it at the shop directly; I pursued, and never lost sight of him; I am quite sure I took the same man, and took him to Hatton-garden. When I collared him he threw the handkerchief down - the officer picked it up.

            . I had just come out of the office in Hatton-garden; Bennett had hold of the prisoner, I saw him throw the handkerchief from him, and I picked it up.(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I deny all knowledge of the robbery; I never saw the handkerchief before.

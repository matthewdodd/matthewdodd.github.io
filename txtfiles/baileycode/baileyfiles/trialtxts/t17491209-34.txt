            . I am a victualler

, I live at the Highlander by Wapping-Dock



. I lost these things mentioned in the indictment the 15th of June. The watchman called me out of my bed, saying my door was open, I found it so, and the sash up, the bar door open, and the bar broke; I shut the window shutters about 10 o'clock the night before, and made all fast; these things were taken out of the bar, I saw them at the time I shut up the house to go to bed. I went to Goldsmith's-Hall, and got papers sent round in the trade, and also had the goods advertised; the Prisoner was taken up and carry'd before Sir 
               
                  Samuel 
                  Gore 
               



            , where he confessed every thing, telling how he took them, that he handed down 2 tankards with a string from the dining-room window, and that he carry'd another tankard and a soop spoon out at the door, and gave most of the silver to the watchman, and the watchman desired him to make the best of his way off.

            . I was charged by the constable to aid and assist with the Prisoner. About five weeks ago, we took him before Sir 
               
                  Samuel 
                  Gore 
               



            , and heard him confess as before mentioned, and that he let down these two tankards to a Moses, a Jew.

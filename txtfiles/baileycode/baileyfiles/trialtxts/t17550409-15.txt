                  Bennet 
               



            . I live with a linen-draper, named Marc, in St. Martin's court


; I lost all the goods mentioned in the indictment; I missed them on the 12th of March, and got a search-warrant from justice Cox on the 13th, and found them in the prisoner's box.
Q. What was he?


                  Sarah 
                  Bennet 
               



            . He is a silversmith
, and lodged in the house.

Q. What said the prisoner?


                  Sarah 
                  Bennet 
               



            . Very little besides this, he owned it, and seemed a good deal confounded; he was taken before justice Cox, and there he owned he took them.
Q. How came he to have an opportunity to take these things?


                  Sarah 
                  Bennet 
               



            . The box, in which they were, stood in a room adjoining to his, and the room door not locked?
Q. Was the box locked?


                  Sarah 
                  Bennet 
               



            . To my knowledge I never left it unlocked?
Prisoner. My lord, I had them in my box three weeks before she missed them.
Prosecutrix. I had not looked in the box, as I remember, for a month before. (The goods produced in court and deposed to.)


                  Mary 
                  Milestone 
               



            . I was going that way and called upon Mrs. Bennet to ask her how she did, she desired me to go to the justice's with her; I did, and heard him confess he took the things, both in her room at home, and also before the justice.

                  Higgins 
               



            . I am constable; on the 13th of March I was sent for to Mr. Mare's in St. Martin's-court, he gave me a search-warrant to search all the people's boxes that lodged in the house; when I came to search the prisoner's box, I found this parcel of things here produced. The prosecutrix said it was her bundle, and he was very much confused, nor can I tell what answers he made just then, he confessed before he went out of the room that he had taken the things, and he said the same before the justice; he had carried away the silk petticoat to another house, he said, at his being asked for it, he would fetch it, so I went with him into Market-lane, there we found it, and I brought it back.
Prisoner's defence.
A woman was in my room with these things in her apron; she desired I would let her lay them down on my box, and she would come up to me soon again; she laid them down; I staid an hour and half, but she did not come; then I took and locked them up in my box, and left the key in it; this was about three weeks before they were missed.

            . I live in Little Queen-street, Edgware-road


. The prisoner had been my servant
 about three months; between four and five o'clock in the morning of the 4th of January she left, and we missed these articles; in consequence of information, about three weeks after, we went to No. 64, South Molton-street, and the prisoner came to the door with my wife's gown on; I left her in charge - the night before she left us, my wife found herin bed with some person; she ran up to me, but when I got there, the person was gone; I went round the house at one o'clock, and there was no person there but the prisoner, who was asleep, and between four and five she came to our room for a light.

             (Police-constable D 9.) I went to No. 64, South Molton-street; the prisoner opened the door - the prosecutor said he wanted to speak to her; she made no answer; we went into the passage, and then took her up stairs, and the mistress claimed a shawl, a gown, and a cap, which she had on; Mr. Chard lost some money and a reticule - this is the shawl; the prisoner tore up a gown of her own before me and the prosecutor.

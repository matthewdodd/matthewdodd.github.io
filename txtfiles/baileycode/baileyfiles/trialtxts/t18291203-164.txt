BENJAMIN WILLIAMS. I am a pensioner
. I was at the Snow Shoes public-house, at Chelsea


, on the 16th of November - I had the articles stated in the indictment there, and missed them about half-past seven o'clock in the morning; I slept there that night, and left them in a back parlour - they were missing when I got up; I saw the prisoner there the day before, but he was gone that morning; these are my property.
WILLIAM NORMAN. On the morning of the 16th of November, I went to the Snow Shoes, about ten o'clock, and the prisoner was brought in by Trays.
JOHN TRAYS. I met the prisoner in the Old Kent-road, with these articles; he said they were given him at that house, and I took him there - he was five miles from there when I saw him.
Prisoner's Defence. I had them given to me by Tyler, an invalid; I had been robbed of my prize-money for the storming and caption of Bhurtpoor - I spoke to the landlord about it, and Tyler said he would make up half a sovereign; he kept me a long time, then brought out this bundle, and gave it me; I belong to the 59th regiment, which is now at Weedon.
WILLIAM NORMAN. Tyler was taken, but he denied it.

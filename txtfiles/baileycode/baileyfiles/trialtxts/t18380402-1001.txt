EDWARD PEACOCK
. I live in Adam-street, East, and am a grocet The prisoners lodged in my house from November—the apartments were furnished—on the morning of the 16th of March, I went to their room—I observed the bed was open, and the prisoners in the act of removing fea there—I looked round, and all the bed clothes were gone—the blanking sheets, pillows, and bolster—I said, "What! are you robbing me?"—they said, "Oh no, we met with an accident and burnt the bed"—the other things are here.





GEORGE SPELLER
. I live with Mr. Walter, a pawnbroker, in High-street, Marylebone. I have a blanket pawned on the 21st of December—I cannot say by whom, but two of these articles the woman pawned—I have seven in all, sheets and other things.





CHARLOTTE PEACOCK
. I am the prosecutor's wife. These blankets sheets, bolster, and other things, are my husband's property.





HENRY WILLIAMS
 (police-constable D 51.) I went to the room, and asked the female for the duplicates of these things—she gave me a bag with twenty-seven duplicates, seven of which relate to these things.

Samuel Fletcher's Defence. I have been brought up for gentlemen's service, but had no work since Christmas—we have been for day together without food or firing, which caused my wife in an evil hour to pawn my landlord's things—we applied to the parish, but got no relief—the blankets was pawned for 4s., to pay our week's rent.

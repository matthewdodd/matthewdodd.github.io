WILLIAM EDWARDS
 was indicted

 for a misdemeanor.






VALENTINE SMITH
. I am a grocer and tea-dealer, and lire at No. 53, Aldersgate-street. I had known the prisoner by coming to my shop for goods for his master, Mr. Cook—on the 16th of February he came—he said he came from his master for 61bs. of black tea, 61bs. of green, and 7lbs., of coffee, the same as the last—he said he had not brought an order, but he supposed it would not signify—I said it would not—he asked for an invoice—I said I could not send the invoice then, as there had been a varriastion in the prices, and I would see Mr. Cook—I let him hare the articles under the impression that he came from Mr. Cook—I discovered the next morning that it was wrong.

Prisoner. I did not mention Mr. Cook's name at all. Witness. Yes, you mentioned it three or four times, and said you came from your matter.





JOHN HENRY COOK
. I am a dry-salter. I deal with this witness—the prisoner had been in my service, but left me on the 14th of February—he was not in my service on the 16th of February, and I did not send him for any property whatever—he has got goods from various other places.




GUILTY
. Aged 21.—


Transported for Seven Years.

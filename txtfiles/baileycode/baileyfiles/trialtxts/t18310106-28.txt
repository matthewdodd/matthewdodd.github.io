            . I am the wife of John Mulranel - he is in the first battalion of guards
; we live in Gray's-buildings


. On the 21st of December I saw the prisoner in Oxford-street - she asked how I was and after my husband, and then asked about Mrs. Young; I said she lodged with me - she then went to my house, and breakfasted with Mrs. Young and me; before breakfast I took off my shoes, and put them by the side of the bed - the prisoner went up by the bed-side, and said she was making very free; when she was gone I missed my shoes, and found them again at the pawnbroker's - he told me to go and get 3s., and I should have them; I did so.

            . I am a pawnbroker, and live at No. 12, Gilbert-street, Hanover-square. On the 21st of December the prisoner pawned the pair of shoes for 3s., which the prosecutrix came and claimed - I had known the prisoner for four years before.

            . These shoes are my wife's - I required the pawnbroker to return the money, but he made a difficulty about it.

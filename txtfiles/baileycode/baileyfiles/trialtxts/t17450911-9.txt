             . The Prisoner went into my room, looked under my bed, and took my watch out of a box, and he has engaged it to a pawnbroker for five shillings at the Cross Keys, the corner of the Coal Yard in Holborn.

            , a Silversmith.
Q. What have you to say against the Prisoner?
Dare. I have nothing to say against him; I do not know the Prisoner no more than the Pope ; the Prisoner said I bought a chain of him, but I do not know that I did.

            . (a servant to the keeper of Clerkenwell Bridewell ) The Prisoner was at first committed for correction, but when he was charged with this, he owned he had pawned the watch for five shillings, and owned he sold the chain to Mr. Dare, for three shillings.
Prisoner. There was something pushed under the bed, and I found it to be the watch, but who put it there, I cannot tell: and as I was going along the watch kicked against my foot upon the floor, and there was a bruise which I made in it having a new pair of shoes on.

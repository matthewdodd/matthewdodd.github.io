HENRY HUBERT
. I am a warehouseman, in Wood-street, Cheapside, On the 22nd of June, about ten o'clock at night, I was going down Fleet-street—I missed my handkerchief, turned round, and saw it in the hands of the witness Baker, and the prisoner in charge of a policeman—I did not feel it taken—I had not used it since about half-past seven or eight o'clock, when I left Wood-street—this now produced is it.





GEORGE BAKER
. I live in Fleur-de-lis-court, Fleet-street; I was in the police, but am now a constable under the Commissioners of Sewers, On the evening of the 22nd of June I saw a cab-horse down in Fleet-street—I saw the prosecutor, and saw the prisoner and another cross from the left-hand side of the way to the right—I saw the prisoner lift the prosecutor's pocket with his left-hand, and take the handkerchief out with his right—I immediately collared him, gave him into custody to the officer, and picked the handkerchief up.





JEREMIAH BARNES
. I am a City police-constable. The prisoner was given to me with the handkerchief.

Prisoner's Defence. I was coming from my aunt's, and met a lad who I asked the nearest way to Cheapside; as we were coming down Fleet-street a horse had fallen, and there was a mob; all at once the lad left me, and I was charged with this; I did not touch the handkerchief.

            . I live in Fleet-street; as I was coming down Fleet-street


 on the 21st of June, between two and three in the morning. from the Queen's-Head tavern in Holborn, where I had been spending the evening with my attorney; just at the end of Vine-Office-Court, near where I live, I met with the prisoner Wright; he accosted me with, Holo, Brother! I said brother. What said he, are you a brother? then tip us your Manus, upon which I gave him my hand; upon giving two or three hearty shakes he declared I was no Mason; I said I was very sure he was none; said he, if I am not, here is a brother a coming, a friend of mine, he shall examine you; then Foulder came up; Wright said, here is a man pretends to be a Mason, I wish you would examine him; he said I was a rascal for pretending to be one, and began to abuse me for pretending to be what I was not, and gave me a deal of foul language, and from words proceeded to blows; he struck me I believe three or four times; I told him then I was in my own neighbourhood, and I would charge the watch with them, but unluckily my watchman was off his watch; they kept ill using me; I said I am arm'd with a pistol in my pocket; I pulled it out; Foulder seized it immediately, then Hicks and Cooper came up (all strangers to me) they all four got round me, and I think Foulder wrench'd the pistol from me; then they began to accuse me with being a highwayman or street-robber, and carried me to the watch-house at St. Dunstan's; when we came there, I gave charge of them, and they of me, and we went all to the Compter together; the next morning we went all before Sir 
               
                  Matthew 
                  Blackiston 
               



            , the sitting alderman, (I did not miss my pocket-book till I was in the Compter) I am very sure I had it in my pocket when I met with them; I had been settling my affairs with my attorney; in my book were these notes and bond; I told Sir 
               
                  Matthew 
                  I 
               



             missed my pocket-book, and begg'd he would have them searched; then the prisoner Wright fumbled in his breeches, and pulled out my handkerchief, and said, here is your handkerchief; then he pulled out my pocketbook, and delivered them to me; I had told them in the Compter it could be of no value to them, and offered two guineas for it, it being all among my friends, I knew I could stop payment when I pleased; they all said they knew nothing of it, and wondered how I could charge them; the book was sealed up before Sir Matthew, and never opened till I came to draw the bill of indictment up, and that in the presence of evidences here. (The book produced, a bond taken out, dated June 19, 1761, for 400 l. A note, dated June 27, 1761, for 128 l. Another, Sept. 24, 1762, for 25 l. Another for 247 l. Another, July 26, 1761, for 20 l. Another, Aug. 15, 1761, for 10 l.) These were all in the book when taken from my pocket.

            , son of 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Wybourn 
               



             deceased, looks at the notes, and certifies which are the hand-writing of his late father, his mother, and his brother, being well acquainted with their hand-writing.


                  Nathaniel 
                  Allen 
               



             looks at a note, and declares the signing his own hand-writing.
Q. to prosecutor. Were any questions asked how Wright came by the pocket book?
Prosecutor. He began begging mercy, I don't know he made me any positive answer how he took it; the others all declared they knew nothing of it, and I think Wright himself said the same, that he himself took it. Sir Matthew committed two to the Compter, and him to Newgate.


                  Nathaniel 
                  Allen 
               



            , brother to the prosecutor, 
               
                  John 
                  Kirby 
               



            , keeper of the Compter, and 
               
                  John 
                  Bignall 
               



            , all deposed to the seeing Wright pull the handkerchief and pocket-book out of his breeches, before Sir 
               
                  Matthew 
                  Blackiston 
               



            .
Wright in his defence said, Mr. Allen was excessively in liquor, and went to bed in the Compter, after which he found the pocket-book and silk handkerchief in his own pocket, but was not sensible which way they came there, and that he never was asked for the book till he came to Guildhall, and then he gave it to him.
Q. to prosecutor. Was you in liquor?
Prosecutor. I was a little merry, but very far from being drunk; I was sober enough to know all that passed.
For Wright.

            . I have known Wright about 18 years; he was apprentice to a merchant at Boston in Lincolnshire; he has been in London about 7 or 8 years, and lived as a gentleman's footman; I believe he has been out of place about two months; I looked upon him to be a very honest, sober, industrious young man.

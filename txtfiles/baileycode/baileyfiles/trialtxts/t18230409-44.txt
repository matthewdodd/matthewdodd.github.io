                  EDMUNDS
               



            . I live at Ambleside, Westmorland. Icame to town in December, 1821, with my son, who was going to China. On the 17th of December we both slept at the Dundee Arms, Wapping


, in a double beded room. We went to bed a little past eleven; I had these notes and bills in my pocket book, and in my purse was twenty-four sovereigns and a half guinea. I did not lock my room door. I have the numbers and dates of all the notes. When I went to bed my pocket book was in one trowser pocket and my purse in the other; when I awoke, about seven o'clock in the morning, my trowsers were on the floor, close to the chair; I believe I had put them on the chair; I was not disturbed in the night. I had received the 10 l. notes at the Bank a few days before, and at that time took the numbers and dates; they were all dated the 5th of November, 1821, and numbered from 6117 to 6131, both inclusive. I know nothing of the prisoner.
Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. You cannot say where you left your trowsers - A. I generally leave them on the chair; I have no doubt but I did so then. The people of the house told me there was no visitor but us, and so I did not lock the door.


                  EDWARD 
                  BEAL
               



            . In December, 1821, I was waiter at the Dundee Arms. Mr. Edwards and his son came there. I saw the prisoner there that evening with another person named Durley, alias Smith; they came together, and both slept there in one room on the third floor. They went to bed between nine and ten o'clock, and left about seven next morning. They had blue trowsers and Wellington boots on when they went away, very muddy, and would not wait to have them cleaned. The prosecutor slept on the second floor.
Cross-examined. Q. Your house is for the reception of travellers - A. Yes; many leave early in the morning; it depends on what time a vessel starts.

            . I am a carpenter, and live in the London-terrace, Commercial-road. In December, 1821, the prisoner lived at No. 12, Albion-street, Commercial-road, and one Durley, who also went by the name of Smith, lodged with him. On the morning after the robbery, I saw them both at 
               
                  Alexander 
                  Logie
               



            's house, No. 11, Samuel-street - they both wore blue trowsers and fustian shooting jackets. I missed them from the neighbourhood two or three days after, and did not see them for nine months, when I saw the prisoner taken. I saw them in Samuel-street the day after the robbery - they had a great deal of money. I never knew the prisoner follow any business.
Cross-examined. Q. I suppose you do not know whether he has any rich relations - A. I understand he has. He shewed me the sovereigns, and said he had done it, and could do it again, and almost pointed out the house where he did the robbery. He said there was a board sticking up to tell where he had done the robbery.
Q. When did you do your last work - A. On Saturday; I worked for Mr. Christian. When I knew him, he lodged at my brother's house, which is the way I knew him. I never saw him with much cash before.

            . I am a bricklayer, and live in Chapman-street. In December, 1821, I saw the prisoner at a public-house, on the evening after the robbery, on the day of the fight at Moulsey-hurst, shewing sovereigns and silver in both hands; he said he had done it, and could do it again - he was at the same house the next night, and had a hunting watch, which he said he had bought. I did not see him again till the 31st of December 1822, - I then went to the police, and had him apprehended.


                  ALEXANDER 
                  LOGIE
               



            . I live in Catherine-street, Commercial-road. On the 18th of December, 1821, I went to Moulsey-hurst - the prisoner was one of the party, and Moriatt also. I saw Durley alias Smith there; he and the prisoner were dressed in Wellington boots, blue trowsers, and fustian shooting jackets, and new silk hats. The prisoner and Durley paid all the expences of the trip between them. Warren, the Excise-officer, is my brother-in-law; the prisoner bought a new silver hunting watch of him, on the 19th of December, 1821. The prisoner, I, and the party at the fight, had agreed to meet next morning, at the Star, public-house, and they came to us again in the evening, at the Roe-buck, public-house, Commercial-road, and we were to meet them next morning in Albion-street - we went there, but did not see them. A woman at the door said, the officers were in the house, and we had better go. I met the prisoner that day, and asked how long he had been from No. 12, Albion-street; he said not long - I said,
"Have you not had some curious visitors there this morning," he said, No. I said if he had done anything he had better not go there again - he swore at me, and went away towards Albion-street, and in ten minutes after he came running to me, and begged of me to run with him; we both run to a public-house, at the back of the London Hospital, and had some refreshments; he said it would not be proper for him to be seen in Albion-street again, and begged I would not betray him - I said I would not. I saw him next day at Hackney. The last time I saw him was the 1st or 2d of January, 1822, and from that time not till eight months after.

On the 18th of December, 1821, a person who called himself Durley (when he was apprehended) bought two shooting jackets of me, and paid for them - I had none, and got them both from Mr. Early, who lives near me. Durley presented the 10 l. note in payment, which I gave Early - I was to take 2 l. I asked his name and address, and indorsed it with what he told me. The jackets were a fourth and fifth size. Durley was afterwards apprehended with one of them on. (Looking at a 10 l. note;) this is it, here is
"Jones, James-street, Commercial-road," which is the address he gave me.
Cross-examined. Q. You was once tried here - A. Yes, seven years ago, and afterwards at Clerkenwell, and acquitted both times.

On the 20th of December, 1821, I went to No. 12, Albion-street, Commercial-road, and saw a girl there - I asked for Bob and George; she said they were out. I searched the rooms, and found a blue surtout coat. I know Durley, I saw him at the office six months after the robbery, dressed in this shooting jacket, which was taken from him, (producing it) - he has been tried since.

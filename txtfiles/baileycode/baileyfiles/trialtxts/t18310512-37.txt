JOHN HOLMES. I was in Dean-street, Soho


 - between four and five o'clock on the 14th of April, I missed my handkerchief, turned, and saw the prisoner close behind me; I collared him, and found my handkerchief between his coat and waistcoat; I took him myself to the station.
Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Were there many people passing and repassing? A. Yes, but the street was not thronged; I felt my coat move, and then missed it - the prisoner was twenty or thirty yards from me; it was a yellow handkerchief, with red spots - I do not know whether it has any mark; I took it from the prisoner, and gave it to the officer - it is by no means a common handkerchief.
JAMES WALSH. I am an officer. I received this handkerchief from the prosecutor, and have had it ever since.
Prisoner's Defence. I was walking up Dean-street, and saw the prosecutor pass; there were two young lads on before me - I do not know who dropped the handkerchief, but I found it at my feet, and the prosecutor took me.

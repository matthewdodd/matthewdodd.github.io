PETER REITZ
 (through an interpreter). I am a tailor, of Great Russell-street. On 1st Aug. I went to a house with the prisoner—she asked what time it was—I took out my watch and shewed it her—in about two minutes she took it and went away—there was no one there but her—I am sure she is the woman.





CATHERINE FERGEUE
. I was in a public-house drinking—the prisoner offered me something yellow—I would not accept of it.





SARAH FREEMAN
. I saw the prisoner offer her something—she would not take it, but told her to go and give it to the man—the prisoner offered me something yellow—I told her I would not take it—I did not know how she got it, nor what it was.





JAMES EVES
 (police-sergeant, H 14). I produce a certificate of the prisoner's conviction—(read—Convicted May, 1846—confined three months)—she is the person—she has been in custody since then.

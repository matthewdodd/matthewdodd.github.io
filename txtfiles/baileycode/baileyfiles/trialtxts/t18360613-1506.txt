 and 




WILLIAM MARSDEN
 were indicted for

 stealing, on the 
10th of June, 11 fowls, value 1l. 13s., the goods of 




Joseph West; and 1 duck, value 2s. 6d., the goods of 




John Watts.






JOSEPH PIGGOTT
, I am servant to Joseph West, a grocer in Shoreditch. He keeps fowls in a yard at the back of Webb-square, in a in a fowl-house—on the 10th of June he had fourteen fowls there—the policeman alarmed me about twelve o'clock at night, and I went with him to the fowl-house—we found the door open, and the two prisoners in the fowl-house—about eleven fowls laid dead, strewed about the place—we picked up two in a bag outside the door next morning, and nine we found dead in the roost—I cannot say whether the bag was my master's or not—I found a dead duck thrown into an empty cask in the yard—that did not belong to master—we found the lock of the outer door of the fowl-house laying at the door, and the staple of the inner door was drawn—we secured the prisoners—I can swear to the two fowls in the bag, as well as the rest—we found three alive outside in the morning.





THOMAS BESLEE
. I went with Piggott, and have heard the account he gives of finding the fowls—it is correct—I have the locks of the outer

and inner doors, which I found on the prisoners, and this piece of liver I found on Marsden, which is used to quiet a dog, and keep it from barking.





JOHN WATTS
. I am a sailor, and live in Swan-yard, Shoreditch. On the 10th of June, I had two ducks and some fowls—they were safe at ten o'clock at night—the duck found on Mr. West's premises, I have every reason to believe is mine—I had no particular mark on it.
(The prisoners received a good character.)

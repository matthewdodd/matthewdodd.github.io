, he had lost a lac'd hat, and other things, from the places where they hung in the hall, the door always standing open in the day time, and to detect the thief, if they came again, he hung up his hat, and put a large piece of coal upon it, so as upon removing the hat it should fall, and give the alarm; he hearing it fall ran out, was informed a woman was gone in at the Cock and Lyon, the next door, he went in, and found the prisoner with the hat put behind her, upon charging her she confessed she did take it.

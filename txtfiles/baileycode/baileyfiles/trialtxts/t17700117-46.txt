. The prisoner came on the 15th of August, about eleven in the forenoon; he had a green jacket on, lined with white; a white pair of stockings; and looked like a seafaring man. He asked me if my name was Wescott. I said, yes. He asked, if I had never a relation abroad. I said, I had an own uncle, my father's own brother, at Philadelphia. He asked when I heard from him. I said he had been abroad before I was born, but my father used to receive letters from him. He said, there was a young man on board his ship would be glad to see me; and it would be to my advantage. I took him into a little room, and said, if you are that person let me know, for I do not chuse to go without any hesitation. Then he took me by the hand, and said, I am the identical person, and my name is

            , of Philadelphia; and that he had a brother kept a punch-house at Jamaica; and that he came in the London Indiaman that lay at Woolwich. He said he had another brother also. He said he had been in a fray at Blackfriars, and had lost his coat the night before; and that he had lodged some things in Newgate-street, and he was going to a shipmate in Whitechapel for some money. I said he had no occasion for that, (I looked upon him to be my cousin) I would lend him a little. He wanted a bag. I lent him one, and a five-and-three-pence. He said he would make my wife a present of a silk gown. I went along with him to fetch the things. I carried the bag till we got to Newgate-street, then he took it. He ordered me to wait at a public-house, for him. My wife went to Newgate-market and bought something for supper. He would not eat off any body's plate but his dear cousin's. He said if his father in America knew he was at his dear cousin's, he would get drunk for joy. My dear cousin did not come back to eat with me. I never saw him till the 23d of December: then another cousin had him in hold in the street for serving him so. Then I charged him. He told me he never saw me before. I went on board the Indiaman. They told me there was no such man on board.
Prisoner's Defence.
I was drinking in a public house. They were talking about Philadelphia and New-York. I said I knew one of the name. They would persuade me I was the person, whether I was or not. He went with me to Newgate-street, and I left him there, and went and spent the money. I don't know what I did with the bag.

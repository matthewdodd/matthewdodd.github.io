            ; we live in St. Luke's


; the prisoner was my servant
. On the 10th of May she left - next morning, I missed these things. On the 11th of June I met her in Oxford-street - she ran away; I followed her and secured her with one of my gowns on. As we were taking her to Marlborough-street she said she could produce duplicates of every thing; they were found on her. I went to the pawnbroker's, and got the property.

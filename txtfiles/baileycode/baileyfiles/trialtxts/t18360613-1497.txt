ANN LEACH
. I am the white of Thomas Leach, a saddler, in Monmouth-street. The prisoner had been with us a fortnight, at needle work living at the house—she was not a regular servant—I told her I could not afford to give her wages, ut I would give her her victuals—there was no agreement how long she was to stay—I went out on the 12th of May leaving her there—when I came back she was gone—I missed a cap which I had left in my drawer, a bonnet which hung upon a nail, an iron, a necklace, an ear-ring, and two frocks—I saw her again on the 14th of May, in Great St. Andrew-street, Seven Dials, and gave her into custody—she had got my bonnet, cap, handkerchief, and collar on at that time.





THOMAS JAMES WOOD
. I am assistant to my father, who is a pawnbroker. I have some things which were pawned on the 12th of May—I do not know who by.





ISAAC KEEN
. I am a policeman. On the 14th of May, the prisoner was given into my custody—she had the cap and bonnet on—I found two duplicates on her, referring to the property produced by the pawnbroker.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

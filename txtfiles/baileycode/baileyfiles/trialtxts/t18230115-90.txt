                  Walters
               



            ; we keep a snuff shop
 in Foley-street


. On the 14th of December, about ten o'clock in the morning, I was in the parlour, my servant came to me - I went into the shop, and found the till wide open, and a small drawer at the back of it gone; it was safe a few minutes before; there was a shilling in it, but how much more I do not know.

            . I live next door but one to Walters. I stood at my door and saw the prisoner and another looking in at the window; I saw them go into the shop and run out again, I went to Mrs. Walters, who missed her drawer, and then followed the prisoner for half a mile, into Tottenham-court-road, and took him; he said, he did not take the money, but it was the other boy; that there was only one shilling, and the other boy had it.

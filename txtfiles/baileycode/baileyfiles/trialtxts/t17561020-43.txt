            . I had the prisoner in my house to help me to make hammocks for about three weeks. On the 15th of September I went out with my work, between eight and nine o'clock, and left her to take care of my house and things. When I returned she was gone, and the things mention'd in the indictment, my property. I took her up, and she had my cloak and my stockings upon her. The rest of the things she owned she had taken, and pawned for six-pence.

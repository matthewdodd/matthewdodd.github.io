            . I am wife to the prosecutor, my husband is a journeyman carpenter
, we live at Hoxton


; the prisoner lodged in our house a week the day the watch was lost; on the 2d of August my husband was at work, I went out, and left the watch hanging up, the prisoner was left at home; when I returned he was gone, the door was locked; I went and called my husband, he got in by taking a pane of glass out; then we found the watch was gone, we had it advertised; I saw the watch-seal and chain the next day; the prisoner said he came up with the Cambridge coach, to get a place in the Navy-office.

            . I am a journeyman pawnbroker in Jermyn-street, St. James's; I took in this watch (produced in court, and deposed to) of the prisoner at the bar, on the 2d of August; he said his name was Trevor, I lent him a guinea on it; he came again the Thursday night was fortnight, he said he wanted 5 s. 3 d. more on it, or to sell it outright; I had seen the advertisement on the 3d of August, and carried the watch, so I stopped him, and he was committed.
Prisoner's defence.
I leave myself to the mercy of the court.

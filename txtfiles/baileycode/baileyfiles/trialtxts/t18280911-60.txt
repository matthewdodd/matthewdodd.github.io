THOMAS KENNEDY. I am a newspaper-dealer
, and live in Fetter-lane. On the 29th of August I made these newspapers into a parcel, and gave them to Clark - they were to go to Ware, Herts, by the Peterborough coach, from the Bell and Crown, Holborn.

            . My master gave me this parcel; I put it into the pocket of the Peterborough coach myself, between seven o'clock and a quarter-past.

            . I am a hostler at the Bell and Crown. On the 29th of August, I saw the prisoner by the Peterborough coach, which stood near the inn yard - I saw him open the coach door, take the parcel out of the pocket, put it under his arm, and run down Holborn; I followed, and took him in Fleet-market - he offered me the parcel, and begged forgiveness; I gave him in charge- I never saw him before.

            . I live in Glo'ster-court, Holborn. I was coming down Holborn, and saw the prisoner open the coach door, take out the parcel, and put it under his arm; I am certain he is the man, and was present when he was taken.(Property produced and sworn to.)

HENRY BONHAM. I am a shoemaker
, and live in Dean-street, Soho


. On the 8th of December, about eight o'clock in the morning, there was no one in the shop, but the apprentice boy, who rang the bell; I came down, and a man who came in with prisoner sat down in a chair, and had his shoe off; he asked for a pair of shoes; the prisoner stood behind the chair - I knew they had been in my shop before, and said I would not show him any shoes, for they had robbed me before, and if they would go about their business I would forgive them; the prisoner ran out of the shop - I pursued him, and took him ten yards off, with two pairs of boots, and a pair of shoes, in his pocket; the other man ran away - they were my property, and had my mark upon them - they were close to the prisoner, while he stood in the shop; the apprentice ran after the other one, but could not catch him - I did not see the prisoner take anything that morning.

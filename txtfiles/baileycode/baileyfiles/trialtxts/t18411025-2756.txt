JAMES RAINSBURY,



 RICHARD SHORT
, and 




THOMAS LEONARD
 were indicted for

 stealing, on the 
12th of October, 12lbs.weight of rope, value 2s., the goods of William Hickling Burnett and another.







NEVIL SMART
. I am clerk to Messrs. William Hickling Burnett and another. The prisoner Rainsbury was brought into my office on the 12th of October with a bundle of rope which he had been cutting from the timber—it was my employers.





JOHN WOOD
. I am a carpenter, living in Crossfield-lane, Deptford, with my father. On the afternoon of the 12th of October I was standing on the Creek-bridge, and saw the three prisoners come on the rafts of timber—Rainsbury and Short were cutting the rope, which was round the timber—Leonard was standing looking on, and as they cut it they gave it to him—he placed it in the mud by itself—I am sure of that—some boys went and told one of Mr. Burnett's men—he came and caught Rainsbury.





WILLIAM ROBINSON
. I received information, and went round the Creek—I saw Rainsbury kneeling down on the timber with a knife in his hand—Short was a little distance off with his hands in his pocket—I did not recognise Leonard—he ran away.





JAMES CONNER
 (police-constable R 62.) I took Rainsbury with this bundle of rope alongside of him—I asked the reason he had done so—he said he was out of employ, and had done it for a living—the other two got away—I went and took Leonard.

 was indicted

 for stealing, on the

Charles Daniel Loveday.






AUGUSTUS FISK
. I am assistant to Charles Daniel Loveday, a pawnbroker in St. Alban's-place, Edgeware-road. On the 5th of August, the prisoner came to the shop to pledge book for 18d.—I would only advance 1s., and he would not take it—he went away and somebody came and said he had taken a handkerchief—I went out and overtook him about twenty yards off, carrying a bag—I asked him to open his bag, he refused—a young man came out of our shop, and then he gave the handkerchief up to me—we let him go, and on returning we missed two parcels which were afterwards found in his bag.

Prisoner. I was at that time in a state of insanity.





WILLIAM MARTIN
. I am assistant to Mr. Loveday. On the 5th of August, the prisoner brought a book to the shop to pawn—I went after him, and he gave me up the handkerchief—when I returned to the shop, I missed an article, and went after him again—I said, he had something more—he said he had nothing but his own—I gave him in charge, and the policeman found two of our parcels in his bag—I had no reason to suppose him insane.





DANIEL DAVIS
. I am a policeman. The prisoner was given into my custody, and I found the two parcels of property in his bag.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

Prisoner's Defence. While I was there they abused me in a most shameful manner—a young fellow of the shop threw the parcels at me, because I refused to leave the book for 1s.—I had witnesses here yesterday to prove I was mad.




GUILTY
. Aged 29.—


Transported for Seven Years.
There were two other indictments against the prisoner

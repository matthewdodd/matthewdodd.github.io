                  THOMAS 
                  BURNELL
               



            . My partner's name is 
               
                  John 
                  Palmer
               



            . While we were gone to search the lodgings of the former prisoner, the prisoner Hansell was taken in custody.

            . On the 22nd of February, about eight o'clock at night, I seized the prisoner, and took from his person two cruets, one from his breeches pocket, and one from his coat pocket, and a glass coral from his waistcoat pocket. I took them from him in the presence of the prosecutor and Matthews.

            . I went to the prisoner's lodgings after he was taken. I looked about his room. I found several things that Mr. Burnell owned, four bowls or basons, a tea-pot, a cradle, a jug, and other things.
Prosecutor. I have every reason to believe them to be our property. The two cruets I saw taken out of the prisoner's pockets.
Prisoner's Defence. That mug Mr. Burnell gave me himself. Them basons were given me by Mr. Palmer, junior. The cruets I took for my own use; I thought them a trifling thing.

               Transported for Seven Years

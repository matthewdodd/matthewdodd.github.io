            . May 11. I went out and made first my Door and Windows, when I came home, I found my Window in the Yard broke, a pane of Glass taken out and the Casement open. I saw the Boy peeping out of the little House; I laid hold of him, and tax'd him with it. His Sister liv'd up Stairs in the same House, and upon my talking to him, he was just going to confess, but she cry'd out upon the Stairs to him, you Blood of a Bitch, what are you going to do! come up Stairs! I took him up the next Day, and he confessed he broke the Window, and got in and took the Things mention'd. I never found my Things, for he said he had given them to his Sister, and what she had done with them he knew not.

Q. to prosecutor. Were your things the same as Ganing describes?
Prosecutor. They were.
Q. to Ganing. What did you do with the fustian waistcoat?
C. Ganing. I sold that for a shilling; I cannot tell to who.

I bought the cloaths of a gentleman's servant; I never saw him but once or twice in my life.

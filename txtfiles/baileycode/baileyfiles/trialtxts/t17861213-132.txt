On Saturday, the 11th of November last, about ten in the morning, my father gave me a linen bag which contained eight guineas and a half in gold, and eighteen pence in silver, and a thirty pounds bank note; he told me it was to pay a draft he expected from Yorkshire; and went out; six of the guineas were bright guineas; about eleven my father returned; and my wife and sister were waiting to go and see the Princess Amelia lay in state; I told my father I would go down with them; I left my father's house about twenty minutes after eleven with my wife and sister; I had the bag there in my right hand breeches pocket; we then went down to Westminster, and in Palace-yard


, I took particular care of my money and watch; but never thought of that money; we got in to see the Princess Amelia; my sister and me returned about one o'clock; my wife staid behind at a relation's; as soon as I opened the shop door, my father said, you have made me very uneasy, you took the money with you for the draft; I then clapped my hand on my pocket, and said, if I took it, then I have lost it, for I have not got it; my father said, yes, I did give it you; I said, now I recollect it; I then carried the number of the bank note to stop the payment of it; I then took a boat at Black-friar's-bridge to acquaint my wife of it, who I left at Westminster; when I went there my wife was gone, and my aunt and cousin who kept the house told me they believed the money was found, for that there had been a man taken up with a thirty pounds bank note, and some money, and they were taken to Bow-street; I went to Bow-street, and found it was the same note, and at six o'clock I attended the examination; I know nothing of the prisoners.
Court. Are you quite sure you did take the money? - I am quite sure I did take it.
Mr. Garrow. This money and note were given to you in the bag? - Yes, when my father returned.
Then you did not open the bag? - Not then; I did not after my father delivered it to me.
So that of your own knowledge you did not know the number of the note, nor that there was one in it? - I did not.
You had totally forgot it at Palace-yard? - Totally.
When you returned you had no remembrance of it, till he mentioned it to you; there was a great croud? - A considerable croud.
Which way did you go? - Through Old Palace-yard.
You was not in the hall? - I was not.
The rest of your money was safe? - Yes.
Court. You knew nothing at all of your pocket being picked till your father spoke to you? - No.

             sworn.
On Saturday, the 11th of November, I had occasion to go out; I expected a draft from Doncaster; I put into a bag a thirty pounds note, eight guineas and a half, and one shilling and sixpence; six of the guineas were very bright; the money and the note were in the bag; I gave it to my son about ten; says I, George, there is the money; I returned home in about an hour; my son told me that his wife and his sister wished to go and see the Princess Amelia lay in state; he asked me to let him go with them, I did; when he was gone, I searched for the bag; I looked for the money; I did not find that he had left it; and while I was seeking for the money the banker's clerk brought in the draft; I had sufficient in the house, and I discharged it; I was rather unhappy concerning him, and was very impatient for his return; and about one he and his sister returned but not his wife; and I said as soon as ever he returned, George, you have made me uneasy, did you take the money with you to pay the draft; yes, says he, I did; he clapped his hands to his pockets, oh, good God! I have been robbed, what shall I do; I took out my pocket book, and took out my memorandum, and sent him to stop the bank note at the Bank, and he went.
Court. What was the number? - 8641, the 8th of October 1786.
Mr. Garrow. Have you any note of whom it was signed by? - I will shew you my memorandum. (Looks at it and at the indictment.) After he was gone, I went to Westminster, where his wife and sister were, and told them what had happened; his wife returned back with me; I had not been home an hour before I heard somebody was taken up, and in consequence of that I went to Bow-street, and asked if there was any pick-pocket taken up; and they said, yes; I asked if there was any bank note; and they said, yes; he asked me the number of the note, I told him; he looked in the book, and said, your note is very safe, you must attend at six in the evening; I attended there on Tuesday following; then the prisoners were committed; I never saw the prisoners till I saw them before the Magistrates; I swore to my note; there is a mark on the back of the note of my own hand writing; I received it at the Bank, and I put a B upon it for Bank.
Did you see the bag? - The bag was never produced.
Mr. Garrow. Of course all that you say is, that you had such a note, and that you gave it to your son, and that that is the note you lost? - Yes.

             sworn.
I am one of the public officers of Bow-street; on Saturday the 11th, I and Macmanus went down to Westminster-hall, and just going out of Parliament-street, into Palace-yard, I saw the three prisoners come out of Westminster-hall; it was about a quarter after twelve; it could not be more I am sure; I hinted to Macmanus whether he did not see the three prisoners, he said, yes; in consequence of that we went towards them; just as they were going up the steps, the further end of Palace-yard, up a little court that there is there; I immediately said to Wager, says I, what have you got there; he replied nothing, and turned about; I perceived him put his hand between his legs; the moment he turned his face, I looked between his legs, and I saw a piece of paper; I said, what is that? I then took this bank note from between his legs: I then said to Macmanus, says I, let us take them into a public house, and search them all three directly; we took them into the back room of a public house close to the spot, and they were searched there; and Macmanus will tell you what money was found; this note has never been out of my custody since.
(The note deposed to by the Prosecutor, having the letter B on it; and then read.)
Mr. Garrow. I believe the two Greville's were admitted to bail? - Yes; one has surrendered now, and the other has surrendered in the course of the sessions.
You found no canvas bag? - No.
Court. You saw them all three together at first? - Yes.

             sworn.
As Townsend has told you, I was with him, and saw these three people walking together from the great door of the hall; Wager in the middle, and the other two one on the right hand, and the other on the left of him; we went up to them just as they were going up the stone steps, and touched him, and Wager turned round, and Townsend pulled out the note from between his thighs.
Was Wager in the middle when he touched him? - I think he was rather behind; we took them into a public house in Bridge-street, and in

            's pocket were eleven guineas and a half, and thirteen or fourteen shillings; there was only a few halfpence on the other Greville; both the Greville's said, they knew nothing about the note; Wager said, he picked it up; the Greville's are both shoemakers.
PRISONER WAGER'S DEFENCE.
I found the note, and was telling the two Greville's of it; there was a person saw me pick it up; I advertised for him five or six times, but nobody came forward.
Mr. GREENWAY sworn.
This note is signed by me; it was issued from the Bank.
The prisoner Wager called one witness to his character.

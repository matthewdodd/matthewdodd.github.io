            . I am the wife of John Cragg - we live in Tilburn-street, Thomas-street


; our bed-room is on the first floor, over the stable. On the 8th of September I saw my room door (which I had locked) open and shut softly, and heard a bustle up the second flight of stairs - I went up, and met the prisoner coming down; I said, "You have been into my room" - he said, "I have." I called for assistance - he was secured, and this coat and breeches, which had been in my drawer, were produced; there was nobody else in the house.

            . I lodge at Cragg's. I heard her cry out, ran up, and saw the prisoner; the coat and breeches laid by his side. I found three keys on a ledge on the stairs.

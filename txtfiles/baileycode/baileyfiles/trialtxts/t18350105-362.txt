JOHN WILLIAMS
. I am a tailor. On the 24th of December, about one o'clock in the morning, I was in Holborn—I had been supping with a friend in Finsbury-square—I was quite sober—the prisoner came on one side, and caught hold of my right arm, and asked where I was going—I said, "Home"—she said, "Will you go home with me?"—I said, "No"—she pressed very hard against my side-pocket—took my handkerchief, and ran off directly—I missed it, and said to the constable, "That woman has got my handkerchief"—he ran, and secured her, and found it on her.

Prisoner. Q. Did not you talk to me for half an hour, and give me the handkerchief? A. I did not—I was quite sober.






EDWARD RENTMOOR
. I am a watchman. Mr. Williams gave charge of the prisoner—he was quite sober—he charged her with taking his handkerchief—I searched her at the station-house, and found the handkerchief inside her clothes, under her arm-pit—she denied all knowledge of it till then.

Prisoner. I throw myself on the mercy of the Court.




GUILTY
. † Aged 18.—


Transported for Seven Years.

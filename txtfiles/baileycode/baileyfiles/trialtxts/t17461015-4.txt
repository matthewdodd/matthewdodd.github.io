Clark. She was acquainted with the Lodgers in my House, and I suppose she was hired by them to bring off the Goods .

            ( to the Prisoner ) Do you hear what Mr. Clark says?
[The Prisoner, in her Defence, declar'd, that she was a hard working Woman, and that she was sent by the Lodgers that Evening for these Things.]
[Mr. Clark depos'd, that he caught her at the Door with these Things in her Lap, that he thrust her into the Room again; and that he sent for the Constable and had her committed: He also said he got a Padlock put to the Door a little before, to prevent his Lodgers from carrying off his Goods, but that was broken.

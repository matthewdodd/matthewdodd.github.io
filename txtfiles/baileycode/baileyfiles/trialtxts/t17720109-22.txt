            . On the 13th of December I lost a candlestick. The prisoner was a servant
 to me formerly; since that he has lived at the Globe Tavern, Milk street. He came into my kitchen between four and five o'clock. My servants had heard he had stole a candlestick; they put another in his way. They called me, and told me he had stolen a candlestick. I saw it taken out of his pocket. (Produced and deposed to.)

Prisoner's Defence.
I came into Mr. Smith's house on the 13th of last month; I came to seek a place. I had not staid five minutes before his apprentice called me into the room. I went in. He took the candlestick out of my pocket; how it came in I do not know.

             sworn.
On the 31st of January last, I went to bed about half after eleven at night, at my own lodgings, and 
               
                  William
                   White
               



            , my fellow 
apprentice


, with me; he slept in the same bed with me; I put my watch into my box, with the rest of my clothes; I unlocked the box, and locked it again; the prisoner persuaded me to put it in there; he said it would be safer; and just as I was going to lock the box, says he, Dan, will you put my breeches in the box? and just as I was going to unlock the box, says he, you have no occasion; in the morning about half after six he awaked me, and he said, 
               
                  Dan
               


             the door is open; it was open; I asked him to strike a light, I am almost sure it was latched when I went to bed, but not fastened.
Did he strike a light upon this? - Yes, and after he had struck a light he went down stairs, and when he came up stairs I got up, and when I went to get the watch out of my box, the box was open, and the watch and all my clothes were gone; I believe it had been opened with a key; it was not broke open; the prisoner was in the room; I told him I had lost all my things; he said, have you! as I had lost my things I got a warrant and took the two prisoners up on suspicion of taking the things; we found the watch and a shirt; Roger is the father of the prisoner William; I was present when the watch was found; it was found at one 
               
                  Edward
                   Foster
               



            's, in Oxford-road; a person came and informed us that 
               
                  Roger
                   White
               



             had been selling a watch there; she is an acquaintance of 
               
                  Roger
                   White
               



            's wife; she is not here; Foster is an ironmonger, or an appraiser, or something; he keeps a shop in Oxford-road; the man who bought the watch is here, the shirt was pawned at a pawnbroker's in Little Windmill-street, he is here: the prisoner made no confession at all.
Mr. Knowlys, prisoners Counsel. This room is at Mr. Stringer's? - Yes.
He keeps a common lodging-house, does not he? - He lets part of his house out.
How many persons were there that lodged in his house at the time? - Two young fellows lodged in his house at the time, one was married, the one is named Hitchins, and the other 
               
                  Peter
                   Fairy
               



            .
Did a man of the name of Wood lodge in the house at that time? - No, Sir; there is one Mr. Williamson, one Mr. Simpson, and Mr. Alderson, five lodgers besides ourselves; the prisoner was a fellow apprentice of mine for a twelvemonth; I am not sure that the room door was latched, but the door below was fast; I lost all my clothes.
When was this young man and his father first taken up? - I cannot say, the Justice discharged the son till we could catch the father.
Have you ever seen 
               
                  Mary
                   White
               



             on this occasion? - I believe the information came first from her.
Is not this 
               
                  Mary
                   White
               



             the wife of the father? - Yes; but he has two wives.
Has not Mary White been separated from him a long time? - By all account she has, I only knew them a twelvemonth.
Do you know any thing of Mr. Stringer losing a pair of stockings sometime before? - Yes, but he did not take any body up.
Did not Stringer suspect somebody, and did not Mary White give him a pair of stockings to prevent him from prosecuting that man? - I do not know.


                  GEORGE
                   STRINGER
               



             sworn.
I came home about twelve at night, the last day of January; I have lived there going on eight years, I found all the doors fast, I could not get in for half an hour, till I got the cellar door open to awake my wife, she sent the child to let me in, and I bolted the door after me.

Is your wife here? - No.
Do you know whether there was any body came in after you? - I believe not, they were all in bed; that is all I know, except that the prisoner is a very good apprentice.


                  JAMES
                   BAKER
               



             sworn.
The prisoner Roger worked with me some time, as a shopmate, he went away for three or four days, and the master sent me after him, he came to work again, and asked me to buy a watch of him.
Recollect as near as you can when that was? - I believe it was some time in February, but I cannot say.
The beginning or the latter end? - I cannot say, I knew of his being taken into custody, it might be about six or eight weeks before he was caught.
Court to Prosecutor. How long after your things were lost was it, that you got the warrant against these people, and had them taken up? - It was a good bit after, I do not know how long.
What is the date of the commitment? - The 5th of June.
Baker. It was in February that I bought the watch, it was a small silver watch, it was pawned for a guinea, at a pawnbroker's, Charnel-street, Grosvenor-square; the prisoner, Roger, took me to the pawnbroker's where the watch was, and I took it out of pawn, and gave him half a guinea besides, I took the watch and kept it afterwards, till I had a summons come from Litchfield-street, and I went and gave the watch to one Mansfield; the prisoner Roger was not in custody, the prisoner William was; it was some time in February that the prisoner William was taken up; I might have had the watch a fortnight, it was the latter end of February.
Was the watch you delivered to Mansfield the same watch that you bought of the prisoner? - Yes; he said he had a watch on board a ship, I did not enquire, as I always took him to be a very honest man, I never saw any misbehaviour before, I never saw him wear a watch before.


                  THOMAS
                   MANSFIELD
               



             sworn.
I belong to Litchfield-street office.
When was it that the young man was first taken up and discharged? - I do not know; he was taken up twice, the first time I took him was the 3d of May; I am sure of the time that the watch was given to me.
Court to Baker. How long before you gave the watch to Mansfield was it that you bought it? - I cannot say, to the best of my knowledge it was some time in February; I cannot tell how long I had the watch.
What reason have you for thinking that you bought it in February, had you it a quarter of a year? - No, I had not.
Had you it a week? - Yes, more than a week; I gave him half a guinea, and took the duplicate in my own name, and it was some time after I bought the watch that I took it out of pawn.
Might that be a month? - I do not think it was.
Might it be a week? - Yes, more than a week and less than a month.
How long do you think you had the watch in your pocket? - I cannot tell indeed.
What interest did you pay? - One shilling and a halfpenny.
Jury. That is three months.
In what name was the watch pawned? - In the name of 
               
                  Roger
                   White
               



            .
Mansfield. On the 3d of May last I heard the prosecutor was robbed, I went to 
               
                  James
                   Baker
               



            , the top of Oxford-road, I told him my business, he said he had a watch, which he received from 
               
                  Roger
                   White
               



            , I told him he must go with me, his master gave him a very good character; after that I took 
               
                  William
                   White
               



            , then I went to one 
               
                  Ann
                   Sherman
               



            , and she directed me to a pawnbroker's in little windmill street, and there I found a shirt, and after I found the shirt, the prisoner William White denied it, and so he has always.
Prosecutor. I had the watch about ten days, it is No. 155, it had two pieces of blue ribbon on it, and a seal with a cypher, not my own cypher, it had a brass key; I believe there was a little bit of white paper in the watch case, with the number written upon it, I am sure it is mine.
Mr. Knowlys. When did you last see it? - On the 31st of January.
Did you examine the watch as to the marks before the magistrate? - Yes, I gave a description before I saw it at all.
Do you know the shirt? - It is not marked, I know it by the frill that is upon it, which my aunt worked; I took particular notice of it, I am sure it is mine.
(Deposed to.)

                   SHEERMAN
               



             sworn.
I work for the prisoner Roger's lawful wife, 
               
                  Mary
                   White
               



            ; and I went there the first of February, about half after seven in the morning, the wife that he did not live with; I had not been there above ten minutes before 
               
                  Roger
                   White
               



             came in, and knocked at the door, she desired I would not let him in till she had put her clothes on, then I let him in, and in about five minutes he pulled a shirt out of his bosom, and desired me to go and pledge it; I took and looked at it, I said I could not get much upon it, I went and pawned it for one shilling, and brought that and the duplicate to him, I pawned it at Mr. Morris's, Little Windmill-street, I afterwards went with Mr. Mansfield, and they delivered it to him.
Mr. Knowlys. You are very intimate with 
               
                  Mary
                   White
               



            ? - Yes, but I pawned it for the prisoner, I am sure I did not pawn it in her name.

            'S DEFENCE.

Court to Prosecutor. Do you know Baker at all? - No, he was quite a stranger to me.


                  ELIZABETH
               


             M'CONWELL sworn.
I have known 
               
                  Mary
                   White
               



             these seven or eight years; she is the wife of 
               
                  Roger
                   White
               



            .
Did you see Mrs. White at any time give a shirt and watch to the prisoner 
               
                  Roger
                   White
               



            ? - I work for a chemist; I got up soon in the morning on the 1st of February; I went up Oxford road; the shop was not open; I went into the Spotted-dog and called for a pint of beer; during the time I set there Mr. and Mrs. White came in together; it was between six and seven in the morning; the Spotted-dog is the corner of Broad-street.
You are sure this was the 1st of February? - Yes; 
               
                  Roger
                   White
               



             and 
               
                  Mary
                   White
               



             came in together, between six and seven, and called for a pint of purl, when the purl was brought I saw Mrs. White give a watch to Mr. White.
Did she give him any thing else? - I saw nothing but a shirt and a watch.
Did she say any thing to him? - She told him to go out and pawn that watch and shirt for a friend of her's that lay sick.
What did he say? - He went out in two minutes after with the shirt and the watch; he returned in a minute with the same things, and gave them to 
               
                  Mary
                   White
               



            , and told her it was too late for him to stay; and she said, no, he must pawn the shirt and the watch, and bring the money and duplicate to her lodging; that it would look better for a man to pawn the shirt and the watch than a woman; she went out and left Mr. White in the box, and he went out in a few minutes; and I know nothing more; they might be at the Spotted-dog about thirty minutes.
Who was present? - The boy and the landlady.
How long was he in the house before she produced the shirt and the watch? - I know it was ten minutes after this when I left the house; and it was just a quarter of an hour after six when I went in.

Court to Mansfield. Who did you get the duplicate of the shirt of? - There was no duplicate; it was given to the prisoner; I had no duplicate of either.
Court to

                   Sheerman
               



            . What time in the morning of the 1st of February did you go to to Mrs. White's? - About half past seven in the morning.
Was she up or in bed? - She was in bed, and in sleep I believe; I knocked at the door twice.
Who lodges in the same house with her? - I do not know, they were all trades people; it was about half past seven when I went there.
Where does she lodge? - No. 2, in Little Windmill-street.
How long after was it before 
               
                  Roger
                   White
               



             came there? - About ten minutes; Mrs. White was still there; she desired me not to let him in, till she had got her clothes on; when he came in, he said, he had been up ever since five in the morning and had received a guinea of his master, and he was obliged to borrow some things of the apprentice boy to make it up.
Was there any thing that passed between them that led you to think they had seen one another on this morning? - He was there before he produced the shirt about five minutes.
Did he tell his wife he had not been able to pawn it? - No.
She never said a word whether he should carry it or not? - Not a word, nothing passed between them that led me to apprehend that they had been together that morning before, or that the wife knew any thing of his business.

               GUILTY
            .
Tried by the first Middlesex Jury before Mr. RECORDER.
Court to Prisoners. You have both been convicted upon evidence which appears to me, as it has done to a very cautious and attentive Jury, perfectly satisfactory, each of you of felony, but unquestionably your degree of guilt is extremely different; the misfortune of the younger prisoner seems to have been that of having a very abandoned and wicked father, who, instead of protecting his younger years and training him up in the paths of honesty and virtue, has been unquestionably the means of bringing his son as well as himself into the situation in which they stand; in such a situation the case of the son deserves compassion, the case of the father deserves none; and if the law had made it a capital crime, few would have deserved that sentence more; but the law has not made it a capital offence, and the punishment of the father, wicked as he is, must be short of death; but when we consider that he has been the instigator of his son to commit this crime, of which he was to be the partaker, and has afterwards sought to cover that crime, by bringing a perjured witness into Court; it appears that no punishment short of death can be too great for that offence; the offence of the son, would under the influence of the father alone, call for a milder degree of punishment than I think it will now admit of, because it was committed with the circumstances of a breach of trust, rising in the night and robbing his fellow apprentice while he was in sleep; I therefore think that less punishment than the usual one of transportation would not be adequate to the offence of the son; the sentence of the Court is, that you 
               
                  William
                   White
               



             be 


               transported for seven years
            , to such place as his Majesty by the advice of his privy counsel shall think sit to direct and appoint; and that you 
               
                  Roger
                   White
               



            , be 


               transported to Africa, for the term of fourteen years
            .
And let the witness 
               
                  Elizabeth
               


             M'Conwell be committed to Newgate to take her trial next session for perjury.

JASPER JUDGE. I keep a lace-warehouse
 in Coleman-street. On the 18th of February, between two and three o'clock in the afternoon, I was in Maiden-lane, Cheapside


, and felt something at my pocket, I immediately turned round, and observed the prisoner and two others, behind I felt and missed my handkerchief, which was safe two minutes before - Clare was behind the other two. They were secured, and the third boy was remanded. I picked my handkerchief off the ground - it dropped from one of the three.

            . I am a constable. I saw the prisoners in company with another lad, who is in custody. I saw Clare take the handkerchief from the prosecutor's pocket - the other two were covering him; he immediately gave it to Allen; Judge turned round and picked it up. I had been following them all three from Prince's-street. As I went along Allen threw another handkerchief away.

CHARLES M'CARTHY
 was indicted

 for stealing 1 shawl, value 2s.; 1 ball, 1d.; 1 thimble, 1d.; and 1 sampler, 1d.; the goods of

JANE ROWLEY
. I live in Charles-street, Drury-lane. On the 21st of June, I met the prisoner in the street about twelve at night—I went with him to a brothel—I awoke about five in the morning, and he was gone—I am sure he is the man—he bad not paid me anything—I missed my shawl, which had a blue middle and coloured border, a sampler, a ball, and a thimble, out of my pocket—there was no one else in the room.

Prisoner. When she awoke she asked the woman who let us the room if she had seen the shawl with me—she said no, and then she came and gave me in charge.





ANN GRIFFIN
. I live in Carrier-street. At a quarter before five o'clock that morning I met the prisoner—he offered to sell me a large shawl for 6d.—it had a blue middle and coloured border.





EDWARD HARRIS
 (police-constable E 50.) I took the prisoner—the prosecutrix stated what she had lost—he cried, and said he knew where the shawl was, and if Rowley would forgive him he would get it and give it her—I found this thimble and ball in his pocket.
(Property produced and sworn to.)




GUILTY
.(†) Aged 19.—


Transported for Seven Years.

THOMAS BUSBY
. About half-past ten o'clock on the 9th of July, I was walking in Titchfield-street—the prisoner was walking slowly—I passed him—I found him then walk faster—I felt a tug behind—I turned, and missed my handkerchief—I turned—the prisoner was standing against the railings,—directly I approached him he threw the handkerchief down the area, and ran off—I did not lose sight of him—the handkerchief was taken up, and it was mine—there was no person within twenty yards but him.





JOHN SIMS HANDCOCK
 (police-sergeant E 12.) I saw the prisoner running, and the prosecutor after him—I ran and caught him in Great Portland-street—I went to where they said the handkerchief was thrown down, and found it.

Prisoner's Defence. I heard a person hallooing out—I ran, and the policeman stopped me.

WILLIAM PARSONS (police-constable D 182.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person.

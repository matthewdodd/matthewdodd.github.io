JOHN BISHOP. I am principal turnkey of Newgate
. On the 7th of November, about twenty minutes before eight o'clock in the evening, I was returning home, under the walls of the new prison, Giltspur-street


 - the prisoner ran against me, and snatched my watch; the chain broke. and he ran off with the seals; I ran after him, and he held out his hand, and said, "Here is your property;" Pike came up and took him.

            . I was near the place, and saw the prisoner running - I stopped him; he knocked me down with his fists, with a violent blow at the back of my head. I turned round, and collared him. My head was cut on the edge of the pavement.

            . I took him into custody.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I was driven to it by distress. I had no money to pay my lodgings, and could not go home. I took the desperate resolution of doing what I did.
Three witnesses gave the prisoner a good character.

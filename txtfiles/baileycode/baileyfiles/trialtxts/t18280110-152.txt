WILLIAM DAVIES. I am a stationer
, and live in St. John-street, Smithfield. I know nothing of the prisoners - I lost some paper from my shop, on the 15th of December - I did not see it taken, but I had seen it about half an hour before - I did not miss it till Waddington brought it in - I had cut it, and am certain it was mine; it had been about two yards within the shop.

            . I am an officer. I was coming down St. John-street, Smithfield


, on the 15th of December, and saw the three prisoners together, for about a quarter of an hour; they passed and repassed several times - I saw them go to Davies' shop - Reynolds went in, and brought out this paper; the others were looking in at the window at the time - I caught hold of Reynolds, with the paper - Martin passed by, and ran away - I lost Harding - I took Martin next day, and Harding on the 17th.
Prisoner MARTIN. Q. Did not you tell the Magistrate, that a respectable person saw us, and would come forward? A. Yes; but he says he should not know the party.(Property produced and sworn to.)
REYNOLDS' Defence. Neither of the others were engaged with me. I beg for mercy.

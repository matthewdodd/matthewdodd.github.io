            . I am a widow; live at No. 8, May-place, at the bottom of Brook-street, Hampstead-road. I lost my stockings and handkerchief the last day in June; I left them in the watchhouse on the Wednesday night at eleven o'clock.
Q. Who took them - A. I believe the prisoner. They broke open the place. They wrenched the post, and broke part of the post away to get the bolt back.
GEORGE SQUIB. On the 30th of June, about six o'clock in the morning, I being in the watchhouse, a person cried stop thief. The prisoner came the back road where this woman lived; he being likely to be pursued, threw the copper down. He was caught by a gentleman's coachman, and in the prisoner's pocket I found this pair of stockings and this handkerchief, which Mrs. Nichols claimed.
Prosecutrix. These are my stockings and handkerchief.
Prisoner's Defence. I was going along the Hampstead-road; I met two men, they asked me if I would carry a copper for them; I answered them I would. They took me in a field; the copper laid in the hedge. They put it on my head. I carried it across the Hampstead-road, and going by the watchhouse a man stopped me with it.

SARAH HUGHES
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
14th of September, 1 sheet, value 2s., the goods of 



Louisa Jackson; and that she had been before convicted of felony.







LOUISA JACKSON
. I live in Dowling-street, Deptford. I let the prisoner a room—she occupied it for about two months—she was to pay 3s. a week—she went away without notice, and owed me 6s. 6d.—after she was gone I missed the sheet, which had been let to her with the lodging—this is it—(looking at one.)





THOMAS JONES CAVANNAH
. I am in the service of a pawnbroker. I received this sheet from a female, who I believe was the prisoner.





BENJAMIN LOVELL
. I am a sergeant of police. I received information of this robbery, on the 24th of September—I went to Greenwich, and found the prisoner—I told her she must go with me about this sheet—she said, "If Mrs. Jackson does any thing to me, I will do a little something for her"—there was another woman who lived with the prisoner, and I said, "You had better both go"—the prisoner said, "She knows nothing about it, I pledged it myself."





JOHN STEWART
. (police-constable R 35.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got at Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 23.—


Transported for Seven Years.

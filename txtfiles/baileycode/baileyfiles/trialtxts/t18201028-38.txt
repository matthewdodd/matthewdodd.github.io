ELIZA CUTLER. I am a dress-maker
. On the 29th of September, about nine o'clock in the evening, I was walking along Finsbury-place


, some person snatched this bundle from my arm over my shoulder; I turned round, and saw a man running with it - he turned down the street, and crossed Moorfields. I followed calling Stop thief! he was stopped in the middle of Moorfields. I think, I lost sight of him.

            . I was crossing Moorfields, and saw the prisoner running, he fell; I ran up, and picked up the bundle and his hat. I heard the cry of Stop thief! and saw him drop the bundle. I took him to the watch-house.

            . I was standing by the watch-house in London-wall, and heard the cry of Stop thief! from a female voice. I ran into Moorfields, and came up with them in the centre; the prisoner was then endeavouring to get from three or four, who held him. He said it was the first offence.

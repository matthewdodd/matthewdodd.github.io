            . I am an officer of the City. On the 28th of May I was in the Strand about an hour before I saw the prosecutor. I was following the prisoner up and down the Strand, observing him. When I came to Akerman's, the picture shop, I saw the prisoner go close to the prosecutor, and saw him take the handkerchief out of the prosecutor's pocket. I took hold of him directly he took the handkerchief, and took the handkerchief out of the prisoner's hand. This is the handkerchief; I have kept it in my possession ever since.
Prosecutor. It is my handkerchief.
Prisoner's Defence. The prosecutor took his handkerchief out of his pocket; he gave it to the officer as soon as the officer took me up. They said they would send me to Bow-street.

EDRICK BEACHER
 and 




WILLIAM LAWRENCE
 were indicted for

 stealing, on the 
26th of May, 1 handkerchief value 1s., 6d., the goods of 




Samuel Maynard, from his person.






WILLIAM DYKE
 (police-constable R 193) I was in Deptford fair with James Wild, on the 30th of May—I saw the prisoner Beacher, go behind the prosecutor with the other prisoner, and take the handkerchief from the prosecutor pocket, and then push into the crowed—Lawrence was close to him when he took the handkerchief, and it was passed in some way from Beacher to Lawrence, and was found on him; but I did not see it found, as he fell on the ground and kicked very much.





JAMES WILD
 (police-constable R 141.) I was with Dyke at Deptford fair between eleven and twelve o'clock at night—I saw both the prisoners standing behind the prosecutor—I saw Beacher pass something to Lawrence—I took Lawrence, and found this handkerchief in the flap of his trowsers—he threw himself down, and began to kick and bite very mach.





SAMUEL MAYNARD
. I live at Layton-stone-hill, and am a waiter. I was in the fair looking at a show—this handkerchief if mine.

Beacher I was selling something in the fair, and saw a piece of work—I went up, and was taken—I did not have the handkerchief at all. Lawrence. He told the Magistrate he did not see the handkerchief come from the man's pocket—I picked it up, and did not steal it—nobody owned it, and I kept it myself.





WILLIAM DYKE
. No, I told the Magistrate he was the person who received it, but the other too it—they were standing close to me and they were seized directly—the fair was very thin at that time.

JURY. Q. You said they pushed into the crowd? A. Yes, but the fair was getting thin—there were perhaps one hundred persons before them, but none behind.

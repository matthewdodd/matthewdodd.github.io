            . I am an officer. On the 24th of February, about a quarter before seven o'clock, I saw the prisoner, and two other persons, at Messrs. Harris' shop - I saw him take the two half-handkerchiefs from the inside of the shop door, and put them into his pocket - I followed him, and took him about three or four yards from the door - Bertraun, who was with me, found them in his pocket - his companions did not go with him.

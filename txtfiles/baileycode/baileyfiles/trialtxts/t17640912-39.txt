            . I live in St. John's-Street


, and am a pawnbroker
. On the 7th of August, about the hour of 11 in the forenoon, the evidence Delvin, with another man, came in and demanded a shirt, that they said lay for 3 s. I sent my daughter up to look for it; the hats mentioned in the indictment were all hanging upon a nail: I saw Delvin pointing up to them: I found there was no such thing as they came for; it was a fiction of theirs. I asked who brought the shirt? they mentioned a woman's name whom I knew nothing of: I bid them go and ask her about it: they went away, and between the hours of one and two, and in the same fictitious manner, demanded a silk handkerchief, which, they said, lay for two shillings. I had no such thing in my house. I had a jealousy they came for my hats: the moment I stept from off the compter, I missed them: I immediately seized Castle. In endeavouring to get away, he left part of his coat, waistcoat, and shirt, in my hands. He was on one side of the compter, and I on the other: he got from me: I stepped to the door, and cried, Stop thief: the next witness crossed the way upon him: I saw him drop a handkerchief; this is it; it is my property. (Producing a blue and white handkerchief.) Castle ran into a chandler's shop and Mr. Rushton took him. We carried him to the Justices at Hicks's Hall, and he was committed. After that I was sent for to Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            's: I described the hats before they were opened: there was Delvin and the two prisoners; as to the former, I can only say, there was one of them about his size, but I cannot take upon me to say he is the person.

            . I was going up to Islington on the 7th of August, to dinner: I saw Castle come running out of Warner's shop in a torn condition; his clothes were hanging about: Mr. Warner came running out, and cried, Stop thief: I ran; the prisoner dropt the handkerchief at the corner of Aylesbury-street, and ran into a tallow-chandler's shop, where I took him: I took him into a public house in that street, he turned about and would have pushed me back again; then I struck him.

            . I saw Castle with his clothes torn: the handkerchief was put into my charge: that is all I know.

            . On the 7th of August, about four in the afternoon, I was told some boys had some hats in the old ruins of St. Giles's; Delvin came out with this hat in his hand, from the Two Brewers. I touched him on the shoulder, and said, How came you by this hat? he said he had it of two young men, and was going to pawn it for them; and that they were at

            's, that is, the two brewers. I took him before Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            , and he was committed upon suspicion. The next day he was brought up, and admitted evidence against the prisoners. On the last execution day I met Farmer, and brought him to Sir John's; and there Mr. Warner was bound over to prosecute.

            . On the 7th of August, the two prisoners and I met in Chick-lane: we agreed to go and rob this pawnbroker's shop: we went; I pulled out three shillings, and asked for a shirt in a woman's name. I went into a back place, where were a parcel of hats: while I was looking to get this gold lac'd hat, Farmer was trying to get some hats that were at the going in at the door: we did not get any thing then; we went out, and met with Castle in Turnmill-street: he asked us where we had been? we told him: he said, where is the pawnbroker's? we told him: we agreed to go back: I said, he will know me, if I go in again: so I went, and stood at the door, till they went in. I had not staid a minute. before Farmer came out with a parcel of hats under his arm; and Castle came out after him with his collar torn: the man came after him, and called, Stop thief; I walked on the other side of the street, and saw him taken: then I went to a house in Thatch'd-Alley in Chick-lane; there I met Farmer: he brought the hats, and we agreed to go and sell them as fast as we could: there were four plain ones and a gold lac'd one; we went to the sign of the Castle; there were four men playing at skittles: he knew where to sell them: we went to the Broad-way St. Giles's: they went and pawned one or two: I sat in the house the time. Then we went to the Two Brewers and had a pot of beer; there were a parcel of young fellows; they wanted to buy them: I had the gold lac'd one in an apron. The thief-catchers came in. I went out, and this

             came and touch'd me on the shoulder, and asked me what I had got there? he took me to Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            , and I was committed to the Gatehouse.
Castle's Defence.
I went into this man's house to ask for a shirt; he said, I was a rascal, he had no such thing in pawn. He took hold of me, and said I wanted to rob the house. I was born in America, and have been here but seven months.
Farmer's Defence.
Delvin came to me in the morning, as soon as I was up; he had committed a robbery that morning upon one 
               
                  John 
                  Brown 
               



            , just below: he told me he had been to the pawnbroker in St. John's-street: I went along with him in the morning; he asked for a shirt for three shillings; the pawnbroker said he had it not in his house: we went out; and between one and two we went again; he went into the shop, and I stood at the door: he took the things and brought them out to me; he pawned one and sold another. I am but 16 years of age.

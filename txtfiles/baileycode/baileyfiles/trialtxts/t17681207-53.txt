            . The prisoner took a lodging of me and had been in it seven or eight months. She paid me regularly; she quitted the lodging about a month or six weeks ago: she left only the bedstead in it, and took the key with her: she not returning in four days, we opened the door. I met her in the street and got the key after; and charged her with taking the things; she owned she had taken them; and went with me to the pawnbroker (name Murthusate) where she had pawned some of the things; and some were sold, some I had again.

I was in great distress when I took them.

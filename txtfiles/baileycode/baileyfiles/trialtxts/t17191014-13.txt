Another Evidence confirm'd the same. Her Mistress had all her Goods again except a piece of Silver and the piece of Silver Spoon. The Prisoner denied the Fact, and said that her Mistress and she had some Words, and therefore swore this upon her; but called none to prove it, nor to her Reputation. The Jury found her

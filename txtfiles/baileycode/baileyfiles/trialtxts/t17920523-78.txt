I live at the Folly-House, Blackwall



. About 10 o'clock, on Easter Sunday, I heard some people at my door; I unbolted it directly, and three or four men forced me down; I do not recollect who; when they knocked at the door first, they threw something over my head; I was afraid to look up or open my eyes, as they swore they would blow my brains out; they asked me what money I had in my pocket; I said about two guineas, or two and a half; they took my shoe and knee buckles; they asked me what money I had in the house; I told them I had three or four guineas in my bureau. I lost nine gowns, they were my deceased wife's, two pair of gold wire earrings, and several silk handkerchiefs; the silver watch and gold rings were mine; they took three or four guineas; they staid in the house between four and five hours. I was released at three in the morning.

             sworn.
The last witness is my son-in-law. On Easter Sunday I was sitting on one side the fire, and Body Spearman on the other; a man came up to the right hand of the fire and presented a pistol to his face; I got up and turned the pistol from his face; I was thrown down and my face covered; I could not for a minute or two recover my surprize; they took a 10 l. note out of my housewife; I do not know the date, or number of the note; they confined me four hours and a half, while they were rummaging and supping. I lost five gowns, three shifts, and two black cloaks, and about six guineas, I cannot say how much; after they had taken what they pleased, they supped upon cold roast pork, and sucked 15 eggs.

             sworn.
I am sister to the prosecutor. On Easter Sunday, at night, I was sitting in the bar, about 10 o'clock, some body came to the door, and my brother went to see who it was, and they said they wanted something to drink; two men came into the bar, one with a pistol, the other with a cutlass; the man with the cutlass desired me to lie down, or he would cut my head off; I laid down and he tied my head with a child's frock; after that they wrapped my head up in a blanket, and rifled my pockets; as soon as that was done, they began plundering the bar; I could hear but not see. I lost seven gowns, three black cloaks, and a red one, nine silk handkerchiefs, two tuckers, and some black lace, I don't know how much; a half guinea in gold, and a Spanish dollar; I suppose the whole together about 15 l.

             sworn.
I am a servant to Gibbons. I had been out, and returned home about 11 o'clock; I knocked at the door, and somebody came to the door and asked who was there; I said itis me, sir, thinking it was my master; as soon as the door was opened, a man catched me by the collar, and told me to lay down; I did not lay down directly, and the crape fell off his face, and I saw a mole on his cheek; I looked round and saw a man with a candle in his hand, and a stick; I think Randall knocked me down; he was the man, I think, who was standing behind the door, not him with the crape and mole; when they had knocked me down on my master, they fetched a table cloth and covered my head, hat, and all; before they went away they tied my hands behind me, and dragged me into the kitchen.
Prisoner Randall. Did not you swear to a man at Bow-street? - Yes.

            's house. She kept an oil shop. She lived in the ground floor under my room. I was at home on the night of Easter Sunday, to the best of my knowledge, about nine o'clock, I was coming down stairs with a lighted candle, then I saw five men go into Mrs. Randall's apartments; of which Leman Baker and 
               
                  Wm.
                   Randall
               



             were two; Randall had then a blue jacket on; I was out about a quarter of an hour that night; I returned and Mrs. Randall's door was shut; I went to bed, and about three on Easter Monday morning, I was awaked by some men talking; I sat upright in my bed, and the first word I heard one of them say, I could not tell which it was, that they had had a better supper that night than for some time; I knew 
               
                  William
                   Randall
               



            's voice above the rest; I have known him a long while; he was one of the company; 
               
                  Wm.
                   Randall
               



             said he had his skin full of liquor; some words passed I did not understand, but I heard one of them say they had had fine fun with the boy, and Mrs. Randall made answer and said, it was a pity they had not cut off all their heads; then one of the men seemed to be very sick in the yard; I opened my shutter and window softly; I looked into the yard and saw it was Leman Baker; I looked at him two minutes; I saw his face very plain; there was a candle burning, but it was dawn of day then, or moon light; then they came into the back room, and some of them said what have you done with the black cloaks; then somebody said they had not them, and they began to wrangle; then somebody said you have planted them (which I understood hid); and somebody said let us count the gowns, and they counted one and twenty; my apartment is over the back room, and when they went into the fore room I could not hear what they said; on Monday I went to a neighbour's house and staid there all day, and in the evening I came home; as I was coming in I met five men coming out with some bundles, and a coach standing on the causeway; these two men I saw, and knew them to be two of the five; they put the bundles into a coach, and got in and went away; on Tuesday morning, 
               
                  Polly
                   Randall
               



            , the little girl at the bar, brought me up a scarlet cloak, bound with scarlet ribbons, and told me her mother desired me to pawn it, and some silk handkerchiefs, which I refused; the girl left the cloak hanging at the back of my chair; she came and told me she had told her mother, and took the cloak and pawned it, and she staid a long time; her mother was very uneasy, and asked me to see and find her; she said she was afraid something had happened; I met the girl, she shewed me a duplicate, but I did not look at it; about three in the afternoon, 
               
                  Polly
                   Randall
               



             came to me to a neighbour's, where I was washing, and desired me to come to her mother; I told her I would follow her in a few minutes; I did so in about three minutes, and I met Polly coming out of her mother's apartment with something in her apron, and she ran up my stairs, and told me to follow her, which Idid, and when I came into my room, she pulled a gown out of her apron, the same patten as this (pulling out a piece), with an old fashioned plated back; Mrs. Mole gave me this piece; the girl said her mother desired me to pawn it; I told her I could not leave my work; I pointed this piece out as the pattern out of several; I put it into a cupboard, and it was in my room; I went down stairs then; early the next morning, the girl came up and desired me to pawn a gown, I said I was sure that was too big for her mother, and asked her where she got it; upon this question the girl seemed to be surprized, said they were theirs, and told me if I would not tell her mother she would tell me; I never saw the cloak or gown afterwards; this blue coat Polly-Randall brought up into my apartment, and told me she was afraid that her mother's apartment might be again searched.
Prisoner Baker. Were not you apprehended for this robbery? - No, I gave the information against them.
Did you ever say that you did not know Baker? - I said I could not rightly say till I saw his face; he stooped down, and had a knife in his mouth, which he bit exceedingly; when I saw his face plain I swore to him; the woman prisoner told the justice that this coat belonged to Leman Baker; which Baker did tell me to sell the coat and keep the money; I thought it improper to sell the coat, and told Mrs. Randall of it, and she said it was Baker's coat, and he might do what he pleased with it. Mrs. Randall told me she intended to be an evidence against the rest of the men, and if I would be so kind as to go to her brother, and tell

            , she meant to be an evidence, and if he would not be an evidence, she would turn one against him, and hang them all; I told him, and he said he would turn evidence, and that there were three of them in a house in Old-street Road; Leman Baker was one of them; but that he was afraid to have them taken that night, as they would turn evidence against him.

I was awoke before day-light, on Easter Monday, by a noise; I missed my bed-fellow; I found her up with the window open; I said Bet, what are you doing here? she made answer and said, cannot you hear; I sat up in my bed and heard a parcel of men wrangling about black cloaks; one said they were certainly there, and another man said they must be planted; then they counted the gowns, and they said there were 21 gowns; after which they left that room and went forwards; I then left Payne at the window and fell a sleep. On Saturday night following, Mrs. Randall and her daughter Elizabeth came into my room, and produced a pistol, and desired me to hide it; she said it was her brothers, and she was afraid the officers would come and search; on Tuesday following I came from work, and in my cupboard I saw a gown, I asked Payne whose it was, she told me it was Randall's, I said to her, carry the gown down again, for it shall not be here; she made answer and said the woman is not at home; it remained in my room till Wednesday morning; on Wednesday morning

RICHARD GRIFFITHS
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
1st of January, 1 jacket, value 4s.; and 1 pair of trowsers, value 4s.; the goods of 



Samuel Teague, in a vessel upon a navigable river; against the Statute, &c.






SAMUEL TEAGUE
. I am apprentice on board the Aquilla brig—she was lying at Brown's Quay. On the 2nd of January, I had a jacket and trowsers on board, which I had left in the forecastle—I missed them that afternoon—they had been safe in the morning—I found them at Mr. Ward's, the pawnbroker's—the prisoner was at work on board our vessel for three or four days, while we were loading, and he was going to ship in the vessel, to go as a seaman.





THOMAS WARD
. I am a pawnbroker, and live in Ratcliffe-highway. I took in this jacket and trowsers of the prisoner, on the 1st of January.

Prisoner's Defence. I never recollect putting any thing in such a place in my life—I had all my clothes on board the ship—I was out drinking—I went on board that morning, and the boy gave me half a cupful of brandy, and I did not know what I was doing.





SAMUEL TEAGUE
. I gave him some brandy, but I did not know he had taken the things.




GUILTY
. Aged 31.—


Transported for Seven Years.

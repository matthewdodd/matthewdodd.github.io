GEORGE HARLEY
. I am in the employ of Bailey and Milner, of St. Paul's Church-yard. On the morning of the 11th of October I was near St. George's Church, in the Borough, at half-past eleven o'clock—the policeman called to me—I then found my handkerchief was missing—I had used it about an hour before.





THOMAS WATKINS
 (police-constable M 174.) I have seen the prisoner before near the Obelisk—on the 11th of October I was passing up the Dover-road, at half-past eleven o'clock, and saw the prisoner pot hit hand into the prosecutor's pocket, take the handkerchief out, and put it into his own left-hand pocket—I took him, and found it in his pocket—I called the gentleman, who recognised the handkerchief as his own—this is it.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

Prisoner's Defence. I was going up the Dover-road—as I was crossing I saw this gentleman's handkerchief on the ground—I took it up, put it into my own pocket—he took me, and said I had picked the pocket.





THOMAS WATKINS

re-examined. He did not pick it off the ground—I saw his hand at the gentleman's pocket, and he took it from his pocket—there was another lad with the prisoner, but he escaped.




GUILTY
.* Aged 19.—


Transported for Ten Years.

Before Mr. Recorder.

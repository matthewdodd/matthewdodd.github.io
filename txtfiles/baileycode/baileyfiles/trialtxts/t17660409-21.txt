Mr. Smith. On Tuesday evening as I was going home at the end of Trig-lane, I met the prisoner with a sack on his back; I asked him what he had got there, he told me nothing. I went and seized him by the collar, and asked him again; he said the same again, he threw the sack from his back. I got assistance and secured him; we found a red mark, E. Rawlins, Dartford, 1765; he said he picked the coals out of the mud; we found his stockings very dry, the coals very clean; he was carried before Mr. Alderman Turner, who bound me over to prosecute.

            . I am a farmer, the sack is my property.
Prisoner's defence.
I gave sixpence for the sack about a month ago, and I picked up the coals along the shore in different places.

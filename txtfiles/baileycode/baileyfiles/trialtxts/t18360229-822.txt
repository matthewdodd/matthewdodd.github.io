SARAH JONES
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
20th of December, 3 aprons, value 1s. 6d.; 2 shifts, value 3s.; 1 night-jacket, value 1s. 6d.; and 1 towel, value 1s.; the goods of 



Hugh Samuel Hopley.






MARY HOPLEY
. I am the wife of Hugh Samuel Hopley, of No. 3, St. John-street, Bethnal-green. I do not know the prisoner—these things were entrusted to me to mangle—a person whom I never saw before, came to me for the things, and I gave them to her—I cannot say it was the prisoner—Chard works for me—they were taken from the door.






MARY ANN CHARD
. I work for Mrs. Hopley. The prisoner came, and said she came for a bundle of clothes which were brought that way, and she wanted them that night—she said she came from her sister—I did not know who her sister was—my mistress, Mrs. Hopley, gave her the things—I am sure the prisoner is the woman.





SARAH EDWARDS
. I sent things to be mangled—three blue aprons, two shirts, one night-jacket, and a pair of sheets—I made these two aprons myself, and know them—I sent them to Hopley's to be mangled—I have not got the shirts, and sheets, and night-jacket, or towel—I found the aprons in the prisoner's box.





MARY HOPLEY
. I believe this is a part of the property I gave the person who came—she picked out several things, and said they were here, and that she had brought them to me to mangle that morning—I have so many things I cannot give an account of them all.





WILLIAM LOW
. I am an officer. I received information, and went to a house, searched it; and the prisoner's mother told me which was her box, and this box these aprons were found.




GUILTY

ELIZABETH HOWE. I am single
. I live in Cursitor-street, and keep a chandler's-shop
. On the 21st of January, between ten and eleven o'clock, the prisoner came to my shop, to purchase a small quantity of tea and sugar - he paid me for them, and then asked what coffee was an ounce, and while I was grinding some for him I saw him move from the edge of one counter to another; I suspected he had got something - he went out afterwards, and I missed the bacon. I went to look after him, but could not see him - but in about a quarter of an hour I saw him go by the house, leading a dog; I sent a woman to bring him back to the shop, which she did, and he had the bacon in his apron.

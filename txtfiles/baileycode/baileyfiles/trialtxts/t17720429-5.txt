            . I am a brewer
, and live at Kensington gravel-pits



. My house was broke open on the 22nd of April

 towards the evening. My servant informed me of it at eight o'clock the next morning, when she went to open the windows. I went to the house; it was a house I had ready-furnished, which was not then occupied, but was ready for a tenant; it was about two or three hundred yards from my own house. I examined which way they came in, and found a pane of glass was broke in a window in the yard to come at the bar; I perceived farther the traces of their feet; they had forced the bars. I was sent for to the Justice's; there I saw most of my things; and the prisoner did own that they were my things, and came out of my house. I know nothing of the prisoner.


                     Mary

            . I am servant
 to Mr. Durne. The house was safe at six o'clock at night on the 22d of April; I went to the house the next morning, and the garden-door and the windows were standing wide open. I missed the things mentioned in the indictment, (repeating them).
Q. Do you know any thing of the prisoner?
Watson. I never saw him before he was apprehended.
- Causey, a pawn-broker, in Barwick-street, produced two cotton counter-panes, and a quilt, which were brought to him on the 22d of April by the prisoner and another man, who said they were the property of a Mr. Eagland; that, as he suspected them, he sent his apprentice and a man with them to give the money to Mr. Eagland, if they found their story true; that they returned in a few minutes, and informed him that the two men had made their escape; upon which he printed hand-bills, and had them distributed to the pawnbrokers, in consequence of which the prisoner was stopped by Mr. Leighton.

                   Alder
               



            , who is apprentice to the last witness, deposed, that he was sent with the prisoner and the other man; that in Windmill-street the prisoner's accomplice turned round upon him, and insisted that he should go no further; that he demanded the money of him, struck him several blows, and ran away with his hat; that the prisoner seized the man that was sent with him, who got loose and ran away.

            , a pawn-broker, produced a counter-pane which the prisoner brought to him when he secured him.

                   Watson
               



             deposed, that the goods produced were the property of the prosecutor.
The prisoner said in his defence, that he went with an acquaintance to pawn these things, believing he had come honestly by them. He called - Hemmings, - Levey, - Barron, and 
               
                  William
                   Rhodes

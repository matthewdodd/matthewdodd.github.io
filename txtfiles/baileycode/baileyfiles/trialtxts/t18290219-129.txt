            . I am an officer of St. Sepulchre's. On the 2d of February, between two and three o'clock in the afternoon, I was in St. John-street, Clerkenwell


 - I saw the prisoner and two more following a gentleman; I watched them for about five minutes - I crossed the way, then crossed again, and saw them at the corner of sutton-street - I saw the prisoner take a handkerchief from a gentleman's pocket - the other two were covering him; he ran up Sutton-street, and I followed him - the gentleman went straight on in St. John-street; I never found him: the prisoner was stopped by another officer, and I knew him again; he dropped the handkerchief about two minutes before he was stopped - this is it.

            . My husband's name is Oliver, I lost the goods mentioned in the indictment from out of my house, and the prisoner lay in the same room where the goods were. When I got up in the morning on the 16th of May, she and the things were gone, between three and four o'clock.

Q. When had you seen them before ?


                  Phebe 
                  Truelove 
               



            . I saw them over night. When I found her, which was about three weeks after, I charged her with taking the things; she own'd she did, and went with me to the two pawnbrokers where she had pawn'd them, and I found them accordingly.
The goods produced in court by Fothergale and Merrit, the two pawnbrokers, and deposed to by the prosecutrix.
The prisoner had nothing to say in her defence.



               Guilty

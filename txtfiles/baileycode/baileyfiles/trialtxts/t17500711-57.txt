            . I am servant to Mr. Young, he lives at the Man in the moon, Plough street, Whitechapel


. The prisoner came in about half an hour after six o'clock in the morning, she asked for half a pint of cyder. I had a mistrust of her. I went down stairs, turned my head and saw her take some plates. (The plates were produced in court.) I drew her the cyder, then I turned round in the kitchen and missed two plates; I charged her with them; she laughed at me; she laid down six pence, and I could not disturb my master for change, she said she would go and get change herself; I would not let her go without delivering the plates. She pulled them out from under her cloak. Then I called my master, and he secured her; then she said she only took them to frighten me.
Prisoner's defence. I had not been well, I was not in my right senses.

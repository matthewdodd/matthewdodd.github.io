            . I live with Mr. William Geary - he keeps a cheesemonger's-shop
, in Broad-street, Bloomsbury. I saw the prisoner come into the shop on the 17th of January, about half-past nine o'clock at night; he took a bladder of lard from off a pile of cheese, about two yards within the door, and ran out with it; I pursued him, and saw the officer bringing him back, and another man had the lard.

            . I was coming down Broad-street, and felt some person run against me; I turned round, and saw the prisoner close to me, and the lard rolling on the ground - he crossed the street, ran against a woman, and then walked on; I pursued, and took him.
Prisoner. I am a poor man.

1413. 




JAMES ROBERT WILLIAMS
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
12th of March, one pair of shoes, value 9s., the goods of 



Ephraim Goatly, his master.






EPHRAIM GOATLY
. I am a boot and shoe-market, and live in Great Russell-street. The prisoner has been in my employ about two months—he came on the 9th of March, and left on the 21st of April—he was errandboy and porter—he had access to my stock—I did not miss this property till an hour or two after he left—he went away without notice, and then I began to make search.





THOMAS WINDSOR ALLEN
. I am assistant to my father, a pawnbroker, in Clare-street. I have a pair of new shoes, pawned on the 12th of March for 2s. 6d., by a lad, who I believe to be the prisoner—it was a lad of the same size and appearance.





HENRY PECK
. I am foreman to Mr. Goatly. I know these shoes to be his property—when the prisoner was taken into custody, he said he had pledged a pair of shoes in Clare-street—I went to Allen's, and found them.




GUILTY
. Aged 18.—


Transported for Seven Years.

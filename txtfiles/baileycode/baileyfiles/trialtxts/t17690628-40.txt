            . I keep a linen draper's shop
 in Smithfield



. On the 15th of June, about seven in the afternoon, I went up stairs and was rung down again in a few minutes by Mr. Taylor, who said he had had two thieves in the shop, and he believed they had stole a piece of cloth. I had left two pieces on the counter when I went up, and upon hearing what he said, I looked, and said they have taken the best. Upon which he went in search of them, but could not find them. I have not seen it since.

            . On Thursday the 15th instant, about seven in the evening, the prisoner, and 
               
                  Mary 
                  Crosier 
               



             the evidence, came into our shop and asked to see some soosea handkerchiefs. I had two customers in the shop at the time. I desired them to wait a little: they said they would. They went to the counter, about four yards distant from where I was serving. The prisoner set a child on the counter, and then the evidence tied the prisoner's apron behind by the two corners with something in it very tight. In a minute's time the prisoner said, Pray, Sir, serve us, we cannot stay any longer. I immediately left my customer and went and shewed them some soosea handkerchiefs. They asked the price for each of them one. I told them 2 s. 2 d. They bid me 20 d. I said I could take no such price. They said they were poor girls, and could not afford to give any more. I did not like the appearance of the girls, so I took the handkerchiefs off the counter, and they went out immediately. I just stepped to the door and looked after them. Seeing they did not call in at any other of the shops, but walked on remarkably fast with a child in their arms, which gave me a strong suspicion they had got something; I immediately turned to the counter, and found one very remarkable piece of linen was missing. I know it was there not five minutes before: there were three or four or five and twenty yards of it; but they do not run all alike. I rang the bell for Mr. Webb to come down. I told him I had had two thieves here that had stole a piece of fine Irish. I went to the door, where was a poor woman standing: I asked her whether she saw two girls go out, and which way they went. She said straight down the road. I went in pursuit, but could not find them. The next day, I went through Field-Lane, in order if I could see any thing of the girls. I saw the prisoner standing with another girl at the One Tun. I went to some of the neighbours, and asked where a constable lived. They sent me to the prisoner Pain, he is a broker and keeps a cook's shop in the lane. I went and told him I wanted him. He went and fetched his staff. I shewed him the prisoner, and gave him charge of her. She went away with a barrow. He let her get near three parts of the way to Hatton-Garden before he would take her in charge: he took her in charge with great reluctance. Then we brought her to my master's. Crosier's father brought her to our house.

            , the accomplice. I went home on the Saturday night, when Pain was standing at his door: he said to me, Whatever you do, keep your girl out of the way, and then there will be no lumber about this affair. I found my girl and secured her, and brought her to the prosecutor. Pain has three or four houses, which he lets out to bad people for lodgings.

            . One Thursday, in the afternoon, I met 
               
                  Mary 
                  Kynaston 
               



            , and she asked me to go along with her to Smithfield. When we came to Mr. Webb's shop, she asked me to tie her apron behind. I knew there was something in it, but did not know what. I did tie it. She asked for some handkerchiefs, the man asked 2 s. 2 d. a piece. She bid him 20 d. He said he could not take it. Then we came out of the shop to the Cloysters; there she shewed me the cloth. We walked pretty fast, and went to Holborn: then she said she would go to Pain in Field-Lane and sell it. We went there; she went in and came out again with half a guinea and a shilling, and said he had given her six-pence a yard for it, and that there were twenty-three yards of it. She gave me six shillings all but three pence. I had a five-and-three-pence, and the rest in half-pence. I had seen a woman in Field-Lane, who told me she had seen Mr. Webb, who told her he would give her half a guinea, if she could tell where we were to be found, for the cloth was worth four pounds. Then Mary Kynaston said, We will go to Mr. Pain's, and ask him to give us half a crown more. We went, and his wife was at home. Kynaston asked him: he said he had given her enough already, and would give no more, for it was a very thin cloth. Mrs. Pain bid us go about our business, and said there should be no more given there.
Q. to Taylor. What was the cloth worth?
Taylor. It cost my master three shillings a yard; worth three pounds fifteen shillings.
Prosecutor. I searched the house of Pain on the Monday, but there was nothing found.
Kynaston's Defence.
Going up Holborn, the gentleman brought a constable and laid hold of me. I asked for what; for I did not know I had wronged any body.
Pain's Defence.
Crosier laid hold of me on the Sunday morning, and said my girl is got in a hobble, and I should be glad to speak with you.

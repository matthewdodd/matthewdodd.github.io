            . I lodge in Sheer lane, am a peruke-maker
; I lost the things mentioned in the indictment, the prisoner work'd for me about a day.
Q. When did you lose these things?
Murray. About 10 months ago, or better; the prisoner was taken about 6 weeks ago in Sheer-lane, with the waistcoat on his back, (produced in court and deposed to) he owned before the justice that he had taken all the things, and said he was sorry for it.
Prisoner's defence.
I know nothing of the things; I bought the waistcoat of a young man in Sheer-lane, of the same business.



               Guilty
            .

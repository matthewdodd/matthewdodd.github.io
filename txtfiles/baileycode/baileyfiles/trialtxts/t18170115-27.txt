            .
HENRY BIRKS. I am the driver of the Knightsbridge stage
. On the 9th of December last, about half-past five o'clock in the evening, my stage was opposite Lime-street


. I got off the box, put my coat inside the stage, and went into the public-house. I came out in a few minutes, and found the door on the street side open, and my coat taken away. It is worth Â£2. In five minutes after the prisoner and coat were brought into the public-house.

            . I am the driver of the Chelsea stage; I was standing behind the Kensingston stage, and saw the prisoner open the door on the street side, and take the coat out, and I collared him; when four more men came up to us, two of whom said they were officers, and the other two caught hold of me and tried to rescue him. They drove me across the road, when the patrole came up and took the prisoner into custody. I am sure I saw him take the coat out. I was within seven yards of him.

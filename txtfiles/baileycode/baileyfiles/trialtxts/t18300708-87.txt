            . On the 19th of June I was passing on Blackfrairs-bridge


, about a quarter-past six o'clock, the prisoner trod on my heel, and begged my pardon - he and another passed me: a Police-officer seized them both, and said, "Sir, you are robbed - seize the man behind you;" I turned, and seized another man, and they were all taken; I had had my handkerchief five minutes before, but I have seen it since - I am sure the prisoner is the man who apologized to me.
WILLIAM SISSONS. I am a Policeman. I was passing the bridge at a quarter before six o'clock; I saw three persons, and watched them - I saw the prisoner, who was one, 'put his hand into the prosecutor's pocket, and take out his handkerchief: I crossed, and in seizing Hall and 
               Davis
             I lost the handkerchief - I called to the prosecutor to take hold of James, and they were all taken, but Davis and James were discharged; the prisoner said, "What do you take me for?" I said, "You have picked that gentleman's pocket" - I then took him.
Prisoner. It is impossible that man could see me take it when he was fourteen or a dozen yards from me. Witness. I might be as far, but I was opposite; there were not many persons passing.

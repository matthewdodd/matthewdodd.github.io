            . I am a wholesale grocer
, and live in Cannon-street. On the 29th of November, about eleven o'clock in the morning, I was in Abchurch-lane


, and saw two lads standing, and as I passed them they followedme. I felt them at my pocket, and immediately turned round - one passed me on the right, and the other went from me. I felt my pocket, and missed my handkerchief - I looked at them, and the prisoner caught my eye and ran off. I called Stop thief! and he was stopped before I lost sight of him - nobody but one of them could have done it. The handkerchief was produced.

            . I live in Cannon-street, and saw the prisoner running down Abchurch-lane; he threw the handkerchief down, and was stopped immediately. I picked it up, and gave it to Mr. Beale.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner. I throw myself on the Mercy of the Court.

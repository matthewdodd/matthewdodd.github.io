MOSES ABRAHAM
. I am an attorney. On Tuesday, the 9th of June, about a quarter past ten o'clock in the morning, I was in Charter-house-square, with my son, who was a few paces before me, with my bag—the prisoner came up to me, and snatched my watch from my fob—he did not exactly strike me a blow, but he took my watch—he came in contact with me—he met me—he was in company with another man of the same description—he appeared to be going to give the watch to the other man, but I followed him, and forced it out of his hand, and broke the chain in doing so—I gave an alarm, and sent my son for a policeman, who took him into custody—the other man made his escape—he took it momentarily.

Prisoner. I was very much intoxicated—my mother has lately died, and I have been intoxicated ever since. Witness. He got about four yards from me, before I seized him—I detained him by force till an officer came—he appeared drunk at the station-house, but I did not notice it before.






MICHAEL ABRAHAM
. I am the prosecutor's son. I was with him, and saw the prisoner with the watch in his hand—my father held him, and sent me for an officer.





BENJAMIN FARROW
. The last witness came to me in Charter house-square, and said his father was robbed of his watch—I ran to the place, and found the prisoner in custody—the watch chain was broken—I asked him what he did it for—he said, "I did it on purpose to be taken—I wish to be sent out of the country"—he was not drank but he pretended to be so when he got to the station-house.




GUILTY
. Aged 25.—


Transported for Fourteen Years.

Before Mr. Justice Park.

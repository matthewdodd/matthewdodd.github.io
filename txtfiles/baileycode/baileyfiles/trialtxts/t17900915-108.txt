             sworn.
I live at the further Red Lion, at Highgate


. The prisoner came into my house, and called for a pint of beer, on Monday, the 13th of this month, about half past seven in the morning: she maid going to clean the candlesticks, missed two: and I heard of it about half past eight: the man went away as near as I can guess a little before eight.
Did you ever recover your property? - I saw it at Mr. Gray's, our constable's, the same day about half past twelve.


                  JOSEPH
                   KILBY
               



             sworn.
I am a labourer. This man came by me in Highgate: I was at the Grove: I see him lay these candlesticks by a tree; he laid down four, and laid himself by them; 
               
                  Joseph
                   Baker
               



             was coming; and he got up, and ran away; and I called to 
               
                  Joe
                   Baker
               



             to run after him, and stop him; he left the candlesticks there; Baker and I tied the candlesticks up in his apron, and took them to the constable, 
               
                  James
                   Gray
               



            .
Did Baker overtake this man? - Yes; he took him directly.
Did you lose sight of him? - Yes; I lost sight of him, because he jumped over the pails into the road; but 
               
                  Joe
                   Baker
               



             soon catched him: I am sure it is the same man that 
               
                  Joe
                   Baker
               



             brought back; I can swear to him.


                  JOSEPH
                   BAKER
               



             sworn.
I am a labouring man; this old man, Kilby, desired me to pursue the prisoner; which I did, over the pales: I saw the candlesticks lay on the ground, in the Grove; and they laid till I brought the man back again to the Grove; afterwards I carried them to the constable, and delivered them to his care: I am sure that is the man.
Jury. How many pair did you see? - Two pair of candlesticks.


                  JAMES
                   GRAY
               



             sworn.
I am a constable: the prisoner was brought home the 13th of September, to my house; I was not at home; I was sent for, and when I came home they had taken him to the cage; and they had given the candlesticks to my wife: I was not gone from home in the whole half an hour.
(The candlesticks produced and deposed to by Mr. Hide, and by Kilby and Baker.)
PRISONER's DEFENCE.
I did not take any property belonging to that Gentleman.

            . I am the wife of Ormond Fincock, who is a milkman
 - my son is in the habit of going round the walk for his father. On the 5th of October my husband gave him a little can to go and serve some customers - he is eight years old; he came home to me for 14s. which I gave him - he has been taught to speak the truth.

            . I went about with the milk, and saw the prisoner between three and four o'clock in the afternoon - he said to me, "Do you go home, and ask your mother for 14s. for your father;" I went home, and my mother gave it to me - the prisoner met me at the corner of Denzell-street, Clare-market


; I gave him the 14s. - he gave me a penny, then dropped a halfpenny down an area, and ran away; I told my father what had happened when I got home, and I think he was taken on Friday night.

            . The prisoner was in the employ of my father, who is a cow-keeper - I did not send him for this money; I have known him fifteen years.

SECOND COUNT, for feloniously ripping and cutting the said lead, with intent to steal it.
JOHN JOHNSON. On Sunday the 1st of February, about five o'clock in the afternoon, I was in my warehouse, in Scotland-yard


, and saw the prisoner come on the roof, and make use of a chisel and knife, which had been left there the night before-he cut about 50lbs. of lead off. I called to him, and he ran away. I got on the roof and said I would shoot him if he ran, he then surrendered. I gave him in charge. I had lost lead before, which made me watch. The lead was fixed to the building.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

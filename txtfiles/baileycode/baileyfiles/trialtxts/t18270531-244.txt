            .
THOMAS BRIGHT. I am a broker
, and live in Queen's-place, Westminster. On the 24th of April I went to the King's Head public-house, Orchard-street


, and had a pint of beer and a pipe; I gave the prisoner, who was the waiter, a sovereign - I told him to take for a pint of beer and a pipe, which he had served me with, and bring me the change; this was between eight and nine o'clock in the evening; I did not see him again till the 30th (at Queen-square;) the landlord gave me the change afterwards, on condition of my prosecuting him.

            . I keep this house. The prisoner was an occasional waiter
; he was there on Tuesday, the 24th of April, in that capacity. Bright frequented the house; he called for a pint of beer that day, and gave the prisoner a sovereign - he left the house immediately, without his hat on; I saw him in custody on the Saturday following. It was his duty to bring me the sovereign to change; I gave Bright the change afterwards - I asked the prisoner about it- he said he took the sovereign, and bought some clothes with it - I have not received it.

            . I am a watchman. On the 24th Jones told me of this, and on the 28th I saw the prisoner at a shop window, and took him.

            . Aged 23.

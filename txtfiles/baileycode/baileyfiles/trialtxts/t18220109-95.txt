. On the 13th of December, about ten o'clock, these shoes hung outside the door - I saw the prisoner come to the window, and stand there two minutes looking through; he then went to the door, cut down a pair of shoes, and walked away; I pursued and took him with them under his jacket, he said,
"You **** let me go, or I will knock you down, he struck me a violent blow on the head; but was secured.

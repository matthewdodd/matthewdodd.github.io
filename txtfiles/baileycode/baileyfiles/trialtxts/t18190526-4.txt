            . I am a watchman. On the 5th of May, about half-past two o'clock in the morning, I met the prisoner in the Harrow-road, with the bridle and saddle, and a spade in a bag; he said he came from Willan's, in the Regent's Park; I was going to take him there. He then stopped, and said it was of no use, for he had stolen them from a farm about six miles off.

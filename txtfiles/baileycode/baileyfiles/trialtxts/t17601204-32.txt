The two prosecutors were youths, just come from sea, had receiv'd some money of their captain, and lodged at their mother's, in Russel-street, Bloomsbury. They were making merry at an alehouse in the neighbourhood. Their mother being with them with a young child, to quiet which she had given it the key of her room, the prisoner came in and placed herself near the mother, and play'd with the child, for which they gave her some drink. She took an opportunity to secretly get the key from the child, by which means she got into the woman's room, where the things were. The things being missing, she was taken up, and owned she had got the pump;, and delivered them to the owner; and proposed to return the four guineas if they would not prosecute her.

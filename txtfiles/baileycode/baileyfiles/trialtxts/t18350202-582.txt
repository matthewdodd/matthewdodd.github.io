JAMES SMITH
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
31st of January, 16lbs. of paper, value 8s., the goods of 



Benjamin West.






BENJAMIN WEST
. I am a bookbinder, and live in St. James's-walk, Clerkenwell. I know nothing of the prisoner; but on the 31st of January I lost this paper—on the 29th, a gentleman, who resides in the lower part of my premises, informed me that there were two suspicious looking characters in my passage—I set a watch on the landing of my house, where this property and some other was placed—on the Saturday the lad who I set to watch, gave me an alarm—I went out, and saw the prisoner running, and the lad after him—he took him and brought him back—he had thrown the property down—my street-door was open, but there is another inside.





JAMES THORLEY
. My master set me to watch about seven o'clock, on the 31st of January, on the stairs, a little above where the books and paper were—about half-past seven, or twenty-five minutes to eight o'clock, the prisoner came in—I did not hear him, but I saw him come up the stairs—he took this paper, which is part of the Delphin Classics, and ran

down—I rang the bell to give an alarm, and pursued him—he dropped part of this paper in the road, and part on the curb-stone—I never lost sight of him till he was taken.





JOHN GEORGE HINDE
. I was coming along with my father, and saw the prisoner run down the stairs with this bundle of books under his arm—I heard a cry of "Stop thief," and tried to stop him—he threw the bundle down—I pursued, and saw him taken.





JOHN ROBINSON
 (police-constable G 57.) I took the prisoner, and have the books.




GUILTY
. Aged 17.—


Transported for Seven Years.
There was another indictment against the prisoner.

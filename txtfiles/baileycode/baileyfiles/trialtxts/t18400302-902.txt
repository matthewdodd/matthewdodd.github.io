MARTIN GAVAN
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
3rd of March, 1 handkerchief, value 1s., the goods of 



Theodore Day, from his person.







JOHN SHUTE
 (police-constable G 219.) About a quarter before five o'clock last Tuesday afternoon, I was passing Moorgate-street—I saw a crowd round a horse that had fallen—I saw the prisoner, and another boy, try several pockets, and the prisoner partly drew out the prosecutor's handkerchief—the prosecutor moved; then he came back, and the prisoner drew the handkerchief from his pocket, and was rolling it up—I seized him with it in his hand—the other boy kept close to him.





THEODORE DAY
. I was looking at a horse that had fallen—this is my handkerchief—(examining it)—I lost it.

Prisoner's Defence. Another boy took it and chucked it down—I could not do it with one hand—I have one bad hand.




GUILTY.* Aged 11.—


Transported for Ten Years.—Convict Ship.

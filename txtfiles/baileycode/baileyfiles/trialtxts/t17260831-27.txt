             thus depos'd. I was got drunk, and was going home to Cats Hole in St. Catherines. In my Wastecoat Pocket I had got a pound of Hair in a Bladder, and a Pocket Book, a Pair of Gloves, and a Handkerchief in the other Pocket; and so coming under Aldgate, I saw the Prisoner Isabel Lucky before me, and I gave her a Tap upon the Shoulder, and ask'd her where she was going, and she said a little farther, and so she walked sometimes before me, and sometimes behind, till she came to Goodman's-Yard



, and there she turned down, and went into a Porch, and I after her. Well, says she, what will you give me now. Why indeed my Dear, says I again, I have got no Money at present, but if you'll oblige me so and so, I'll make ye Amends the next Time I see ye, for I live but a little Way off. Truly, says she, I can do nothing without ready Money, for I can't afford to trust. - Indeed my Dear you must for this once. - Will you be as good as your Word then? - Yes indeed I will Child. - Well then if I must, I must, and so, Sir, I laid her upon the Ground, for she was not afraid of daubing her Cloths, because she was then in as dirty a Pickle as she is in now. But however as foul as she was, I can't deny but that I did commit that filthy Sin upon her, and just in the Heat of Action, she cry'd out, The Watch, the Watch is a coming, get away and shift for your self. So I got off, and turn'd my Back upon her, and put up my Breeches, but the Watch not coming, I went to the Porch and felt for her there, but she was gone; then I felt in my Pockets, and found that all was lost. Well, says I, to my self, The Bitch had robb'd me, she has taken away every Thing that I had about me; my very Hair and Bladder and all, and I am an undone Man! So having no body to make my Apology to, I e'en walk'd home in that Condition. When she was taken, she said that she did not take the Things out of my Pocket, but found them in the Porch.

             offer'd me some of this Hair to sell. I examin'd her how she came by it, she said she had it of

            , who waited hard by. I look'd out, but she was gone. I took the Prosecutors, Pocket Book upon Jones, by which I found him out, and search being made after Lucky, she was taken at Billingsgate, in the Gravesend Tilt Boat, just as it was going off.
Lucky in her Defence said, that as she was going along Goodman's Yard, in the Dark, She Kick'd something soft before her, and taking it up, found it to be Hair. Jones in her Defence said that meeting Lucky, she ask'd her to drink, and desir'd her to sell the Hair for her, telling her that she had the Hair from a Sailor of her Acquaintance. Lucky was found 


               guilty, value 10 d.
             and Jones 

               Acquitted

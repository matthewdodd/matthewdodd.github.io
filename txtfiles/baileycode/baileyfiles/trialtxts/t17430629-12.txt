            . On Sunday Sen'night, at Night, as I was going by the Fleet-Market, I met one 
               
                  Judith 
                  Nash 
               



            , a Companion of these two Women; and she took me Home with her, to their House in Black-Boy Alley by Chick Lane


; I not having any Apprehension of Danger, the Prisoners informed me, that 
               
                  Judith 
                  Nash 
               



             was Mistress of the House; they brought some Gin, which I paid 3 d. for, but I believe I did not taste it; in a little Time I found I had lost my Watch; I asked them for it, and they said they had none of it; I thought it was not a proper Place to make a Noise, so I came away without it. On Tuesday in the Afternoon, I went to see if I could find the House, and saw 
               
                  Judith 
                  Nash 
               



             sitting at the Door; I went as a Stranger, and not with a Design to discover myself, for fear they should use me ill; I called to 
               
                  Martha 
                  Ewers 
               



             to bring a Dram, which she did; they asked me for a Present, which I refused, because I wanted Nothing with them: I wanted to go out, and they refused to let me go, then they called 
               
                  Sarah 
                  Bartlet 
               



             to their Assistance - Ewers and Nash took hold of me, while 
               
                  Sarah 
                  Bartlet 
               



             took the Money out of my Pocket - I was endeavouring to get out at the Door, and they seized me, one on one Side and the other on the other. - I had in my Pocket 10 s. 6 d. in Silver, and 4 d. 1/2, and they left me a Shilling, a Six-pence, and some odd Half-pence (I had paid my Reckoning before) - I was endeavouring to get out at a boarded Window, but they told me they had me too fast for that; they went to a Light at the other Side of the House, and I heard one of them say, let us see what we have got; and, in the mean Time, I unbolted the Door and got out.
Bartlet. He gave two Guineas to Long Charles to have his Watch again, he knows it to be true.
Copperthwait. I advertised my Watch, and I had it again from Long Charles.

Bartlet. I never saw a Farthing of the Gentleman's Money, in my Life; he said, when he had got his Watch again, that he did not mind the eight Shillings.
Ewers. I know nothing of the Matter, I do not know the Gentleman. 

               Guilty

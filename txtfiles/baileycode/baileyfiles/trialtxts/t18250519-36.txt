JOHN MILES PATTERSON. I am a ropemaker
, and live at Old Ford


. I think this bolt is mine; I should not like to swear to it: I see no difference in it and the one I used to have on my premises - I had it on the 12th of April, and saw it again on the 15th, at Mr. Huddon's shop, at Bow. The prisoner worked for me about two years ago.

            . I worked for Mr. Patterson. I know this bolt well; I was in the habit of using it every day for four years; I had used it on the 12th of April, and am certain it is the same.

            . I am a smith. I bought this bolt of the prisoner, but I cannot tell exactly when. I went before the Magistrates on the 18th of April.
Prisoner's Defence. It was given me to sell by a person who said he would pay me for it.

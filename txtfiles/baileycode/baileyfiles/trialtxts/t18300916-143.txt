            . On the 22nd of August, as I was going into a house in Stationers'-court


, I felt something at my pocket, turned round, and saw the prisoner with my handkerchief nearly in his possession - he fell on his knees, begged I would excuse him, and said he would not do so any more; he had the corner of it in his hand.
Prisoner. When he took me to Guildhall, he said he was calling Watchman! for a quarter of an hour. Witness. Yes, I did; I took him from Stationers'-court, beyond the Old Bailey, crying Watch! all the way, and then took him back before I got a watchman.

            . I am a parish officer. I took the prisoner - that is all I know.
Prisoner's Defence. I was going to the bottom of Old Fish-street to meet a man, who said he would try to get me a situation - it was raining fast, and I went down the court for the nearest way; there were two or three more in the court - I saw this gentleman on the step of the door, and as I passed him he said, "You rascal, you have been picking my pocket;" I had passed him nearly twenty yards before he came to me.
HENRY PATCHING. That is not true.
Prisoner. It is the first time I ever was in such a place, and it shall be the last.

            . Aged 18. -

            . I am a cheesemonger
 in New Bond-street


, the prisoner was my servant
; on the 24th of March she asked me to go out, I told her she might; (she had lived with me three weeks) she did not come home till the next day; the spoons and things being missing, I suspected her; she would not confess any thing to me, neither was I at the finding the things; the next evidence can give a farther account.
Mr. Barrington. Mr. Harrison applied to Justice Spinnage, who desired me to go and bring the prisoner before him; I said to her she had better tell where the things were; she said she would shew me where they were laid; she shewed me down an alley where the handkerchief lay; she said, there they lie; I took the handkerchief up and found two table-spoons in it, it was near Bond-street; (produced and deposed to by prosecutor) she pulled one spoon more out of her pocket, (produced and deposed to.)

Prisoner's defence.
I used to carry them about me very often; I went out with them, and I said too late, and was afraid to come home.

             SPEIGEL. I hold a situation in the Treasury
. At a quarter-past twelve o'clock last Monday night, I was in Regent-street


; I had a handkerchief in my pocket- an officer told me I had lost it; he had it in his possession, and pointed out the prisoner to me.
JOHN BURKE. I am an officer. I saw the prosecutor and another gentleman near the Fire-office - they passed me, and the prisoner pulled the prosecutor's handkerchief partly out; some persons then came by, and she stopped; she then pulled it again - they then went on to the Quadrant, where she pulled it right out, folded it up, and put it into her bosom: I took her to the prosecutor, and told him of it.(Property produced, and sworn to.)
Prisoner. My father and mother are both dead; I have not a friend in the world.

            . Aged 20. - 


               Transported for Fourteen Years

WILLIAM HUTCHINSON MOISTER
. I live in Fulwood's-rents, Holbom. On the 18th of November I was employed to conduct a sale of furniture in the Old Kent-road—the prisoner was standing about there, and I delivered him a dining table to take to a place—he returned, and said he was to take a looking-glass to the same place—I said I could not attend to him—I went up stairs, and when I came down, he had taken the glass down, I asked him where the bill was—he said it was all right, that he had given it to me—he had given the bill of the table, but not of the glass—it was the property of Mr. Hassell—it was sent in there from him for another person, and he has since paid for it—the prisoner took it out, and asked me to lend him a board to put it on, and said he should return in a quarter of an hour, but he never came back at all—I did not see him again till last Monday week, as he came out of the Compter.

Prisoner. Q. Did you not take the glass down for me, and help me outside with it, and lend me a hammer? A. No; you took it down your self with a screw-driver—I lent you a board, which I have not had back.

Prisoner. I took the glass to the Bricklayers' Arm—a lady gave me 18d. for taking it, and I put it on an omnibus, and she gave me 6d., for doing so.




GUILTY

Transported for Seven Years.


Before Mr. Sergeant Arabin.

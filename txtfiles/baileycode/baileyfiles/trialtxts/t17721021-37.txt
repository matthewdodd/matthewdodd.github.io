            . The prisoner was my servant
; she went away last Monday night without my knowledge; she did not come home all night; the next morning I found my drawers, in my bedchamber, were broke open, and my money, amounting to 40 l. was gone; the prisoner was apprehended; she confessed that she took the key of the room from the bar; that she found the drawer unlocked, and took away the money.
Another witness deposed, that he took the prisoner near Brick-lane; that she delivered to him 27 guineas, a half guinea, a 36 s. piece, a queen Ann's crown, and a few shillings, which she said was her mistress's property.
Prisoner's Defence.
I acknowledge I took the money, but I returned it almost all again. I leave myself to the mercy of the court.

Se called three witnesses who gave her a good character.

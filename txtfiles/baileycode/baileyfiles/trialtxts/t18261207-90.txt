                  , from his person
            .
THOMAS DAWSON. I am a carpenter
, and work at the corner of Downing-street. I live in Crown-street, Westminster


 - the prisoner is my son-in-law, and lodged with me. On Friday, the 17th of November, I was ill in bed; I had five half-crowns, and a sixpence in my left-handtrousers pocket, which was under my pillow - the prisoner was there at his dinner-hour - I fell asleep between two and three o'clock, and when I awoke he was gone; about two hours afterwards I missed my money, which I am sure was safe when I went to sleep - I found the sixpence laying on the bed, then looked and missed the five half-crowns - the prisoner did not come back till the 22d of November; when he called, "Mother!" I let him in, and said, "You are a pretty boy, where is my money?" he said he had spent it; I said, "What did you take?" he said, "Five half-crowns;" I gave him in charge - he has been in many places, but defrauded his masters.

            . I am a surgeon
. On the 4th of December I was in Brydges-street


, returning from the theatre, between twelve and one o'clock; I felt the flap of my coat fall against my thigh - I said, "Some one has taken my handkerchief;" a coachman said the prisoner was the man - he was taken, and my handkerchief found on him.

            . I was on duty, and took the prisoner - the handkerchief was found, but I did not see it in his possession; I found this other handkerchief in his hat, and this duplicate.

            . I am a hackney-coachman. I saw the prosecutor walking down the street; the prisoner stepped behind him, and took his handkerchief - I pointed him out, and took him into custody; while I had hold of him, and he was saying he had not got it, two gentlemen took it from his pocket.
Prisoner. That man speaks false - I never had it at all on my person.

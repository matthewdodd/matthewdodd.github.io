            . I am an officer. I saw the prisoner walking down Rosemary-lane, on the 7th of January, with a bag - I went up to him, and asked what he had got, he said, Nothing - I took hold of it, and found it was lead; he then said he found it close to St. Katherine Docks. I took it to my brother, who found where it came from.

THOMAS WILSON
 was indicted

 for burglariously breaking and entering the dwelling-house of Frederick Ingoldby, about two in the night of the 
26th of April, at 
St. Mary, Islington, and stealing therein, 1 pair of scissors, value 1s.; the goods of 



Frederick Ingoldby; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






JOSEPH HARVEY
. I am assistant to Frederick Ingoldby, he lives in the parish of St. Mary, Islington—the surgery adjoins the house, and is part of his dweling-house—I left at half-past ten o'clock on Friday night, the 26th of April—it was safe then—the window was down, and the glass was not broken—at a quarter to three I was awoke by the policeman—I went down, and saw the surgery door open, the front-door open, and the window put up—there were a pair of my master's scissors near the bell—they had been removed.





GEORGE MILES
 (police-constable N 110.) At half-past two o'clock that morning I saw the glass broken at the surgery window—I turned my lamp on, and saw the prisoner come to the passage—he came out of the street door, and I took him—the sash was up half a foot, and the glass was broken over the catch, which would enable a man to put his finger in and open it—the prisoner had his boots under his arm when he came out—I asked him what brought him there—he said, "I belong to the house"—I rung up Mr. Ingoldby,

and he came down—he said he knew nothing about him—I took him to the station, and found some lucifer matches in his pocket.

Prisoner's Defence. I am quite innocent of breaking into the house: I had been drinking in the night, and was in there.





WILLIAM MALYON
 (City police-constable, No.456.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person.

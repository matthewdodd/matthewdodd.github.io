JAMES HILSDON
 (police-constable S 42.) On the 22nd of May I met the prisoner, between twelve and one o'clock at night, coming along Mornington-crescent, which is about half a mile from the prosecutor's, with this copper on his head—I asked where he was going—he said, "To Mr. Fogg, of Compton-street"—I asked if he worked for Mr. Fogg—he said, "Yes," and he had been to fetch it from Mr. Fogg's brother, at Hanrpstead-heath—I asked what for—he said, "To new-bottom it"—I took him, and found on him these five pieces of leaden pipe, and a brass cock, which I here produce—I found the owners in the morning—I saw the place the copper and pipe was taken from—the copper fitted exactly—I have no doubt it was taken from there.





RICHARD BOND
. I am agent to Mr. Joseph Faulder. The house No. 18, Grove-street, Camden Town, is an empty house, which I have the care of for him—I had seen it all safe on the Saturday before the Wednesday, when the policeman called my attention to it—I described the copper as soon as he saw me—the pipe was fixed—the prisoner must have got in at the back door, which was forced open—the copper was put up in the second pair front room, for safety.

Prisoner's Defence. I was coming down Arlington-street, and saw the copper and leaden, pipe lying—I went to take it up to take home, and the officer took me.

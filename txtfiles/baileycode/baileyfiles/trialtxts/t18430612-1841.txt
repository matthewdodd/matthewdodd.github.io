JOHN CANHAM
. I am master of the Mary Ann, of London, which laid in the Newcastle tier off the Tower—I sleep in the cabin. About half-past twelve o'clock at night, on the 15th of May, I wound up my watch, and laid it over the bed-place, and my purse, containing two sovereigns, was in my waistcoat pocket, hanging on the state-room door—the officer came about three in the morning, and then I missed my watch, money, and purse—this is my watch, seals, and key.





CHARLES HENRY FALCONER
. I am inspector of the Thames-police. About two o'clock in the morning, of the 16th of May, I was on the river—I heard some one, in an under tone, calling to a waterman, "I will give you a tanner to put me on shore"—but the man being busy, he rowed past—I heard him ask the same of another waterman, but he rowed past—I desired one of my waterman to get into a boat and row past—he went—the prisoner called him, and he took him into the boat—I shot out in my galley, boarded, and overhauled the prisoner—I found this watch and appendages in his

right-hand jacket pocket—I found six half-crowns in his pockets, but no sovereigns or half-sovereigns.

Prisoner. It was in my left-hand pocket.




GUILTY

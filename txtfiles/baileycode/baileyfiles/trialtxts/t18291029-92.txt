            , and live in Waterloo-street


. The prisoner was my servant
 - she left me on the 27th of September, without notice - I was very ill at the time; when I went into the kitchen I missed all the articles stated - I never permitted her to take any of them; I have not seen any of them since - when she was taken, she said she sold them; she had been with me five or six weeks.

            . I am a constable. I took the prisoner, and asked what she had done with the property; she said she sold them to a Jew in the street.
Prisoner's Defence. That is false; my mistress quarrelled with me on the Saturday, and I left on the Tuesday - she was in the habit of sending me out with these things to get liquor; that is why they were sold.

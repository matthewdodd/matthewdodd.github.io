            , of Lower Grove-street


. The prisoner took our front parlour on the 6th of May, for which he was to pay weekly; the next morning he came to me about half-past six o'clock, and asked what time it was - I thought he looked rather bulky; he went out - I ran and opened the parlour window, and missed these sheets; I ran and took him going down the street with this sheet in his hat, and this one round his body - he said he was very sorry, and he would return and give them to me.

Prisoner's Defence. I found the sheets damp; I took them off, doubled them up, and put them in the chair; in the morning I threw them on the hed, and went and asked her the time - I went out, and met a young man whom I spoke to; I then heard Stop thief! called, and saw the good lady - I went back with her, and showed her the sheets on the bed folded up, as I had put them in the morning.

            . I keep a shoe-stall
, in Feather stone-street


. On the 19th of December I went to my leather-dresser's, and saw the prisoners at the corner of the street - they watched me - I did not like their looks. I returned in about five minutes, and missed the boots. I am sure they are the men.
EDWARD RICHARDSON. I saw the prisoner, Denton, come from Ross's stall with something under his apron, and go towards Tabernacle-walk-the other prisoner was with him, walking after him, and looking behind. I am sure they are the men.

            . I saw Denton take the boots from the nail, when the prosecutor was gone. Strugnell stood at the corner, and when he saw any person coming he whistled - He also whistled when the prosecutor was gone. I am sure they are the boys.

            . On the 29th of March, about nine in the morning, the prisoner came to my master's shop in Thames-street


, and took my hat from a nail. I stopped him with it in the shop, as he was going away with it. When he came in, I was in a back shop, so that he could not see me; but I saw him. ( The hat produced and deposed to.)
Prisoner's Defence.
A young man desired me to call on him on the Tuesday, and I went in there, thinking it was the shop. The hat was fallen from the nail, so I put my hand down to pick it up; but I had no design to take it away.




               Guilty 10 d.

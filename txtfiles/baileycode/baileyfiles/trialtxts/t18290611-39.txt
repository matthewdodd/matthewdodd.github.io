             odged at my house at Hornsey


; the prisoner was in my employ as a labourer
. On the morning of the 19th of May I heard a noise, about half-past three o'clock; I got up, undid the bolt of the door, and heard a man's footstep run away - I did not open that door, but went round and met the prisoner; it was all within my own premises - I saw him get over two fences; I went round and met him again, and took him - he had with him this coat, which I had given him, and three bottles; one was full, and the other two were broken - these other nineteen bottles were found in a sack; I put this one to them- it was old port whie, and belonged to Mr. Brooks; it had been left in my care in a hamper - it was put into the cellar, which was not locked; the bottles had not been tapped, the seals appear to be the same as the others.
WILLIAM COWLAND. I assisted in taking the prisoner in a field adjoining the prosecutor's house.
GEORGE CHAMBERS. I am an officer. I took the prisoner - I found these nineteen bottles of wine in the sack, and this one, which was found on the prisoner, I put with them; the other two were broken.
Prisoner's Defence. I know nothing about it.

JANE MARY OVERMAN
. I am the wife of Charles Edward Overman, of Queen's-road. This day week, about twenty minutes to one o'clock, I was walking in Park-crescent, and saw the prisoner walking—he struck me a blow on my chest, from which I fell into the road—he made a snatch at my purse, which was on my finger, and I felt my chain straining on my

neck—I kept the purse, but the ends broke off—he dropped them, and ran away—these are them (produced)—I saw him stopped.

Prisoner. I certainly snatched her purse, but did not strike her; I might have pushed her. Witness. It gave me a great deal of pain on my chest.





ROBERT EDWARD WYATT
. I was in Park-crescent, and saw Mrs. Overman fall, and the prisoner run away from her—I stopped him—I am sure he is the man.





JOHN TURNER

            . I was walking along Coventry-street


 on the 17th of July, and saw the prisoner take these trowsers from Mr. Waters's shop, off a rod inside - he got ten yards from the shop - I took him, but was forced to let him go, as I had no officer there - I went into Mr. Waters's, and told what I had seen - I then got an officer, who took the prisoner.

JOHN GILDERT
. I bought this steel of the prisoner, about three weeks ago—I did not know him, but he said he was in want of money.

Cross-examined by
MR. CHAMBERS. Q. You are quite sure you bought it of him? A. Yes.






GEORGE HAVILL
. I found five steels at the prisoner's house; and all these others at different butchers' shops.

            's Wife, looking out o' Window, saw that some Lead had been strip'd off the Church-Gallery. On Thursday Evening, about 5, 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Rudd 
               



            , going into a neighbouring Field, saw the Prisoner enter at the other End, and go towards the Ditch, where he took up something, and let it down again; but perceiving that Rudd took Notice of him, he untrussed, and pretended to ease himself, tho' he did not fit a Minute, but put up his Breeches, and walk'd off, looking often behind him, and at last ran away. Rudd ran to the Ditch, and found 2 Pieces of Lead in a Sack, which prov'd to be the same that was taken off the Church. Rudd then pursued him, and calling to some Neighbours as he ran along, they at last took him among the Boughs of a stump Tree, where he had endeavour'd to hide himself. The Jury found him 

               guilty
            .

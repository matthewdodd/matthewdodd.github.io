             and 
               
                  Mary 
                  Sysom
               



            , both of the Parish of Stepney



, were Indicted for 


               feloniously stealing two Suits of laced Head-cloaths, a Dimitty Petticoat, and 40 s. in Monies numbred, the Goods and Monies of 
                     
                        Leonard 
                        Rawlins
                     




                  , on the 25th. of September
 last
            . The Prosecutor deposed, that the two Prisoners came in to Drink, and after some time, one of them went away, a little while after, going up stairs, the Goods were missing, and Clarke was for making her Escape out of the Back-door; but being taken, was brought back again and search'd, and found two Suits of Head-cloaths upon her; upon which, she restored the Money, and begged they would be favourable to her: But upon her Tryal utterly denied the Fact, saying, she knew nothing of it. The Evidence against Sysom was not sufficient to convict her, she was 

               acquitted
            , and the other found 

               Guilty
            .

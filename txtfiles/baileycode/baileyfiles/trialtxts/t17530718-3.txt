                  Norris 
               



             went after them towards Acton, I could hear nothing of them, then we went towards Fulham-bridge, we did not hear any thing of them there, we came back again and gave them over, and coming through the George at Hammersmith, we saw them in a drinking room, I got off my horse and run in doors, then John Beverly ran out at the back door, I ran and catch'd hold of him directly, and brought him back into the room; when I came into the room, there was Norris, and the other prisoner struggling together, he endeavoured to resist, the great coat lay on the table between them, it fell down, I took it up and untied it, it was tied up, and the boots within inside of it; we took the prisoners and the things before justice Lever, and he committed them: Beverly said Owens brought the things to him in the road, Owens said he knew nothing of it.

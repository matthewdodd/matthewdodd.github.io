             sworn.
I keep a clothes shop; on Saturday, the 19th of April, a little before nine o'clock in the evening, the prisoner Fletcher came in, and asked me for a second-hand shirt; upon that, Ling came in to him; I asked which of them it was for; Fletcher said, for himself; I told him, I had not one that was fit for him; upon that, he laid hold of a gown that hung upon a nail behind the shop door, he gave it a jerk to disengage it from the nail, and ran off with it; I ran out, and called, stop thief! but could not see any thing of them.
While they were in your shop, did Ling and Fletcher speak to each other at all? - No, I do not recollect that Ling spoke a word.

             sworn.
On the 19th of April, I was going down Russel-court, I heard the cry of, stop thief! I saw the prisoner Fletcher and another running; Fletcher; I took particular notice of; I watched them across Drury-lane, and then went back to to the prosecutrix's shop; her husband went for Mr. Jealous; when he came, we all went into a house in Nag's-head-court, Drury-lane, where we found the three prisoners; the gown we found upon the middle prisoner (Ling)

             sworn.
I went in consequence of an information to No. 5, Nag's-head-court, Drury-lane, where I took the three prisoners; I heard Ling's voice as I went up stairs; I knew his voice as soon as I heard it; he had the gown under his arm; when he saw me he threw it down.
(The gown was produced in Court and deposed to by the prosecutrix.)
FLETCHER's DEFENCE.
I went to buy a shirt, but I did not touch the gown; I am as innocent as a child unborn.
LING's DEFENCE.
I went to see my sister who lives in this house; when I went in, these two young men were in the room; my sister shewed me the gown, she said, she had bought it of them.
(Medcalf was not put upon his defence.)

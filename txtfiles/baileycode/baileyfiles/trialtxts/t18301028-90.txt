            . I saw Lynes last Tuesday week, in the evening, between Ratcliff-cross and Cock-hill - she asked me to go home with her; I said I would not, and would have no connection with her; she walked all the way up the highway, and asked me to give her something to drink - I said, to get rid of her, I would give her a pot of ale or porter; I went with her to a private house, went up stairs, took out my money, and gave her a shilling - she called another girl to go and fetch the porter or ale- she then said the girl stopped a long while, and she would go to look for her; when she was gone, I missed a 10l. note, and seven sovereigns, which were wrapped up in it; they had been in my purse, in which was some small silver in a separate department - I know I had it safe when I saw her, because I took the purse out, put it on the table, and gave her the shilling out of it; the purse was in my left-hand breeches pocket - I missed the purse and all, but I found that was returned into the side pocket of my coat; I did not perceive it taken from me - I had had two glasses of grog with a gentleman, at Limehouse; I was in the room about a quarter of an hour - it was about ten o'clock at night, I think; I did not change the state of my dress at all - I am sure of that; I went down, and called the Policeman - when I called a second time he answered, and came to me; he told me to remain there, and sent another to me, who observed the number of the house, and took me to the night-officer.

Lynes. Q. Can you swear that I took any thing from you, or went nearer than from one chair to another - you brought up a shilling in your hand? A. No, I took out the purse; it might be between twelve and one o'clock -I cannot tell the time exactly.

            . I am a Police-officer. I was on duty on the morning of the 20th; I heard the call about one o'clock, and went to the house - I found the prisoner in Lyne's apartment; he said he had been robbed by this young woman - I knew where her mother lived, (the prisoner

            ;) I went there, and found

                  McCarthy
               



             standing inside the door - I went in; she said,"My God! what brought you here?" I told her not to be uneasy, I only came to look for a prisoner - she ran up stairs, and I followed her; when I got into the apartment she was in the act of opening the window, and before I got to her she threw some money out - I heard it chink on the stones; another officer came into the room - I told him to take her, and I went out and picked it up; I found this 10l. note, No. 5324, six sovereigns and 16s. there - the prosecutor had been drinking, but he was not drunk; he gave a description of Lynes - I found the male prisoner in bed; he said nothing, and made no resistance - I did not see Lynes.

            . I came down, and had nothing on but my inside garment; I never went near the window. Witness. You were at the door when I went; you went to the window, and threw the money out, and I picked it up under the window.

            . I was on duty between twelve and one o'clock, and saw Lynes run out of Cable-court into Shorter-street; I was pursning her when the prosecutor called out - I went and found him; he gave an account that he had lost 17l. - I found Lynes' aunt by his side, and took her to the watch-house; I then disguised myself, and went and found Lynes in Rosemary-lane, with two others - I searched her, but found nothing; I knew she had a father and mother, named McCarthy, living near Rosemary-lane, and when we got to the house I found the mother on the stairs, within about two stairs of the bettom- she ran up stairs, went to the window, opened it, and we heard the fall of something like money; the last witness ran down, and I seized the mother, drew her from the window, and threw her on the bed, in case she should have any more money -

             made use of some phrase in case I did not get off his bed, or let his wife go, and he pinched my arm till he got to the back of my hand, and threatened how he would serve me if I did not let his wife go.

            . I am an inspector of the Police. I received six sovereigns, 16s., and a 10l. note from the officer.
Lynes' Defence. When I first met him he said he would give me something to drink; he went into the back yard, and came up with 1s. in his hand - he sent me for a pot of ale; there was no other woman with me - when I went down I found the money in the passage; I took it up, but did not know whether it belonged to him or to another young man who had been in the house before - I went to a public-house to see if I could get a pot of ale, but could not; I then took the money and put it outside my mother's window-ledge - my father and mother were in bed, and asleep; they knew nothing about it - when I was returning home, the officer told me I was wanted at the watch-house - I there saw this gentleman, who said I had robbed him of a 10l. note and seven sovereigns, but he did not know the number of the note; it is not likely I could take his purse when he had it about him all the time - he had it at the watch-house.

            . I never saw the money, and never had it; I went to bed at nine o'clock at night, with my husband and four children.
JURY to WILLIAM SLEE. Q. Were the sovereigns in the notes? A. Yes; the purse lodged on the table while I gave her the shilling I think - I lost it in the house.

                  JOHN
                   LYCETT
               



             sworn.
I am a coachmaker
; I live in Whitechapel


; I let out carriages to hire; I know the prisoner; he hired a post-chaise of me yesterday was a twelvemonth; the 1st of September, 1785.
Relate particularly all that passed at the time it was hired? - He hired it for the term of three weeks or a month; he said, he was going round the north.
To make a tour? - I think he said so.
Relate as nearly as you can the particulars of what he said to you? - For that time he was to pay me at the rate of five shillings per day; and I have never had the pleasure of seeing the post-chaise since nor him till I was indulged by my Lord Mayor with seeing him in the Poultry compter; he had hired one on the 10th of July before that; he had brought it home and paid for it.
How had he been first recommended to you? - From the Saracen's-head, Aldgate, where he lodges; he said, now I have paid you six shillings a day; I shall want another post-chaise in the course of ten days or a fortnight, you will not charge me so much for that, as the time is longer.
(Going to look at his book.)
Were the memorandums you are going to look at made by yourself? - Yes; it was the 10th and returned the 16th, seven days, he paid six shillings a day for it.
When he came to you on the first of September, did any particular conversation pass between you? - Nothing, but he desired the chaise to be fitted up with pistol holsters and a net to the roof; I told him it was not customary to furnish them with pistol holsters, he said, he must pay for that.
You understood it was to go a tour through the north of England? - I did.

Did he say so? - I think he did; to the best of my recollection he said, round the north; but that was no part of the contract for the hiring the chaise.
When was the chaise delivered to him? - The 1st of September; that same day he sent a pair of post horses from the Saracen's-head.
From that time you never saw any thing of him or the chaise till he was taken up? - No, Sir, I never did.
Do you recollect particularly as to the time he was to have the chaise? - To the best of my recollection it was positively three weeks or one month.
Then it was to be returned in the course of that time? - Yes.
Have you never found the chaise since he was taken up? - No, Sir, I have never seen it since, nor do not of my own knowledge know what is become of it.
Have you ever heard the prisoner say any thing about it? - No, Sir, I never was in his presence; I only had just a view of him at the wicket at the compter.
Are you quite sure he is the person that hired the chaise of you? - Yes, I have no doubt of it.
You had seen him before? - Several times.
There was no agreement to sell the chaise to him or any thing of that kind? - There was no positive agreement nor any thing of that kind.
Was there any conversation of that sort? - He said, now suppose I have a mind to buy this carriage, what might be the value of it, I said, I do not know exactly, but I suppose fifty guineas; that was not the post chaise he was to have had; for unfortunately for me another gentleman had that post-chaise, and went a tour to Margate, and did not return at the time he intended.
What answer did he make to what you said? - He said, he should see when he came home; he did not make any particular answer; I do not recollect he made any answer.
Did you part with the chaise to him in any expectation of his becoming a purchaser? - No, by no means.
By what name did he come to you? - By the name of Harrold; I knew him by that name and no other.
Mr. Garrow. What book is that you have in your hand? - It is called the hire book.
Will you be so good to favour me with a sight of it? - To be sure, Sir.
Are the places turned down? - Yes.
This is your regular day book to enter things hired? - Yes.
There is one entry of a chaise called Onslow's, seven days at six shillings per day crossed out; your entries were made at the time I suppose that the things were hired? - Yes.
On the second entry, the words that follow the word day are written upon an erazure? - Yes, he was called Mr. - at the Saracen's head at first, then the second time he was called Mr. Harrold.
Then there is inserted the additional name thus, supposed to be Semple; now, upon your oath, when was this written, which is written upon an erazure, I mean these words, his name supposed to be Semple? - I think it is three quarters of a year ago.
Will you swear that? - I have done it.
Do you mean to stand by that that you have sworn? - Yes, that that was put in about three quarters of a year ago.
Do you mean now again to swear that three quarters of a year ago you wrote these words, his name supposed to be Semple? - Yes, Sir.
It has continued then in your book for three quarters of a year? - Yes.
What was originally written there? - I believe there was a name of Mac something.
What was that Mac something? - I do not know I declare to God.
First you wrote Mac something? - No, Harrold first.

That stands distinct from it? - Yes.
Then at the bottom there is this, five shillings a day - his name supposed to be Semple? - I heard it was the Marquis of Carmarthen at one time; it was one name that I put down, but what the name was I do not know; it was not the right name; I was informed his right name was Semple.
So this you wrote three quarters of a year ago; by whose advice and recommendation and information? - I was informed by a man at Knightsbridge.
Favour us with that man's name? - 
               
                  James
                   Sadgrove
               



            , No. 2, Knightsbridge.
How long ago have you conversed with him about the defendant? - I believe it is about three quarters or a year ago.
Now state to my Lord and the Jury what that conversation was.
Court. You have no right to ask him that.
Mr. Garrow. I want to ask him what he said to Sadgrove about Major Semple and the post chaise, about three quarters of a year ago? - I told Sadgrove that he defrauded me out of a post chaise, or robbed me of a post chaise, or something to that effect.
Did not you tell Sadgrove that he was a d - d scoundrel, and he had got a good new post chaise of yours, and that you would arrest him for fifty pounds if you could find him? - Certainly, as a distressed tradesman I wished to recover my property.
I ask you now, Sir, upon the oath you have taken, will you venture to swear you did not tell Sadgrove that the prisoner was a d - d scoundrel, and he had got a good new post chaise of yours, and that you would arrest him for fifty pounds if you could find him? - I do not know that I ever said such a word.
You will venture to swear that you did not? - I do not recollect it.
Do you recollect asking Sadgrove where you could find him to arrest him? - I do not know that I used that word.
Would not you have arrested him then? - I do not know whether I should or not.
Had not you it in contemplation to do it? - No Sir, I do not know that I had any intention.
Court. Do not look at the effect or consequence of your answers, but give a fair and manly answer.
Mr Garrow. Did you never deliver a bill to any man? - No, Sir.
Not to the prisoner? - No, Sir.
Be careful, Mr. Lycett; do you swear that positively? - I swear that positively; I am as careful as you are.
Did you ever sue out a writ actually against him? - No, Sir, I never did.
Nor you never mentioned arresting him to Sadgrove? - I do not believe I ever mentioned such a word to Sadgrove; I am pretty sure I never did.
The first post chaise he had of you was a common hack post chaise? - It was a middling chaise.
Now this was a better one, not one that you would let in common hire? - I should not let it to every body; I should let it to a gentleman like you.
I am much obliged to you, Mr. Lycett, I am sorry I do not happen to live at your part of the town, or else I might be a customer; this second post chaise had pistol holsters? - It had; they were put in by the direction of the prisoner.
It had a net and a top? - There was a platform.
Did you put these to it after it was bespoke by the prisoner? - No, Sir, I fitted some things up to my own fancy.
You did not usually let post chaises with platforms? - Yes, Sir, frequently.
Had this chaise ever been let before? - The carriage had.
Had the carriage in the state in which it was delivered to the prisoner ever been let before? - No; I built it on purpose to let out on hire, to go on a job, or any thing of that kind; my servant delivered it, and he will prove the delivery.

Of your own knowledge you do not know to whom it was delivered? - I do not.
The value of it was about fifty guineas? - Yes.
You told me just now, before the prisoner went away, before the carriage went from your possession, he talked about buying it; he said, suppose I should have a mind to buy this carriage what may be the value of it? - He did it in a kind of air.
He did not do it so vulgarly as you and I should have done? - No, no, he was a great deal more polished than either of us; I beg your pardon though, Sir.
I am not angry with you, Mr. Lycett; his polish to-day will not hurt him, he will not be convicted to-day because he is a polished man, or a man of fashion; now Mr. Lycett, you have said that he said, suppose I have a mind to buy this carriage what may the value be? - I did; and he said he should see when he came home.
You expected him to be gone some such matter as three weeks or a month; if he had returned at the end of two months, and given you the fifty guineas, should not you have been pleased? - I should have been better pleased than I am now.
You would not have thought he had broken any contract with you; you say the first chaise was out seven days? - Yes.
How much did that hire come to? - Just six shillings a-day.
Do you remember receiving any other sums of money or bank note from the prisoner besides the payment of that chaise? - No.
Did you never receive a ten pound bank note? - No, I never saw any bank note; I have seen him pull out his purse with an air; he seemed a man of great consequence and property.
He seemed what he was then. - I never received from him the sum of ten pounds.
At the time you saw the defendant he was in custody? - Yes, he was in the Poultry compter.
Had you then seen Mr. Feltham? - Yes.
You have read a deal of stuff in the papers, charging this gentleman with a great many misdemeanors; the papers you know were full of the major, but now they have got the death of the king of Prussia, and Mrs. Nicholson to work upon, probably they will leave off the major; however Mr. Lycett, you know now that he was charged with a great many misdemeanors? - I have heard so.
Who carries on this prosecution? - I do not know; my pocket suffers for it.
I was in hopes Mr. Feltham's pocket suffered for it? - He may have a super-fluity of money; but I hope I shall always be able by my industry to punish a character of this kind; I think I am doing good to the public.
Court. Were the words at five shillings a-day written at the same time with the first part of this entry? - That was all but the name of Semple.
Mr. Garrow. Now my Lord, I say that upon that spot after the word day once stood or upon return to be paid fifty guineas; I say that no single name, Mac Carty or any thing else ever could fill up that place.
Mr. Lycett. Hand that paper up to my Lord.
Mr. Garrow. Let us have a peep at it first.
Mr. Lycett. I do not know that you have a right to peep at it before my Lord.
(Mr. Garrow looks at it and gives it him back again.) Now you may ask my Lord whether it is evidence; my Lord I submit that the words originally stood there; I could write them in that space myself.
Mr. Lycett. Can you? Why you can put it in, in a nicer manner than I can, I am but an aukward hand.
Court. There does not seem room for so many words.
Mr. Garrow. Yes, my Lord, these words, or return fifty guineas.
Court to Jury. The erazure is not the whole length of the line, the erazure seems to me to go from the word day to the letter B.
Mr. Garrow. It seems to have been fresh done, and it is sworn to have been done three quarters of a year ago.
Court. That last is a fair observation to go to the Jury; the other is a mere suggestion of your ingenuity, you have been measuring the words to see what could have been written there; you stated it first a little too much, and now you have narrowed your supposition to fit the place.
Prosecutor. Here is a few lines he sent me.
Mr. Garrow. They are totally immaterial; and only go to confirm that he had a chaise.
Prosecutor. I have some notion his hand writing can be proved, you will observe it says a carriage, in does not say his carriage.
Mr. Garrow. No, nor there is no date to it, so it may relate to the first carriage.
Court. (Looks at it.) It is totally immaterial.
From the Prisoner, sent to Mr. Garrow. I am desired to ask you whether the platform for this carriage was not made from the measure given you by the prisoner to suit his own trunks? - No, Sir, it was not made; it was a second-hand thing, I do not think it was, it was a great deal too big.
Was it made to fit, was it reduced to the size of his trunks? - I do not recollect that it was; I rather believe it was altered to fit his trunk, not made.
Did not you tell him that the chaise was intirely new, and that the wheels had never been out? - I do not know that I did; if I did I must tell him a story.
Will you venture to swear you did not? - I cannot swear I did; I cannot charge my memory with it.
As a serious man upon your oath did not you tell him that it was intirely new, and that the wheels had never been used? - I do not think I did.
Will you swear that? - I am sworn.
Court. You should answer with a little more respect to the gentleman.
Mr. Garrow. I have not treated you rudely, and I am glad the Court take notice of you; have you never to any body declared that you would arrest him if you could find him? - As a tradesman, not knowing what to do, I should have been glad of my money.
Would not you arrest him now? - I do not think I should.
Have you never told any body that you would? - I might.
Do you believe you did? - I really believe I did.
How long ago do you believe you said that? - God knows; I do not know.
Did not you say so at Knightsbridge? - I believe I might.
Did not you say you would swear to your debt and hold him to bail? - I said nothing about swearing to my debt.
Did not you say that if you could find him, you would arrest him for the debt of fifty guineas? - I do not think I said the debt of fifty guineas.
Did not you say if you could find him you would arrest him for the debt, is that your distinction? - I am not so experienced; I told people so.
Then you did so intend? - I talked of it.
Did not you intend it? - I do not know whether I should or not.
Did you tell people you should do the thing you did not intend to do? upon your oath if you had known where to have found him three quarters of a year ago, would not you have arrested him? - I do not think I should.
What makes you think you should not? - Because I never arrested a man in my life.
Did you ever prosecute a man before? - Yes, I did a Jew some time ago in this court; I am not fond of arresting; I believe I might tell people so, I dare say I might.
I am desired to ask you this question, whether if other persons had not applied to you, you would have brought this prosecution? - I really believe I should have done it chearfully.
Is not it by the desire of others? - I do not know that I am to be led.
Is it not by the desire of Mr. Feltham? - No, Sir, I do not know that it is; I have been exceeding happy in having Mr. Feltham's assistance.
Mr. Silvester. Did you apply to any attorney to take out a writ against this man? - No, by no means.
Court. I have one question more that I wish to ask you, and you will be so good to recollect as correctly as you can at the distance of time before you answer it? - Yes.
You say the chaise was hired at five shillings a day, you understood it was for three weeks or a month? - Yes.
After the price of the chaise was mentioned, was any thing said supposing he should keep it beyond the three weeks or a month, what was to be done then? - I am sure nothing of that kind was mentioned; I am positively sure in that respect; there was nothing passed of that sort.
Prisoner. Did you ever watch me any where? - Watch you! I have set my servants to watch you.
Did not watch me into a public house? - No, Sir.
Had not you taken instructions then? - No, Sir.


                  JOHN
                   MASHANT
               



             sworn.
I am an apprentice to Mr. Lycett; I delivered a chaise to a man named 
               
                  John
                   Deacon
               



            , about a twelvemonth ago.
What day did you deliver it? - I cannot directly say, it was about a twelvemonth ago.
Court. What sort of a chaise was it? - A post-chaise.
What sort of a post-chaise? - A new one.
Where did you deliver it to Deacon? - At the door.
Did he bring horses for it? - Yes.
How many? - Two.
Who is Deacon, do you know? - He is a post-chaise boy, and drove for Mr. Bolton at the Saracen's-head.
Mr. Agar. This you say was a new chaise? - Yes.
Do you know whether this chaise was bought or lent for hire? - I understood it was hired.
From whom? - From my master.
Is it usual for your master to let new chaises out to hire? - Yes.
Do you know of any alteration that had been made in the chaise? - No great deal of alterations.
What were these alterations? - They were baggage boards to put on before to put a trunk on.
Were not they on before they were let to the prisoner? - No.
That is what you call a platform then? - Yes.
Do you recollect any holsters made in this chaise? - No, I do not.
Which does your master let generally to hire, new or old chaises? - Both.
What most usually? - Old.
Do you recollect ever seeing the prisoner at your master's? - Yes.
Do you recollect ever hearing him treat respecting the purchase of a chaise? - No.
Mr. Silvester. What did he come about to your master? - About hiring a chaise.
Mr. Garrow. You know nothing of that but from your master? - No, the first time he came I heard him say he wanted to hire a chaise.
Mr. Silvester. Did you see him after that? - Yes, several times.
Did you see him this second time? - I cannot pretend to say, I do not recollect.


                  JOHN
                   DEACON
               



             sworn.
What are you? - A post-lad; I drove for one Mr. Bolton, about a twelvemonth ago, at the Saracen's-head, Aldgate.
Did you go for any chaise? - Yes; the 31st of August to Mr. Lycet's, for a post-chaise; a gentleman's carriage.

Who was it delivered to you by? - By that lad.
Who sent you? - My master; I put to my horses, and I took it to Knightsbridge; there I took up a single gentleman.
Should you know that gentleman? - I cannot be any ways positive to the gentleman; that may be the gentleman; but I cannot be positive to him; I drove him to the Crown and Cushion at Uxbridge; and he ordered a pair of horses; and I went with him then to the Duke of Portland's; I do not know the name of the place; I waited for the gentleman, and brought him back to the Crown and Cushion; then the gentleman took a fresh pair of horses, and where he went I cannot say; I can no way s be sure as to the gentleman; I did not see him out of the carriage.
Mr. Garrow. That is all you know about it? - Yes, Sir.
Mr. Silvester. Have you seen that gentleman before? - I drove him once to Barnet; to the lower Red-lion; he did not get out of his carriage, but had horses put on and went off immediately; as to his person I do not know.
Court. How long before had you drove him to Barnet? - I cannot pretend to say about how long; it might be a month or three weeks, but justly to the time, I cannot be sure; it was the same gentleman.
Why do you say so? - Because my master told me it was the same gentleman I had driven to Barnet.
Who did you go to at Knightsbridge? - To a hair dresser's shop on the left hand.
Do you know the name of that hairdresser? - No.


                  THOMAS
                   BOLTON
               



             sworn.
I keep the sign of the Saracen's-head.
Do you know that gentleman at the bar? - Yes.
Did you know him last August was a twelvemonth? - He was a customer of ours at the Saracen's-head.
What was his name? - Major J. G. Harrold, I think he called his name.
The other lad was a lad of yours? - Yes.
You sent him for a chaise? - Yes.
Who ordered you to send him? - This gentleman.
When the chaise came who went into it? - It did not take up at our house.
Court. But are you sure he ordered you to send a pair of horses for the chaise? - Yes.
To whom? - To Mr. Lycet, a coach-maker.
Where did he tell you he was to be taken up? - I do not know.
Where did the horses drive him to? - To Uxbridge, I think it is so entered in my book; I have the book here; it is my entry; here is the whole account while he was at our house; and here is the bill.
(Mr. Silvester reads.) A chaise to Barnet? - Yes, he had that before; he had a chaise to Barnet before from the same coachmaker.
Who drove him to Barnet? - I cannot recollect; I believe it was the same boy.
Mr. Garrow. Do you keep carriages yourself at the Saracen's head? - Yes.
Do you let them occasionally for a fortnight, three weeks, or a month to job? - Yes.
Had you any to let at that time? - Yes.
So that if a customer of yours had wanted a job carriage of yours, you could have supplied him? - Yes, I shewed mine to the gentleman, but it was not good enough; I went with him to Mr. Lycet's because ours was not good enough.
Did you go with him when he hired the second chaise? - No.
Did you go with him to look at any chaise? - I went with him two or three times at the first.
Do you remember going with the prisoner to look at a chaise to see what it was worth? - No, I do not recollect his asking me to go at all.
You did go there? - Yes.
Do you remember telling the prisoner afterwards that you thought fifty pounds was not a great deal too much for it, and that he might venture to give it for a carriage that was pointed out? - I do not recollect it, he might ask me some questions upon that head; I cannot say.
Do you recollect such questions or not? - I do not.
Are you confident he did not? - No, I am not confident he did not; I have no knowledge of any such thing happening.
Did not you go to the prisoner that night you looked at the carriage, and did not you tell him it would not be dear at fifty pounds? - That was the former carriage, I went with him.
Did not you tell him after having looked at a carriage? - I never, Sir, passed my sentiments on the value of it; no such thing.
Did not you go with him to Mr. Lycet's to look at a carriage, a post-chaise, and did not you tell him it would not be dear at fifty pounds? - I cannot charge my memory that I said so; I do not recollect that I gave him any answer; I certainly never put any charge or value upon it; I never heard any talk of buying a carriage.
You did not offer Lycett fifty pounds? - No.
Court. There is a direction pinned into this book on a slip of paper, who gave you that direction? - In that first account when he had a chaise to go to Barnet he borrowed two guineas of me in addition to his bill, and I begged he would write his name in the book, as I did not know him but by his discourse; and he wrote his name in that place where it is scratched out.
Who wrote this direction? - I wrote it; he paid me six guineas.
Who told you this direction you have written here? - He wrote only J. G. Harrold.
Who told you to add the other? - I believe by the communication and talk with this gentleman that he was an esquire, and came from the Hague in Holland; I unstood him many times that that was his title and that he came from there.
Prisoner. How often did you go to the coachmaker's? - I might go two or three times.
Did not the first chaise come to your house to take me up? - I do not recollect that.
Do not you recollect my taking you to look at a chaise which I told you I had some idea of buying, and shewed you a chaise before Mr. Lycett? - Yes.
You went with me for that purpose, did not you? - Yes.
Did not I ask you if you thought the chaise dear? - I cannot say.
Did I ask you that question? - Perhaps you might ask me.
Did not you go for the purpose of giving your opinion upon that chaise? - No, Sir, I do not recollect.
Mr. Silvester. My Lord, this is our case.
Court. Mr. Semple, now is the time for you to make your defence.
Mr. Garrow. My Lord, before he is called upon for his defence to the facts, I think it my duty to state to your Lordships, some observations upon the law of this case; upon which I shall take the liberty to submit to the Court, that he ought not to be called upon for his defence; because, in point of law the facts supposed to be proved against him, taking them all to be true, do not come within the cases that have been decided to be felony: the leading case on this subject is the case of Aickles; that is the last decision on the subject, and if I can distinguish this from that case, and antecedently from all those that case has noticed; then I trust you will be of my opinion. The old question was, whether, where a party who gave his property out of his possession, parted with it voluntarily out of his possession, into the possession of another, and that property was converted to the use of the person to whom it was so given, whether that could be a felony; and cases arose, that induced the Court and Jury to believe, that the possession was obtained merely colourably, that it was obtained with a felonious intent; therefore these cases were referred to the Jury; I resort to Aickles's case, because it seems the strongest; your Lordship knows the old case of a man that hired a horse to go to Surry, he did not go there, he instantly sold the horse, that was left to the Jury, it was a felony; for they were of opinion, that he got the possession of it with that intent; Aickles's case, you know, goes one step further; the note in that case, charged to be stolen by the defendant, had been put into his hands for the purpose of discounting it, it was to be paid over to the prosecutor, and out of which the defendant was to have his share, he carried it away with the leave of the proprietor, he never discounted it, but carried it to his own house. In all these cases the party never had the legal possession of the thing that was delivered to him, but upon an express contract which he broke; I take the liberty of saying, that this case is by no means like it; in this case he does it upon a contract that is by no means proved to be broken, it was in his option to compleat it or not, taking it in the strongest case; he hired the chaise for three weeks or a month, not to go to any definite place, not to perform any definite journey; the witness has loosely said, he understood he was going round the north, but that was no part of the contract; he was to pay a stipulated sum, then there was a time during which he had an entire possession of this, and during which he was to have the entire dominion of it, and he must have been answerable for damages, if any had arisen during that period. I am now puting out of the case, that which I dare say your Lordship expects me to say a word or two about; that is the idea of buying it at fifty-two guineas.
Court. That contract is not proved, the witness has denied that.
Mr. Garrow. I say that having the possion of this for three weeks or a month, he has not broke his contract, taking that contract to be so; if this party originally when he had taken possession of the property, had an honest intention to restore it, and afterwards had adopted a felonious intention, however his necessities afterwards, or his dishonesty might stimulate him to adopt a felonious intention, and he converts it to his own use, it will not be a felony; because, he must at the time he got possession of it from the proprietor have the felonious intent; he was for three weeks as much the owner of it as your Lordship is of your coach that you came here in to day; then I admit that one day before the end of the month, his necessities, or his bad mind, drove him to commit a felony; I say, he got this first honestly, and afterwards adapted it to this dishonest idea, and converted it to his own use; I do not desire in this case to go beyond bounds, what the witness took to be the contract, was the hiring for three weeks or a month, but he has admitted that there was a conversation about the price.
Court. I think I should stop you in this part of the case, for this clear reason, you are now stating it to be a question, whether the witness has or has not proved a different contract, that is a question which the Jury, and not I, must decide; I give you my opinion that supposing they are of opinion that the witness has proved a sale of the chaise, I shall certainly direct them that in point of law it is no felony.
Mr. Garrow. One little step further, if you state to the Jury that if the witness has proved that it was a contract with an alternative, either to pay fifty-two guineas or return it.
Court. I shall leave it to the Jury what the contract was.
Mr. Garrow. And that if they are satisfied that there is an alternative, there is no felony; but you see in this stage not having the honour of knowing your Lordship's opinion, if you agree with me; that if the contract was in the alternative; I hire this chaise, I pay you five shillings a day for three weeks or a month; I feel some difficulty in arguing it beyond the stating it; your Lordship sees, supposing a case to stand this way, for I really find it difficult to amplify at all on that position; A. B. goes to a coachmaker's and hires a chaise for three weeks or a month, and suppose he says, it is a pretty good chaise, if I should like to buy it whereabouts will be the price? and the owner says, the price will be fifty-two guineas; suppose A shall say, I will see about it when I return; the party who gets it has an opinion to do one of the two things; in that case I do not know how to argue about it, than merely to state the position; the man has the thing; if he pays the money it is his own; if he keeps it and does not return it, then it is the subject of a civil action.
Court. You are asking the Court to give an opinion on a case that is not before them.
Mr. Garrow. I put it thus, that there was conversation on the subject; but I shall take the liberty in two or three words to bring back my first position to your Lordship's recollection; I say, that in all cases that have been recited, there has been no intermediate time; here there is manifestly three weeks or a month, during which time no felonious intent is proved to operate; therefore as I am sure your Lordships will not make a new case, I doubt not but you will save the defendant the trouble of stating his defence.
Mr. Agar. I am of counsel also for the defendant, and I shall take the case in the strongest point of light in which it can be viewed, and I think this to be one of the most extraordinary efforts to convert the subject of an action at Westminster-hall into an indictment at the Old Bailey that ever was attempted; my Lords, the doctrine contended for, goes to the most dangerous extent, for it lays down this position, that if a man hires or agrees for a commodity, and keeps it one moment beyond the time stipulated, he may be indicted for a felony; it lays down this monstrous position, beyond the time stipulated; the same doctrine will hold as if a year! the law can make no discrimination with respect to the time; my Lords, I submit that the utmost that can be proved against my client is, that he has kept the subject he has contracted for beyond the time understood by the parties for which the contract was made; that is the strongest case, and I contend that no case goes yet to prove that position; that where any person has been guilty or has been supposed to be guilty of that fact, that it is felony; my Lords, I would ask the learned counsel for the prosecution, whether Mr. Lycett could not now commence an action in Westminster-hall, against the gentleman at the bar, and recover the price of the chaise from the time of the hiring to this time? I would ask whether he has not that adequate remedy in a civil action which is the properest for him to have recourse to? with respect to these cases that have been cited of constructive felonies, (but which I should be far from subscribing,) the evidence in those cases have uniformly proved it out of the power of the party hiring, to restore the property in the same situation; in the case of the horse, which is the most analagous, it is materially different, for having once sold it, it was impossible to restore it; now with respect to the present case, it has not been proved that my client has not now the chaise in his possession, and before he was taken up had not used it according to the terms of contract; and therefore without taking up any more of your Lordship's time, I should humbly presume, that such an indictment as the present cannot be maintained.
Court. You need not trouble yourself, Mr. Silvester, I believe the Court has no doubt, I am clearly of opinion that the Court is bound by the determinations in former cases, and supposing the Jury to be of opinion that the hiring was, as stated by Mr. Lycett, in his first account of the transaction, and that that hiring was originally made with the felonious intention of getting this property into his possession; I say, supposing the Jury should be of that opinion; I can see no difference between this case and that case of the King and Pares; it has been argued, that it would be extremely dangerous to hire any thing if this doctrine was to prevail; but if the party antecedent to any prosecution returned the property, that would be decisive evidence, that there was no felonious intention; and even if he did not return it; still the question is open to the Jury, under all the circumstances, whether the hiring was merely colourable, or whether the possession was originally acquired with a felonious intention: if there was a bona fide hiring, the keeping it beyond that time, will not constitute a felony; on the other hand, if the Jury should in the result be of opinion, that there never was a bona fide hiring, but that the prisoner made use of the pretext of hiring fraudulently to obtain the property of another man to his own use, there it is a felony: and I think by the cases that have been lately decided, both of the King and Pares, and the others that have been decided on the authority of that case, the law is now settled; and I have not subtlety enough to distinguish this case from those.
Mr. Justice Gould. I am entirely of the same opinion, and that it must depend on the decision of the Jury, whether there ever was a bona fide hiring or not: that case has been alluded to of Pares; I happened to be one of the Judges that heard that case a good deal debated, in the time of my Lord Chief Justice De Grey, (at his house I think it was) and the unanimous opinion of the Judges was, at last, that the direction that was given to the Jury by the learned Judge who tried the prisoner, was perfectly right, and that if the Jury were satisfied and convinced, from the circumstances in evidence, that he went with a guilty mind to obtain the horse, for there was the great argument, why the horse was delivered to him, he did not in truth and in reality, strictly speaking, divest the owner either of his property, or his possession; but that does not take the decision from the Jury, for it is for them to consider, whether they are satisfied that the contract was meant fairly, or whether it was a colourable thing for the obtaining the horse: the last gentleman, Mr. Agar, observes a difference between this and Pares's case; the supposed colourable hiring was to be determined in a day; he was to ride this horse on an expedition into Surrey, and to return the same day, the distance not being such as to prevent it; where is the distinction, if the fraudulent intention is the same, as to the time, if he had hired it for two days, or a week; obtaining the possession with the same fraudulent view and design, the law must be the same: the guilty mind is the same, that which is the foundation and constitution of all felonies is the same in the one case or the other; Mr. Agar distinguishes this from the case of Pares, for he was proved to have sold it, to have disposed of the horse; whereas in this case the prisoner is not proved to have sold this chaise; there is no proof of that kind; Mr. Recorder has said very truly, that if at a distance of time he had kept it, and supposing he had staid out six weeks or two months, and when he came back, he had offered to have returned the chaise again, certainly that would have been an evidence of an honest intention at the first, that would immediately turn the intention of a fraudulent design; but in this case a man hires a chaise for a month, take it at the utmost, and a year passes, very near a year, eleven months, and the man is not heard of, nor is the chaise heard of, when he is at last taken, and is under the charge of stealing this chaise, is the chaise forth-coming? does any one know where it is now? therefore that in my apprehension will be for the contemplation of the Jury, whether this man has not disposed of the chaise, and converted it to his own use; and therefore that will lead you back to the time of obtaining it, whether he did not obtain it with intention to steal it; therefore it is for the consideration of the Jury, whether this is not equivalent to that, that the prisoner at the bar has disposed of and converted it to his own use; then you are carried back to the instant of time that he obtained possession of it, whether it was not done with that intention; if that is the opinion of the Jury, this is a case that falls directly within the case of Pares: there is a case in Keeling, where a person took a lodging in the house, and afterwards, while the people were at prayers, robbed them; the charge was for a burglary, the Court held this, that obtaining possession by fraud was a burglary; another case, a man ordered a pair of silver candlesticks, when they were brought he sent the man back for something else; the Court held it was a felony, though in that case the delivery was in expectation of being paid money for it, and there was a colourable sale, and a bill of parcels left.
Mr. Recorder. They were taken from the bar of a coffee-house, I remember it.
Court to Prisoner. Now, Mr. Semple, if you have any matter to state to the Jury you may state it.
Prisoner. I went to Mr. Lycett's and hired a chaise, and paid him; I mentioned, that I wanted to purchase one before I returned to the continent; he shewed me one at fifty guineas or thereabouts; it was not finished; I told him, I would shew it to somebody; I got Mr. Bolton to give his opinion of it, which he did, and said, it would not be dear; I told Bolton afterwards I had fixed for the chaise, and desired him to send horses; the chaise was sent for and brought; at that time Lycett asked me about how soon I thought I could pay him, I told him in a year, and not sooner; he then asked me for some few guineas to pay the expences of fitting up; I asked him how much would do, and he said, five or six guineas; I gave him a ten pounds note in his own shop; I was at his house after the chaise was away; here are witnesses that will prove some facts.

                   SADGROVE
               



             sworn.
Mr. Agar. Do you recollect seeing the prosecutor at any time? - Yes.
Do you recollect a conversation he had with you? - Yes.
What was the subject of that conversation? - He came to my house to enquire after the Major; the Major lodged at my house; it was the latter end of September, or some time in September; he asked me for the Major.
Court. What Major? - Major Harrold; I told him, I did not know where he was, for the Major left my lodgings which he has not paid me for, nor I do not know when he will; we went into the parlour, he told me the Major had a carriage of him; that he had not paid him for it; he said, the carriage was fifty-two guineas; he said, as I understood it, that the Major was to have it upon trial for some time; and if he approved of it, the price was fifty-two guineas; if not he was to pay him so much per day or week.
Court. Is Mr. Lycett in Court? - Yes, my Lord.
Stand by, and attend to what this man says.
Did he mention his intention of suing out a writ against him, what more did he say? - I could not give him any information where he was, and therefore nothing more could be done in the business; I told him, if I found out where he was, I certainly would let him know; I saw the Major in town; I waited upon him for my money; I called on Mr. Lycett, and told him the Major was in town, but when I came to look for him he was gone from that lodging.
What did Mr. Lycett say? - He said, he would be much obliged to me for the information if I could give him any.
Did Mr. Lycett say any thing respecting what he meant to do? - If he could have found him he would have a writ for him.
Did he say so? - Yes, Sir, that it was his intention to arrest him.
When was this? - I cannot justly say to the time; I did not take any particular notice of the time; Mr. Lycett may have the letter which has the day of the month and year.
Are you positive that Lycett said he had a carriage of him? - He told me he had had a carriage of him, for which he was to pay him fifty-two guineas, if he approved of it; if he did not approve of it I imagine he was to pay him so much per day or week.
Did he say any thing respecting wronging him? - I sent him word he was in town; he said, he would be glad to find him; I told him where the lodging was; he went I believe to the publick house and waited for him; he told me he did; but whether he did or no I cannot say; he went to find out where the Major was, that he might have a writ for him to arrest him.
He said so? - Yes.
Mr. Silvester. Where do you live, Mr. Sadgrove? - At Knightsbridge; the gentleman lodged with me; I never received a halfpenny from him or any other person; there was a lawyer came with his father.
Mr. Garrow. Ask him if that was me? - No, Sir.
Was it Mr. Agar? - No; somebody came with the Major's father, I do not know who it was.
You was not anxious to imprison the defendant? - My sum would not do it.
Then Lycett told you this man had a carriage of his which he valued at fifty-two guineas, how long was he to hire it? - I cannot say.
Did you understand him that he had purchased it or hired it? - I understood he was to have it upon liking, and if he liked it, he was to keep it, and if not, he was to pay him so much per day or week; I have not received a halfpenny from any body upon my oath.
As to your part, yours was so much of a debt that you did not attempt to indict him? - I did, I went to Hick's-hall.
Prisoner. Was you advised by anybody to indict me? - Mr. Feltham's brother, I think he told me he was his brother or his brother-in-law; he came and fetched me to go to Hick's-hall; when I came they told me mine was a debt, which I knew before.
Court to Lycett. This man says, that you told him that the prisoner had had a carriage of you, and had not paid him for it, that the price was fifty-two guineas, if he approved of it, if not, he was to pay you so much per day or week; is that true, did you say so to Sadgrove? - No, my Lord, I told him that he had hired a carriage of me; I believe I might mention that he had intimated as much, and asked the price of it.
Did you ever tell him it was agreed that he should have it for fifty-two guineas? - No, my Lord.
You are sure you never told him so? - Yes.
You swear that? - I do.
Was the truth so, was that the agreement between you and the prisoner? - He never had it for a bargained price, nor he never had it at his option, nor I never told Sadgrove so.

             sworn.
I am a hackney coachman; I know the defendant.
Did you upon any occasion go with him or for him to Mr. Lycett's? - Yes Sir, I have drove him there frequently, at separate times, may be two or three times in the course of a week; he told me he had a carriage; I do not know Lycett, I never heard him say any thing there; he always got out of my coach, and left me, and went to the coach-maker's shop; I never went to Lycett's without I went with him.
Prisoner to Lycett. Have you made any account for these extra works in any day-book? - No, I never did.
Mr. Garrow. What was the value of the holsters? - I declare I do not know; they were old ones I had by me; I suppose about eight or nine shillings.
Whatever was done you made no charge against him for that? - No.
You would have sold it for fifty guineas including all that? - Yes, I believe I should.
Mr. Agar to Deacon. Did you ever go to Lycett's to enquire for Mr. Semple's carriage? - I went the day before and asked for the carriage of the gentleman at the Saracen's head.

                   Lycett
               



            . I will state to you the evidence before I state to you the particular question you are to decide, and my opinion in point of law: 
               
                  John
                   Lycett
               



             states to you that he is a coach-maker in White-chapel, and also lets out carriages for hire, &c. (Here the learned Judge summed up the evidence, and then added) Gentlemen, the prisoner is indicted for feloniously stealing and carrying away this chaise; that he took the chaise, that he had the chaise delivered to him by Lycett, and that it has not been returned to Lycett, is clear beyond a doubt; so far the facts are not disputed: the defence of the prisoner is, that though he had the chaise delivered to him, yet it being delivered to him by the owner of that chaise, and the property being transferred to him by the owner by sale; it was entrusted to him, and can only be converted into a debt for the chaise: if the fact was so, it would be a good defence in point of law; it may be dishonest from the probability of never being able to pay, if they had obtained a bona fide sale from the party to whom the property belongs; but it certainly is not a felony; for it would be of dangerous consequence if there could be any doubt about that law; but it is very clear in many cases, that though the actual manual property may be in the owner, yet in several cases it may be construed to a felonious taking in the party. The question for your decision upon this will be the intention of the parties, the prosecutor and the prisoner, at the time that the actual corporal possession of the chaise in question passed from one to the other; for it seems to me it is upon that, that the law of this case must depend; if it was understood between the parties, that the one was to become the purchaser, and the other the seller, though the chaise was carried off and never paid for, though the consideration was never paid, there is no pretence to call it a felony; and if you can be of opinion, from the circumstances proved today, that that was really the case, you will have no difficulty in acquitting the prisoner: on the other hand, if you believe what is said by the prosecutor, that the prisoner hired the chaise for a limited time, and carried it off altogether, and that although the prisoner has heard in the course of this trial, and though his counsel knew before-hand, that it would be very material to account for this chaise, yet it is not accounted for at the distance of a twelvemonth! that is strong evidence for you to presume that the prisoner converted and disposed of this chaise in some way or other to his own use. The charge then of the prosecutor is, that hiring this chaise for a limited time by the prisoner, and his converting it to his own use instead of returning it. Now if there was a bona fide hiring on the part of the prisoner at the time, if he really took the chaise with intention of returning it, and of paying for it at so much a week, or for the purpose of paying for it in a limited time; though afterwards he by necessity, or from a wicked disposition, had converted it to his own use, yet still that conversion would not be a felony; because by the bona fide contract at the time of delivery, and by the delivery by the rightful owner, he would have acquired lawful possession of the thing; and therefore though afterwards he abused that trust and that possession, it would not be a felonious taking in the first instance: but if you are of opinion that the hiring was only a pretence made use of to induce the owner of the chaise to part with the possession, and without any intention ever to restore it, or pay for it; in that case the owner never does part with the possession; for he has agreed to let the prisoner a qualified use in the thing, under a certain sum to be paid for it, and the prisoner having no intention to make use of that qualified possession, cannot by that means obtain it. If therefore you are of opinion that the prisoner bought the chaise from Mr. Lycett, though he has never paid for it, and has acted fraudulently and improperly, if you think that he actually bought it, and there is an actual sale, and an actual agreement, and that Mr. Lycett trusted him with the chaise, and so parted with the possession of it, you will acquit the prisoner; if you are of opinion that such was the intention of both parties at the time, though he might afterwards make a fraudulent use of it, it is not a felony: but if you believe Mr. Lycett's evidence, and think the hiring was only a colour to obtain possession of the chaise with a fraudulent intention to convert it to his own use, and not to return it to the owner, in that case I do not hesitate to tell you to find the prisoner guilty; because I do it in the presence of one of the most respectable authorities in the law, who will correct my opinion if it happens to be erroneous: if you are of opinion that the hiring was never intended as a bona fide hiring, in that case the prisoner is guilty in point of law: You will ultimately decide the question upon the evidence that has been laid before you, which it is your particular province to judge of, and upon which I shall not give you any direction, you are the proper judges of the evidence, and according to the opinion you shall form upon the facts as I have stated them to you, you will find a verdict of guilty or not guilty, according to the circumstances of the case.

            , otherwise Harrold, otherwise Kennedy, you stand convicted of felony, what have you to say why this Court should not give you judgement to die according to law?
Mr. Garrow. My Lord, before the prisoner is called upon to answer that question, your Lordship knows that the scope of my duty can be very small indeed, and I dare say that you expect I can be addressing the Court for no other purpose than that of arresting the judgment: I think it my duty to inform your Lordship that I am not going to make any such motion: I am only going to ask a favour of the Court: and my humble application is only this, that the judgement against the prisoner may be respited till the next session. My Lord, with all humility to, and with all satisfaction at the very solemn deliberate judgment which was delivered on this cause, I beg leave to point out some small circumstances, which, though possibly in my own judgment they could not vary at all this from the other cases, still as this case has struck some persons, and as the prisoner is extremely anxious, as no failure of justice can happen, I am sure the Court will forgive me for saying a word: The case against the prisoner is, that the Jury have found that he possessed himself of the chattel mentioned in the indictment with a felonious intent: I am at a loss after that finding to state any thing on the subject, but this observation has occurred, that in every other case of this kind there has been a palpable, clear and explicit evidence before the Jury, of which no man could doubt, that the felonious intention had possession of the man's mind at the moment he obtained the property of the prosecutor; for unless they found that at no one period from the moment of his obtaining the possession he had his mind free from the felonious impulse, they certainly could not find him guilty; for if this man got the possession honestly, and with a fair intent, and if he afterwards adopted a felonious one, then it would not be a felony: In all the other cases, as in the case of the horse, there was a palpable piece of evidence to go to the Jury, that he must in the nature of the transaction have got it for the purpose of stealing it, and therefore there could be no doubt on the subject. In the case of Aickles, (which I never like to travel beyond) the instant he got possession of the note, he did not do one act towards discounting it for the proprietor, but he instantly converted it to his own use; but here unquestionably there is a certain period in which the defendant might have had an honest intention: My Lord, I sit down after assuring your Lordship that I just mention this at the earnest entreaty of others, not from my own judgement, and I take the liberty to intreat that sentence may be respited until the next session, not to take the opinion of all the Judges, but at the earnest request of the prisoner.
Mr. Agar. My Lord, I beg pardon for troubling the Court with a very few words in addition to Mr. Garrow: In all those cases that have been cited there has been some direct, positive, absolute conversion of the property to the use of the person: now the direct and positive evidence of conversion in the present case as far as any positive evidence goes, only proves a fact which, prima facie, is strictly legal and just, namely the hiring and taking a post chaise, therefore the only ground on which a criminal intention may be presumed is the not returning the chaise; now I apprehend the Jury cannot infer a felony from such a circumstance, and no felonies have yet been so inferred, for that would be to make the Jury arbitrary in every respect, and they might by extending that power infer a different crime, the crime of murder or any other: My Lord, the next ground of observation that strikes me is this; this is a crime which is specifically ascertained by the legislature, and in the statute of the 30th of Geo. the 2d, against the fraudulent obtaining possession of goods, the legislature certainly had this particular specific crime in view; the crime which has been proved against the prisoner at the bar is precisely and specifically the crime provided for by the statute of the 30th of Geo. the 2d; being so provided for, I apprehend it cannot now be construed to be a felony: There will in future exist no such crime as that of fraud; for this doctrine, the doctrine contained in this case, I will assert goes the full length of this position, the abolishing of all frauds and converting them into felonies. I therefore humbly hope that sentence shall be respited by this honourable Court till the next session.
Court. This wears a shape, if one can put it into any regular shape at all, it seems to wear the shape of an application to the discretion of the Court, for it neither wears the shape of a motion for an arrest of judgment, nor can it wear the shape of a motion for revision of the verdict of the Jury. Every judicial decision must be governed by fixed rules, and some reason must be found to induce the Court to comply with the motion, and to prove that some end may be answered, which may account for that compliance: Now by the mere abstaining to pronounce sentence, no end could be answered at all, because between this session and the next, there is no mode in which the case of the prisoner could undergo any revision, or reconsideration; if the motion therefore means any thing, it means in indirect terms to call on the Court to reconsider the opinion they have pronounced in point of law, and to call in further advice, to which in cases of doubt we have the opportunity of resorting, which is the opinion of the twelve Judges. With respect to the case of the prisoner now at the bar, although no case has come within my knowledge which has appeared to me more free from legal difficulties, taking in all former cases; yet I feel peculiar satisfaction in recollecting that I tried the prisoner in the presence of one of the most learned and experienced judges, and best lawyers in this kingdom, a man deeply read in the law himself, and most intimately acquainted with all the decisions of the Judges; I say, it gives me much satisfaction to my mind that he was present; though if I had been unfortunately deprived of that assistance, and that sanction, I should have felt no hesitation in my own mind; but I had his private assurance before we closed that case that he had no doubts on the subject. The objections that have now been taken, seem rather to arraign the judgment of the Jury, for it is perfectly in the recollection of the Court, and of every person that attended to the trial, that the question, whether there was originally a bona fide hiring, or whether there was a felonious intent at the first in the prisoner, was wholly left to the Jury; then it may be doubted whether the Jury have formed a right judgment. In this, or in any other case, if there is reason to believe that the Jury have formed an improper judgment, on a question which they were competent to decide, the only redress is by application to the sovereign, to do away the effect of such a verdict; for the circumstance of a motion for a new trial is I believe without a precedent; however I think it justice to the Jury to declare, that I was most perfectly satisfied with their decision on the question, for the weight of evidence was powerful indeed, from all the circumstances of the case, that there never was at any moment an intention in the prisoner to restore that chaise to the owner; for it rested with the prisoner who has been in custody a considerable time, to have shewn any one period in which he had made a lawful use of that chaise; and at the distance of a twelvemonth he did not offer any particle of evidence, to shew that there ever was a moment in which he made use of that hired chaise, and in which it might be presumed he had an intention to return it; or to draw the least line in order to enable the Jury to judge whether he ever had any intention but a felonious one. The ingenuity of man is not sufficient to distinguish this case from those that have been repeatedly decided: it is sufficient to say, that all the objections that have now been mentioned, arising from the act of parliament for obtaining goods or money under false pretences, and the difficulty of drawing the distinction between frauds and felonies; all those general arguments have been fully considered by the Judges, in the decisions that they have lately made, and in justice to those decisions it is but right to add, that there are former decisions which go nearly as far: what my opinion would be if the law was not completely settled, it is not necessary to say: I can see no distinction, and that learned Judge whom I have mentioned could see no difference; therefore we considered ourselves bound by those decisions; and it would not be treating the Judges with respect, unless we could state some ground for a possible distinction. I am therefore satisfied, that no good judicial purpose could follow, by postponing the sentence. There has been one ground that has been stated, which I reserve for the last, and I mention it least it should at all mislead bystanders; for I think one of the positions laid down by the Counsel dangerous to men of the prisoner's description; because, when they adopt dishonest intentions they may be too apt to weigh, how far they may go consistent with the law, in what they may be secure, and what evidence will be necessary to convict them. The position I mean is this, that the Jury cannot presume a felony from such a circumstance as that of not returning the chaise, and that no felonies have yet been so inferred: I take the law to be directly and flatly the contrary, and in nineteen cases out of twenty the verdict is found upon presumptive and not upon positive evidence; and the highest crimes, not excepting murder itself, are perhaps of all others the most frequently convicted upon circumstantial and presumptive evidence only; for a chain of evidence that hangs well together, carries a much stronger conviction to the mind, than the positive testimony of a witness, of perhaps doubtful character; therefore felonies, even of the highest nature, are every day inferred from circumstances that go to the fact of the case I think it my indispensable duty to pronounce upon the prisoner, that sentence which the Court is of opinion his case justly merits; and if he has any hopes to mitigate that sentence, that application must be elsewhere: I am far from wishing to be understood as recommending that application, or as entertaining the least idea of its success. It now becomes my duty to pronounce on you the sentence that ought to follow on the verdict of the Jury: you have been convicted upon evidence -
Prisoner. My Lord, I only beg to observe, I believe it will be in my power to prove the prosecutor perjured; I have already one affidavit to that purpose; I have an affidavit of one witness, with whom Mr. Lycett has had a conversation concerning the sale of the carriage.
Court. The Court have no power to revise the verdict of the Jury; we are not competent or impowered by the constitution, to enquire into any fact subsequent to that verdict: Your proofs must be laid before your sovereign, for his mercy. Your peculiar situation is very different from that of those unfortunate wretches who generally appear at that bar: A man in superior rank of life, who has had the education which you appear, both from your demeanor and the circumstances of your case to have received; and a man who enjoyed the advantages of associating with persons of rank and character through many years of your life; these, far from being circumstances of mitigation, I consider as great aggravations! When men, in the rank of gentlemen, possessing the means of education, and the benefits of society, which you have possessed, are led either by profligacy of manners, or a depraved mind, to throw away all those advantages, and to put themselves on the level of common offenders; it is fit that they should receive as exemplary a punishment as the law can in such cases inflict. The sentence of the Court upon you is, that you 
               
                  James
                   George Semple

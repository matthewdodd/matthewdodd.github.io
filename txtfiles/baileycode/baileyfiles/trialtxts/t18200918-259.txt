, and live at Ratcliff-highway


. On the 9th of August, about half-past seven in the morning, a woman opposite said that a manhas got a scarf from your shop. He had been in the shop just before. The shop was full of people. He passed me going out as she spoke. I looked at him, he walked away about two doors, I touched him on the shoulder and said he had something belonging to me, and asked him to come back - he did so. I put my hand in his outside coat pocket and took out the scarf. He fell on his knees and begged forgiveness.

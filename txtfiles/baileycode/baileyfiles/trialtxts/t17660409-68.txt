            . I am an agent for the Navy
; I transact for officers. The prisoner brought a letter to me on the 12th of September; after I read it, I asked him if he brought it from Mr. Lackey; he said he did, and that Mr. Lackey desired his compliments to me; I asked him if he was to have some money of me; he said 3 l. I immediately paid him the money, and took this receipt on the account of Mr. Lackey.

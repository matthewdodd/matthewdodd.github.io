            . I am a bootmaker
, and live at Barbican


. On the 6th of August, about nine o'clock in the evening I missed a boot; I kept watch behind the door, and saw the prisoner take another away. I followed and overtook him in Moor-lane; he threw it behind him, and I picked it up - I lost him. I described him to the constable, and he took me to a place where we found him. I am sure he is the man.

JAMES STANTON. I am a constable. I assisted in taking the prisoner. We asked him what he did with the other boot? He said he put it under a board in Angel-court, Grub-street. He took us there, but we could not find it.

            . I am servant to Mr. Whitebread: the prisoner came into the shop to buy some lace; I saw her conceal a piece under the peak of her stays; I gave notice of it, and she immediately dropped it.
Q. Might she have put it there by mistake?
Peachey. She put it under her arm first, and from thence under her stays.
Mrs. Whitebread. The lace has my mark upon it.
Prisoner's Defence.
I went into the shop and asked the price of the lace; it did not suit me; as I came out my cloak swept it down; I did not take it.

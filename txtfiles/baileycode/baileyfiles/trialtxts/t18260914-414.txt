. I am landlady of the whole house; these articles are all mine - they were safe on the night of the 24th of July - they were taken from my wash-house, which joins my dwelling-house - but it does not open into the dwelling-house, it opens into the yard.
Q. In what state did you find your place the next morning? A. It was not broken - the wash-house door was only on the latch - they had got the articles over the wall.

On the morning of the 25th of July, the prisoner came on my beat with this bundle under his coat-skirts - he passed me nine or ten yards - I then seized him, and took him to the watch-house - these are the articles I took from him - he said they belonged to his mother.(Property produced and sworn to.)

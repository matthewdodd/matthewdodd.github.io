            . I am bailiff to Mr. Bacon, who has a house at Finchley


, which was empty. I examined the house, and found the coping of one of the cisterns stripped of fourteen feet six inches of lead, weighing about 90 lbs.; it appeared recently cut, and was very fresh. The house is the property of 
               
                  John 
                  William Bacon

            . I am constable of Hampstead. I met the prisoner about eleven o'clock in the morning in Shepherd's-field, Hampstead - it is three or four miles from the premises; they were each carrying a basket on his shoulder - I followed and took them into custody in Bellsize-lane. I found each basket contained lead, about 3/4 of a cwt. together. I tried it to the roof, and it fitted exactly.

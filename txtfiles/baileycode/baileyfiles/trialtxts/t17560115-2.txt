            . On the 30th of Dec. I was going out with some goods from my master's shop, a linen draper's in Leadenhall-street


, when I saw the prisoner near me, as I was in the same street; he put a handkerchief under his coat; I felt, and missing mine, I asked him if he had got my handkerchief: He said, No. I said I missed mine. He said, the man behind me had got it. He turn'd himself about, and threw my handkerchief on the ground; he then ran away, and was taken by a gentleman's servant in St. Mary Axe. (the handkerchief produced in court, and deposed to ) The prisoner said, if I would forgive him, he would never do so again.
Q. When did you see the handkerchief last?
Abraham. I had it in my pocket when I went out.
Prisoner's defence.
I am a watch-maker's apprentice
. I was walking down Leadenhall-street, where I saw a handkerchief lying on the ground. I picked it up; the prosecutor came and charged me with taking his handkerchief. I said it was not his. He said it was. Then I threw it on the ground, and said, he should pick it up, as I had done. He call'd, Stop thief, so I ran away.

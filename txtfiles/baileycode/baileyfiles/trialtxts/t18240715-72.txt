                  CETTI
               



            . I am a traveller, and sell barometers
. On the 5th of April, I lost a barometer from the Bull's Head, public house, Hitchen, in Herts


. I had left it there on the 30th of March, with a glass and a knife and fork, in a trunk. When I came to town on the 17th of April I heard they had been stolen.


                  JAMES 
                  REYNOLDS
               



            . My father keeps the Bull's Head, at Hitchen. Mr. Cetti had a box in our front room up stairs. I did not know what was in it. I saw the prisoner at my father's house, on the evening of the 2d of April; he was a stranger to me. He slept there on the 2d or the 3d, he was several times in the house, and went away on the 5th. I was not there when he left. The box was locked, and Mr. Cetti kept the key himself. He was in the habit of coming to Hitchen three weeks or a month at a time. On the 5th of April. I was at home, and my mother said,
"Come up stairs;" when I went up, I found the box had been broken open. I did not see the prisoner again till he was at Bow-street. I am quite positive of his person. Late on the night of the 4th of April, I saw him go up stairs with a lighted candle, he slept that night alone in the room, where the box was deposited.
Prisoner. Q. Can you swear that the box was not open on the 3d of April - A. No, I cannot swear that.


                  JOHN 
                  CETTI
               



             re-examined. I left the box locked.


                  WILLIAM 
                  MARSTERS
               



            . I live with Mr. Turner a pawnbroker, at the corner of Russellrcourt, Drury-lane, these articles were pledged with me on the 5th of April, about nine in the evening; I believe by the prisoner, I saw him again at Bow-street, and believe him to be the person. Iadvanced 23 s. upon them - they were redeemed on the 10th, but not by the prisoner - the barometer is here, and I believe it to be the same; it has the same general appearance, and the same maker's name.
Prisoner. Q. Did you ever know me before I pledged these articles - A. No - I believe you are the person you came into the shop, and then left, and came back and took the money I had offered you, so that I saw you twice.


                  WILLIAM 
                  DENNY
               



            . I am a broker, and live at No. 13, Shire-lane, Temple-bar. A woman brought the duplicate to me, and I took out the barometer - I think it was on the 10th of April, from Mr. Turners. I cannot be positive that this is the barometer. I sold it to Mr. Morris, of Clare-market for 10 s.


                  JOHN 
                  MORRIS
               



            . I am a cheesemonger, and live in Clare-market. I bought the barometer of Mr. Denny, and seeing the name of Cetti on it, I sent it to him to repair it.


                  JOSEPH 
                  CETTI
               



            . I am a maker of barometers, and live in Red Lion-street, Holborn. This barometer was brought to my house by Morris to be repaired; it was not in a finished state. I am no relation of the prosecutor's. I sell them to him unfinished, and he finishes them for sale - it would not be sold to a gentleman, without the inside tube was filled - it is now worth about 18 s.


                  JOHN 
                  SCOTT
               



            . I am a constable, I apprehended the prisoner at No. 46, Parker-street, Drury-lane. I told him I had an order from Mr. Denny to take him into custody, the woman was with me who sold the duplicate - I did not hear what she said to him, but I believe she told him what the charge was.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. The house has many lodgers. The gentleman states I was there three nights, and during that time he does not say the box was locked, but there might be other persons come into that room. The pawnbroker stated at Bow-street, that he believed I was the man, but could not swear it.


                  JAMES 
                  REYNOLDS
               



             re-examined. When the prisoner left the house, he got out of the front room window into the street, the door was locked - I was called to break it open, and found the window open, and the lid of the box standing wide open.



               GUILTY
            . Aged 28.




               Transported for Seven Years

Richard Egan, I live with the prosecutors, who are linen draper

s. The prisoner came to our shop on the 13th of December, and asked to see some handkerchiefs. I showed him some, he said, they were not of the kind he wanted; he desired to see a neckcloth; I sold him one, then he asked for a pocket handkerchief; turning round, I saw him secrete something under his apron; after he had bought the handkerchief, he said, he was going to Maiden Lane and he would call for the things and pay for them. I insisted upon seeing what he had in his apron; and then leaning over the counter I saw him drop the piece of handkerchief from under his apron. These are the handkerchiefs (producing them) they are the prosecutors property.

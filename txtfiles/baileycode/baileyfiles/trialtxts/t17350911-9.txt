            . My Mistress keeps a Sale-shop
, the White Hart in Houndsditch. The Prisoner and one who pretended to be his Master came to our House and ordered a Coat and Waistcoat to be made for the Prisoner - The Prisoner came to fetch them and he put them on and left his old Cloths, for which he said I must allow what they were worth, and go with him to his Master at the King's Head in Chancery-lane to receive the Ballance in Money. So I went with him, but his Master not being there he carried me to several other Taverns betwixt there and Charing-Cross to see for him; but not finding him I told my Chap he must go back and take his old Clothes again and leave the new ones; so we returned together till we came to St. Michael's Alley


, and there he run away from me, but I followed, and I cried stop Thief, and he was taken.

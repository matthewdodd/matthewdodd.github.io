                  John 
                  Greenwood 
               



            . On the 4th of March, about 8 o'clock, a servant to one Turner, a waterman in our neighbourhood, came and told us, his master had dodged three soldiers to the Cock in Aldersgate-street, each with a bar of iron; they went from our wharf.
Q. Where is your wharf?
Greenwood. It is called Dyers-hall wharf



, the nearest iron-wharf to London bridge. I went and looked to see what were missing, twelve bars of four inches and an half broad, half an inch thick, and about five or six feet long, not all of a length. I then went to the Cock, there were the two prisoners, and 
               Collins
             the evidence; the last had worked at our wharf some time; three bars of iron were also there, part of the twelve that were missing; the mark is done with the hammer when the iron is hot, it is a particular sort; the mark is called a double bullet. Bringing them to Wood-street-Compter, Collins began to confess, and said, they had taken three other bars, and sold them to 
               
                  Joseph 
                  Lewis 
               



             in Goswell-street, on the 28th of Feb. and when in the Compter he owned, he and the two prisoners had taken these three bars also from our wharf, which belongs to messrs. Ross, and Co. I have the care of the iron there.


                  John 
                  White 
               



            . I am a Cooper. I met the two prisoners and the evidence with each an iron bar on his shoulder coming up from the wharf to which Mr. Greenwood belongs, on the 4th of March, about a quarter after 8 at night, 
               
                  John 
                  Turner 
               



             was with me; we suspected they had stole the iron, we followed them to the top of the Old Jewry, there they pitched the bars; we passed them, and observed one of them look after us, to observe whether we took notice of them; then we went back to them, and asked them, where they were going to carry that iron? they said, to the Cock in Aldersgate-street, and that they took it out of a cart at the foot of London Bridge, and were to have sixpence each for carrying it. We asked them for whom they carried it? they could not tell the gentleman's name, but said he would be there as soon as they; we followed them there, there they pitched them, there was no person met them; then we spoke to the landlord to get a constable, to stop them till we could let Mr. Greenwood know about it; we sent to him, he came, and brought the mark on paper which we found stampt on the iron.


                  John 
                  Turner 
               



             confirmed the account given by White.


                  John 
                  Collins 
               



            . On the 4th of March the two prisoners and I went to Mr. Greenwood's wharf, and took each a bar of iron, with intent to carry to Lewis in Goswell-street to sell them, but the two last witnesses followed and questioned us where we had the iron, and where we were going with it; we told them as they have related, and when we came to the Cock in Aldersgate-street they stopt us and the iron, and sent for Mr. Greenwood.
Davis's Defence.
That evidence was the man that took the bars out of the wharf, and set them into the alley, and then took one, and desired us to follow him with the others. I have been along with him there seven times, and two other men along with me.
Addison's Defence.
I happened to meet Collins in the street, he asked me to go along with him, he brought me into the alley where the bars stood, we took them to Lewis's, and we sold them; after that we went another time, and were stopt at the Cock.
Davis called 
               
                  Mary 
                  Davis

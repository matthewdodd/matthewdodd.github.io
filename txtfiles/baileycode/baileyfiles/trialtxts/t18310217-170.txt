; I saw the prisoner and some other boy
s there; the prisoner came up to my side, snatched my cap off, and gave it to his companions - they then ran away, towardsFrench-alley; the other boys called the prisoner Joe - I was sent for to the Police-station on the Friday night, where I saw the prisoner, and knew him; I am quite clear he is the person who took my cap - I had seen him before; it was a new seal skin cap.

I received information, and looked for the prisoner, and on the Friday night I met him in White Lion-street, at half-past eight o'clock, with three or four other boys; he saw me, and ran towards Shoreditch - I went up to the corner of White Lion-street, and he was peeping round the corner; he then ran down Shoreditch - I pursued, and took him into custody; he said, "What do you want me for?" I said for a boy's cap which he had stolen on the Monday - he said, "Let me go home to my mother," but I took him to the station.

            .
MR. JAMES RALPH. I lost a watch, four spoons, and a pair of sugar-tongs, on the 7th of August; the prisoner had been my servant
 for about six weeks - he was a very good servant, and I was much surprised, as I had seen all these articles safe about half an hour before; they were taken from my kitchen; my servant came and said the prisoner was gone - he did not return at night: I had paid him part of his wages.

            . I apprehended the prisoner on the 12th of August, and asked how he came to do this; he said he did not know, but it came into his head all at once - I asked if he had taken any spoons; he said Yes, two, and had sold them and the watch for 30s.
Prisoner's Defence. I never had them.

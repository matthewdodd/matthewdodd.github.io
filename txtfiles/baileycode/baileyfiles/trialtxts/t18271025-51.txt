SAMUEL BOWER. On Sunday, the 30th of September, about four o'clock, I was passing along Broad-court, Bow-street


, with a lady, and just at the entrance into Bow-street I felt my coat pulled; I turned my head round, and perceived my handkerchief drop from the prisoner's hand- I immediately seized him, and had some difficulty in securing him - he got from me.(Property produced and sworn to.)

            . I saw the prisoner running away, and followed him; I took him to the corner of Wild-passage, Drury-lane, about one hundred yards from Broad-court; Mr. Bower came up very soon.
Prisoner's Defence. Directly I turned round he began to throw me down, which was the reason I ran; he knocked me about, and a young woman who was with him said I was not the man; he said, "I will send you where I have sent a good many more - I will transport you for life."
SAMUEL BOWER. The lady who was with me, said,"How could you see him take it? you could not see him," but she spoke under fear. I am sure he is the man - he was a short time out of my sight; he struck me, and knocked my hat off; I lost sight of him while I picked it up.

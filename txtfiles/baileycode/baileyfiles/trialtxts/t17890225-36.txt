PRISONER's DEFENCE.
Mr. Ireland employed me to drive the two pigs to Hyde-Park Corner, it was quite dark, and they parted, and I lost one, and I took the other home to my lodging, but my landlady would not let me abide at home with the pig, so I sold it to Mr. Bowtell, thinking to see the gentleman the next market day, and to give him the money.

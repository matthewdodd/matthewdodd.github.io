JOHN PHIPPS. On the 14th of June, about ten o'clock at night, I was in Church-street, Bethnal-green; at the end of Cock-lane


, the prisoner came behind me and struck me on my arm, and snatched my bundle from me, which contained the articles stated in the indictment; I was not aware of his coming, and did not resist-the bundle fell from me when he struck me. I followed behind him. He was secured. I am certain he is the man. It was a clear night.

            . I am a patrol. I heard the cry of stop thief, and saw the prisoner running. I secured him. Phipps said he was the man.
JESSEE LUDFORD. I am a weaver. I heard the alarm, and saw the prisoner running, with a bundle under his arm; as he passed, me he said, "D-n me, I shall get off now." I pursued, and saw him throw it away. I never lost sight of him till he was secured.

JOSEPH EDWARDS
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
10th of February, 1 coat, value 15s., the goods of 



Samuel Rabshaw.







SAMUEL RABSHAW
. I am a carter. On the 10th of February, I was with Pye's cart, in Spital-square, about five o'clock—I left my coat on the horse, and went into Mr. Eastman's, who is a customer of my master's—I was in there about ten minutes—when I came out, my coat was gone—I found the prisoner in custody with it—this is it.





GEORGE POCOCK
. I am a manufacturing chemist. I was passing through Fort-street, about five o'clock, on the 10th of February—I saw the prisoner and two others running—the prisoner had the coat under his arm—I immediately pursued—another person ran before him, and then he stopped—I came up at the corner of Petticoat-lane, and took him into custody, and took the coat from him—he said he hoped I would forgive him this time—I went back to find the owner.

Prisoner's Defence. I picked the coat up in White Lion-street.
(John Palmer, plasterer, of Ash-street; and Samuel Mardon, of Cock-lane, Shoreditch, gave the prisoner a good character.)




GUILTY
. Aged 22.—


Transported for Seven Years.

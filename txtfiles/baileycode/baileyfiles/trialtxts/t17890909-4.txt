             sworn.
I am servant to Mr. Atkinson; between two and three o'clock I watched the prisoner, and saw him take an earthen pot with twelve pounds weight of white lead ground in oil; he had worked in the morning for my master; he said he took it to mix it with other colour.
Prosecutor. Before I went out I mixed what colour I thought would be wanted in the course of the day; they always take it out in pots; he had not done half an hour's work for me, and that was in stone colour; he had no orders from me to fetch any colour.
PRISONER's DEFENCE.
I went to dinner with another young fellow, and we got in liquor; and by the persuasion of the young man I went and fetched the white lead, not knowing what I was about.



               GUILTY
            .
Tried by the London Jury before Mr. RECORDER.

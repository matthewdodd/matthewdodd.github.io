Julias Delavae. The prisoner was my fellow apprentice
; on the 15th of October, my coat and waistcoat were in my box, in my master's garret; I had seen them about half an hour past seven in the morning: I mist them about eight at night. The prisoner was taken up last Monday, then he confessed he had carried them and pawned them at Mr. Stiles's, where they were found. (Produced and deposed to.)

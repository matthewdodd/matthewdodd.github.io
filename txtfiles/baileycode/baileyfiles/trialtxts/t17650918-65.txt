            . I deal in hard ware and silver
; the prisoner came to my shop in Holborn


 on the 16th of August, under pretence of buying some, stone buckles and ear-rings. She chose some, and ordered them to be sent to a house in Great Kirby-street, saying she was niece to 'Squire Mitchel. After she was gone I missed a pair of plated shoe-buckles, and a pair of stone shoe-buckles. The next morning I took her in Cold-Bath-Fields; she immediately begged I would speak to her by herself, and said she would restore my things; she restored both pair of buckles, and a pair of file-stone ear-rings, which then I had not missed, and said she took them out of my shop.

GEORGE SORRELL. I am in the employ of George Dehane, a grocer
, in Kingsland-road


. On the 24th of November, about half-past five o'clock in the afternoon, this soap laid by the side of the door; I missed it, went out, and saw the prisoner with two more twenty or thirty yards from the house - the prisoner was in a stooping position, with a cake of soap in his hand; I took him with it - the other boys were near the rest of it; they got away - I lost eight cakes.

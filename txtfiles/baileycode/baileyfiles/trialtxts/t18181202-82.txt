HARRIET ROBINSON. I am a bonnet-maker
. On the 6th of November, I was sitting at work in the back-parlour heard a noise, looked up, and saw the prisoner taking the bonnets out of the window - he ran away with two. I followed him to Mile End-road. He threw them down, and I picked them up - he was stopped - I am sure he is the man.

            . I am mother of the prosecutrix. I ran out, and saw the prisoner with his hand in the window, taking the bonnets. A man stopped him - he was never out of my sight.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

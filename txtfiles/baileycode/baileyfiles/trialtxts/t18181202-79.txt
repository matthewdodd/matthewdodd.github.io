            . I keep a general sale shop
 in High Holborn


. On the 4th of November, just as I had lit my lights, I turned my back to walk towards the parlour, on turning round again I saw three people in the shop; it was the prisoner in custody of two persons whom I knew. They produced the violin, which I had hung over the door not three minutes before.
JAMES FURZEMAN. I was crossing Holborn when I saw the prisoner go into the shop. He came out and touched a young man with the violin who was looking in at the window. I took him.

HENRY GRISS (Police-constable F 137). On the 24th of March, I was at the Seven-dials


, between three and four o'clock in the morning; I saw a gentleman, who was a stranger to me, standing still, and the prisoner close behind him; I saw the prisoner take something from his trousers pocket, and put it into his own left-hand coat pocket; I went up and took hold of him - he resisted being searched; after a short time. I took from his pocket this purse, containing one half-crown, 12s, and 2s. 6d; the gentleman came and identified the purse; he gave the name of 
               
                  Henry

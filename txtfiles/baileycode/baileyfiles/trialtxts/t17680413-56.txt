            . I live at the corner of Chick-lane; I lost a parcel of butter, about twenty six pounds, on the 4th instant; I was told there was a man carried to the watch-house on suspicion of stealing butter; I went and found him there, then I saw the flat which he had the butter in; I can swear to that as my property, which my butter was taken away in.

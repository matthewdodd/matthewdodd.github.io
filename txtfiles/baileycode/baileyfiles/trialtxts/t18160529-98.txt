            . I lost this property in Broad-street, St. Giles's


, between twelve and one at night. Coming along the street a man ran against me, and I immediately felt a hand in my pocket, and I turned round immediately, and found the prisoner's hand in my pocket. I was as sober as I am this moment; she had the money in her left hand, and dropped it into her right hand. I held her fast until I got some one to 
assist me; and Smith, the patrole, came.

            . Between twelve and one, I heard the cry of watch; and on going up to the prosecutor, found he had hold of the prisoner.

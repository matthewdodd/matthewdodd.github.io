            . My husband's name is William: on the 16th of December the prisoner came to light a candle; after she was gone, my little boy said, Mamma, what did she take from the chair?

I looked, and missed a red cloth cardinal. No soul had been there but she. A young woman that knew where she used to pledge things, went along with one of my lodgers; there they found the prisoner was stopped.

            . I am a pawnbroker; the prisoner at the bar brought this cardinal to my house on the 16th of December; my people stopped her, and kept her there two hours. Then a person came to know if such a thing was pledged with me, by which means I came at the knowledge of the prosecutor.
Q. What did the prisoner say for herself?
Masters. She said the prosecutrix had lent it her to pledge for five shillings. [ Produced in court.]
S. Meeson. This is my cardinal, and which I lost on the 16th of December.
Q. Did you lend it to the prisoner to pledge?
S. Meeson. Upon my oath I know no more of that, than of going to France to-night.
Prisoner's Defence.
I lodged at Mrs. Meeson's house, and after we had been drinking. she asked me to go and pledge it for five shillings; and having other things there in my own name, I went with this to pledge.

            . I keep a coal shed
, on the 7th of April between seven and eight in the morning, I caught the prisoner in the coumpting house with the till, as I was backwards and forwards, I had left the key in the till, I secured him and called a constable, and then he throwed down twelve shillings on the table, there were just twelve shillings missing out of the till.
The constable confirmed his evidence.
Prisoner's Defence:
I went into the shop to buy coals, I was not in the compting house, I did not meddle with the till.



               Guilty

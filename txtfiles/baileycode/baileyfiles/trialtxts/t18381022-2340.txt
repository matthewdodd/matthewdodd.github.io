for stealing, on the

JOHN LLOYD
. I am a printer and publisher, and live in Catherine-street, Strand. The prisoner was my clerk and office-keeper, and lodged at the office—on the 8th of October I gave him into custody—he was searched at the station-house, and two duplicates were found upon him, one for a coat, and the other for some paper—I had missed the coat in May, and had questioned him very particularly about it, but he denied any knowledge of it—I also asked him particularly about the paper, and he denied any knowledge of that—it was worth 3l., and the coat 5s.

Prisoner. The two reams of paper belong to the proprietor of the "Torch"—the witness was merely a servant like myself. Witness. I am liable to make the paper good—it is my property—it was employed in publishing the "Torch."





EDWIN HEWITT
. I am shopman to a pawnbroker. The prisoner pawned two reams of paper, on the 8th of September and 21st of August—I have the duplicates here.





RICHARD SAYER
. I am shopman to a pawnbroker, in Drury-lane. The prisoner pawned a coat with me.





THOMAS BURN
 (police-constable F 140.) I took the prisoner into custody on the 8th of October, on a charge of assaulting Mr. Lloyd's child, being drunk—I searched him, and found these duplicates in his pocket.





JOHN LLOYD

re-examined. This is my paper and my coat—it was taken from the office.

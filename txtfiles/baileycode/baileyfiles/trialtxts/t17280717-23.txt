               stealing an Ox's Hide, value 6 s.
             on the 25th June
 last, the Property of 
               
                  
                     John 
                     Dun 
                  




                
            .
It appeared that the Prosecutor had the Hide taken from others that lay to be sold in Leadenhall-Market


 and that the Prisoner sold it to one 
               
                  Stephen 
                  Adams 
               



            , who was oblig'd to surrender it to the Prosecutor, it being found with his Mark upon it; and 
               
                  Stephen 
                  Adams 
               



             seeing the Prisoner a Day or two after in Shoreditch, caused him to be apprehended, remembering he was the Person of whom he bought the Skin.
The Prisoner said in his Defence, That he was in great Distress, and that he was very drunk, (which was a very extravagant Excuse for a Man in Distress) or he had not stole it, the Jury found him 


               guilty to the Value of 10 d.

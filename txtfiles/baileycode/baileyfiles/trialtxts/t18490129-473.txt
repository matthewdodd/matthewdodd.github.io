, stealing 1 coat, value 3l.; the goods of 



William Field; having been before convicted.






WILLIAM FIELD
. On 4th Jan., about half-past four o'clock, the prisoner came to my office, and asked for a party in Mincing-lane who I did not know—I saw my coat safe then—he came close to my desk, and asked for a "Directory"—I put one on the table—he said, "Thank you! I have got it," and left—I directly missed my coat—it has not been found—no one else was there—I identified him a week afterwards.

Prisoner. You are mistaken in me. Witness. I am sure of you—I noticed you particularly, through your impudence in coming to me through two partitions.





GEORGE SCOTT
 (policeman). I took the prisoner, and asked why he went to the office—he said he went to ask a question.

Prisoner. I deny it.





JEROME SULLIVAN
 (policeman) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's conviction—(read—Convicted Sept., 1847, of stealing a coat, and confined four months)—he is the person.

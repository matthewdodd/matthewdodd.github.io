WILLIAM JUPP. I am a corn-dealer
, and live at Brentford


 - I have a partner; the prisoner keeps a little shop
 at Stanmore; he dealt in coals
, and bought them of me. On the morning of the 27th of April he came and had 4 cwt. or 6 cwt. of coals of me - one of the men who works on the wharf came to me, and said my foreman wanted to speak to me; I went, and he said he wanted me to go into the loft to watch the prisoner going through the stable with corn, which he had taken out of the bin - I saw him go through once, and he had been twice before; I let him go off the premises, and then had him taken - I found these beans and oats on him; I compared them with those in the bin - they correspond exactly.
THOMAS RUDD. I am servant to the prosecutor. I watched the prisoner, and saw him take some corn from the bin; he saw me, and ran away - he had it in a basket; he brought it out, and put it into a sack in his cart - I saw him go three times into the stable.
HENRY CREED (Police-constable T 15). I was sent for, and found the prisoner with two sacks in his cart, there were oats in one and beans in the other.
The prisoner handed in a petition for a lenient sentence.

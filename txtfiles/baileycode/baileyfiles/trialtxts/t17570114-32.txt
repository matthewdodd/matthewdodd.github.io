                  Morris 
               



            . On Tuesday night the prisoner came down into my apartment, and desired me to let her have a quart of small beer. She carried my candle up into her room, and I went up for it.
Q. Do you both live in one house?
M. Morris. She has the first floor, and I live upon the ground floor. I left the key of my cellar upon her table, by the fire-side, and went to bed. In the morning I went into her room, and asked her for my key. She said you left no key here. I said, I left it upon your table. I went into my own apartment, and look'd about for it; not finding it, I went up to her again, and she denied it still. My shifts, and the other things mentioned, were carried down into the cellar over night, in order to be washed; but they were all gone the next morning.
Q. Was the cellar door lock'd afterwards?
M. Morris. It was.
Q. Did you find it lock'd the next morning?
M. Morris. I did.
Q. When did you see your things last?
M. Morris. I saw them over night, about eight o'clock, and the cellar door fast.
Q. Did you ever see your things again?
M. Morris. Yes, I have. They are here in court. ( The goods mentioned in the indictment produced in court.)
Mrs. Ransey. These three shifts, handkerchief, apron, and tablecloth, I received from the prisoner at the bar last Wednesday.
Q. to prosecutrix. Look at these things, do you know them?
Prosecutrix. These are my property. The same I lost that night. I lost more things than these.
Prisoner's Defence.
I never carried any such things to pawn. Mr. Silver Crispin, one of the jury, knows me, and if he pleases can give me a character.
Silver Crispin. I desired her not to call upon me. Her husband works for me, and he is a very honest man, and I believe he would be very glad to have her sent into another country.

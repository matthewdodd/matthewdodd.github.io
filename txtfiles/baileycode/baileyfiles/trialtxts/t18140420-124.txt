Q. Do you know of your own knowledge of the man prisoner visiting her at your house - A. No. We gave her warning; she quitted my service, and went to a Mr. Ingram, a latter, in Cheapside. I suspected her, and that made me insist upon her going away Mr. Ingram called upon me. I went with him the next day to search the box of Edward Brazely; Edward Brazely was confined in the watch-house at the time I searched two boxes, and there we found all the articles enumerated in the indictment. I took Susannah to be a single woman, and if I understand right, she was married while in my service. I believe her to be the wife of Edward Brazely.
ISABELLA HARRIS. I am the wife of the last witness. When Susannah was my servant, I thought my plates and dishes diminished. I had no certainty of her taking these things, so as to prevent me giving her a character. The articles found in

BENJAMIN PUTNEY
. I live in Monmouth-street. On the 20th of January I saw the prisoner Smith take a pair of half-boots from the cellar of Thomas Conolly, and put them into Walker's apron—they ran away with them—I alarmed the prosecutor—his son ran and caught Walker—I am sure the prisoners are the boys—they were not out of my sight.





THOMAS CONOLLY
. I keep the cellar in Monmouth-street—my attention was called to this—I went out—my son had taken Walker, and he had the half-boots—I kept Walker—my son pursued and caught Smith.





JOHN CONOLLY
. I went in pursuit—I took Walker with the boots in his apron—I then took Smith.

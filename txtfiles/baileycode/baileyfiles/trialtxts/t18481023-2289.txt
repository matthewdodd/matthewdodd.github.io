GEORGE SMITH



, feloniously being at large before the expiration of the term for which he had been ordered to be transported.






JAMES FREWIN
 (policeman, N 84). In consequence of some information on the night of 15th Sept., I went to an unfinished building in Hoxton Old Town, and there found the prisoner—I asked him what he was doing there—he told me he had got in there for the purpose of lying down—I told him I thought there was a serious charge against him, and I should take him to the station—I examined him there, and found his person exactly answered the description I had heard of him—I then told him I charged him with being an escaped convict from the York bulk—he said nothing.





FREDERICK POLLAR
 (policeman, G 214). I know the prisoner—I was Present at his trial on 14th June, 1847—I was a witness—he was transported for seven years—I have the certificate, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read—George Smith, Convicted 14th June, 1847, and Transported for Seven



Years)—the prisoner is the person to whom it refers—I saw him tried, convicted, and sentenced.

Cross-examined by
MR. O'BRIEN. Q. Did you know him before? A. Yes, and knew his person.





ROBERT STANIER
. I am quarter-master on board the York hulk, at Gos-port. I know the prisoner—he was on board the hulk on 31st last Aug. as a convict under sentence of transportation for seven years—he was employed on the public works ashore at Gosport—he was not under my charge—I missed him on 1st Sept., and never saw him afterwards till he was in custody Worship-street.

Cross-examined. Q. Were you the superintendent in charge of him? A. No; a ship-mate named Baine was—sometimes it happens that persons who have served half their time at Gosport, when their conduct is good, are discharged—we do not transport now for short periods; they send them out as emigrants—this man's conduct was not very good.




GUILTY
. Aged 19.—



Confined Eight Days, and 


Transported for Ten Years.

            , on the 18th of June

.
They were a 2d time indicted for 


               stealing two Curtains and a Pair of Stockings
            , the Goods of 
               
                  
                     Elizabeth 
                     Williams 
                  



                
            . It appeared that Bledall brought the Goods into a Room, where the other Prisoners were sitting, and so they were all found and apprehended together. But the Jury 

               acquitted
             them all except Bledall, who 


               confess'd the Fact in his Tryal upon the first Indictment, and pleaded Guilty to the 2d.

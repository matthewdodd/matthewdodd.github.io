for stealing, on the

Charles Stonestreet, from his person; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






CHARLES STONESTREET
. I live at Hillingdon. On Saturday the 29th of August, I was at the Bell Yard, Uxbridge—I sat down at the door, and fell asleep—I had all these things in my pocket, and a pair of shoes tied up in a handkerchief in my hand—the prisoner awoke me by taking these things from me, and the witness was pulling him from me—he pushed the other man down, and ran away—no one else had been there, to my knowledge.

Prisoner. Q. Was it moonlight or dark—It was nearly light, in the morning, about three o'clock.






CHARLES CLARKE
. I was sitting in the Bell Yard, up against the wall to rest—we were dozing till about two o'clock in the morning—I saw the prisoner's right hand in the prosecutor's left pocket—he flung me down, and went away—the prosecutor and I went down the yard after him—I waited till I could see him run out—I went and called the constable, and had him put into the cage about half-past five, there were three shillings found on him.

Prisoner. This man I never saw before—It is impossible for a man in liquor to swear to me.—Witness. I was not in liquor—I am sure that is the man that did it.





JAMES DARNELL
. I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got at Mr. Clark's office—the prisoner is the man.




GUILTY
. Aged 21.—


Transported for Seven Years.

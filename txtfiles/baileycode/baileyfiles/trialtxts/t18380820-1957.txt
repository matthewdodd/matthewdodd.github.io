ROBERT JOHNSON
. I live in Lion-street, Kent-road. On the 16th of August I was opposite the Horse Guards—I had a parcel in my pocket, containing sixteen sheets of paper, which belonged to Mr. Barclay Farquharson Watson—this is the paper which contained them—the papers have been taken out by Mr. Watson—they were the Abstract of some property in Essex.





JAMES WEBB
 (police-constable V 134.) About three o'clock on the afternoon of the 16th of August, I was near the Horse Guards, and saw the prisoner put his hand into this gentleman's pocket, and take out his hand-kerchief part of the way—he waited about two minutes, and then took out this parcel—I took him with it.

Prisoner. It was dropping out of the pocket, and I took it to give it to the gentleman. Witness. No, he took the handkerchief partly out, and then put it back again, because it was a cotton one—he then took this parcel from the left-hand pocket—it was not likely to fall out.

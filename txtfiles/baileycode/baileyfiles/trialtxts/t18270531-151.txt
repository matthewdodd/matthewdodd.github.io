JOHN FOWLER. I am a glass-coachman
. On the 1st of May, between eleven and twelve o'clock, I was waiting at Covent Garden Theatre


 for a party - I stood by my horses; my coat was on the box; I heard the coach creak, turned round, and saw the prisoner, who ran off, with it in his hand, and threw it to two companions, between Hart-street and Bow-street. I pursued, and seized him - he struggled hard, and bit my knuckle very much; some girls came up, tried to get him away, and said he was not the man, but I had not lost sight of him; I held him till the officer came.

DIEDIRICK KLINCK. I am a German. On the 28th of September I was at the King Harry, in Red Lion-street, Whitechapel


, about ten o'clock at night; there was fiddling up stairs - I went up; a man put his hand into my pocket, and took my money - I caught hold of him, and several of them beat me; the landlord came up, and took me down - I said I would not go without that man; they came down, and said I should fight, and they would give me fair play - I pulled off my jacket, and the prisoner was taken with it.

            . I am a watchman. I produce the jacket which I took from the prisoner - this shilling and this halfpenny were in the pocket; I was going to cry ten o'clock, saw the row, and the prisoner was running from the crowd with it in his hand - he turned the corner and I caught him; I asked him how he came by it - he at first said it was his own, and then said it was the man's who was fighting, and he was going to take it home to his wife; I took him to the watch-house, then went to the crowd, and brought the prosecutor, who claimed it.
Prisoner's Defence. I found the jacket half a dozen doors from where they were fighting.

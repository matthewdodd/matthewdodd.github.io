            .
THOMAS SCULLARD. I am a Hackney-coachman
 - my coach is No. 882; it stood on the stand in Bishopsgate-street


, on the 2d of July, about half-past eleven o'clock; I gave the horses some water, and put the bags to their noses; I then got on the box, and sat there about twenty minutes, when a friend came and asked me if I would copy a receipt for him - I said Yes, and we went to Jones' wine-vaults, but could not get a seat: we then went to the Bull's Head public-house, where they generally provide for coachmen - I was not absent more than a quarter of an hour; when I returned the coat was gone from the box, and I have never seen it since - I asked the waterman about it, and he gave me information.

            . I live at Mr. Jones' No. 152, Bishopsgate-street. I was in my mistress' room, dusting it, and saw the prisoner take the coat off the coach box and walk away with it, towards Artillery-lane; I went to see for the waterman and told him - I am sure the prisoner is the man - it was a light drab coat; I believe he was taken the same afternoon - I have known him these four years; he goes from one coach-stand to another, and gets his living as he can.
Prisoner. I was at Shoreditch church at the time - I get a job of watering sometimes, and sometimes go out with a coach.

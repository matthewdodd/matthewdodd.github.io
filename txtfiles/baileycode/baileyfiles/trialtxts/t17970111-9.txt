.
Mr. Knapp. My Lord, I am Counsel for the prisoners; the indictment says the parish of Whitechapel; I submit to your Lordship, therefore, that that will take away the capital part of the charge.
Court. It certainly does; but this is the second instance this morning of the gross negligence of the clerk of the indictments; and it is very unfit that persons should excercise the office who are so careless.

            . On Tuesday, the 26th of December, the window was cut about six o'clock in the evening; I was in a little room adjoining, I did not hear it cut, it was not ten minutes after I was out of the shop, the window was whole then; I looked out, and missed the ribbons and the shawls, they hung across a line that was tied on each side the window, the window was cut, and half the pane gone; my husband then went to the door, but did not see any body; on the Saturday morning afterwards William Peach, the officer, brought two shawls to my house.


                  WILLIAM

            ; I apprehended all the prisoners at Mrs. Waring's house on Friday the 9th, I apprehended them in the front room next the street; I found one shawl hanging upon a cupboard-door, the other was up stairs upon the bed that Mrs. Waring was in, this was the morning after the prisoners were apprehended.
Q. Was there any other person in the room? - A. No, only a child; these shoe-bows I found in a cupboard, the right-hand of the fire-place, below, in a front room; this lace I found in a bag in the room where she was; I asked her how she came by this shawl.
Q. Did you tell her it would be better for her to confess, or worse if she did not? - A. Not a word; she said, she had it of a tally over Blackfriars-bridge; the other, she said, she had bought, and it had been in wear two or three years; she said, she bought the shoe-bows, and the lace; I then took the things to the office; I did not take her into custody then,

            , her son, was there, Mrs. Waring came to the office to him and she was detained.


                  WILLIAM
                   WILLIAMS
               



             sworn. - Milton, and Green, and Waring, and I, met at Mrs. Waring's house about three o'clock; 
               
                  James
                   Waring
               



             asked me to come and write his mother a letter; Green is a cousin to Waring, Milton is a chimney-sweeper
; I found them all at Mrs. Waring's house.
Q. Did you write a letter for her? - A. No; when it came dark we went out together up Bethnal-green-road.
Q. Was any thing said before you went out, for what purpose you were to go out? - A. No; James Waring asked me to take a walk up the Bethnal-green-road.
Q. He did not say for what? - A. No.
Q. What was said about the letter? - A. His mother said she had got the paper, nor ink; we went out together, and when we got into Bethnal-green-road there was a shop open, and Waring stuck his knife into the putty and broke the window; he told us to stop just as he got to the shop.
Q. Did he tell you what he was going to do there? - A. No.
Q. Did you talk about what you were going to do before that? - A. No.
Q. Nor you did not ask him? - A. No.
Q. Did he say any thing to Milton and Green? - A. Not that I heard; he cut the window, and broke the glass, and took the things out of the window: two shawls, and two pieces of lace, a white piece and a black piece, some ribbon, some black shoe-strings, and a pocket handkerchief.
Q. What did you and your companions do while he was so employed? - A. We stood over the way; and young Green brought me some pieces of ribbon which he had taken from the same shop.
Q. What did Milton do? - A. I did not see him do any thing, he was standing the other side of the way, and walking backwards and forward; Waring told him to watch, and if any body was coming by, to whistle.
Q. Did Milton go to the place where he was told, and walk backwards and forwards? - A. Yes; and some persons went by, and Milton whistled, and then he came away from the window; a man saw the window, I believe, and then he ran away. Waring and the sweep ran over to me, and told me to take the things home to Waring's mother; I took the shawls from the window from Waring, I carried them to Waring's mother, while they went down Brick-lane; they told me to come and meet them, and I did, I left them at Mrs. Waring's; I put them upon a bit of a counter that is there, and Mrs. Waring saw me; I told her Jem took them out of a window; she looked at them, and put them upon a little shelf, and covered them with a little bit of cloth, and then we all went to the mother's, and she cut the ribbon in pieces, I had two yards and a half, Milton had two yards and a half, and Waring had two yards and a half, and the shoe-strings were given to the mother, and Green had the same, two yards and a half; the shawls the mother bought of us, the gave eighteen-pence for the dark shawl, and nine-pence-halfpenny for the other; we all had the money divided among us.
Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Honesty, you know that by giving evidence here, you are come to save yourself from being tried? - A. Yes.
Q. Have you ever been in a Court of Justice before? - A. I have never been in confinement before in my life.

Q. When did you tell this story for the first time; was it before the 
Magistrate? - A. Yes.
Q. You never told the story till after you were taken up for the felony? - A. No.
Mr. Knapp. (To Peach). Q. Did I understand you right, when I supposed you to say, that when, after you had been at Mrs. Waring's, and found the shawl, you did not take her into custody? - A. No, I did not.
Q. And then she herself came to the office, and then she was taken up? - A. Yes; she came to her son, and then she was detained.
Q. Mrs. Ivy. There is no mark upon these shawls, but they answer the pattern exactly; the white lace and the shoe bows answer the same.
Mr. Knapp. I understand you to say, there is not one article but what you know, merely by bearing a similitude to what you lost? - A. Yes.
Q. But you don't mean to swear to their being your's, but from the pattern? - A. No.
Q. The shawls are a very common pattern? - A. Yes.
Q. And the other things are common patterns? - A. Yes.


                  WILLIAM
                   BLACKITER
               



             sworn. - I know nothing more than apprehending the prisoners, and finding this ribbon in the room where the shop is, at Mrs. Waring's.
Mrs. Ivy. This is the same coloured ribbon as what I lost.
Q. Did you lose ribbons of that sort, and of those different colours? - A. Yes, exactly the same sort; there was about seventeen yards of this satin ribbon; of this blue ribbon I don't know how much there was.
Q. (To Blackiter). What is Mrs. Waring's business? - A. Her husband drives a hackney-coach, that is all I know about it.

                   Waring
               



            's defence. I know nothing of these shawls, nor the ribbon; there are some other things they have not brought forth that are mine; I know nothing at all about them.
Green's defence. I don't know any thing at all about them.
Milton's defence. I know nothing about them.


                  Elizabeth
                   Waring
               



            's defence. That shawl I have had these two years, it is a coarse thing, I gave but fifteen pence for it; it is the coarsest thing that ever was printed.
Q. (To Mrs. Ivy). Does that shawl appear to have been much in wear? - A. It does not appear to have been washed more than once.

 of a coachman who drove for me two or three years; she always bore a good character for any thing I ever heard; and I have known Green ever since he was a child; his father drove for us; he always bore a very good character.
Q. What is Green? - A. He has been with a publican these three or four years as a pot-boy
; his master was to have been here.
MARY GUNN sworn. - I live in East-passage, Cloth-Fair; I am a chimney-sweeper; Milton is an apprentice to me, and has been for ten years; he always behaved like a just, honest servant to me, and I am afraid has been drawn into bad company since I have been ill.

            . I am a carpenter
. I lost a saw from Mr. Cornish's, Black-friars


, on the 5th of December. The prisoner was taken up for another offence of the kind, and my saw was found pawned by him.

            . I live with Mr. Simons, a pawn-broker, in Knightrider-street. On the 5th of December this saw was brought to our house by the prisoner; I asked if it was his own; he said, no; he was distressed, and his father had lent it him. (The saw produced, and deposed to by the prosecutor.)
Prisoner's Defence.
I did not steal it, I found it. I am a printer
. I had not time to send for my friends, or else my master, Mr. Cornish, at Black-friars, would have appeared for me.

                  , Esq; on the 11th of March, about the hour of eight in the night, and stealing a table clock, value 10 l. the property of the said David, in his dwelling-house
            .
Mr. Murrell. I am servant to General
 Grame. He lives in Golden-square



. (A table clock produced in court). Between six and seven in the evening, on the 11th of March

, this clock was safe in the General's house, in the fore parlour; the window was shut but not the shutter. I went out, and came in at night, and the clock was gone.

                   Beaver
               



            . I was in that room that night betwixt seven and eight, and found the window thrown up and the clock gone. They must get over the area to get in at the window.

                   Ride
               



            . I keep the Hand and Crown oining Lawrence-lane, St. Giles's. About eight o'clock I went out of my house, and when I came to the corner I met four men; Hayes was one of them: the first of them put his hand to my breast and turned me out from the wall, and pushed me with this clock, which he had under his right arm: one of them that came after him struck me on my left breast and knocked me almost cross the street. I followed them, and asked them what they used me in that manner for; one of them came up to strike me; I hold up my stick, and bid him keep off: the man that had the clock put it down. A man came to assist me; then he that had the clock made off. I took up the clock, and cried, Stop thief! The man that came to assist me followed him; he ran into 
               
                  Stephen
                   Welch
               



            's house; I there went and took hold of him, with the clock under my arm. Welch told me he was one of his lodgers, and bid me take the clock and drop it in the street. I said I would keep the clock and the man too. I took him by the collar and brought him to the door. Welch said I should not take him out of his house without a constable. There was one Murrell came up to me and gave me a punch in the breast; then the man got away. I carried the clock to Justice Cox's that night.
Q. Did you take notice of the three men to know them again?
Ride. No, I did not. I cannot say the prisoners are the men: I know it was the lustiest of the three that struck me.



                  John
                   Hayes
               



            . I know two of the prisoners. I will not take it upon me to swear to 
               
                  Richard
                   Baker
               



            . I know Tomlin and Butler.
Q. How many names does Baker go by?
Hayes. He never was with me doing any thing. I do not know his name, no more than the Justice says his name is Baker.
Q. Tell your story what you know.
Hayes. We met in one house together, Tomlin, Butler, and I. This 
               
                  Richard
                   Tomlin
               



             at the bar, is not the man that was with us; that was another 
               
                  Richard
                   Tomlin
               



            . We went out on a Sunday night to look after something or another a thieving. Going thro' Golden-square we saw a window where this clock was. Butler got upon some flat rails and opened the window, and 
               
                  Frank
                   Comfort
               



             went in; he was in about five minutes: he desired us to hand him in an apron; I handed him in mine. He tied up the clock in it and gave it to Butler, who handed it to me, and I carried it all the way till this man met me, just by my landlord's house where we lived. Butler struck him in the breast; immediately he came to me, and as ked me what I struck him for. He asked me what I had under my arm. I let the clock down, and they made their escape, and I made my escape, and was taken in Cross-lane, by Little Queen-street. On the Tuesday following the prisoners were taken where they lived, and were at the Justice's when I was brought there, all three of them.
Q. Did you see that man at the Justice's that you call Baker?
Hayes. I did.
Q. Did you tell the Justice he was not one of the men?
Hayes. I don't know that I said such a word. I was a little in liquor.
Q. Have you ever sent to the Justice to tell him this is not the man?
Hayes. No, I have not. I have been bad of the soul distemper; I can hardly walk now.
Q. Tell me now, Is not that 
               
                  Richard
                   Tomlin
               



             that is at the bar now, the 
               
                  Richard
                   Tomlin
               



             that was with you in this robbery?
Hayes. No, he is not.
Q. Where is the other 
               
                  Richard
                   Tomlin
               



            ?
Hayes. I don't know where he is. He is thinner than me.
Q. Take care; tell the truth; Is this man that you call Baker, the Tomlin you gave information against?
Hayes. No. I did not say that was the man. I said it was one 
               
                  Richard
                   Tomlin

Butler's Defence.
This man knowing me to be an evidence two or three sessions ago, takes upon him to swear my life away.
Comfort's Defence.
I know nothing of it.

            . I am a horn-comb maker. I have known Butler from a child; he was a very honest lad for whatever I heard, till he lately fell into bad company.

            . I took the prisoners up in St. Giles's about a month go. Butler and Tomlin were together at Butler's mother's. I took them down to Mr. Welch's office; Hayes was brought there; he told Justice Welch that the clothes were sold to one Welch: we went to his house, and found the coat and breeches on a bed. I asked Mrs. Welch if any body else were there; she said not to her knowledge. We went up stairs, and found 
               
                  Francis
                   Comfort

            . On the 2d of March the parlour and kitchen windows were not shut; this was about eight o'clock. I bid the maid shut them. She returned, and said she believed we were robbed. I went into the parlour, and missed the things laid in the indictment. The room had been washed, and she had left the windows open to dry. They must come in at the parlour window. The things belonged to

            . Tomlin, Comfort and I, robbed this house; Comfort got on the pallisades, and in at the window; the windows were open: we took away two boxes, a tea-chest, and several small things, a pocket-book and a lottery ticket; in one of the boxes was two shirts, two stocks, a table cloth, a great coat, and a pair of breeches; we sold them to Mr. Welch for a guinea, which we shared amongst us, 5 s. 3 d. each. The things laid in the indictment produced, and deposed to by Mrs. Tovey.
Tomlin's Defence.
I know nothing at all of the things; nor never had any of the money.
Butler's Defence.
I never had any of the money. He wants to swear my life away.
Comfort's Defence.
I had none of the money.
All three

EDWARD MASON
. I live at No. 6, Oxford-terrace, Clapham-road; I am a banker's clerk. On Wednesday, 29th Oct., about a quarter past one in the morning, I was in High-street, Borough—I was on the left hand side of the way, going towards the Elephant and Castle, on the same side as St. George's Church—when I got to Stone's End, I saw the prisoner Hunter come out of a court—he bent his head down underneath the gas lamp and looked at me, and I did the same, and did not like his appearance—he was alone—I attempted to step into the road to pass him, when I felt a spring from behind, and was immediately seized by the throat from behind, before I could get into the road—I was walking very fast at the time, and when I was seized I had got within arm's length of Hunter—he was walking across me—he stopped when I was seized, and he immediately seized me by the right arm—another seized me by the left—I had a loose coat on at the time with a pocket at the side, and he seized my pipe case from it—I believe Hunter must have done that, he being on that side of me—I received a bruise at the time from the violence—he seized me by the arm, and seized the pipe case out of my pocket—I was then held by the arm after being seized by the hand by a third man—I struggled with them, and they held up my over coat, and put their hands in my wowsers; I do not wear braces, so they could not get their hands into my pockets, but they undid all the buttons, and pulled out my shirt, and after that they said "Quick"—I could not say which of them it was that said that; some of them did—they looked round and cried out "Quick," and then I saw the prisoner Murty for the first time—they tore open my over coat while he tried to unbutton the under one, which was closely buttoned up—I kicked him as hard as I could on the legs—they then said, "Squeeze him tighter," and that was the last I recollect—they all opened away from me when I kicked—the man behind still had hold of my throat at that time—I was calling out as well as I could, but of course I could not call out, I was only gurgling in my throat—I tried to throw the man behind—I could hardly move while I was held by the three, but I kicked the fourth one when he came to unbutton my under coat, and that startled them—after they said, "Squeeze him tighter," I became insensible—I scrambled up as well as I could, and I saw the policeman running after three, and I ran as well—I felt very unwell, and went home—I had been in bed about half an hour, when the policeman came to fetch me, and I gave him a description of Hunter in the hall, and I also gave a description of two other men—Murty is one of them—Hunter was brought to me, I should think, within an hour; it might have been an hour and a half—all the property I lost was my pipe case—I was very much hurt—I have a lump in my throat at the present time—my stomach was almost beaten to a jelly from the way in which they used me, and I have a large bruise on my left breast—I have had a great dizziness in my head ever since.

Cross-examined by
MR. SLEIGH (for Hwnier). Q. I suppose this outrage upon you was all the work of a minute? A. I should say about a minute, I could not judge of the time—it was about a quarter past 1 o'clock—it had struck 1 o'clock as I walked over London Bridge—it was foggy, but I could see clearly across the road—when the officer came to me, he said, "You must go with me to the police station; we have one of your men"—he did not describe the man—I said, I was very much hurt, and I would rather

not go that night—he said, "We dare not detain him till the morning; we have no doubt he is one of the men"—I said, "I will tell you what the man is like," and I told him—when I went to the station, Hunter was locked up in a cell—I believe he was brought out by a policeman into the room where I was, and I was asked if that was the man—but before they could get him into the office I recognised him, because his appearance is so ferocious looking—directly I saw him in the street I started, and would not have passed him at that time of night.

Cross-examined by
MR. METCALFE (for Mwrty) Q. You did not see Murty in custody till about ten days afterwards, I believe? A. No—I was then fetched to the police station to see him—I saw him in the same way as I had seen Hunter—the first time I saw him I said I could swear to him—before the Magistrate I had my doubts about him, but now I believe he is the man—I will swear to him—I saw him first on the Saturday night, about 9 o'clock—that was by gaslight—I saw him before the Magistrate on the Monday—that was by daylight—I had never seen him from the time I was robbed until he was in custody—I am quite sure about that—I went to a public house, kept by a person named Harris, near the Surrey Theatre—I went to several public houses one night, with a man in plain clothes, to see if I could see the men—that may have been about a week after the robbery—I saw a person called Bill, the carrier—he was brought out of the public house for me to see; I went in five times previously to look at him—Murty was not in that public house at that time, because I went and looked at the men five times—he was not standing outside the house; there were only two or three women there, who had been turned out—there were two policemen with me, one in plain clothes, and one in uniform—I will swear that I did not see Murty in the house; he may have been hid in another room—I believe Murty to be the fourth man, the one who came up to me after my pockets were rifled, and immediately before I was insensible.

MR. W. J. PAYNE. Q. At the time you saw Murty had you your senses about you? A. Yes, I had, and I gave him four or five good kicks, as violently as I could, being forced down towards the. ground; I should think they took effect on his legs, from his starting back so quickly as he did—there was a gas lamp exactly near the place, and in the struggle I was carried across, so that the light shone on the face of the men—I was carried some two yards in the struggle—I was certain of Hunter directly I saw him—I am certain of both of them—the more I look at Murty the more I believe him to be the man, and I swear to him, but there is a great difference between gaslight and daylight.





JOHN SMITH
 (policeman, A 480). On the morning of 29th Oct., about 1 o'clock, I was on duty near Stone's-and, in the Borough—I heard a noise on the opposite side, from the Ship public house, a scraping of feet, and scuffling about on the pavement—I went across very gently, and, when I got within about two yards of the kerb, some one ran away from a something that I saw lying on the pavement—the person that ran away had a cap on, and a pair of light trowsers—I saw him very clearly, because he had to run past me—I had a full view of him; it was the prisoner Hunter—he went into Trinity-street—I followed him very closely, and called out,"Stop thief!" two or three times—I lost sight of him when he got to the corner, because he was some distance before me, and he turned sharply round the corner of Trinity-street—I followed him down Trinity-street—I cried "Stop thief!" in Trinity-square three or four times after springing my rattle, and I heard the constable Armstead say, "Come on; I have got him"—he might

have been 100 or 200 yards off at that time—I went straight up to him, and found Hunter struggling in his arms—we brought him back to the spot where I had seen something lying on the ground, but it was gone.

Cross-examined by
MR. SLEIGH. Q. When you came up and found Hunter in the custody of Armstead, did you hear him say that he had been running after one man who had been knocking another man down? A. The words he used were, "You are mistaken, it is not me;" he also said, "There was a man knocked down, I am running after the man who knocked him down," or something very near it.

MR. W. J. PAYNE. Q. Had any one passed you between the time of your turning round the corner of Trinity-street and finding Hunter in the hands of the constable? A. No.

COURT. Q. Did you see one or two men go down Trinity-street? A. One, and only one; he was not running after any one.





JOHN ARMSTEAD
 (policeman, M 124). About a quarter past 1 o'clock in the morning of 29th Oct., I was on duty in Trinity square—I heard a cry of "Stop thief!" or "Stop him!" and heard some one running; he was coming towards me from Blackman-street—there was only one person—it turned out to be Hunter—I laid hold of him; he did not speak for some minutes; when the other constable came up, I took him to the station.

Cross-examined by
MR. SLEIGH. Q. I believe you were not actually in Trinity-square when you heard the cry of "Stop thief!"? A. Yes, I was—Trinity-street runs into the square—there is one other street called Church-street that runs into the square, there is no other—Swan-street is between Blackman-street and Trinity-street.

COURT. Q. Was he running after another man? A. He was the only person.





WILLIAM BROAD
 (policeman, L 23). On Saturday night, 8th Nov., I took Murty into custody between 8 and 9 o'clock, in Webber-street—I had been in search of him for some time—I and another constable were in a house having refreshment, and from something the other constable said to me I went to the door, and saw Murty running from Blackfnars road down Webber-street in the direction of the New Cut—I gave chase, and overtook him—I told him I should take him into custody for being concerned with another man who was in custody for assaulting a man and robbing him in Blackman-street, in the Borough, about a week ago—he said "If they had wanted me, why did not they take me the other night when they came to the house and took a man in custody? I opened the door to them"—I took him to Tower-*treet station, and there he said, "There are others ought to be apprehended as well as me"—Mr. Mason was sent for—I was not there when he came—previous to taking Murty I went with Mr. Mason to different public houses on one or two occasions to seek for certain parties.

Cross-examined by
MR. METCALFE. Q. Did you, among other places, go to a public house next to the Surrey Theatre? A. Yes, I was there one evening, when a man called Bill the carrier, came out—Murty was not there that evening, not in front of the bar; I did not see him—I did not see him standing near to Bill at the time the prosecutor was looking at him—I did not go into any room; but if he had been in front of the bar I must have seen him—he was not standing outside—I did not apprehend a man named M'Donald—I did not go to Murty's house at all before 8th Nov.—I believe some constable of the M division did—I think there is a constable here who was present when M'Donald was apprehended—I was not

there—Murty did not say, "You might as well have taken any other man as me for this robbery"—he said, "Others ought to be taken as well as me;" it was either "taken" or "apprehended"—I believe his words were, "Others ought to be apprehended as well as me"—I did not hear him ask the inspector to allow some other persons to be put with him, so that the prosecutor might select him from them—that was not done.

MR. W. J. PAYNE. Q. Had Mr. Mason before this given you a description of the prisoner? A. He had.

COURT. Q. Was he shown alone? A. He was not shown alone—I walked in with Mr. Mason, and in going into the room, he saw Murty sitting in the reserve room straight on, and without saying another word he turned round and looked at him, and said, "That is the man"—there was no other man there, but Mr. Mason was not aware that he was sitting in that room.

MR. METCALFE. Q. Tou brought him expressly to see that prisoner? A. To see some one—I had not pointed any one out to him.





ALEXANDER DEARING
 (policeman, M 38). On Saturday night, 8th Nov., I was with Broad when he took Murty into custody—I took him to the station—on the following Sunday night, as I was passing his cell door, he said to me, "Jack, you done it b—well to rights for me last night"—I said, "Oh, did I"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "You are to rights this time Tommy"—he said, "Yes, I know I am, I am to rights this time"—I have known him for the last five years—he knew me—he has called me Jack before—I have been a policeman very nearly six years.

COURT. Q. What is the meaning of to rights? A. I suppose he meant that he was got to rights for the case that I took him for—it is a slang term—it does not mean to write with a pen and ink—it is a cant phrase—I have heard it many times—it means, "You are in the right this time."

Cross-examined by
MR. METCALFE. Q. Was not this what he said, "I am to rights if you will do it for me?" A. No—I have stated all that passed—I went to Murty's house and apprehended M'Donald—Murty did not open the door to me on that occasion—I did not see him—I heard that he lived there—M'Donald was discharged—I had not seen Murty from the time of the robbery till I apprehended him.




GUILTY
.
(The prisoners were further charged with having been before convicted.)





THOMAS LETT
 (policeman, V 142). I produce a certificate—(This certified the conviction of Thomas Murty at Croydon, in July, 1853, 
of house-breaking, and that he was sentenced to fifteen months imprisonment)—I was present at that trial—Murty is the person referred to.





THOMAS GARFORTH
 (policeman). I produce a certificate—(This certified the conviction of 


Charles Connell at this Court, Dec. 1850, 
of larceny, after a previous conviction, and that he was sentenced to seven years penal servitude.)

Hunter. I plead guilty to my conviction. Witness. He is the person—in May, 1854, he received a ticket of leave—in July, 1864, he was tried at the Westminster Sessions, and acquitted—in August this year, he was tried at here for a robbery with violence, at a jeweller's shop, and acquitted—he has also been tried and convicted, and had eighteen months.

Hunter. When I came home from transportation, I obtained a situation at a beer house in the Waterloo-road, where I was getting a comfortable living, and supporting my wife and aged mother; I had been there a few weeks when sergeant Broad came and told the landlord I was a ticket-of-leave man, and if he allowed such characters in his house he should indict it; he told me to go; after that I drove a costermonger barrow, and be

followed me about the streets, telling my customers to see that their change was good, for I was a ticket-of-leave man; I was compelled to give that up; I went to live with my parents, and worked at tailoring, and every time I came in or out of the court where I lived, he would stop and search me, if any of the neighbours or their children were about; so that at last I could get nobody to trust me with anything; what had I to do? I would work if they would let me, but they will not.

HUNTER—
GUILTY. Aged 26.

MURTY—
GUILTY. Aged 30.

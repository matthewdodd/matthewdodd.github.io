            . I am a king's watchman upon the keys: on the 11th of March about a quarter before ten at night, I heard a ruffeling on board a lighter, I took a light and found the prisoner under the tarpanline; among the hogsheads; I took 2 lb. of tobacco from under his coat.

Prisoner's Defence.
I was employed as a merchant's watchman to take the lighter from the ship: some tobacco was thrown into the lighter; the officer said they had better throw it away.

            . I am a king's watchman; I was on board the lighter: I asked the prisoner where he got the tobacco from: he said out of the hogshead in the back part of the lighter. I asked him how he could do it; he said to get him a shilling to buy him something.

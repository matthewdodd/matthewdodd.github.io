 on the 30th of April, between three and half-past three o'clock in the day, at the Drawing-room; I lost my handkerchief, which I saw in the officer's hands.

            . I was on duty at the Palace. A. gentleman told me a person was picking a pocket; I pursued, and took the prisoner; he resisted a great deal-I got assistance, and secured him: I found six handkerchiefs, a snuff-box, and a ring upon him - the prosecutor's handkerchief was one: there was a witness who resembled the prisoner very much in the face, who gave his address at Chelsea; I went there, and it was false.
Prisoner's Defence. I felt something against my heel, and found it was these handkerchiefs; I took them up, and put them in my hat, but it was too heavy, and I took them out again.

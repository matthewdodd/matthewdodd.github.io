             sworn.
On the 11th of September, I was called down by somebody in the house, who said, they imagined somebody was stealing the wet linen; it was in a washing tub of hot water; I came down, and found the prisoner concealed in the coal-cellar, with the linen by her; she said, she only wanted to go to the necessary; I sent for the constable and delivered her to him, and told the constable where the linen was; I would not pick it up; I touched it, and it was quite hot.
THOMAS APPLETREE sworn.
I am a constable; the prosecutor sent for me, and gave me charge of the prisoner; I took her into custody; he told me where the linen was, which I took up; it was quite hot; I have had it ever since.
(The things produced and sworn to.)
PRISONER's DEFENCE.
They never took any thing from me; I never touched any thing.

. On the 20th of March I lost a ham, about half-past eleven o'clock at night - I did not see it taken, but the Policeman brought it back, and I believe it to be mine; I had had it in my hand twice that day - I do not see any difference between this and mine; it is the same weight and size.

            . I stopped the prisoner on suspicion, three or four hundred yards from the shop, with this ham under his arm - I asked where he got it; he said at a shop leading to Clare-market, which is the prosecutor's - I lodged him in the watch-house, and took the ham to the shop; he said he bought it at 5 1/2d. per lb., and it weighed 10 1/4lbs., but it weighs 12 1/4lbs. - he was going from the shop.
Prisoner. I said 6d. per pound.
THOMAS COURTNEY. It would have been 7d. per pound.
Prisoner's Defence. I saw this ham and asked the price - they said 7d. per pound; I said I would give 6d. for the whole, and it was weighed to me - it weighed 10 1/2lbs., and I gave 5s. 1 1/2d. for it.
JURY to JOHN RAWLEY. Q. Had he any money on him? A. He stated that he had none, but I believe he was not searched.

            . I took the prisoner on the 20th of October, and found the pots now produced at Mrs. Harris'.

            . I bought the whole of these pots of the prisoner, sometimes five or six in a day; I have not sold any of them - my husband has nothing to do with the business; the prisoner brought them in the day time - he said he had kept the Ship, but was reduced in business, and did not like his name to be known; I bought them without a name on them.

            . I am a box-maker. I was near Mr. Ingham's house on the 20th of January, about half-past eleven o'clock - I saw Williams come out with a bundle under his arm; Mason and another person went up to him, and Mason took the parcel from him; I followed till they came to the Minories, where they gave it to the other one - I informed the officer, and we pursued; the one who was carrying it got away.
JOSEPH INGHAM. I live with my father - he is a woollen-draper
. I know this to be his property.
BENJAMIN FIGGINS. I am the officer, and took the prisoner.
MASON'S Defence. When the officer came the witness said, "They are not the boys - let them go - it is the other;" then the other went on, and he said, "These are the two - take them."

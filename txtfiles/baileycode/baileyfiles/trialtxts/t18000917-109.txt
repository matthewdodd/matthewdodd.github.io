             sworn. - I am a wholesale grocer and tea-dealer


, in Upper Thames-street


: On Thursday the 18th of the present month, a little before eight o'clock in the evening; the prisoner at the bar was the going home he was brought back, and I saw the sugar taken from him in the cellar, upon the premises, from whence it was taken, he took it out of his stockings himself; his stockings were full of sugar, and a loose pair of trowsers let down over all; upon comparing the sugar, it was impossible to discover any difference.

             sworn. - I am clerk inthe house of Wild and company, the firm is 
               
                  James 
                  Wild

            , and 
               
                  John 
                  Boddy
               



            : On the 18th of the present month, I went into that part of the cellar, in which we had formed a stove for drying sugar; I there observed a tub full of raw sugar, covered with a sheer of brown paper; knowing it to be an improper situation for the sugar, I knew there was something wrong, it was a sort of sugar that we do not use for drying; after I came up, I observed the prisoner go there almost instantly, he continued there for half an hour; when he came up again, he was sent into the lamp-room to paper a few loaves; I then went down a second time, and observed, that a considerable quantity of sugar had been taken out of that tub; he was then going home, and had got several yards from our premises, when the other witness and I secured him and brought him back; we took him into the place from whence he had taken the sugar; he denied having any knowledge of the sugar that was missing, till it was felt through the trowsers; I then went for the constable; I felt the sugar under his stockings myself; I am certain, that which remained in the tub, and that which was found upon him, was exactly the same sugar.
Cross-Examined by Mr. Alley. Q. How long have you lived with Messrs. Wild and company? - A.Seven or eight months.
Q. The prisoner lived there before that? - A. Yes.
Q. Did you weigh the sugar afterwards? - A. No.

             sworn. - I am an apprentice to the firm of 
               
                  James 
                  Wild

                  John 
                  Boddy
               



            : On Thursday the 18th of the present month, between seven and eight o'clock, in consequence of suspicions that had been entertained, I stopped him about eight or nine yards from our door; I brought him back, he denied having taken the sugar, and denied having any till it was found upon him; I saw it found, there were twenty-one pounds taken from him; I compared the sugars, and they were exactly alike; from the appearance of it I believe it to be our sugar, but I cannot swear to it; I asked the prisoner if that was the way he served his masters every evening; he said, no, he did not do it above twice a week, sometimes he did not do it above once a fortnight.
Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Before he told you that, of course you told him, if he would tell the truth, you would forgive him? - A. No, I did not.
The prisoner left his defence to his counsel, and called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.

            . The Prisoner was my servant
; my husband was ill in the country, and I went to see him; when I came home the Prisoner was gone. About a fortnight afterwards she was brought to me, but the constable was in liquor, and let her go; he said to her, be a good girl, and come again tommorrow; but she did not come again. When she was taken up, she told me where the things were pawned, and I found them where she told me, pawned in her name.
The pawnbroker's servant proved, that those things were pledged at his master's, but being taken in by a servant who is since dead, he could not say the Prisoner was the person that brought them.

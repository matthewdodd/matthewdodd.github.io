            . I am shopman to Mr. Graham, linen-draper
, of High Holborn


. On the 22d of July the prisoners came together to the shop, and asked to look at some silk handkerchiefs which were in the window - I was in the shop, and they looked at them a long time before they attempted to purchase; a fellow-shopman was serving them; I saw Dover put one piece under her shawl; they continued to look at them a little longer - when I saw them going out I took hold of Dover, and said, "Are you not ashamed of yourself?" she then took it from under her shawl, and said, "If you will let me go, I will buy it of you;" Hammond might not have seen what was going on.

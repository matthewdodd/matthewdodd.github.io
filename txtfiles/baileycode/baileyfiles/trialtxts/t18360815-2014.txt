REBECCA SIMPSON
. I am the wife of Charles Simpson, of Brothers-row, Lambeth. On the 1st of August I was at Lambeth-stairs, looking at the rowing match, and had a red purse in my pocket containing the money stated—a gentleman came and told me something—I was my purse on the ground—a gentleman seized the prisoner—this is my purse—it has the money in it now.





GEORGE VICKERS
. (police-constable L 54.) About seven o'clock in the evening I was on duty, and saw the prisoner standing close behind the prosecutrix—I did not see him take the purse out of her pocket, but I took his hand from her person, and took this purse out of his hand—he let it fall on the ground.





WILLIAM ROWE
 (police-sergeant M 10.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, from Mr. Clark's office (read)—the prisoner is the man.

WILLIAM ROBINSON
. I am a carpenter engaged at the Half-way House, near Peckham. I had some planes and other tools, which I left in the building on the afternoon of the 11th July, and in the evening the basket of tools was gone—these are them.

WILLIAM SHEPHERD
 (police-constable C 208.) I took the prisoner, and found the duplicates of these tolls between the lining and crown of his hat.





WILLIAM WOODWARD
 (police-constable P 15.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction—the prisoner is the person who was then tried (read).

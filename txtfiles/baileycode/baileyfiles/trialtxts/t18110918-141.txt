            . The prisoner lived with me after she left Miss Rawlins; I live in Guildford-street, Bedford-square. During my confinement in June last I missed a variety of articles, and Mr. Lane likewise missed articles. The next morning I had all the servants in the room at the same time; I said it is a painful thing to accuse you, but I am sure it is among you and when I find it out I certainly will prosecute. The prisoner gave me six duplicates, one of which proved to be the duplicate of the gold locket. That was between July and 
               August.
             The prisoner lived with me rather better than three months; she had lived with me before a year and a half.
- . I am a pawnbroker. This locket was pledged in December last, I cannot remember who I took it off. I gave a duplicate to the person that pawned it.

            . I am an officer. This is the duplicate.
Pawnbroker. They correspond.
Prisoner's Defence. The locket was given me by a fellow servant who lived with me as cook.
The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave her a good character.

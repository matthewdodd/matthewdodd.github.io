JOHN STRACHAN FLEWEL
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
15th July, 1 box, value 2s. 6d.; 1 ear-ring, value 2s. 6d., and 1 pair of spectacles, value 5s.; the goods of 



William Nordish; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






TERRY NORDISH
. I am the wife of William Nordish—we live at Greenwich—in the beginning of July I left home, leaving my cash-box in charge of Mrs. Cotton—Ihere was a pair of spectacles and an earring in it—I have not found them.





MARY ANN COTTON
. I received the cash-box to take care of on the 15th of July—I he prisoner's mother lodged in the house where I was—the prisoner slept in the room where the box was that night, and in the morning he was gone, and the box also—I saw it safe at half-past nine o'clock the night before, and no one had been in the room but him from the time I saw it safe till he went out—he came back in three or four days—his mother accused him of it, and be said he took the box, and it was not of much value.





WILLIAM WILTON
 (police-constable R 216.) When the prisoner was remanded I asked him what it was for—he said for stealing a cash-box, but they would not find it out, as he had put it in Davy Jones's locker—he said he would not have taken it if he had known how little there was in it, that the woman had told a great story, instead of being 10s. in it, there was only 5s.





CHARLES GRINHAM
 (police-sergeant S 21.) I produce a copy of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got at Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 19.—

Transported for Seven Years.


Before Mr. Sergeant Arabin.

            . I am a publican
, and live in Catharine-street, St. Catharine's


; I lost a pewter tankard and a silver punch ladle; I did not miss them till they were advertised, on the 19th of June; when I saw them advertised as being stopt; the prisoner had been in my house the day before, in the morning.

            . I live at Mr. Jarvis's, a pawn broker, in Fetter-lane; the prisoner brought me this pewter tankard to pledge on the 18th of June, at night, just before we lit candles; I asked him what he called it; he said plate; I knew it was not, and therefore was convinced it was stolen: I sent for a constable, then he threw this punch ladle down upon the floor, and a shilling that was knocked out of it. (The tankard and ladle produced and deposed to by the prosecutor.)
Prisoner's Defence.
I know nothing of the matter. I drank freely at this gentleman's house in the morning; I know nothing of what happened afterwards.
White. He was very sober when he came to our house.

JOHN PADDON
 was indicted

 for stealing 1 handkerchief, value 2s. 6d., the goods of

EDWARD OVERTON
. I am steward of the steam vessel Griselle. About a fortnight before the 9th of August I was at the Gallic-tavern, Leman-street, in company with William Laurence, the other steward—we had a glass of gin, and after I came out, on feeling in my right-hand jacket pocket for my handkerchief, it was gone—the policeman afterwards brought the prisoner to me—this is my handkerchief—I had put it into my pocket, as I was going down stairs, two minutes before.





JOHN PERKINS
 (police-constable H 6) I was in the public-house—I took the prisoner into custody in the street opposite the tavern—I found the handkerchief concealed under his shirt—the prosecutor claimed it—the prisoner said at the station it was handed him by another person.

Defence. A boy came up, and said, "Will you mind this handkerchief? I will be back in half an hou."I put it into my pocket.





CHARLES RANDALL
 (police-constable H 18.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction—(read—Convicted 7th Nov., 1844, and confined six weeks solitary)—I was present at the trial--the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY

Transported for Seven Years.

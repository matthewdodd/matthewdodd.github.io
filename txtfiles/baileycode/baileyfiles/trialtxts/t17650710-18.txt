            . I am a merchant's clerk
. On Sunday the 30th of June, about half an hour after nine o'clock at night, I was coming up Ludgate-hill


: a gentleman was with me: I was on the outside; I felt something pull hard at my pocket; I look'd, and saw the prisoner with my handkerchief in his hand; he was behind me: I had two handkerchiefs in my pocket; I had fight enough of it to know which it was: I ran a good way after him; he cross'd the street, and a coach parted us: he got opposite to the end of the Old Bailey, in the passage that goes to Blackfriars; there he was taken: there my handkerchief was taken from the ground, and delivered to me. (Produced and deposed to.)

             Saul. I was at the Cock alehouse in that passage: I heard the cry Stop thief; I ran out, and took the prisoner by the collar, an d took him into the ale-house: I saw him drop this handkerchief just as I came to the door.
Prisoner's Defence.
I was coming along, and heard the cry Stop thief; I ran up the Cock in the corner, and this young fellow took hold of me, and said I dropt the handkerchief. I never saw the gentleman that owns it.

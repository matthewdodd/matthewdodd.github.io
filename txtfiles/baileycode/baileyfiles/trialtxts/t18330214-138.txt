            . I am assistant to Messrs. Underwood and Todd, drapers
. On the 7th of January I was walking over Blackfriars-bridge


; I put my hand to my pocket, missed my handkerchief, and found a companion of the prisoner's lifting up the flaps of my coat - I seized the prisoner's companion; he declared he had not the handkerchief, and passed it to the prisoner - I then seized the prisoner; he protested he had not got it; he got to the rails, and threw it into the water - I had seen it was my handkerchief; I detained the prisoner, and gave him to the officer - his companion got away.
Prisoner. I was a dozen yards behind him, and I ran up to see what was the matter. Witness. No, they were arm-in-arm, and close together - the prisoner was within a foot of me; I told him if he would give me the handkerchief I would let him go.

             (City Police-constable 91). I went up and took the prisoner - he said another person took the handkerchief, and he had nothing to do with it.

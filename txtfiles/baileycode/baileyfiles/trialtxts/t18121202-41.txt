                  BARTLETT
               



            . I am porter to Messrs. Wyatts, leather-cutters and leather-sellers



, Coleman-street


. I live in the house where the business is carried on. The prisoner, Challon, was their carman
. Taylor is a porter
 in the neighbourhood.
Q. Messrs. Wyatt do not sleep on the premises - A. None of them. I do, with my family.
Q. Did Challon bring in the keys of the stable of a night - A. Yes, he did.
Q. On the 27th, in the morning, when he came for the keys had you examined the stable on the over night - A. I went as soon as I came down stairs, the first thing, and examined the doors. I found the door unlocked. Challon came to work a little before seven in the morning. On the morning of the 7th, I recollect his coming for the keys. He took the keys from their place. I took up the dust tub, and I followed him, and put the dust on the dung-hill. When I went out of the door I saw the prisoner, Taylor, on the spot adjoining our premises. He was walking by our premises. He made a stop, as if he wished me not to see him. I went on with my tub to the dung-hill. I did not see Challon go into the stable. I heard the door. I returned back immediately. I saw Taylor had gone past the alley that goes up to the stable; I placed myself in a situation where I could watch him. In a few minutes I saw Taylor came back, and go up towards the stable. He was gone about three or four minutes. I saw him come down with this bag upon his shoulder. I followed him immediately down Coleman-street. I walked behind him a few yards. I was satisfied what was in the bag. I laid hold of the bag. I said, what have you got here. He said, a parcel that a man gave me to carry up the street a little way for him. I told the prisoner, Taylor, it would not do, I must have the parcel. I brought the parcel into my master's premises, and went to my master. Mr. Burkitt came immediately. I told him what had happened. He ordered the carman into his accompting-house. Challon came into the accompting-house, where master and the bag was. Master asked Challon whether he had any knowledge of that bag. He said, he did not know that he had. Master said, you do know, and you know that we know, and it is useless for you to secrete it. I was then ordered to fetch a constable, which I did.
Q. At the time that you saw Taylor on your master's premises, with the bag upon his back, was he ever out of your sight - 
               A. 
            No, not until I took him. I am sure he is the same man.
Taylor. Where did I go to when you took the bag from me - A. You went off towards the Dolphin public-house.
COURT. Had he any bundle or bag with him, when you first saw him - 
               A. 
            No.

             BURKITT. The names of my partners are 
               
                  Robert 
                  Wyatt
               



            , 
               
                  Robert 
                  Burkitt
               



             Wyatt, and

                  Wyatt
               



            , and myself. We are leather sellers, in Coleman-street. On the morning of the 27th, in consequence of information from the last witness, I sent for Challon, and when Challon came in I asked him if he knew any thing of that bag. He denied all knowledge of the bag. I than sent Bartlett for a constable. When Bartlett was gone out of the accompting-house, Challon fell on his knees, and begged that I would pass it over. I said that was impossible; the law must take its course, for I suspected a long time we had been robbed. I told him it was near two years. He replied it was not more than twelve months. The man returned with a constable. The bag was opened, and I was positive the property was ours. I then locked Challon in the accompting-house, went into the street, and saw Taylor, the other prisoner, opening the shutters of the adjoining premises. I cought hold of him by the collar, and brought him into our warehouse. This was about half past seven. I sent the officer and Bartlett to search Taylor's lodgings. Nothing was found. Challon was confined in the accompting-house and Taylor in the parlour. The sole leather is marked by my partner, 
               
                  Clement 
                  Wyatt
               



            . It is of the value of between six and seven pounds. Challon lived with us two years the last time. He had lived with us previous. He was our carman.


                  CLEMENT 
                  WYATT
               



            . Q. You are one of the partners in this house - A. Yes.
Q. What time in the morning did you see Challon - A. About a quarter before nine. I can swear to that sole leather. It is chiefly of my own mark. I saw the bag in the accompting-house, and Challon, I said, well, William, so this game is out at last. I said, you need not hesitate; I have been aware a long time that you have robbed us, and I said, that as a proof to you that I have been aware of it I have reason to believe you left a parcel some time since at a public-house in Little Britain, for a cobler to call for it. I asked him, if that parcel did not contain dressed leather. He said, no, he had never taken any thing but sole leather. He told me the way he got into the house was from the stable into the loft, from the loft into the adjoining shed, from the shed down two ladders, into our warehouse, and he had taken this leather off the shelves were we customary put this leather; that he had given it to Taylor to carry to the Dolphin public-house for him, and that he had done it frequently before.
Challon's Defence. I asked the prisoner Taylor to carry it. He did not know what was in it.
Taylor's Defence. I have been a porter in Coleman-street for ten years. On this morning, I was coming up the street, this man asked me to carry this parcel, as far as the corner of White's-alley: he would pay me for carrying it; and there would be a person to take it of me of the name of Robinson: and do you know, I was stopped before I got there. The man that took the bag from me, he carried if home. As to know that the goods in the bag were stolen, I did not. I am innocent, in that respect, as a child unborn.

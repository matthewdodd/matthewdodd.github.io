             was my shop-man
. In consequence of information I received, I went to Mr. Salkeld, pawnbroker in the Strand. I there found an epaulet, that belonged to me, pledged for twelve shillings. I obtained a search warrant, and searched the prisoner's lodgings the following morning. I there found a quantity of duplicates between the mattras and the bed, and some of my goods scattered all over the house.
THOMAS PACE. I am a constable; on the 15th of September I went with a search warrant to the prisoner's house. Mr. Simmonds found the things, and duplicates, and gave them to me. There is forty-four duplicates; ten duplicates at Salkeld's, and six at Ashman's, in the Strand. These are the duplicates of articles pledged at Ashman's.
Mr. RITT. I am shopman at Mr. Salkeld's; one of the prisoners pawned at our shop for seven or eight years. I produce a pair of pantaloons, two waistcoats, a pair of trowsers, an epaulet, a pair of gloves, and a pair of breeches, and a waistcoat piece; these were all pledged by the woman.
Prosecutor. I am certain they are all mine; and the epaulet is mine; the epaulet is worth two pounds fifteen shillings.

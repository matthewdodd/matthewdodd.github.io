JAMES MARTIN
 was indicted

 for embezzlement.


MR. DOANE
conducted the Prosecution.






JOHN BLACKBURN
. I am clerk to the Newcastle and Shields Company, in Fenchurch-street. On the 17th of December the prisoner came to the office, and presented an order on the captain of one of our ships for the payment of 14l.—he said he came from Mr. Hovey—I gave him the money, and he gave me a receipt which is attached to it—(order read)—"Please to pay T. Hovey 14l. for discharging the brig Six from Quebec.
"ALEXANDER PERRING."





THOMAS WILLIAM HOVEY
. I live in Grove-street, Deptford, and am a waterman and lighterman—the prisoner was in my service. On the 17th

of December I directed him to get the money for this order, and get back to me as soon as possible—(I gave him the order at half-past eight o'clock in the morning)—and when he came back, if I was not at home, he was to leave the money at my house—he never brought it—I saw him again on the 31st of December—I found him in his own bed—without my saying any thing to him, he said, "I am very sorry for it; for God's sake have mercy on me, on account of my family"—I said, "You have not considered my family, you had better come with me, and save me the two guineas reward which I have offered"—he said he had received nine sovereigns and a £5 note, and that he had lost 9l. and spent the other 5l.—he had been in my employ between three and four years, discharging ships and loading them—I have trusted him to receive money three or four times a-year.

Prisoner's Defence. I spent the money, and when I came home I gave myself up to him, and said I would pay it at so much a week, but he would not allow it—he took me out of the house, saying he would not hurt a hair of my head, and then brought me before the Court.




GUILTY
. Aged.—


Transported for Fourteen Years.

Before Mr. Common Sergeant.

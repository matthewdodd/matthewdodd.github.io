James Macken.






WORTHINGTON STRINGER LODGE
. I am foreman to Mr. James Macken, a tailor, of Little Knightrider-street, St. James's. I saw the prisoner on 31st July—he told me he was going to Osborne-house, to be presented to the Queen and Prince Albert—he had before sent a letter, saying that he required a Court dress, to go to Osborne-house, and I saw him on the subject of the letter at 20, Duncan-terrace, Islington—he hired these things, he did not buy them—I let him have them, and he was to return them in two days from Osborne-house—he was to pay his respects to the Queen as a clergyman, in the name of the Rev. Mr. Liebaiel—I sent him the things, a black coat, waistcoat, and breeches; a cocked-hat, and shoes, and knee-buckles, and a white stock—he said he would return them by a Queen's messenger, he could get them sent to Buckingham Palace for half-a-crown, and then they could he seat to us—he was to pay three guineas for them—we never got the things back—we sent to Osborne-house, and he was never known there.






WILLIAM ATLEE
 (policeman, L 110). I went to 20, Duncan-terrace where I found this card-plate and some cards, "Rev. A. C. Liebaiel, Bombay"

John Fairbern. I live in Charles's-Court, St Martin's


. The prisoner lodged at my house up one pair of stairs backwards. I lost the goods mentioned in the indictment from out of my back parlour. She had been gone out about a quarter of an hour. She was taken with my wife's apron, handkerchief, hat, and necklace on. Produced in court and deposed to by prosecutor's wife. The prisoner confessed the other things were at her new lodging in Wapping; we went and found them accordingly, and two table spoons, that she had pawned one to Job Jones, the other to 
               
                  Jane 
                  Honderson 
               



            . Produced in court and deposed to by prosecutor's wife.
The two Pawnbrokers deposed to the taking the spoons in of the prisoner; and Mr Smith the constable to that of her confession, and the finding the things.
The prisoner said nothing in her defence.

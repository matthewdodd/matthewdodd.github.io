            . I am the wife of William Vickers, who lives at Wanstead, Essex


. On the 25th of November I lost the things out of my yard, where they hung to dry.
FRANCIS FREEMAN. I am an officer of Lambeth-street Office. On the 27th of November I heard of the robbery, I went and found the prisoners in Swan-yard, East Smithfield, and told them I came to search the room-it was Cole's room; I found a handkerchief and an apron there which the prosecutor claimed; Coles said they belonged to his wife, pointing to Stiff. I found she flounce of the prosecutrix's gown in her work-bag.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
COLE's Defence. I let the bed out to different people.
STIFF's Defence. I went to Cole's room that night, and know nothing of it.

                  Upington 
               



            . I am servant to Mrs. Poor. On the 17th of this month the prisoner came to our house to work; he is a plaisterer
. My mistress having business to do abroad, she desired me to look after this man, for she heard a bad character of him. I had been in the room all the time till three o'clock, then I went up to drink a dish of tea with Mrs. Eagen: Mr. Eagen had occasion to go down stairs, I desired him to look into the room, for I had a caution given me of Tobin's not being honest. He came up, and said, he was surprized at my mistress's leaving one of her trunks open; I said, Lord, she did not! I went down into the roomand the three trunks were upon the floor.
Q. How long was you absent?


                  Sarah 
                  Upington 
               



            . A little better than a quarter of an hour: when I went into the room he had buckled the strap over the key-hole; I unbuckled it, and there was a piece of a key broke in. The prisoner desired I would let the trunk be therefor he had occasion for it to put his scaffold upon: I told him any thing of weight would split it. We took it out of the room, and went up stairs, and left him at work as before.
Q. Did you find the trunk open, or shut ?


                  Sarah 
                  Upington 
               



            . It was shut when I came down, but it was not lockedand when I went up stairs it was.
Q. Were all three of them unlocked ?


                  Sarah 
                  Upington 
               



            . No, only one, and the locks of the other two were so damaged we could hardly open them.
Q. Did you examine to see whether any thing was taken out ?


                  Sarah 
                  Upington 
               



            . I did not; when my mistress came home in the evening, I asked her whether she left it open or no; she said, no, here is the key; says I, here is a key broke in the lock, and there was not a soul in the room but Mr. Tobin. She looked, and missed the things.
Q. from the prisoner. Did you find me in the room when you came down ?


                  Sarah 
                  Upington 
               



            . No, I did not.
Pris. Did not I desire to have them moved outbecause there was size and whitingand it would stick to them ?


                  Sarah 
                  Upington 
               



            . No.
Pris. Did not you say you had got a cloth to cover them ?


                  Sarah 
                  Upington 
               



            . I did not say any such thing.
Pris. Did not you help me to move the trunk ?


                  Sarah 
                  Upington 
               



            . No, not till after it was broke open, it was not offered to be moved. The prisoner was by and heard his wife offer half a guinea she had in her pocket, and would pay half a guinea a week afterwards till the worth of the things were paid.
Q. Did he contradict that, and say he would not have it done?


                  Sarah 
                  Upington 
               



            . No, he did not.

            . The prisoner came to work at my house on the 14th of May; the second day he was at work I lost five full trimmed shifts, five sheets, three pillow-cases, a table-cloth, a child's mantle, and three aprons. I lost them out of a portmanteau trunk in the room where I laythat was the room where the prisoner was at work in.
Q. What is your husband's name?


                  Elizabeth 
                  Poor 
               



            . Nicholas.
Q. Do you know any thing of the prisoner's having the things?


                  Elizabeth 
                  Poor 
               



            . I did not come home till ten at night; I went up, and there found the key broke in the lock: they were all lost out of one trunk: it is in court; the pick lock, or keyis now broke in it. (The trunk produced in court, with part of the key broke in.)
Q. What business is your husband?


                  Elizabeth 
                  Poor 
               



            . He is bred to the sea; at present he is abroad. I took this house for a pawnbroker's shop; it is not fitted up yet.
Q. Have you any lodgers?


                  Elizabeth 
                  Poor 
               



            . I have Mr. Eagen and his wife, they are as honest people as any in the world.
Q. Have they any servants ?


                  Elizabeth 
                  Poor 
               



            . No.
Q. Was there any offer made you about making it up?


                  Elizabeth 
                  Poor 
               



            . There was in the room, when his wife offered half a guineaand half a guinea a week to make it up.
Q. Did the prisoner hear her?


                  Elizabeth 
                  Poor 
               



            . He was near enough to hear that.
Q. Did you ever hear him confess any thing?


                  Elizabeth 
                  Poor 
               



            . No, Sir. I asked him if he was not ashamed to come into people's houses and rob a lone woman; he said, serve you right, you b - h. He broke the other locks, and if he had got them open, he might have robbed me of five hundred pounds value. I never could open them since; they are just as he left them; I must get a smith to take them off.
Q. from the prisoner. Was I by when my wife offered you any money?


                  Elizabeth 
                  Poor 
               



            . He was; and he and his wife were a singing in the constable's house.
Prisoner. It is very unaccountable I should be singing, and taken up on suspicion of a robbery.
Q. from the prisoner. Did not you send to my lodgings and search them ?



                  Elizabeth 
                  Poor 
               



            . No, I do not know his lodgings.
Q. from the prisoner. Did not you break open my boxes and trunk ?

                  Poor 
               



            . No, I did not know his house.
Q. to Upington. Was there any other person in the house when you went up to drink tea?


                  Sarah 
                  Upington 
               



            . There were nobody in the house but Mr. Eagen, his wife, I, and the prisoner; I was in the fore chamber.

                  Upington 
               



            . No, there could not.
William Eagen. I lodge in the prosecutrix's house, and as I came down out of my own room, Mrs. Poor's maid desired I would look into the room to see what the prisoner was about: I looked in, and saw the trunk open, and saw some linnen in it; I ran up stairs, and asked the maid how her mistress came to leave the trunk open; and when we came down there was the flap over the lock buckled too?
Q. Was the trunk open or shut when you came down?
William Eagen. It was shut, and buckled down with that strap, and there was either a picklock or key broke in the lock. When Mrs. Poor came home I saw it opened, and there were not all the things taken out.
Q. What people were in the house at the time you saw him in the room?


                  William

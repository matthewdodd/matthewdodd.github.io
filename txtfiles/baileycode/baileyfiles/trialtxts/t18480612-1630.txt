MARGARET DOYLE
. I am fifteen years old; I live with my father John Doyle. On 7th June, between nine and ten o'clock, I was at a fair in Acrelane, Brixton—I felt a tug at my pocket, and found the prisoner's handcoming out of it, and missed a shilling—I told my mother, she caught holdof him immediately—he wanted to run away, but the officer caught him-there were a good many people about.

Prisoner. I was a yard from her; there was a man between me and her; directly she turned, he went away; I never had my hand in her pocket.





MARY DOYLE
. I am mother of Margaret Doyle. I seized the prisoner, and called "Police!"—he attempted to run away.





ROBERT LANE
 (policeman, P 86.) I took the prisoner.





FRANK TURNER
 (policeman, L 114.) I produce a certificate of theprisoner's former conviction—(read—Convicted May, 1847. and confined threemonths)—he is the man.




GUILTY
. Aged 20.—


Transported for Seven Years.

             ACTON. I am a student
 of the Temple. I was in St. Paul's church-yard


 about half-past three o'clock on the 6th of November, and stopped to look into a shop; Britten touched me on the arm, and said I had lost my handkerchief - I looked round, and saw it laying over the prisoner's arm; a witness had got him in custody.

            . I was going up Ludgate-hill, and saw the prisoner try a gentleman's pocket; he did not succeed: I afterwards saw him try another gentleman's pocket, but he got nothing - I followed him to a picture-shop in St. Paul's church-yard, and saw him put his hand into Mr. Acton's pocket, and take out this handkerchief; I went up, and laid hold of his arm, as he was in the act of putting it into his bosom.
Prisoner's Defence. The handkerchief laid on the ground; I picked it up, and the officer took me.

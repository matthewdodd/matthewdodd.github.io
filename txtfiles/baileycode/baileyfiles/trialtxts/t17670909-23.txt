            . I went to Barnet races; I got fuddled; I got from my horse, and got into a cart, in which was the boy at the bar; this was on the 18th of August; when we came to Golder's-green



, by Hendon, they took the horse out of the cart, when in the Swan-yard



, and I lay and slept in the cart, I believe an hour and a half; I awaked, and got on my horse, and rode home, which was but about a quarter of a mile; in the morning I missed my money, a guinea and a half, and a quarter guinea; I suspected the boy at the bar, and sent 
               
                  Richard 
                  Empty 
               



             after him; he took and brought him home in the afternoon; we took him before Justice Cross, there he confessed he took the money.
Q. How old is the prisoner?
Sedgwick. I believe he is between thirteen and 14 years of age; he confessed before Mr. Cross, he took my money, and went to Barnet, and bought himself a pair of breeches and a pair of shoes; then he played at a game of pricking at the belt, and lost the rest of the money, all but half a guinea and six-pence, which he delivered to 
               
                  Richard 
                  Empty 
               



             when he took him.


                  Richard 
                  Empty 
               



            . Mr. Sedgwick sent me after the lad; I found him upon Barnet common; he had new shoes and breeches on; he first said his grandmother gave him them; afterwards he began to cry, and said he had a half guinea from one, and a 5 s. 3 d. from the other of his prosecutors, and that he said was all.




               Guilty of stealing, but not privately
            .
(M) He was a second time indicted for 


               stealing half a guinea and 6 d. the property of

            . I was with Mr. Sedgwick, and when he was sleeping in the cart, I fell asleep on the bench in the yard for the space of an hour, or an hour and a half; then I got up and went home to bed, and in the morning I missed half a guinea; I had a suspicion of the prisoner, and I sent my brother after him; he was taken, and confessed to the taking half a guinea from me.
Q. Was you fuddled too?
Empty I was.

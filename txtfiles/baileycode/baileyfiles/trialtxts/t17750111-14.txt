            . I live in Crispin-street, Spitalfields


. On the 8th of December
 between six and seven o'clock in the evening I heard somebody walking over head, the outer door was upon the latch, and the windows were fastened. I went up stairs, and saw the prisoner stand against the door of Mrs. Robinson's lodging; he asked me if a Mr. Nash lived there; I said no, he went away, the last week, then he went up to the second pair of stairs, to the door of one Sligh; there I saw him drop from under his arm the things mentioned in the indictment.
(They were produced in court and deposed to by 
               
                  Elizabeth
                   Robinson
               



            ) When he dropped them, I said, I see what you have been about, but you shall not go; then he rushed towards me and knocked the candle out of my hand; and we had a struggle upon the stairs. Mr. Sligh came out; we found that there was another man in Mr. Robinson's room, my wife saw that man make off, she called out to me and I pursued him. I did lay hold of him, but he struggled and got from me. Mr. Sligh took the prisoner. I am certain he is the person I saw in Mr. Robinson's room.
Q. Are you sure your door was fast.
Spearing. I saw my wife shut the door too, and she tried whether it was fast or not; it was not above ten minutes after that when I found the prisoner in the house.
On his cross Examination. He said he could see his wife put her arm to the door in order to shut it.

            . I lodge at Mr. Spearing's, I left my door locked when I went into the country, upon my return I found my lock of my chest-of drawers broke, and the things mentioned in the indictment were taken away.
Sligh confirmed the evidence of

            . Last Wednesday sennight I was in the kitchen backwards, and was surprized with a very great noise; I thought the servants had been fighting: I went into the shop and they were very quiet; the maid went a little way up stairs and came down very much frightened, for she saw her mistress's cloaths scattered about the stairs. I happened to look up and saw the sash up two pair of stairs lifted up, and the Prisoner look out of the window; I cried out Thieves directly, and she made the best of her way down stairs to get out of the house; but one of my servants seized her coming down stairs; she fell down on her knees, begged we would forgive her and said she would never do so any more; I believe she had loaded herself too much and made a false step and so tumbled down stairs.

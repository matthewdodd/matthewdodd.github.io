            . I keep a woman's clothes shop
 at the upper end of Rosemary-lane


; this day week, about 11 o'clock in the day, I just went cross the way; I had not been gone above 3 minutes before I saw the prisoner came out of my shop; I went after her, and turned up her cardinal, and saw a linen gown, my property; I called a neighbour to be witness, and took the gown and petticoat from her; they were taken from off my counter.

            . I was standing at my shop-door, I saw the prisoner coming along; the prosecutor went to her, and charged her with stealing something out of his shop; he looked under her cardinal; she said, they are mine, Sir; he answered, they were his property, and charged her with stealing them, and took the things mentioned from her; then she begged for mercy; he desired me, as a neighbour, to be a witness that he took them from her; he sent for a constable, and gave him charge of her.
Prisoner's defence.
A woman gave the things to me, and said they were her property, and the man came and took them from me.

He might have been at the horse's head, and you not have seen him, you were not there during the whole time - what occasion had you to come up and down so often, when coals were delivering - do you do your work as you walk up and down stairs? - A. No; when the work gets too dry, it is a great loss to a man, I came to look at it.

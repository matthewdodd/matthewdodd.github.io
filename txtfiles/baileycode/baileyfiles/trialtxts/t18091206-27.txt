            . I live at No. 4, Henrietta-street, Manchester-square


.
Q. Did the prisoner lodge there - A. Yes. On the 14th of November I came home, I went into my room and went to the closet. I looked in my hat box and found that my hat was gone, I had put it there the night before; I accused the prisoner, he denied it; I understood from my landlady that he was going the next morning on account of being accused. I instantly took him to the watchhouse. The next morning he said he had stole the hat and took it to Mr. Layton, a pawnbroker in Wardour-street; I went there and found it. I am sure it is mine.

            . I am a servant Mr. Layton. On the 14th of November the prisoner brought this hat to pledge for three shillings.
The prisoner said nothing in his defence, nor called any witnesses to character.

BENJAMIN POOLE sworn.
About three weeks ago, I was in High-street, St. Giles's


; about five or six yards from the prisoner, I heard Mr. Fletcher cry, stop thief; he pursued after him up Dyot-street, with the handkerchief in his hand; it was a white and brown handkerchief, with a sort of a dart in it, a kind of a sprigg; it was a linen handkerchief; when he got into that street, a brewer's carman stopped him with his whip, and gave him two or three cuts, and the handkerchiefwas taken away from the prisoner; when he was laid hold of, Mr. Fletcher said, I have a great mind to take you before a Justice, and the prisoner said he was very willing to go; I have not the handkerchief, Mr. Fletcher has it in his possession; he took him then to the office in St. Martin's-street; I went with him, and he put him into the custody of the people there, till next morning, when he was committed; I attended the next morning, and Mr. Fletcher; and then the prisoner owned that he had taken it for the first time; the handkerchief was produced and shewn to the prisoner by Mr. Fletcher; the handkerchief is worth about 2 s.
PRISONER's DEFENCE.
I was going along St. Giles's; I saw the handkerchief lying on the ground, and I picked it up, and the gentleman charged me with having stole it.

                  FISHER
               




             was indicted for that 


               she, on the 30th of March
, feloniously did utter a forged order for the delivery of goods
            , which is as follows:-
Mrs. Bailey, - Give Fisher a pair of shoes, shift, and petticoat. By order of T. TUCKER.
30th of March. with intent to defraud the 
               overseers, for the time being, of the parishes of St. Giles in the Fields and St. George, Bloomsbury


            ; against the Statute, &c.
THREE OTHER COUNTS, varying the manner of stating the charge.
SARAH BAILEY. I am matron of the workhouse


. I have known the prisoner two years or more; on the 30th of March she was an out-door pauper - she came to the store-room that day with this order, in consequence of which I gave her a shift, petticoat, and a pair of shoes - I believed it to be a genuine order.
THOMAS TUCKER. I am an assistant-overseer. This order is not my writing, nor that of any person authorized by me; no one but myself ever issues an order in myname - upon my solemn oath, I never gave the prisoner this order, and I knew nothing of it till the matron showed it to me.
Prisoner's Defence. I got the order from Mr. Tucker - I was in Islington farm-house, and lent a girl my things; she never returned - I had to go on the 28th of March, and ask for clothes from Mr. Tucker; he would not give me any - he said he was not going to lend clothes to clothe other paupers; I went to him again on the 29th, and he would not - I went again on the 30th, and he gave me this order.
MR. TUCKER. I never remember her coming to me, and I never gave the order.
Prisoner. He did; who do you think I could get to forge it? there was Mr. Wright and the beadle there at the time.

            . In consequence of an information I had received; I went to the house in which I understood the prisoner Day lived; I went first to the back of the house which opens into a Tenter-Ground, but by mistake I went into the wrong house; when I came out again, I saw Day coming out of the back door of the right house, I desired Parker to go after him, which he did, and brought him back, and I found in his hand a key, which key I took from him, and in his breeches-fob a punchin, the use of which is to stamp a die, the reverse of an Irish half-penny; with the key I took from Day, I unlocked a cellar door belonging to the house; in that cellar we found this instrument (producing a large coining engine) it was fixed and ready for working, there were a pair of dies in it, and a halfpenny between the dies; the halfpenny is made in imitation of the copper coin of this realm; there was another halfpenny by the side of the dies, some finished halfpence lying about, and a quantity of blanks ready cut; there was a fire in the cellar, a kettle on the fire, and blanks in the kettle, the blanks are put into a kettle in order to boil off the scurf which is upon copper, and which prevents the impression being made so strong by the instrument as it should be; I found a punchin for a die for the reverse of an English halfpenny, I searched the garret, and in the garret I found a press which may be made use of for the cuting out of round blanks; and there was a blank lodged in this press at the time we found it, and there were a quantity of blanks round it; the prisoner Day's wife was in the kitchen, and the prisoner Bailis, was there with his coat off, and Bailis, wife brought in a seive, which seive is likewise an instrument they do make use of in the process of coining copper-money.

            . I was along with Clarke, Day came out of the house, he ran away, I pursued him, he made a blow at me and missed me, then he said he would surrender, I brought him back, I found Day's wife in the kitchen, Day said he was just cleared from the King's Bench, and that he did it through want, I said to Bailis, are not you an old fool to get into such a scrape as this in your old age? Bailis said, he did it by his master's direction, and we could not hurt him, Bailis was as black as a chimney-sweeper and without his coat. I saw Mr. Clarke take the key from Day which opened the cellar: Day told Mr. Clarke that this was the key of the cellar: I did not go into the cellar with Mr. Clarke at the first time; I kept Day in custody while Mr. Clarke went to see what was in the cellar, afterwards I went into the cellar and saw the instrument fixed with the halfpence and the fire.

            . I was in the garrett, I saw the cuting out instrument there and the blanks, and the parcel of copper halfpence, that have been produced in court.
Bailis's Defence.
The reason of my being so black and without my coat, was not by having any thing to do with coining, but I had been carrying coals for a person in the neighbourhood; I was only in the passage at the time they found me.
Day's Defence.
The house was not my house, though the key that was found upon me opened the cellar, yet that key belonged to a lock in my own house; I did not say I did it for want.

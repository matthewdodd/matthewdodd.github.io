JAMES WILD
 (police-constable D 124.) I was on duty, in plain clothes, on the afternoon of the 20th of May, in Greenwich fair—I saw the prisoner in company with another man, feeling gentlemen's pockets—at last I taw them standing behind a man—the prisoner took this handkerchief out of his pocket, and put it into his own flap—I seized them both, and told the gentleman—he felt, and missed his handkerchief—I took it from the prisoner, and the gentleman claimed it—I told him to follow me to the station-house, but the crowd was so great that he did not—I do not know his name—I found on the prisoner six gambling dice and a pair of combs.

            . I had the care of the sugars on the wharf in behalf of the company; there is a foot-path in the day time; we put up hurdles in the night to obstruct the path. I heard a rustling noise among the hurdles, and soon after I saw a bag of sugar come over; I secured the prisoner who stood there. I am positive the bag that contained the sugar was thrown over by him; he threw it over the hurdles, and then came over himself.
Prisoner's Defence.
It is impossible for any man to distinguish in that place, to speak with certainty to it; it was my coat I threw over, not the bag.
Q. to Chinner. Are you sure it was the bag, and not the great coat?
Chinner. It was very light: I am sure it was the bag.

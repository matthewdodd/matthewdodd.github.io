            . I live with Mr. J. Jones, hatter
, of Tottenham-court-road


. On the 17th of September I was coming home, and met a boy near my master's shop with three hats - I cannot say that it was the prisoner; I went in and told Mr. Jones, who went out and returned with one hat - I saw the prisoner the next morning, but I cannot say whether he was dressed like the boy.
JOHN JONES. I am a hatter, and live in Tottenham-court-road. This witness gave me information, I went in pursuit, and saw the prisoner about one hundred yards from my shop with this hat under his arm; I ran by him first, then turned, and followed him about four hundred yards, and just as I went to take hold of him, he dropped this hat and ran; I ran and took him; this is my hat he had it under his arm.
Prisoner's Defence. I was running by John-street, and this man came and gave charge of me for stealing a hat, but I had not seen it.

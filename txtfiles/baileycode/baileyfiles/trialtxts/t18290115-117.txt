            . I was in the employ of Mr. 
               
                  William 
                  Robinson
               



            , of Holloway


. On Sunday, the 4th of January, he had thirty-three fowls; I saw them that day in the yard, but did not see them locked up - I had known them for about seven months: on the morning of the 5th, thirty-two were gone; they were marked with a cut on the right wing - I have since seen the one that was left behind, and I saw some fowls at the watch-house on the evening of the 5th, but I could not say that I knew them; and the wings of Mr. Robinson's fowls were cut - I cut them, and the wings of the fowls I saw were cut in the same way: I believe some of them were a good deal like them.

            . I am an officer of Islington. I heard of the robbery at Mr. Robinson's; there was a reward offered for the fowls: I knew the prisoners, and about twelve o'clock on the Monday I went to John Hancock's house, in White Conduit-fields - I had before that been to Mr. Robinson's premises, and found the lock had been forced off the hen-house door - it appeared as if it had been done with a three pronged fork; I saw footmarks on the ground of more than one or two persons - one was a very large footmark, and the welt of the foot was worn away in one part. I met 
               
                  John 
                  Hancock
               



             coming out of his house, with a basket, and said to him, "What have you there?" he said, "Some fowls, which are my property, and I am going to sell them;" I asked him to admit me into his house, to see if there were any more; he said he could not, for the door was shut - his wife had got the key, and no one was there: I said I should force the door - he said at my peril; Mr. Mayor, who was with me, pushed the door, and it opened very easily; they were folding-doors, and not bolted - John had four fowls in his basket, which were picked; I found four fowls not picked, in a room in the house, and in another room I found William Hancock, sitting picking a fowl, and some more fowls, not picked, below in a fire-place, under some straw which a dog lay on - I found a sack, which had feathers in it and it was bloody; I took these shoes from the feet of William, and this piece of the welt of his shoe exactly corresponds with the mark made in the ground - it was a red soil, but soft; some of the footsteps were in a direction from Mr. Robinson's premises, towards White Conduit-fields, and some the other way, which appeared to be going and coming; there were some other footsteps there; I showed the same fowls to Selman the same day, and to Jones on the Friday following - they identified them; there was a cut upon the right wings: I went after the examination to examine the fowls at Hancock's, when I found some which had been cut in the right wing, and some in the left, but they appeared to be cut rather cleaner.
COURT. Q. What is the distance between the prosecutor's and John Hancock's? A. I should think a mile and a quarter; this large shoe, which I took off William, tallies in all respects in length and breadth, and in the mark of this piece likewise - there was no mark of nails, because the ground was rather too wet; I found some other footmarks, which corresponded with the size of 
               
                  John 
                  Hancock
               



            's shoes: the prisoners are both bricklayers: I know there was a reward, in which I expect to participate.

            . He said the little shoes did not match at all, only the big ones. Witness. No - I said I could not swear to them.

            , The fowls belonged to us; we asked him to take the live fowls to the office, but he did not. Witness. Because I considered that the fowls which were running about knew the premises.

                  MAYOR
               



            . I am an officer. I went with Morgan to examine the prosecutor's premises; what Morganhas stated is correct; we went to John Hancock's, and saw him coming out with a basket, and a cloth over it, with some fowls in it - we then went into the house, and found some fowls; here is one of them which had not been picked.

                  JONES
               



            . I am an auctioneer, and am son-in-law to Mr. Robinson - he had thirty-three fowls in his premises; I was acquainted with them: this is one of them -I know it by a particular mark here; it was bred on the premises: I locked up the hen-house door myself, about four o'clock in the afternoon of the 4th, and saw the whole of the fowls there; when I went in it happened that dinner was announced, and I did not put the key in its usual place, but put it into my pocket, and it was there till ten o'clock at night - the premises are surrounded with a paling, about five feet six inches high.
COURT. Q. Can you swear positively to this fowl? A. Yes - I sometimes took them their food; Skill did not live in the house - he used to feed them, and knew them: the cut in the wings was his own cutting.

                  SKILL
               



             re-examined. I am out-door gardener to Mr. Robinson; I have examined the cut on the wing of this fowl - I cannot say whether Mr. Robinson had such a fowl; I never took notice of any particular fowl, so as to know it again; he had fowls something like it: I cannot say that this wing is my cutting, as I did it in the dark, with a large old pair of sheep-shears, about a fortnight before they were stolen; I have been listening to what the officers have said, and I believe it is true, as I heard it before - there were footmarks of more than one person, but I did not take particular notice; I went with Morgan and Mayor when they measured the footmarks, and every thing matched as he says.

            . I know this fowl - I had it in Mr. Robinson's loft for a good bit, while it was a chicken; I am sure it belonged to Mr. Robinson: it is all white except the rump.

            'S Defence. I had twenty-five at first, and killed nine, to get myself a pair of shoes; I picked four to take to a gentleman to sell - I have about a dozen at home; I have kept fowls all my life: the landlord gave me warning because I kept so many; he said they picked the garden, and that was why I cut their wings; some I have had for two years, and some one year.

CARMELO TORGE I was at Covent-garden Theatre 


on the 13th of January; I am a musician
 employed there. At half-past twelve o'clock, after the performances were over, as I came out of the pit, under the Piazza, a man came right opposite me, pulled out my watch, and ran away; I ran after him, seized him, and threw him on the ground with the watch in his hand - the watchman came up, and took it out of his hand; the prisoner is the man.
Cross-examined by Mr. BODKIN. Q. It was dark, I suppose? A.There were plenty of gas-lights - a great many persons were about; he had not gone three steps before I took him; the force of the pull knocked the watch against the wall, and broke the glass.

             re-examined. I at first took him under the Piazza: two of his comrades came and knocked my arm - he got from me, and was re-taken: I am certain he is the man - he was never out of my sight.
CARMELO TORGE. I said he was the man when he was taken, and he said,
"It is the first time I ever did such a thing."

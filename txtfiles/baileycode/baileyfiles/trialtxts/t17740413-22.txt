            . Coming from work by the breeches-maker's stall, I saw the prisoner come out backwards with the breeches under his arm; seeing the lock lie on the ground, I suspected he had stole them; I took him into the public house; the breeches-maker was there, and said the prisoner had stole them out of his shop.
Prisoner's Defence.
As I was going along I saw a man come out of the shop; he threw the breeches down; I took them up and went into the ale house to call the breeches-maker; I told the man when he found me with them, they did not belong to me.

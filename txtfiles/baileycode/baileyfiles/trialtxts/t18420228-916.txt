DANIEL LEARY
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
9th of February, 18lbs. weight of lead, value 5s., the goods of 




Charles Smith; and fixed to a building.—2nd COUNT, not stating it to be fixed; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






CHARLES SMITH
. I keep the Britannia public-house in Brown-street, Bryanatone-square. I have a stable and coach-house adjoining Mr. Sewell's, in Lisson-grove—I have compared the lead produced, with the roof of my stable, and it completely fits—I have no doubt of its being mine.





GEORGE EDWARD SEWELL
. About five o'clock in the evening of the 9th of February, I came out of my work-shop—I saw two boys on the top of the coach-house—the prisoner was one of them—one was carrying a piece of lead into a loft—directly they saw me they ran down the steps—I ran and overtook the prisoner in Devonshire-street—the other had left the lead in the loft—the prisoner was pulling up the gutter—this is the getter of Charles Smith.





GEORGE ROGERS
 (police-sergeant D 1.) I produce the lead, which I found in the loft adjoining Mr. Smith's—I have fitted it—it corresponds both ways.

Prisoner's Defence. It was not me.





JOSEPH WALKER
 (police-sergeant D 5.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 15.—


Transported for Seven Years—Convict Ship.

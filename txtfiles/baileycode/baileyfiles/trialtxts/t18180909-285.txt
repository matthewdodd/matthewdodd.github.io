, the prisoner was my servant
; he came to me the beginning of June. On the 28th, I put a box, containing the money, on the shelf. Next morning, when I went to call him, I found he had absconded; I found the back-door unbolted, 11s. in copper, and a table-cloth gone. On the 11th of August, he was brought to me, and said he took them.

             . I am apprentice to Mr. Barton, the Prisoner came into my master's shop to buy a pound of sugar, about 9 o'clock at night, she brought a guinea to change, I gave her 20 s. but had not given her a groat, which was her due; there was some chocolate lay upon the counter, I looked to see if it was right, and I missed a pound, she was going away, and our young man brought her into the shop, and she dropped it down behind her.
Q. How do you know this to be your master's chocolate?
Gataker. It was marked with our mark; I believe she was a little in liquor when she did it; she lived a servant
 upon Ludgate-Hill.

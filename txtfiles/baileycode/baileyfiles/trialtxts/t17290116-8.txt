             aforesaid.
The Prosecutor depos'd, That the Goods were taken out of his Room, and he being sent for to the Crooked Billet, near St. Clement's Church, went and found the Prisoner stopp'd, and his Goods upon her.
Other Witnesses made it appear, that the Prisoner was stopp'd with the Plate of the Prosecutor's, and that she then said it was given her to pawn.
She said in her Defence, that the Prosecutor's Wife was a charitable good Woman, and going to her to ask Relief, she said she had no Money to relieve her, but being mov'd to Pity, fetch'd her Plate, and gave it her to pawn for her immediate Relief, which if the Prisoner could have prov'd, would have been a surprising Instance of the Charity of the Prosecutor's Wife, but it appear'd otherwise; however, she being indicted for stealing in the Dwelling-house of 
               
                  George 
                  Sheval 
               



            , and the Prosecutor confessing he was but a Lodger in the House of Mrs. Williams, the Jury found her 


               guilty of single Felony only
            .

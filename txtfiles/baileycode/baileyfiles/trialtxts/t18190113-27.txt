            . I am a solicitor
, and have chambers in Paper-buildinge, Temple


; the prisoner had been my porter
 for two years. I had a quantity of printed paper, in loose sheets in a room, where I deposit papers, and other things. I received information, and found my papers lessened very much. I sent for an officer, whotook the prisoner, as I suspected him, and charged him with it; he said he had taken some, but others were concerned in it. I found part of the paper I missed at Oram's - It could not be mistaken for waste paper, as it was carefully tied up.

            . I am a cheesemonger; I bought the paper of the prisoner, he said it was old papers of members of Parliament, that they had been employed upon them and the clerks had sent him to sell them - he was in the habit of bringing me old briefs.

            . I live in Diot street, St. Giles's


. The two prisoners took a lodging of me together; they were to pay me 2 s. each a week. I knew Pator; I did not know Stevens; Pator desired I would put up another bed in the same room, that they might lie in the same room; they lodged with me a week, and two days before I missed my things; Stevens's husband is a coal-heaver; he never lay there but one night; that was the Saturday following; I never saw him before; she told me she had a husband; he went away on Sunday; she told me his name was 
               
                  John
                   Stevens
               



            . In eight days I missed two pair of sheets, one pair of bellows, and one blanket. Stevens frankly owned she pawned them all. The pawnbroker delivered up the bellows and one blanket and one sheet, because they could not both attend; the justice committed the other as a party concerned, because it was in her lodging.

Stevens's Defence.
I did pawn them, but it was through real dis tress; my husband was out; I thought no harm to pawn them till my husband came on Saturday night. I did not design to defraud her. I expected my husband home on Saturday night, and when he came I was in Newgate. I did not know the consequence of it, or I should never have done such a thing.

10th of September, 1 pewter pot, value 1s. 6d., the property of

ANDREW WYLIE
. I am a police-officer. On the 10th of September, a few minutes after five o'clock in the afternoon, I was in Cavendish-square,

and saw the prisoner coming along with this basket in his hand, and these pots in it—I asked what he had got—he said "Nothing"—I said, "Let me look"—he let it go, and ran off—I pursued him to Castle-street—a man then ran against him, and stopped him—I took him to the station-house—this basket is lined for the purpose of holding pots.





DAVID OLIVER
. I am servant to William Taylor, of the Coachmaker's Arms in Bryanstone-street. One of these pots is his.





RICHARD PAYNE HUTCHINGS
. I keep the Coach and Horses, in Welbeck-street. Two of these pots are mine, and one belongs to Mrs. pierpoint, who is not here—I do not know the prisoner.





ANDREW WYLIE
. I got this certificate of the prisoner's conviction from the Session House at Clerkenwell—(read)—the prisoner is the person.

Transported for Seven Years.

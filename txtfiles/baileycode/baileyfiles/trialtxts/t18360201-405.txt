WILLIAM RUSSELL
 were indicted for

CHARLES LE RAY
. I live at Camberwell. On the 19th of January, at ten o'clock at night, I was crossing St. Paul's Churchyard—as I turned the corner of Cheapside, a policeman said, "Have you lost a pocketbook"?—I felt my pocket, and missed it—I went with him to the watch-house, where I saw the prisoners—my pocket-book was in my coat pocket—I did not feel it taken—I had two pocket-books in the same pocket, and lost one.





HARRIET LAWRENCE
. I was in St. Paul's Church-yard at ten o'clock at night, and a saw the prisoners, with a smaller boy than them—they were close to the prosecutor—I saw the little boy put his hand into the gentleman's pockets, take out a pocket-book, and give it to Griffin—I directly told the watchman, who went after him—they all three ran away.

Cross-examined by
MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Why not lay hold of him, as you were so close to them? A. There were three of them together, there were not many people about—the watchman was quite close to me, but not to the boy—I never saw the prisoner before.





EDWARD WINTER
. I am a watchman of Farringdon within. I was coming out of the watch-house in Cannon-alley—the three boys met me in the court—Lawrence said, "Those three have picked a gentleman's pocket" ran and caught hold of the two prisoners, the little one bobbed under my arm and got away—one of them dropped the pocket-book—I could not see which it was—I found it close at their feet.





CHARLES PAYNE
. I am a watchman. I heard the alarm—the prisoners were given into my hand. by the witness, and I saw Griffin throw the pocket-book down.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

            . I am a Policeman. I met the prisoner on the 23rd of April, in Pitfield-street. with a bundle under his coat, and having seen him before with bad characters, I stopped him, and asked what he had - he said what was that to me; I insisted upon seeing - I unbuttoned his coat, and took out this shirt, with his duplicate on it, which he tried to get off; I took him to the station, and found Mr. Law.

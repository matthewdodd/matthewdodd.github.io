JAMES HERBERT
 was indicted

 for embezzlement.






EDWARD BURGESS
. I am a cow-keeper, and live in Cornwall-road, Lambeth—the prisoner was in my employ, and it was his duty to pay me all he received—if lie received 13s. from Alary Lofts he has not paid it to me.

Prisoner. I had 13s. paid me, and I lost 1s.; I gave the other to the policeman.


Witness. He gave it up to the policeman the next night, but when I asked if he had received this money, he said they had not paid it.





MARY LOFTS
. I paid the prisoner 13s., on the 27th of July, for the prosecutor.





THOMAS GOOSE
 (police-constable L 160.) I took the prisoner—he said the female had not paid him—I said to the prosecutor, "It is a hard thing to take him up if he has not received it, if you will allow me I will take him to the person"—I took him to Lofts, and he denied it to her face—he said several times she had not paid him.




GUILTY
.* Aged 16.—


Transported for Seven Years.—Convict Ship.


Before Edward Bullock, Esq.

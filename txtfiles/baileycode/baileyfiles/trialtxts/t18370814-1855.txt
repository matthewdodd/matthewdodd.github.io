SAMUEL PEGLER
 (police-constable S 104.) On Monday morning, the 17th of July, I was in the Edgeware-road, and saw the prisoners standing at a corner—they went into a field—I called to Tilley, by the name of Blackey, and he took this handkerchief from his left-hand pocket and put it round his neck—I went and asked him where he got it—he said he bought it of Mr. Ross, a pawnbroker—I then looked at Phipps, and saw he had a fresh handkerchief on—I asked where he got it—he said he took

it out of pledge on the Saturday night—the boots were on Phipps's feet I took them and the property—I went to Ross.

Tilley. I worked in a stone-yard, and on Saturday night I bought the handkerchief.

Phipps. I got the handkerchief out of pledge on Saturday night, and I bought the boots of a young man of the name of Callaghan.

MR. BROOKS. I had seen these things safe about seven o'clock on the Sunday evening before, they were found by the officer on the Monday.

            . I am an upholsterer
, and live in Duke-street, Manchester-square


. On the 28th of January, I missed a Pembroke-table; on the evening of the 29th, I believe the same party came again, but could not get any thing - on the 30th they came again; I think there were four of them - one of them took something in the shop, but he was disappointed; the prisoner, who was one of the party, then stepped about one yard into the shop, and took this table - I followed him; he dropped it, and fell into the drain; I took him.
Prisoner's Defence. The table was outside the shop - a man told me he would give me a shilling to carry it to North Audley-street.

: the 13th of this month my wife went up to our room, and tried to open the door; she called me; I was drawing beer; I came up to her assistance, up to the chamber; I bid the people look to see if any body came out of the window; when I entered my room, my box was broke open, and part of my property was gone; I missed six crown pieces; I paid some money about six o'clock, and saw the money safe; I pulled the door to, and run down; and the people said, this is the man; his name is Nelson: the constable searched him, and found six crown pieces upon him; I had no particular mark upon them; I do not know the date of them: I think I have seen Mr. Nelson in my house, I cannot say what day.

             go down stairs, for I thought there was no good going on; the landlady came up to the room, and I asked her if she came to see what these men were after; she said, yes; she went down; presently I heard a hue and cry, a terrible noise; I ran down stairs; she said she had been robbed; I ran out of the house, and found they were gone into the next house; I saw him on the stair-case; I caught hold of his leg; I said, you willin, I thought you was after some such thing: I saw Michelsfield in the green-shop; I caught hold of him by the collar, and said, you are one; Mrs. Purchase said, don't collar him; I called then for assistance; I said, you know nothing of the matter; there are four in the mess; he was searched in the back parlour.

I live near the house; I went out about half past six, and heard that a man had got out of one window into another: Purchase's maid called out, thieves! I went to her assistance; Mrs. Purchase said, these are the men; I called for further assistance, and four persons came; I left them to seize the prisoners, while I guarded the door; we then went to the public-house, and they were searched; I saw Nelson have something in his hand, and it dropped on the floor (produces a phosphorus box); I picked it up; I asked him if it was his, and he said no.

I can only say what Gates said.
Prisoner Nelson. That is my own property: I played sometimes at the house; I went up, as well as others, to see what was the matter, and somebody said, that is the prisoner.
(The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a very good character.)

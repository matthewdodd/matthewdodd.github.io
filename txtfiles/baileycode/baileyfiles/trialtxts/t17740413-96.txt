            . I took a man that was stealing some lead from the Hospital of Bethlem


, but I cannot swear to the man; I saw him bring a basket with rubbish seemingly down the ladder from the top of the hospital; I laid hold of him by the collar; I found forty pound of lead in the basket; I gave the porter of the hospital charge of him.

            . The last witness brought the prisoner to me and gave charge of him; the lead was taken from a building contiguous to the Hospital of Bethlem. The prisoner said before the Alderman that poverty drove him to do what he had done.
The prisoner in his defence denied the charge, but called no witnesses.




               Guilty of stealing to the value of 10 d.

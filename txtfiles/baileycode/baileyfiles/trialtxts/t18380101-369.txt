GEORGE ALEXANDER
. was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
19th of December, 1 pair of half-boots, value 4s., the goods of 




William Henry Pollock.






WILLIAM HENRY POLLOCK
. I live in Chapel-street, Edgeware-road, and am a boot and shoemaker. About eleven o'clock on Tuesday morning, the 19th of December, I had some half-boots outside—I missed some about four o'clock—these are mine.





CHRISTIAN SAX
. I am shopman to a pawnbroker, who lives in Marylebone. These boots were pawned by the prisoner on the 19th of December.

Prisoner. Q. How can you swear to me? I was never in his shop in my life. A. There is a boy that comes that is shorter than him, but I believe he is his brother—I asked who the boots belonged to, he said, himself—the prisoner is the person who pawned them—I asked if they were his own property, he said, "Yes"—he said he lodged at No. 16, Nightingale-street, which is where he was found and taken.

HANNINGTON. (police-sergeant D 9.) I got information from the witness, and took the prisoner on the 20th—he identified him directly.

Prisoner. When I got home, my brother told me there had been a policeman after me, and he did not know but he could put a crown in my way; he came and knocked at the door, and I answered him, and then he said I must go with him to the pawnbroker's—and as soon as they opened the door, they said, "That is him"—how can the pawnbroker tell it was me, when there are many go into his shop?

JURY. to
CHRISTIAN SAX. Q. Had you any previous knowledge of this

prisoner? A. No; only his brother—there were no other boots of this description pledged that day.

COURT. Q. Are you sure it was not the brother? A. Quite certain—it was in the evening—I have no doubt whatever that he is the person.

Prisoner. Q. What dress had I on? A. A jacket similar to what you have on now, of a dirty, light colour, and I think a fur cap.




GUILTY
.* Aged 20.—


Transported for Seven Years.

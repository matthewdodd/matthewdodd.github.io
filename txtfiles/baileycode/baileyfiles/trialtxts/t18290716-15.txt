            . I borrowed a saw of Mr. William Brown, and put it into an empty house in Charles-street, Hoxton


, on the 12th of June; I locked it up - when I went the next morning the house was broken open, and the saw gone; I know nothing of the prisoner - he was not a workman there.

            . I keep the Golden Heart, Spitalfields. On the 13th of June the prisoner brought this saw, and said it belonged to Moore, a sawyer; he asked me to let it lay there till the morning, as the yard was then locked up.

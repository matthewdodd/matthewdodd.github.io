            . I am a chemist
. On the 19th of May, about two o'clock in the afternoon. I was in Upper Thames-street


, and had my handkerchief in my right hand pocket - I felt something at it - put my hand round, and missed my handkerchief. I looked round, and saw the prisoner not two yards off, with it in his hand; he put it behind him. I charged him with robbing me, he seemed alarmed, and threw it at me and ran away. I picked it up, pursued him a long way, raising a cry: nobody at first attempted to stop him; the first who tried to stop him he wrestled with, and got away, but was soon afterwards stopped, without my losing sight of him at all.

            . I saw a scuffle between Mr. Peak and the prisoner, who made off; the first man who tried to stop him he got from; but I followed and secured him.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I was proceeding to my father's in Eagle-street, Red Lion-square, walking at a slow pace, when the property was thrown in my face - it fell at my side, and I picked it up; when the prosecutor accused me of the theft, I was surprised, and said if it was his property he was at liberty to take it, and set off, fearing I might get into trouble.

            . Aged 17.

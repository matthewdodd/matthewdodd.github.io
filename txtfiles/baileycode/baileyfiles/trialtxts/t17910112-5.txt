            , No. 4, King's-head-court, Shoreditch; her husband's name is William. On the 4th of January, instant, between eight and nine in the evening, I was going down Shoreditch, to carry some linen home, three shirts, from Mrs. Greville; she takes in washing; the shirts were wrapped up in a coarse-cloth; I was going to take them to Broad-street; when I came to the bottom of King's-head-court, I saw three men standing at the corner; and I went a little farther, to the next turning, and a young man came and snatched them out of my hand; he ran before me, and I saw the bundle in his hand; he came behind me, and snatched it; he was one of the threemen I had seen standing at the end of the court; he ran up the turning; I was about twenty yards from the end of the court; he ran before me, and ran up the turning; he had on a dark green coat, and a round hat, and his hair about his ears, and dark stockings; I hallooed out, murder! I went a little farther up the turning, and fell down, and got up, and cried stop thief! several times; when I got to the top, there was nobody nigh me; and then the people came out of the public house, and I went back and told my mistress; I lost sight of the prisoner then; I saw him at the justice's two days after; I saw three men before the justice, and to the best of my knowledge one was the same man, but I was not sure; that was not either of the prisoners; the prisoners are the other two men that stood at the end of the court; I knew them before; I did not know the other man before; I had known the two prisoners a long while; Solomons lived next door but one to my mistress, about a twelvemonth ago; I had often seen Humphries with Solomons, but I did not know his name then; when I went back, neither of the prisoners were at the end of the court; that was about half an hour; it was dark; I have seen the two prisoners together three or four times, walking up and down Shoreditch: I have lived five months with Mrs. Greville; and before that I lived with my mother at Mrs. Greville's, when Solomons lodged next door but one; when I went home, I said I had been robbed by Solomons, and the other, whose name I did not know, and by another man that snatched the bundle.

            ; I take in washing; the last witness is my servant. On Tuesday night, the 4th of January, I sent her to Broad-street with three shirts wrapped up; it was between eight and nine; she was absent about a quarter of an hour; when she returned, she seemed very much frightened, and said she had been robbed of the linen; she said there were three boys standing at the end of the court, and one of them she was certain was the Jew boy, Solomons; he had been a neighbour of ours a great while before; she said, the one who took the bundle from her, was a boy in a dark green coat; I do not remember whether she said she knew the other; I saw two of the shirts without the wrapper, at Mr. Staples's, in the possession of Mr. Cooke, the officer; I know them again.

             sworn.
I am an officer belonging to Justice Staples. On the 4th of this month, about ten in the evening, I was going up Church-lane; I saw a lad named 
               
                  William
                   Archer
               



            , who is admitted an evidence, standing at the end of a court in Church-lane; I thought it suspicious; I never saw him before to my knowledge; and from his information, I left 
               
                  John
                   Ryley
               



             in charge of him, and went up the court, and listened at a back door of a suspicious person that I knew, and I heard some people talking; the door was shut; I tried to open it; in a few minutes I saw the two prisoners come out of the court; one of them had something in his bosom; they came out together; I asked him what he had there? he said, two old shirts, he was going to sell to purchase him a lodging; I said, if you prove it so in the morning, you shall have them; but I suppose you have stolen them; and I took them out of his bosom; I then took him and Archer into custody, and sought after Solomons, who had made off; I knew him perfectly well by sight; I saw him soon after, and called him; I searched him, and found nothing on him; I asked him what he did at that house in the court? he said, to pledge a handkerchief for sixpence; I let him go: I did not take him again; he was taken by Pirnell and West; I kept the shirts ever since: Archer and Humphries said Solomons was innocent; they said he was not in it.

             sworn.
I am a constable. I was with Cook about ten on the 4th of this month; I saw Archer standing at the corner of an alley; Cook asked him what he did there? he said he was waiting for somebody that was gone in there; and Cook gave me charge of him, and went into the alley and brought Humphries out with him; we secured them in the watch-house that night; I saw Solomons, that night, some time after, running along Cable-street; me and Cook took him in custody, searched him, found nothing, and let him go; he said he had been to sell or pawn something for sixpence, to buy a supper.


                  WILLIAM
                   ARCHER
               



             sworn.
Court. Remember the situation in which you stand, and take care you say nothing but the truth, in every respect? - I know the two prisoners; but that was the first night I had had any conversation with them for two years; that was the 4th of January; one of them I knew very well; I met them together by chance, the corner of Hog-lane, facing Magpie-alley; it was about seven o'clock; they both asked me whether I would go out with them a thieving?
Court. Was that the first thing that passed between you? - Yes.
Was not you surprised at such a question? - We had a few words; but I never was out with them before, nor any body else; but their persuading me, I consented; and as we were standing at the end of Bold-court, the corner of Hog lane, this girl came past about nine; we were there about seven; and Humphries said, there is a girl gone by with a bundle, let us go and snatch it from her; and we followed her till she got very nigh Plow-yard; then we crossed the way, and met her; and I came round her, and snatched the bundle from her, and we all ran away to the corner of Magpie-alley; and Humphries took the bundle from me, into his apron; and we all went into Wheeler-street, where we examined the bundle, and found it consisted of three shirts; and we offered them to a woman for sale at a house on the left-hand side, that Humphries knew; and the woman offered us four and six-pence for them, and we would not take it; then we all went into Bishopsgate-street; there I went in and pawned one of the shirts for half-a-crown; and they two stood at the door; and Humphries and all of us went into Back-lane, a place where they live; and Humphries and Solomons went into a house with the shirts; they went up a court, and I stood at the end; I do not know the name of it; and Cook and another gentleman came by and took me; and I said I was waiting for somebody; and Cook went and took Humphries into custody; and Solomons ran away.
Prisoner Solomons. When Mr. Cook took me at night, did not you say I was innocent? - At first I did, because you told me to say so; but I owned the whole afterwards; I said, at first, Solomons was not with us, because he told me he had robbed the same woman before; that was directly after we had robbed the girl, as we were walking along; and if he should be taken, therefore for me to say he was innocent; and I not knowing what to say, I said so.
Did not his father give the officers four guineas to get him made an evidence? - No.
Did the officers say, if you did not swear against me, you would be hanged yourself? - No.
Did the other prisoner know me before? - Yes; they both lived in one house; the two prisoners were ten yards behind me, when I took the bundle.
Prisoner Humphries to prosecutrix. Did you see me, or was I nigh you, when the bundle was taken from you? - No, I did not; I saw him at the end of the court, with the other two.
Jury. Do you know that boy in the green coat? - No, Sir, I never saw him before that night.
Do you know him now? - I do not know his face; I never saw his face; Iknow his back; he is the person that took the bundle from me, to the best of my knowledge; it was about his size and figure.
(The shirts produced and deposed to.)
PRISONER SOLOMON's DEFENCE.
I was coming down stairs to get something for my supper; and coming along, Humphries asked me if I knew of ever a pawnbroker's near? and I told him, and went with him to the pawnbroker's, where he asked five shillings for the shirts, and they offered him three shillings; I was going to pawn a handkerchief for six-pence; and coming out, I went up stairs, and was going to bed; and I came down stairs to fetch a pint of beer, and Mr. Riley and Mr. Cook took hold of me; and they asked me if I knew any thing about any shirts? and I told them I saw a lad ask five shillings for two shirts, and he was offered three shillings; and then they let me go; and I went home and went to bed; and then Mr. Pirnell took me in the morning; and Humphreys and Archer said they knew nothing of me, and I had not been with them.
PRISONER HUMPHRIES's DEFENCE.
I was talking to my sister; and 
               
                  William
                   Archer
               



             called me three times before I made any answer; and he bought a halfpennyworth of apples at Magpie-alley; and he gave the girl that sold the fruit, his bundle; and he came up to me, and said, I have some shirts of my father's, I will be obliged to you to pawn them for me; I took them from him, and was going to pawn them for him, knowing him; and I met Solomons, and asked him for a pawn-broker's? and he said, here is one here; I am going in; and I went in with him, and asked five shillings, and they would not lend it me; and I was coming to bring them out to 
               
                  William
                   Archer
               



            , and Mr. Cook and Riley laid hold of me; they said, what have you here? I said, two shirts belonging to 
               
                  William
                   Archer
               



            ; and they took them away from me, and put me in the lock-up-room all that night; and 
               
                  William
                   Archer
               



             sent for his father, and he gave Riley three or four guineas to swear in his son as an evidence; and the girl is here.

             sworn.
I am no relation to the prisoner: I live in King's-head court, Shoreditch, with my mother; she sells fruit, and has done so thirty-four years. On Tuesday night was a week, William Archer came across the street of Shoreditch, and had a halfpennyworth of apples; I was minding the stall; and he asked me to let him leave a bundle with me, which he had in his hand, till he called again; and he went across the way again, after he left the bundle with me; and he brought the prisoner 
               
                  Lawrence
                   Humphries
               



             across the way with him, and asked him to pawn a few things for him; and Archer said to me, give this Lawrence the bundle I left with you, which I did, and they both went away together; this was about half after eight at night, as near as I can tell; I never spoke two words to either of the lads in my life; I knew them no farther than buying fruit of me, and going away again; Archer said the bundle belonged to himself.
Jury. What sort of bundle was this? - It was pinned over in a brownish coarse-cloth.
Court to Archer. Did you see that girl there? - I have seen her going backwards and forwards to my work, but never laid out a halfpenny with her in my life.
Did you deliver any bundle to her? - I never did; for as soon as the bundle was snatched, we all ran up Plow-yard, to Magpie-alley; and then Humphries took the bundle, and we all went to Wheeler-street, to a place he said he knew.
You never saw the girl that night? - No, my lord, I did not; I tell you nothing but the truth.

I am the prisoner's sister. I live inShoreditch; I am a single woman; I keep two rooms in the house of Mrs. Weighty, a widow, No. 3; I take in washing, and make sailors shirts and jackets; when my brother is out of work, he lives with me; and when he is in work, he lodges at one Mrs. Bryant's, in Bold-court; he is a brick-maker; he always keeps very good hours when he is at home with me.

I am the unhappy father of this unfortunate young man; I live in Garden-court, Whitechapel; my chief employment is grafting silk stockings for gentlemen; my son lives with me, but of late I cannot speak to his guilt or innocence; my wife died in child-bed, with seven children; he was employed all last summer by me; he always behaved very peaceably and quiet; I would rather give my voice for sending him abroad; he may make a bright man yet.

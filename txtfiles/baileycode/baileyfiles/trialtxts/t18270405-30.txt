JOSEPH LAMBERT. I am a coachmaker
, and live in Jury-street, Aldgate


 - I had a quantity of steel on my premises - it was old coach-springs; the prisoner was about five weeks in my service - this steel was safe about three o'clock on the 14th of February; I found him at the watch-house with it, at eight o'clock - he said he hoped I would have mercy on him. He could earn 36s. a week.

            . I am foreman to Mr. Lambert. These springs were safe about three o'clock - the men leave work at eight - the prisoner left about half-past seven o'clock; I followed, and an officer, who was waiting, stopped him six or seven yards from the premises - he had these steel springs in a basket, which was covered up; he said, at the watch-house, he had bought them, but I had seen him breaking them into old steel, after three o'clock, which made me send for the officer - he begged my master to be merciful.

            . I am a starch-maker
 at Bromley


. On the 18th of April I was informed the prisoner had sold some starch in my name; I got a warrant and took him in Chamber's-street, Goodman's-fields; he said if I would let him go about his business he would tell me where he sold the starch; he confessed he stole it from me, and sold it to Mr. Deastill; he said he came into the premisses and took it out of the stow at twelve o'clock at night.

             deposed that on the 18th or 19th of April, the prisoner offered him some starch, but he did not buy it.

            . The prisoner came to my house with two papers of starch, said he brought a load from Mr. Hilt, and had had the misfortune to let it fall, and asked me to buy it of him, which I did.
The prisoner said nothing in his defence.

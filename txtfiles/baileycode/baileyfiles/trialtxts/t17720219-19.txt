            . I was in Fenchurch-street


 about seven o'clock on the 18th of February. I felt something in my pocket; I turned round, and saw the prisoner and another lad behind me; the prisoner had my handkerchief in his hand; I secured him, then he dropt my handkerchief.
(The handkerchief produced and deposed to.)
The prisoner in his defence said that the other boy might drop it, but that he knew nothing of it.

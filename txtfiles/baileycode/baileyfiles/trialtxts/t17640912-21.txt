            . I am a watchmaker
, and live in Whitecross-street


. On the 30th of July, I went out of my shop; backwards, into the kitchen; I generally shut the shop door, and lock it, but do not take the key out. About eight at night, I seeing the door open, went in, and missed a silver watch: I went about with written papers to the pawnbrokers the next morning, and when I got home, 
               
                  Mr. 
                  Griffice 
               



             of Bridgewater Gardens came and let me know he had got the watch: it was a watch that was left with me to be cleaned, by one Mr. Roberts.


                  William 
                  Griffice 
               



            . I am a pawnbroker, and live in Bridgewater Gardens. (He produced a silver watch.) On the 30th of July, about seven in the evening, the prisoner at the bar, and 
               
                  Catharine 
                  Pollock 
               



             the evidence, brought this watch to pledge; they told me, it belonged to Pollock's husband, and they pledged it, in order to raise money to bury a child that lay dead. I lent them a guinea upon it.


                  Catharine 
                  Pollock 
               



            . The prisoner came to me, and took me to her own room, and took this watch out of a drawer, and desired I would go-along with her, and pawn it for her: we went together on a Monday, in the evening; she gave me eighteen-pence and a pint of beer for going with her.

                  Catharine 
                  Pollock 
               



             brought me the watch, and asked me to go with her to pawn it; she pawned it in her own name, and took the money for it, and through spite and malice, she was admitted an evidence.




               Guilty of stealing, but not privately in the shop
            .

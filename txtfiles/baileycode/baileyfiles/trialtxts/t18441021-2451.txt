WILLIAM OAKLEY
. I live in Aldermanbury. On the 18th of Sept., about half-past five o'clock, I was standing at my door—I saw the prisoner past from the end of Addle-street, and turn into the lobby of No. 51, Mr. Margetson's—in a few minutes after, as I was crossing the street, I saw him come out with a piece of carpet on his shoulder—he had a blue bag in his hand—he passed down Aldermanbury, and I, seeing Mr. Margetson at the end of the warehouse, called to him—he came out, and I spoke to him.

Prisoner. Q. Can you swear that the carpet was not given to me? A. I will swear that no one passed the door during the time you went in, till you came out.





RICHARD MARGETSON
. I live in Aldennanbury. From what Oakley told me, I ran down Aldermanbury, and saw the prisoner with a piece of carpeting. on his shoulder—I ran up to him and collared him with it on his shoulder—it belongs to Mr. John Monkton and belongs to Mr. John Monkton and others—I am their agent.

Prisoner. Q. This is the piece you found on my shoulder? A. Yes, I can swear to it, and did so at Guildhall—I know it by the make of it—it is not the only piece of carpet of that description that has ever been made—I can swear that this piece had been in the warehouse a quarter of an hour before.

Prisoner's Defence, I was coming down Aldermanbury on the 18th of Sept.; a man respectably dressed asked me if I would earn 6d.; I asked him how; he said lie would give me 6d. to iake a piece of carpet to St. Martin's-le-grand; I took it, and put it on my shoulder; he told me to go on, and take it to the Bull and Mouth, and wait till he came; I saw no more of him; this gentleman came and tapped me on the shoulder, and said it was his.




GUILTY
.* Aged 21,—


Transported for Seven Years.

, on the 5th Instant. Mrs. Foster was hearing a Ballad sung in the Market, and her Pocket was pickt immediately. Upon which, the Prisoner was found telling the money in a corner, which money was owned by Mrs. Foster, she swearing it was hers that she then lost. The Prisoner strongly denied the Fact, and said she found it in the Market: But that was lookt upon to be an old Newgate shift, and groundless Excuse; and she was known to be an old Gamester in the Art of Legerdemain, tho but a young Girl. She was thereupon found 

               guilty
             of the Felony.

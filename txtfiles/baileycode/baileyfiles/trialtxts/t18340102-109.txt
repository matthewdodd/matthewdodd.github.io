 - the prisoner lodged in the same room, but slept in another bed - on the night of the 6th of December, I went to bed between eleven and twelve o'clock, and put my coat, waistcoat, and stockings, in a chair between the two beds - the prisoner was in bed - when I awoke in the morning, the prisoner was gone, and these articles also - I found my coat at the pawnbroker's the same day - I had lent him the same coat to pawn once before - the prisoner was taken the same day - he is a velvet-weaver - he said he did this to get tools to go to work with.
JOHN BOARD. I am a pawnbroker - on the Thursday before the 7th of December, the prisoner pawned this coat, and redeemed it - on the Saturday, he brought it and pawned it again for 5s.
DENNIS REGAN (police-constable H 22). I took the prisoner, and found these stockings, waistcoat, and comb on him.
Prisoner. I did it from distress.
GEORGE TURNER. I know he was in distress; and he had a place to go to work at - he did buy some tools with part of the money.

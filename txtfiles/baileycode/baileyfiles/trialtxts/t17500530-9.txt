            . I am the prosecutor's apprentice, the prisoner came to our shop on a Saturday, the cord hung up against the wall. I see her with it in her hand. I ask'd her what she was going to do with it. She throw'd it down, then I stop'd her at the door, and she did not deny taking it.
Q. Did she own she took it?
Wadkins. She did, saying, she had it, but she did not carry it away.
Q. When did you see it hanging last?
Wadkins. I am sure it was there not a quarter of an hour before.
Prosecutor. Here is the number I put upon it of my own writing.
Prisoner's defence. I went into this shop, as I was going along, to change six-pence. I knock'd with my heal upon the boards, and the boy came and said, what are you going to do with that cord? I said nothing at all.

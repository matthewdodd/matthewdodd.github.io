. I lost a cream-jug out of the servant's hall, about half-past eleven o'clock in the morning, on the 8th of February; the area door was unlocked, and I saw the prisoner come into the area, and soon afterwards I saw him go out of the hall; he was quite a stranger, and had no right there; I stopped him at the area gate, and he gave me this cream-jug out of his pocket.

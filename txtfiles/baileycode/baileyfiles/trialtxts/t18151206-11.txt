                     WILLIAM 
                     CUTHBERT
                  




               
             was indicted for 


               uttering and putting away several forged and counterfeit notes, purporting to be the notes of the 
                     
Governor and Company of the Bank of England




                  , with intent to defraud the said Governor and Company
            .
He was also indicted for forging the same, with the like intent.
Mr. Reynolds stated this case to the Jury, and informed them that the latter of these indictments was a capital one; and that the prisoner had pleaded guilty to the former; and the Bank, with the usual clemency which marked all their proceedings, had instructed him not to offer any evidence upon the capital charge. He therefore should not 
trouble them with any evidence.




               GUILTY

Of uttering, knowing to be forged.




               Transported for Fourteen Years

First Middlesex Jury, before Mr. Recorder.

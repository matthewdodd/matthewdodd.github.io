Mr. GREENAWAY. I seside in Bishopgate-street. On the 16th of November as I was in my chambers, a few minutes before seven o'clock, I observed the two prisoners in conversation together. The man prisoner pulled the street door bell of Messrs. Duddell and Glover for admission, I presume. The door was not immediately opened, and the conversation continued. He rang again, and upon the second ringing the street door was opened. Previous to the door being opened, I observed the man had a small bundle in his hand. The woman had no bundle, and when the door was opened she moved to the door of the adjoining house. She stood there during the time he went in, When he had been in the house a minute or two he came out and made a signal to her for her to come to him. She did. She went within side of the shop, and the man not having light enough, took down two shutters of the window. I considered there was something improper going forwards, and come down stairs. I opened the door of my own house, and observed them. In a short time the woman came out with a large bundle. That bundle, or part of it. I understand, will be produced here. I looked at the bundle, and considered there was a bar of soap in it. I looked round and saw 
               
                  John 
                  Ward
               



            , the constable. I beckoned him to me, and told him what I had seen, and begged he would bring the woman back to Mr. Duddell, saying, I would gurrantee him. He took her into custody. Upon her being taken to Mr. Duddell's, they sent for me desiring I would come over. I did so, and when I went into the shop, the man informed me that he had taken the bundle and throwed it behind the counter. I looked behind the counter and desired Mr. Duddell might be called, and when he came down he owned all the property. When they were stopped, the man prisoner called the woman his sister, on Monday, he said she was his wife.

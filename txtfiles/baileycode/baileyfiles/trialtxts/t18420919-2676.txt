JOHN WILSON
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
23rd of August, 1 pair of boots, value 2s., the goods of 



Thomas Murray, from his person.







THOMAS MURRAY
. I am a pot-boy, and live in Drury-lane—about four o'clock on the morning of the 23rd of August I went to sleep in the Adelphi arches, when I awoke my boots were gone—they were safe on my feet before—these now produced are them I am sure.

Prisoner. You know you were taken up for vagrancy and released to come against me, how do you know these boots? Witness. I am sure they are mine.





WILLIAM WEST
 (police-constable F 106.) I took the prisoner in Covent-garden—he had these boots on his feet—I went up to him and asked where he got them—he said they were given to him in the market.

Prisoner's Defence. I said I bought them of a young lad in Covent-garden market.




GUILTY
.** Aged 22.—


Transported for Ten Years.

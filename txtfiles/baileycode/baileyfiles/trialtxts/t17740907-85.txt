            . I am clerk to Mr. Dver, who is a sugar-baker
; on the 15th of August I was at Ralph's-Key


; we had fifteen hogsheads of sugar there for shipping, and they were weighed; the coopers came down to hoop them; the prisoner is a cooper
; I was informed the prisoner had taken some sugar out of the hogsheads; I weighed them over again, and found four of them plundered.

            . I saw the prisoner as he was at work at the hogsheads, put some sugar in a bag three times; the bag was afterwards found.

            . I was up in the compting-house; the last witness called me down, and told me some of the coopers had been filling a bag with sugar; my partner and I went down and found the bag of sugar under the scaleboards, with loose hoops over it, it weighed fifty-four pounds; the prisoner was present when we found it; Dixon told me he saw the prisoner put the sugar in the bag, on which I took him.
Prisoner's Defence.

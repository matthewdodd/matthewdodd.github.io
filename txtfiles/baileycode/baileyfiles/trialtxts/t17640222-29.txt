            . I am a weaver
. My wife hired the prisoner out of Spital-fields market upwards of half a year ago; she came on a Monday, and on the Tuesday she dined with us; after dinner my wife and I went to take a walk in the garden, and returned in less than a quarter of an hour; then we miss'd her, and the tea-chest and things in it; my wife pursued one way and I another, but could not find her. We took her up last Tuesday was fortnight; she then had my wife's cloak upon her back (Produced and deposed to.) We never could find the rest of the things.
Elizabeth, his wife, confirmed the account he had given.

I am as innocent as the child unborn; I bought the cloak of a stranger for 9 d, about three months ago: I gave her a shilling for it.

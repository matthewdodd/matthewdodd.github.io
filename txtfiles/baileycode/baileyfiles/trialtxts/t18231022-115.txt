            . This lead was fixed to a dormer window of a house I was building in King-street, Finsbury


. On the morning of the 2th of September, I found the prisoner in custody with it - it was safe a week before - he is a stranger. I compared it to the dormer, and it matched.

            . I am a watchman of St. Luke's. On the 25th of October, at ten minutes past eleven o'clock at night, I saw the prisoner at the corner of Castle-street, City-road, with a bag containing lead - two others were with him. I secured him, and asked what he had got - he said he did not know. I took him to the watch-house.

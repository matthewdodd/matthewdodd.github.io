ROBERT MARRIOTT CALDECOTT
. I was staying at the Golden Cross, Charing-cross. I was in the Strand on the 25th of October—I received information, and missed my handkerchief, which I had seen safe half an hour before—I asked the prisoner for my handkerchief—he pulled out his own—I said that was not it—the boy that gave me information said he saw the prisoner give the handkerchief to another person, and it was a white one, which mine was.





WILLIAM ALEXANDER SWAN
. I was near Hungerford-street, in the Strand, on the 25th of October—I saw the prisoner and another boy—the prisoner took a handkerchief from the prosecutor's pocket, and gave it to the other boy, and they walked away—I told of it.





JOHN EVANS
 (police-constable F 96.) About twenty minutes past five o'clock, on the 25th of October, I was called to take the prisoner—he kicked me several times, and resisted greatly—the handkerchief has not been found.




GUILTY
.* Aged 19.—

JOHN BROWN. On Thursday, the 6th of June, my brother was with me, he said there was a man stealing some lead opposite, I saw the prisoner come out of the house, he had nothing with him; he had a leather shoe and a list shoe on him, this was about six o'clock, about eight o'clock, a little boy said a man had gone out of the house with some lead; I pursued the prisoner and took him in custody; he then had one leather shoe and a list shoe. I am sure he is the same man.

            . I am eight years old, I saw the prisoner with the lead on his shoulder, he is the same man that I saw tie it up in the front parlour. The prisoner was in the house the day before that.

            . The lead came from Queen's Row, Pentonville; it was cut from the garret; I fitted it, it belonged to the same house that two men were convicted two sessions ago. This man belonged to the same gang, there are ten of them.
Prisoner's Defence. I saw the lead laying in the kitchen area, I never was in the house before in my live, I would wish to ask Mr. Brown if it was himself that saw me in the morning.
MR. BROWN. I did, you came from a back wall, eight foot high.

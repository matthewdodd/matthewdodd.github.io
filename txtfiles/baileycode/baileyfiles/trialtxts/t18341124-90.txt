 were indicted for

 stealing, on the

Sophia Yates.






SOPHIA YATES
. I live at Hillingdon. I was walking on the footpath, in Mr. Cox's park, alone, on the 3rd of November—the two prisoners came up to me, and Collins snatched my bag out of my hand—they both ran away—they did not say one word to me—there were 13s. in my bag and some keys.

Cross-examined by
MR. DOANE. Q. Did you know them before? A. No; I knew something of Barnett's family—I am single—they were walking quietly, and I met them—I have never seen the property since—I saw the prisoners again in about two hours.

COURT. Q. Had they a dog with them? A. Yes; a white and brown dog.





WILLIAM WEST
. I live with Mr. Cox, at Hillingdon. About one o'clock on the 3rd of November, I was going to Uxbridge—I met Collier and another young man with him—they had a dog—this was just by the bridge.





MICHAEL POWELL
. I was near Uxbridge, and saw both the prisoners together—one was standing in the road, and the other coming across Mr. Cox's premises.





GILES BELL HUDSON
. I went after the prisoners, and took them in a house on Uxbridge Common—they had a brown and white dog with them.

Cross-examined. Q. When did you see them in the house? A. About twenty minutes before four o'clock in the afternoon.

Collier's Defence. Barnett is innocent.
(Thomas Parrott, a chair-maker, and Mary Parrott, gave Barnett a good character.)

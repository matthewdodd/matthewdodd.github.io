            . I live at the Red-cow, Mile-end




. My house was broke open the 28th of last April. I got up on Monday morning the 29th, about five o'clock; the first thing I saw was the door broke open, and tore to pieces. The bolts were burst open. This is a padlock of the outer gate. They got over the pales, and burst the door, and took the hinges off. I lost the things in the indictment. They pick'd the lock of the bar-door, and took a bag of halfpence and farthings, about thirty shillings. The porridge-pot, chocolate-pot, &c. were lost out of the kitchen. I found the coffee pot and porridge-pot, and twelve plates, in St. Luke's parish, in a stable.

            . I am a pawn-broker; I live in Magpye alley, Shoreditch. The porridge-pot and coffee pot were pledged by Hurdley's wife about the 12th of 
               
                  August.
               


             I gave her a duplicate. I lent her eleven shillings on the porridge-pot, coffee-pot, half a dozen odd cups and saucers, and a tea-pot. She pawned them in the name of 
               
                  Catharine
                   Holland
               



            , who came with her, but Hurdley's wife took the money. Mrs. Holland said we might put them in her name, or Hurdley's name; knowing Mrs. Holland, I put them in her name.

            . On the 3d of May the watchman came to me, and told me there was a man in Bear and Ragged-staff yard had conveyed some goods into a stable, and had made his escape. I found these things in the stable: he said he was going to fetch another load of goods to deposit in that stable, because his landlord was going to seize them. He was with the watchman when I came up. I took the key out of his hand, and he said if we would go with him to Cock-alley, we should see where he brought them from. The watchman is not here. I do not know the prisoner.
Q. Look at Clarke, is that the man?
Jones. No: I offered to go, but he made his escape from us.
- Macknal. I went to take Gulley and Hurdley one morning. I went to Hurdley first; his wife said she had not seen Gulley for two days. I went up stairs, and the door was shut against us; I broke the door open, and Gulley went to strike me down with a pick-axe. We searched Hurdley's room, and in the drawers found this duplicate in a green purse (producing it). It is Mr. Hopley's duplicate, which directed us to Hopley's house. Hopley brought the things to Mr. Sherwood's.

            , the two prisoners, and myself, got over the back gate, and wrenched the door open. I got in, and took out the copper pot, the pewter, the coffee-pot, chocolate-pot, and some halfpence. Hurdley kept the coffee-pot and the chocolate-pot; 
               
                  Nathaniel
                   Craven
               



             had the pewter.
Q. Did you give this information before the justice?
Clark. Yes.

             and Henry to be let go?
Clark. They broke loose out of the Round-house.
Q. Do you know what became of the copper pot and coffee-pot?
Clark. I do not know what Hurdley did with them.
Gulley's Defence.
I was never out of my lodgings at these times.
Hurdley's Defence.
I know nothing at all about it.
For Gulley.

            . Gulley lodged at my house a twelvemonth. He was constant in my lodging.
Q. Can you say he was never a night out of your lodging?
Harris. I can to the best of my knowledge. He was at Hurdley's the night he was taken; he came home, and the door was fastened, and he went to Hurdley's. He never lay out before, to my knowledge.


                  William
                   Sheppard
               



            . I lay in the same bed with Gulley. I lodged three years there, he a twelvemonth.
Q. You said, on the former trial, he never lay out a night the whole twelvemonth?
Sheppard. No, he never did; he was never out after ten o'clock; he used to sit in the room with Mrs. Harris and her husband till ten or eleven o'clock; he used to get up between four and five; he always awaked me when he went out.
Q. How near does Hurdley live to where he lodged?
Sheppard. The court joins to the house where I lodge.
Q. Did Hurdley use to be often at your house?
Sheppard. No.
Q. Did he lie at home the night he was taken up?
Sheppard. He did not lodge there then for a constancy; my landlord and landlady always made him welcome; after he came from Ireland, he only missed one night, and he was taken up the next morning.
Q. So he did not lodge there for a constancy, and yet never missed but one night?
Sheppard. Yes.

 in our service. She had been in our service about five weeks. We missed a shirt of mine, a black silk gown, two silver table-spoons, a silver tea-spoon. Some of the articles have been found. She confessed to taking the spoons, and directed us where they were to be found.

Prisoner's Defence. I did pawn the spoons. I asked my mistress for some money. She refused me. I was obliged to pay money that day. My master told me, if I would tell him where they were he would never do any thing to me, and the constable said the same.

JOHN CLAYTON. I am a watchman. On the 24th of May, about four o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner coming towards me, the prisoner had a bundle; I asked him what it was, he said he had nothing, only two ducks; I took it from him, and found there were six ducks in it. Rees claimed them. Three of them had their necks cut, and the other three were wrung - They were quite warm.

            . I am a green-grocer, and live at Whitechapel. I saw the ducks, and am certain they were mine.
Prisoner's Defence. A man gave me a cup of coffee to carry them.

1365. 




MARY ANN WILLIAMS
, was again indicted

 for stealing, on the 
23rd of March, 1 shawl, value 6s.; 1 petticoat, 2s.; 1 handkerchief, 1s.; and 1 pair of gloves, 6d.; the goods of 



Fanny Jane Oborne; and 1 sheet, 6s.; the goods of 



Susanna Thorpe; and that she had been before convicted of felony.







FANNY JANE OBORNE
. I live with my aunt in Leader-place, Westminster. On the 23rd of March the prisoner came there at a quarter to eight o'clock in the morning—she said she had come from Windsor by the steam carriage, and wanted my aunt to recommend a person to go and fetch her boxes, which we did—the shawl was lying there, and she asked me to let her put it on her shoulders, as she was very cold travelling all night—she then borrowed a shilling and got some rum, and had some luncheon—then she got me to write a note to her aunt, at the Marquis of Lansdowne's—we went out, and she asked me to lend her another shilling, which I did—she went away with the man who was to fetch the boxes, and when I got home I missed my flannel petticoat, handkerchief, and gloves, which had been on the mangle where the shawl was.





ELIZABETH HARMAN
. I am a searcher at the station—I produce this flannel petticoat which I found on the prisoner.





FANNY JANE OBORNE
. This is my petticoat—there is no mark on it, but I have another like it, and it is my own making.





JOHN BARKER
 (City police-constable, No. 466.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's conviction, which I got at Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person who was then convicted.




GUILTY
. * Aged 23.—


Transported for Ten Years.

(There was another indictment against the prisoner.)

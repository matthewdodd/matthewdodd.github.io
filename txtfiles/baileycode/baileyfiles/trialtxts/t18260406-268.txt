            . I am a bricklayer. About ten minutes past twelve o'clock I was on the top of a building, and saw the prisoner coming along with the saw wrapped up in a dirty cloth, about a quarter of a mile from where it was taken - I called to him, and asked him how he got it - he said he had found it; I said, "If you will go back, and can show the place, you shall be let go;" he went back, put it against a heap of bricks, and said he had found it there.(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I met a boy who asked me to take care of this saw for him.

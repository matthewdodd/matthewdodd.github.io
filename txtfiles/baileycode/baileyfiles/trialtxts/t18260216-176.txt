JOHN SMITH. I lost this coat on the 11th of February - I left it on the box of my hackney coach, while I went into a grocer's shop at the corner of Devonshire-street, Mary-le-bone


; I had not been in there above a minute or two, when the officer came and told me of it.(Property produced and sworn to.)

            . I live in Edward-street, Foley-place, and am a beadle. On the night of the 11th of February the prisoner and a man came to my shop, and I followed them to South-street - I saw them go to an eating-house, I suppose to see if they could get anything, but they could not; they then went to several other places. - When they got to High-street the man took this coat from the box; he gave it to the prisoner, and I stopped him with it.

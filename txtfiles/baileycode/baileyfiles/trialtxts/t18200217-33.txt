            . I am a boot-maker
, and live in the Old Bailey. On the 7th of February, about ten o'clock in the morning, I was coming through Ball-alley


; the officer asked me if I had lost my handkerchief? I felt and missed it. We pursued, stopped the prisoner, and he pulled his coat and waistcoat off. I felt it in his coat-sleeve, and took it out.

            . I am a constable. I saw the prisoner and another man in Fish-street Hill. I saw him turn sharp round, and follow Mr. Ryder - about an inch and a half of his handkerchief was out of his pocket; they followed him into Lombard-street, and in Ball-alley I missed them - there are several turnings there. I caught sight of them in George-yard; they were then running from Mr. Ryder - the other man ran down an alley. I saw the prisoner tucking something down the arm of his coat, and asked Mr, Ryder if he missed his handkerchief? he said Yes. We pursued, and overtook the prisoner; he was very willing to be searched. Mr. Ryder found the handkerchief in his coat-sleeve.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

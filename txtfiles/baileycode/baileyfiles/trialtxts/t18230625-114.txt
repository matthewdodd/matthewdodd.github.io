            . I am the prosecutor's daughter. On the morning of the 23d of June, I was in a room behind the shop, and heard a very low footstep - went into the shop and saw the prisoner going out, with this shawl and handkerchief in his hand. I stopped him by the door; he asked if we sold cotton handkerchiefs - my brother came into the shop and saw me take the things out of his hand, and boxed his ears, and let him go.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

            . I am postilion to the Queen; I had lent my clothes, mentioned in the indictment, to a servant of Prince William's, to go to the play, about six weeks ago; they were brought back again, and left at a public house we use, Mr. Jones's, by Charing Cross; they were missing out of the house; we had reason to suspect the prisoner, he having lived at that house about three quarters of a year before that: he was taken up, and charged with taking the clothes: he confessed he had taken them, and sold the coat and jacket.

            . I buy and sell old clothes; I bought a coat and jacket of the prisoner at the bar; (produced in court, with the lace taken off), I bought them in the same condition they are now.
Meytham. This is the coat and jacket I lost; the great coat was carried back, and put in at a cellar window out of the street, at Mr. Jone's.

JOHN CHAPMAN
. I am a glover, and live in King William-street, Strand. On the 26th of February, about a quarter-past ten o'clock in the morning, I left my shop for a few minutes, and on looking from my back parlour I saw the prisoner leaving the shop with something bulky under his coat—I ran after him into the Strand—he found I was pretty close to him, and he dropped from his coat twenty-three handkerchiefs and a scarf which had been taken from my shop window—I took them up, and called "Stop thief"—a person brought him back in a few minutes—these things cost me about 5.





WILLIAM HAWKE
. I know the prosecutor's shop—I saw the prisoner leaving it—I followed him—he dropped this property at the bottom of King William-street—the prisoner is the person.

Prisoner's Defence. I was standing at the door, and a boy chucked them it me—I took them up—a man ran out and said, "Thief, thief," and I pat them down again.




GUILTY
.* Aged 14.—


Transported for Seven Yean.

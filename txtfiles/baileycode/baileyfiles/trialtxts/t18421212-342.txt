WILLIAM WELLS
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
17th of Nov., 1 cask, value 2s.; and 207lbs. weight of pork, 5l.; the goods of 



Richard Chidley.






WILLIAM CHINAN
. I am shopman to Richard Chidley, a cheesemonger in Whitechapel-road. On the 17th of Nov. I received information, and missed a cask of pork—I ran down the street, and saw two men rolling it—one was a short man—I cannot swear to the prisoner—the other man I could—we had the barrel of pork here last Sessions—this prisoner was not in custody then.

Cross-examined by
MR. WILD. Q. What time at night was this? A. Five minutes after eight.





JOHN FRESHWATER
 (police-constable K 146.) I saw the prisoner and three

others go up the road—I watched them—I left Wells and Shaw standing within three or four doors of Mr. Chidley's shop—I afterwards heard that the pork was taken—I am sure the prisoner was with Shaw—I have been after him ever since, but could not find him.





EDWARD HENRY TURIN
. On the 17th of Nov. I was standing at my master's door at live minutes before eight o'clock—I saw the prisoner roll the barrel of pork from Mr. Chidley's door—he rolled it round Court-street, and then Shaw helped him.

Cross-examined. Q. Did you ever see the prisoner before? A. I knew him by sight.
(---- Cooper, timber-merchant, and Samuel Cannon, auctioneer, gave the prisoner a good character.)

JAMES VEITCH. I keep a linen-draper's shop
, in Ratcliff-highway


. On the 2d of June the prisoner came in, between six and seven o'clock in the evening; she asked me to show her some cloth for trousers, which I did - she asked me for a pattern, and I cut it for her; I turned to get something else, and she went away; I saw my young man stop her at the door; I heard something drop at the same time, but did not see from whence it came -I saw it lie on the threshold, and found it was a piece of Irish linen.
MARTHA BATSON. I was in the shop, and saw the prisoner take the piece of cloth from the counter - she walked towards the door; the young man went and took her - I heard it drop at the door.
THOMAS GULLEN. I am in the employ of the prosecutor. The prisoner came into the shop and asked for some trousers - my master showed her some cloth to make some; I saw her take the piece of cloth and put it under her apron - she went to the door; I followed and brought her back - she dropped it.
Prisoner's Defence. I wanted some duck ones; he had none - I asked for a pattern of some duck to make some if there was time; the young man then came and said I had something belonging to his master - he took up the cloth, but I had not seen it; whether it was knocked down or not I cannot tell; I had a basket in my hand.

            . I am a constable of Bow-street. On the 20th of November, about eight o'clock at night, the prisoner and two others passed me, by the Admiralty. I suspected them, and turned back, as I thought they were following a cart. I followed them into Pall-Mall


. One of his companions went behind the cart, and tried to take something out, but did not succeed. He returned to the other two, they walked on about 200 yards, following the cart; the prisoner then went behind the cart and lifted something over the tail-board; I could not see what it was; he returned to his companions with it under his arm. Wright and I went up, laid hold of him, and found the cheese under his arm. The others immediately ran away. He dropped the cheese and resisted very much. I lost the cart, and do not know who it belonged to.

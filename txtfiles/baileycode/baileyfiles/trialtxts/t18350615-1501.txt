CAROLINE PETERSON
 and 




SARAH SMITH
 were indicted for

stealing, on the 
18th of June, 9 yards of printed cotton, value 7s., the goods of 



James Brown.






WILLIAM SHEATH
. I am in the employ of Mr. James Brown, linendraper, No. 3, High-street, Shadwell. On the 18th of June, the prisoner came there in company, and asked to look at some printed cottons, and then asked to see some more—none suited—I showed some more—none suited—they saw one across the shop, and wished to have that—they left one

shilling on that, and said they would come the next day—they went away, and in a minute or two I missed nine yards of print—I went after them, brought them back, and sent for a policeman—I told them I suspected they had taken something—they denied it, and so they did to Mr. Brown—the officer was sent for—he found the print—I believe Peterson was carrying the basket; they said the print belonged to them, and had bought it at some other shop—I swear it is Mr. Brown's property, it has his mark on it, in my own writing.





WILLIAM BASLEY
 (policeman K 176.) I was sent for, and found this print in the basket—I sent for a female to search the prisoners—nothing was found on them.

Peterson's Defence. I was going to purchase a bit of print, and asked this young woman to come with me; whether she had a basket I cannot say, but I had none—what I had I came to pay for—I had done nothing of the kind—I stayed a quarter of an hour outside the door.

PETERSON—


GUILTY

SMITH—


GUILTY

WILLIAM CHECKER
. I am a linen-draper, and live at Clapham. I had a piece of printed cotton safe at my door at half-past twelve o'clock on the 23rd of Oct.—I received information from a neighbour, and missed it between twelve and one—this is it—it is mine.





JOHN BRIDGLAND
. I am an omnibus conductor. On the 23rd of Oct., at ten minutes before one o'clock, I received information, and ran and caught the prisoner—he had this cotton—I saw him drop it—I said, "This don't belong to you"—he said, "No, I did not take it"—he was about 150 yards from Mr. Checker's—he ran part of the way, and then stood, and I came up to him.

Prisoner. There were two others with me who gave it to me.





HENRY NOLAN
 (police-constable L 129.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's conviction, by the name of Henry Jones—(read)—the prisoner is the person then tried.

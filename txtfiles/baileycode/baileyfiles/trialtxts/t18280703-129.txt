 on Tuesday afternoon, between four and five o'clock; I saw the prisoner snatch the umbrella from the child, and run down Church-row as fast as she could - I ran and took it from her; I gave it to the child, who was screaming - the officer came and took the prisoner.

            . I am an officer, and took the prisoner.
Prisoner's Defence. I met the little child carrying a baby, who was crying; I said, "Little girl, you are not able to carry that child and the umbrella;" she gave me the umbrella to hold while she took up the child and carried it a little way, and then put it down; the man came up, and said, I wanted to swindle the child out of the umbrella - I am a widow and have had six children.

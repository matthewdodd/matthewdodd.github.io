            . I am a mason
; I am employed at the new building in the Old Bailey


. On the 31st of August I lost the two chissels that are mentioned in the indictment; I had them about eight o'clock in the morning, when I went to breakfast; on my return they were gone. On the 4th of September I found them at one Mr. Pickering's on Saffron-hill; I asked Middleton if he knew any thing of these tools; he said he stole them and gave them Johnson, who sold them at Pickering's, and I found them there.

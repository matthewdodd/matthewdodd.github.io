HENRY WALKER. I am a farmer
, and live at Enfield-highway



. On the 8th of December, I sent my man to dress the wheat - he could not finish it; he heaped it up in the middle of the barn, and left it; the next morning, he came and told me the barn had been broken open; I went, and missed a bushel or two - it was found in the mill: the prisoners lived close by me, and knew my premises well - they are mother and son; neither of them worked for me - there was a hole which I consider only sufficient for a boy like the prisoner to get through; he was taken up, and then ran away - he came to me; I made him no promise or threat, but he came, and said he would tell me the truth; he did break through the barn, and take it, that his little brother held the sack outside, and he put the wheat in.

            . I worked for the prosecutor. I left the barn all secure on the night of the 8th of December, about five o'clock; I returned at half-past six in the morning; the boards had been pulled down - there was a hole about ten inches wide, through which a boy could get - I missed from one to two bushels - there were nine quarters of wheat; I went and told master - I have seen some wheat since.

            . I am a miller. This wheat was brought to me by the two prisoners to grind, on the 16th of December; I gave it to the officer - there is one bushel and a half of it.

            . I am a constable. I took the prisoners on the 18th of December; I had seen them taking wheat to the mill, and told the prosecutor - I suspected it was not right; the boy made his escape.

            . This is very much like the wheat - it was not quite clean; it is a mixed wheat, red and white, and here is rubbish which the machine would not take out.
MR. WALKER. I have been a farmer nearly all my life; I believe this wheat to be mine - it is not in a fit state to send to the mill.

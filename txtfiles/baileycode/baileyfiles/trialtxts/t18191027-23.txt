            . I am a shoemaker
, and live in Orange-street, St. Martin's in the Fields


; I occupy the kitchen, and have boots and shoes there; there is a staircase from the street to the kitchen. On the 28th of September, about half-past nine o'clock at night, I shut the flap, but left the door open, and went for a pot of porter. When I came back I saw the prisoner on the stairs, taking the shoes off the nails, which hung by the kitchen-door - he had got over the flap. I saw him take four pair of shoes and one pair of boots; he turned to come up again, but I pushed him into the kitchen, and he fell with the shoes under him. I secured him.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

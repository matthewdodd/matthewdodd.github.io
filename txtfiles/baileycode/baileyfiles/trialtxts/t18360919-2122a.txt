JAMES SMITH
. I live in Charles-street, Deptford. About half-past ten o'clock on the 2nd of September, I saw the prisoner walk into Mr. Pavey's shop, and take hold of a saucepan which was lying on the table, and put it down again—she walked a little way up the shop, then returned, took it again, and walked away—I followed, and called to her—she came back with it in her apron—I took her into the shop to Mr. Pavey, and left her.





JAMES PAVEY
. I keep the shop. This is my saucepan—the prisoner was brought back with it.

Prisoner. I had it not in my apron at all.




GUILTY
. Aged 44.—


Transported for Seven Years.

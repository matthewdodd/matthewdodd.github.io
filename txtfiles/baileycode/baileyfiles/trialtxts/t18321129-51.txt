                  BLOUNT
               



            . I am in the employ of Spalding and Co. The prisoner has been in their employ, but was not so at this, but he came to the premises; I had a cheque in my possession on the 16th of November - it was the property of Basil Jackson and John Hodge; I keep it in a desk in our room, on the premises of Spalding and Hodge - Mr. 
               
                  John 
                  Hodge
               



             lives in the house, it is his dwelling alone; my desk was not locked - I missed the cheque about a week after, in consequence of a gentleman from Messrs. Coutts' coming to our house, and I saw the cheque afterwards - it was for 41l. odd, payable at Coutts'.


                  RICHARD 
                  MINSHAW
               



            . I am clerk to Messrs. Coutts. The prisoner presented this cheque for payment on the 22nd of November; it being dated so far back as April, before I paid it I kept the cheque, and asked him from whom he received it - he said from Spalding and Hodge, who had desired him to bring it down to get the money; he then went away, as he said to explain the circumstance to Mr. Hodge - he did not return that day; I called on Spalding and Hodge that evening, and next day the prisoner brought a note to our house from Spalding and Hodge, and I asked him how he came in possession of the draft he had presented the previous day; he said he had found it in the counting-house - I gave the cheque to Mr. Hodge; Jackson and Co have an account at our house.


                  JOSHUA 
                  BLOUNT
               



            . The prisoner came occasionally to our counting-house, as he was employed by Mr. Lewis, our traveller; Spalding and Hodge are wholesale stationers - there is a room between my room and the counting-house; they are all on the same floor - the room is my counting-house; it communicates with the rest of the house.
JOHN HODGE. I live in Drury-lane


. Minshaw gave me a cheque on the 22nd of November; it was the property of myself and 
               
                  Basil 
                  Jackson
               



             - the prisoner has lived with me; he had left several months, but he came to the premises afterwards, being employed there by Lewis - I had given the cheque with other papers to Blount; it was in a cheque-book, partly cut from the margin, but not completely - I never entrusted it in any way to the prisoner, or authorised any body to hand it to him; I am not not certain whether he was on our premises on the 22nd of November - he came three or four days in the week, just when our traveller wanted him; I did not see him after Minshaw produced the cheque till he was in custody, but he had come to our house on the 23rd, to be employed by our traveller - Mr. Spalding sent for him, and sent him to Coutts' with a note; I saw him in custody at Bow-street afterwards - I had possession of the cheque till I gave it to Blount.


                  JOSHUA 
                  BLOUNT
               



            . I received the cheque from somebody, and gave it to Thomas - it was the cheque I lost out of my desk.


                  JOSEPH 
                  SADLER THOMAS
               



            . I am superintendent of the Police. The prisoner was brought to the station-house on the Friday; I told him he was charged with stealing a cheque from Messrs. Spalding and Hodge; he replied, "I am very sorry for it;" I said,"What are you sorry for?" his answer was, "That I should have done it, or that I should do it;" I produce the cheque which I received from Blount.
Prisoner. It is my first offence; I throw myself on the mercy of the Court.

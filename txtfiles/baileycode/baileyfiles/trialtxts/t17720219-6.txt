            . I am a haberdasher
 and live at Aldgate


. On the 25th of January, a little before ten o'clock at night, while I was in a back parlour behind my shop, one of my young men came and said the windows are broke; I bid him run out; he did, and one 
               
                  Thomas
                   Pearcey
               



             came in and said the thieves were run up Church Row; we run there, and we found the prisoner just by the Bell ale-house, which is about 150 yards from my house; my sister saw him drop some handkerchiefs in the shop.
He pretended to be ignorant, and said, we had dropt them there ourselves: they broke the square the handkerchiefs lay against the window; the shop was not shut up, it being Saturday night; there were five or six parcels; upon searching I found three parcels missing from the windows, there were the makers marks upon them; by the marks and the pattern, I believe them to be my property.

            . I carry coals for a coal shed in Houndsditch; I was going by the prosecutor's, and I saw the prisoner and another standing under Mr. Caley's window; I had about forty yards to go; they were standing there when I came back; the prisoner stared me in the face; I heard a pane crack, and I saw them draw something out of the window; and they run up Church Row; I told Mr. Caley; so he went after them, and brought back the prisoner; he is the same man that I saw under the window; I saw Mr. Caley's Sister take one parcel out of his apron and two other parcels lay right under his feet, there were no parcels there before he was brought in.

            . When the prisoner was brought back into my brother's shop, I saw one parcel of handkerchiefs drop out of his lap as he stood in the middle of the shop; his apron was tuck'd up; after that I saw another parcel in his apron, which was searched. The handkerchiefs laid quite in view. I took them out of his apron. I suppose the other parcels had dropt before.

            . I sold a quantity of such goods as these to Mr. Caley; here is my hand writing upon this piece; I sold it to Mr. Caley.
The prisoner in his defence said, he pick'd the handkerchiefs up in the street, he call'd his mother who said he had behaved very well to her.




               Guilty of stealing, but not in the shop

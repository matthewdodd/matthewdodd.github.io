            . I keep a book-shop
 in Holborn


. I had some books in a tray at my window - I received information, and went in pursuit of the prisoner, who was then about one hundred yards from my shop, and took this book from his breeches pocket - I had seen it safe a few minutes before.
Prisoner. I was walking leisurely along with this book, which I got two days befofre, in exchange for a pair of oldshoes. Witness. It is my own binding, and I know it by that.

            . I was going along, and saw the prisoner put his hand up and take the book from inside the window; he put it into his breeches pocket, went up a court, and came down again - we went and took him with it.
Prisoner. He has told you a falsehood, for Mr. Wilton stopped me, and he was behind. Witness. No, I stopped him.
Prisoner's Defence. I deal in old shoes, and took the book in exchange for a pair; I wanted the Messiah for it, I went to the tray, and there was not one - I looked at his books, but it was not there; I then went down a court, and returned - the prosecutor came and said, "You have a book of mine;" I said, "You flurry me - I have nothing of yours; I have this book, which is my own."
MR. WILTON. He said he was a poor man, when I stopped him.

            . I am a Policeman. I stopped the prisoner in Litchfield-street, Soho, on the 27th of September. with this piece of brass; I asked what it was - he said a bit of wood; I had suspicion, and looked - he then said it was a brass fender, and he was going to take it to his master's; I have fitted it to the prosecutor's window, and it fits exactly.

            . I am servant to Mr. Sutton
, who lives in Mortimor-street. On the 25th of January, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I was in Tottenham-court-road


 - some men had been fighting; I stopped to look at them for about five minutes, I felt something pull at my pocket, and saw the prisoner go from me; I saw the corner of my handkerchief as he put it under his great-coat. I followed him, and saw him take it from his coat, and put it into his pocket. I secured him, and he gave it to me. He told me to say nothing about it.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

            . I have a shop
 in Newgate-market




. On the 24th of December I came to my shop, expecting to find seven flats of butter out of the Daventry waggon, and there were but five.

                  Mecchin 
               



            . I unloaded these goods out of the waggon, and was at the delivering seven flats of butter at Mr. Nalder's shop; we put them down at his stall on the 24th of December; there was none of his people there, but there was the clerk of the market.

            . I had lost a parcel, with some bills of advice; I went to Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



             for advice; last Wednesday se'nnight I was informed there were two men taken up, which were the prisoners; I was directed to Smith's lodgings, in Blue-anchor alley, Bunhill-row; there I saw the two flats marked A. A. I knew them to be Mr. Adams's, the Daventry Waggoner; and having heard of butter being lost, we took the flats with us; I saw a piece of a direction in one of them; part was rubbed off, but there was Nalder on it; (the flats and cloths produced, the cloths had Adams at length on them.)


                  John 
                  Marston

                  Jones 
               



             and I went into Newgate-market about three weeks ago, about six at night; there were six or seven flats of butter standing by the prosecutor's shop; he took one and I another, and carried one to Smith's house, and the other we left in Jones's room; Smith sold them for us; he gave us 10 d. a lump, two pounds in a lump; he had the two flats of butter; I received of him better than six shillings for my part at one time, and I had some more afterwards. Jones lived in Hand-alley, Golden-lane; I am sure that flat or basket is one of them, by a piece of Iron upon it.


                  John 
                  Noaks 
               



            . I am constable. I went with Mr. Aldwin to search Smith's house; there were the two flats; he said they belonged to Mr. Adams; we took them with us; I saw Mr. Nalder's name upon one of them; there we found the cloths.
Jones's defence.
The evidence had the key of my room three days; he was taken up one night, and those things were laid to me as a confederate.
Smith's defence.
The evidence dined along with me last Sunday; he found fault I had no cloth upon the table; he brought the hamper without a lid, and said I might burn it, and keep the cloth to lay upon my table.

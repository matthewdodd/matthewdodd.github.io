                  , from his person
            .
JAMES HOOKER. I am a Custom-house officer
. About eight o'clock on the morning of the 15th of November, I was in St. Mary Axe


, a horse had fallen down, and the prisoner was standing there; the passage was narrow, and I said to my brother officer, who was going on duty with me, "We had better go singly." He went first, and I after him. The prisoner came up to me and snatched my watch out of my pocket; I seized him by the arm, and called Thief! thief! My partner could not come to my assistance, but I held the prisoner, and he threw down the watch to make use of his other hand, to push me aside; he then made his escape, and lost his hat in the scuffle; he ran through several streets, and we pursued, but lost sight of him; he was, however, taken in a street in which there is no thoroughfare.

            . I was in St. Mary-axe on the 15th of November. I heard the cry of Thief! and saw the prisoner and the witness Hooker, struggling together. The prisoner got away, but he had thrown the watch down at my feet.

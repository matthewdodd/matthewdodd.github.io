            . On the 30th of July I was in Cheapside, and saw the two prisoners coming down Wood-street into Cheapside - Donnovan went into two Manchester warehouses; they then went into Trump-street, and Donnovan went into the prosecutor's - Topper walked backwards and forwards, close by the door; Donnovan came out with something under his coat, and rejoined Topper. I took them both, and found the shoes on Donnovan.

            . I was with Herdsfield, and saw Donnovan come out of the shop. I went up, and he dropped the shoes at the time Herdsfield seized him.
DAVID REID. I keep this shop
. I was up stairs, and knew nothing of it till the prisoners were brought back; I missed the shoes off a nail in the back part of my shop.(Property produced and sworn to.)
DONNOVAN'S Defence. I know nothing of the other prisoner; I only asked him the time; and went in to ask if they wanted a boy.
TOPPER'S Defence. I was not within ten yards of the place; he came up and asked what it was o'clock; we walked together - he went into two warehouses.

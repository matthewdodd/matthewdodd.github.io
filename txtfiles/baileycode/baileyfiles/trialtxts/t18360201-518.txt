GEORGE LUCAS
. I am in the service of Mr. Seth Worrall, who keeps an eating-house on Holborn-hill, The prisoner came in on the 7th of January,

about two o'clock in the day, alone—she went and interfered with other people's dinners, and took what she liked with them, and some were obliged to use her very roughly, to keep her away—our waiter was obliged to put her out, she would not go away—she had a bundle with her—we did not miss any thing then, for we regularly lose knives and forks every day—some weeks four dozen—I know this knife and fork to be my master's and this spoon—I think she in the house an hour and a half.

Prisoner. I was asleep part of the time, Witness. She was there the day before—if I went to take any thing off the table, she would say, "I have not done with them, "and snatch up the things.





GEORGE CHIDSEY
 I am a policeman. I found this bundle on the prisoner—it contained a lot of pieces of paper, with this knife and fork and spoon.

Prisoner. There was a cab-man in the house who took my potatoes and soup, and he must have put these things in my bundle.

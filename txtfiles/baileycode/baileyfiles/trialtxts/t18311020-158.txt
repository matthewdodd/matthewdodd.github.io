            .
WILLIAM CAULDFIELD. I live in Gray's Inn-passage, and am a book and print-seller
. On the 8th of October, about half-past five o'clock in the evening, I left my shop, leaving this picture safe - I returned in about three minutes, and as I came to my door Mason gave me the picture, and gave me information.

            . I live in Gray's Inn-passage, nearly opposite the prosecutor's. I saw the prisoner walking up and down the passage - I then saw him go into Cauldfield's shop, and come out with the picture under his arm- he ran away; I called Stop thief! he dropped it; I took it up, and gave it to Cauldfield - he was secured in a few seconds; I have not a doubt of him - he was alone.

            . I laid hold of the prisoner in Bedford-street, near Red Lion-square; Mason called to me to stop him - I saw him throw down the picture, and stopped him, without losing sight of him.
ALFRED MARTIN. The prisoner was delivered into my custody, with the picture; he said it was not him who stole it - that he ran to get out of the way when the man ran.(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I heard a cry of Stop thief! and ran.

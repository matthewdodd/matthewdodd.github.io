            . On Sunday morning about six o'clock, I was called up and informed, that there were three or four men with a bag of fowls; I went after them, and saw the prisoners on Bow Common; I apprehended Freeman; he had the bag; he said it contained fowls; I found it had six fowls, and two ducks dead, and two live geese in it; the ducks and fowls were just warm. He said he did not steal the geese, but the two Wells's gave them to him. When I apprehended him, the two Wells ran away. I shewed the property to the prosecutor, and he owned the fowls and the ducks.

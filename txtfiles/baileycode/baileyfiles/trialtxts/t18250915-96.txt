, Fetter-lane


. On the 10th of September, about nine o'clock in the morning, a stone was thrown at one of our back windows, which looks into a yard - I went to the side door to see who threw it, and saw no body; I was sitting in the parlour which commands a view of the shop, and went from there - this coat hung at the front door, and while I stood at the side door, which is in Neville's-court, I saw the prisoner pass with a coat - he threw it away on seeing me - I ran after him immediately, he was secured without my losing sight of him - the coat was picked up - it is my father's - he begged he might be liberated.

            . I am a jeweller, and live in Bluett's-buildings. I was coming up Neville's-court, and saw the prisoner turn short round the corner from Mr. Brown's front door, and just opposite to the side door, he threw down a coat, and ran away on seeing Brown - I stopped himwithout losing sight of him - picked up the coat, and took him back to the shop - he begged to be let go, saying, it was his first offence.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I was in Fetter-lane, three men asked me if I wanted employ - they said if I would take that coat from the door, and wait at the bottom of the alley, they would give me 6 d.

            . The prisoner came to lodge at my house on the 1 8th of October; between eight and nine o'clock in the evening he took a candle to go to bed; about ten minutes after he went up, I sent the girl to fetch the key down, that the prisoner might not be disturbed; she came down again, and told me the man and the bed were both gone; on Monday the 20th I found him at the King's-head in Holbourn; some of his friends were there; he informed me he had carried the bed and bedding to a house in Short's-Gardens; I went there about half an hour after, and found all the things there; they were in the room of one

            . I have a room in Short's Gardens. I have known the prisoner six weeks or two months; he told me he was going to buy a bed of a man that owed him some money; he brought a bed two days after that on a Saturday; the next morning we untied it, and he desired my wife to lay the bed on the bedstead, to be out of the way; I saw the bolster and blankets, the sheets and the covering.

             came on Monday; as soon as I knew what he came about, I told him there was a bed there; I shew'd him the things; and he said they were his property.
Prisoner's Defence.
Mr. Relly and his son came to the King's-head and took me up; they said, if I would tell them where the things were, they would not hurt me; about half an hour after that, they took me to the Round-house.

            . I am a leather dresser
, and live in Whitechapel. On the 28th of January, I went to receive some money at a public house, and after that to another, and called for a pint of beer. The woman at the bar sat on one side the fire, and I on the other: she asked me whether I would give her a pint; we had a full pot, after that another pint. I bought two black puddings of a man that came in: then we went to the Ship, in Monmouth-street, together, and drank. I never saw her before. I got very fuddled. I said I lived in Whitechapel; she went along with me to another public house, but I cannot tell where that was: she came to see me home; this was about 12 at night. When we got just by Prescot-street, I fell down, and was terribly wet. I believe I might be there some time. When I got up, I clapped my hand to my fob, and missed my watch. I said to her, you have my watch: she said, she had not. I took hold of her, and shoved her through Rosemary-branch-alley, and called the watch, and gave him charge of her; she was searched in the watch-house, and the watch found under her arm.

             the constable confirmed the account of finding the watch as mentioned.
Prisoner's defence.
When he fell, I stooped to lift him up. I saw something shine. I picked it up, and put it in my bosom.

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. On the evening of the 15th of March, when you were at Messrs. Smith's, did you search the prisoner's box? - A. I did on the following day; I broke it open and found about eight bottles of wine and liquor together, and this cheese; there are two pieces of cheese, which weigh about seven pounds; the prisoner was not present; I found receipts for Bank Annuity, in the name of 
               
                  Edmund 
                  Gardner
               



            ; I believe there were eighteen or nineteen, all in his name, to the amount of eight or nine hundred pounds.

                  SMITH
               



            , jun. sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. The prisoner was in your employ; were you present when the prisoner's box was opened and the cheese found? - A. I was.
Q. Do you know that cheese? - A. It has our mark; I took the officer down into the warehouse, to shew him the mark of the same dairy.
Q. Have you sold any cheese of the same dairy with that mark on it? - A. None but what was shipped in the country to Kent and different parts.
Mr. Knapp. Q. How many persons do you keep serving in your shop? - A. Only my partners, myself, and Gardner.
Q. Therefore, whether your partners had sold it to the prisoner you cannot tell us; it is single Gloucester? - A. It is.
Q. What quantity of cheese of the same dairy had you left? - A. I do not know.
Q. Had the prisoner been ill just at this time? - A. Not to my knowledge.
Q. He had made no application to you for any cheese? - A. Not to my knowledge.
Q. Did he board in the family? - A. Yes; he had the same cheese and the same joint of meat as the family had.
Court. Q. You have no private mark on that cheese? - A. It is marked with our factor's markwhich we can prove; it is marked with W. S. No. 2.
Court. Q. That other people may have as well as you? - A. There are no other people have cheese with our initials; our factor's name is Groom.
Jury. I can vouch that Groom does not mark any other person's cheese with W. S.
Prisoner's defence. I have been, for several winters past, troubled with a bad cough; on the 26th of February last I complained to my young master, Thomas, of the cheese that I eat; it was strong old Cheshire cheese; it made my cough much worse; I used to eat cheese twice a day, and on that day he cut that cheese, and gave me that which is now produced, and said, put it by, let nobody see it, and you can have a slice when you please.
Court. Q. Is he here? - A. No.

I was passing by Mr. Billett's, the 12th of March, about half past five, and I saw the prisoner take these handkerchiefs off from the door-post; he was going along the street, and rolling them up; I pursued and took him; hearing a person speak to me, he ran across Oxford-road, and dropt the handkerchiefs in the middle of the road; I ran after him, he fell down, and I took him: these are the handkerchiefs.
PRISONER's DEFENCE.
A man took the handkerchiefs, and chucked them down, and I took them up.

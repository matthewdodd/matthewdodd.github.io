JAMES LYNCH.
 I am a lighterman, and live at Horsleydown. Between one and two o'clock, on the morning of 8th Nov., I was walking down Tooley-street—the prisoner came up to me—I Shoved her away two or three times—she shoved me down Weaver's-lane—we stood there about five minutes—she then left me—I had a handkerchief, two half-crowns, and other money, just before—the moment she left me, I put my hand into my pocket, and they were gone—no one could have taken them but her.





THOMAS TATE
 (policeman, M 267.) I took the prisoner—I found two half-crowns in her right-hand, and a sixpence and two-pence down her bosom—she told me to keep the money that was in her hand and say nothing about it.

Prisoner's Defence. It was my own money, which a gentleman gave me in the street just before; this man said all the money he had was 3d., and if I did not go down Weaver's-lane with him for that, he would give me in charge.





JOHN WOODHOUSE
 (police-sergeant, M 13.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction—(read—Convicted Oct., 1841, and confined three months)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY. Aged 27.—


Transported for Seven Years.

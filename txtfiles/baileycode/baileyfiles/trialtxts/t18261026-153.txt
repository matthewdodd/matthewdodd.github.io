JAMES WATKINS. On the 9th of October, I was in my master's bake-house, in Garnet-place, Clerkenwell


, and lost my handkerchief and watch from there; the prisoner was my fellow-servant, and was going out with bread - I missed the watch, which hung by the trough-board, directly he was gone; it was safe five minutes before - the handkerchief was in the room we both slept in - I went round to the customers, found he had served them and gone away, leaving his basket - I could not find him till last Monday week, when he was taken with my handkerchief on his neck.

            . I am a pawnbroker; the prisoner pawned this watch on the 9th of October, about four o'clock; he said it was his uncle's, Samuel Makepace.

            . I superintend the watch; I received the prisoner in charge with this handkerchief on his neck - he told me where the watch was, and said he had torn the duplicate up.(Property produced and sworn to.)

, I was told by a person that I had been followed by two men, and one of them had picked my pocket, and that he'd shew me the person that did it; when we came over against the Change he shewed me the man, I laid hold of the prisoner and his companion, and took them into a shop; while I was talking to the prisoner's companion, I turned my head and saw my handkerchief lie on the ground near the prisoner's foot. The handkerchief produced in court and deposed to. I never saw the person since, who saw them pick my pocket.

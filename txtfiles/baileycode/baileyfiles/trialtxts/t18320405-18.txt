GEORGE KENT. I lodged with Mrs. Gleed, not Glee, in Chapel-street


 - the prisoner lodged there four months, and slept with me. On the 29th of January I missed from my box in my sleeping-room seven sovereigns and a half; they were in a small box in the larger one; the prisoner had then been gone three days - I did not know he was going; I never found the money - I saw him in custody in about five weeks.

            . On the 4th of March I apprehended the prisoner, and took him to Kent, who gave him in charge - he said nothing to me on the way from the station-house to the office; but he made a statement at the office, which Mr. Laing took down - I was present, and saw him sign it; I know this statement to be in Mr. Laing's hand-writing - (read)
The prisoner voluntarily says, "I own the deed of unlocking the box, and taking the money out, seven sovereigns and a half, and sixpence - I left my lodgings, and went to No. 3, Cock-alley; I have none of the money left. THOMAS TISSIKER."

            . Aged 32.

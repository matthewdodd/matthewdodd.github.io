            . I am an auctioneer and house-agent -I live in Seymour-place. In July the prisoner Jones calledon me; I had seen him before - he told me he was about a house at 200l. a year in Connaught-terrace, and he wished me to go over the inventory, to see if it was correct; he did not take that house; but I afterwards arranged to let him Mrs. De Windt's house - he said he was a respectable person, and could give me the best of references; that when he was at home he resided at Carno, North Wales - he afterwards said he was connected with an extensive mining concern in North Wales; he called on me afterwards, said he had seen Mrs. De Windt, that all was settled, and he was to have possession; I forget whether I sent a man with him or not, but he said he expected his housekeeper in town, and she would be ready there to take possession - I saw him after that, when he said he had taken possession, and found every thing quite correct; he afterwards appointed me his secretary for his mining concerns; and I must confess, I looked upon him as a very wealthy individual.
Cross-examined by MR. CARRINGTON. Q. Was it you who recommended him to Mrs. De Windt, as an eligible person? A. Certainly not - they became known to each other by some other means.
SARAH BIRCH DE WINDT. I am a widow
. I had a furnished house in Winchester-row, Paddington


; the prisoner Jones called to look at it, and said he wished to hire it - there was at that time a bill on the house to let it; I asked him 110l. a year - he said that was more than he should like to give, and I finally agreed to let it him for 105l., on condition of his taking it for twelve months certain; he said he had possessions in Wales, a house, servants, and an establishment there - that his property chiefly consisted of mines; he stated he had a wife and family, and the motive of his coming to town was on account of Mrs. Jones' health; I had not then seen either of the other prisoners; but on the 24th of July Jones took possession of the house, and that day I saw Boone - she presented a card to me, saying she came from Mr. Blakie, to take possession of the house, in the name of Mr. and Mrs. Jones, her master and mistress; she went over the furniture with me with the inventory, but prior to that she showed me a letter, which she said she had received from her master that morning - she said he was a most excellent husband, master, and father - that she had lived with him twenty-two years, and that she had strict injunctions to be particular in taking the house, as she would most likely have to give it up as she received it: in the month of September Jones called on me in Judd-street - he spoke of some alterations he had made in the house; I said I was surprised at it, and he said did I not suppose it would make the property all the better - I said no doubt it would make it all the better; he had taken to the old sashes in the parlour and put in new ones; I never saw Hicks but twice - the first time was about a fortnight or three weeks after Jones had taken the house; I called there, and she came down to the gate - she did not know me, but I made myself known to her as the lady belonging to the house, and said if Mr. and Mrs. Jones were at home I wanted to speak to them - she said Mr. Jones was not, but she asked me into the parlour, and said she did not think I could see Mrs. Jones, as she was laid down; she went out of the parlour, but not long enough to get up stairs, when she returned, and said Mrs. Jones was too ill to see me - I saw Jones at the house I think about the 17th of September, when I went to look at the improvement which he had told me of; and I told him I wished very much to go into the back parlour, where there was a book case with some valuable books, which were not let with the furniture; the bookcase was locked, and I had the key in my possession - Jones said that room was sacred to his son, and his papers were there; I then observed that when I left the house there was no lock that would secure the door between that room and the front parlour, and now there were patent locks on - Jones said if I very much wished it he would send and have the lock picked for me, but he would rather not till his son came home; he afterwards called on me in Judd-street, and made an offer of marriage to me - he told me his wife died a week after he went into my house; I referred him to my husband's executors and all my friends, to prove that his wife was dead, and that he was the gentleman he represented himself to be - he exhibited some papers to me, which the officer has, and said he would settle 600l. mining shares on me; he said he had a great deal of property, if it could be realized, but that was all he could then settle on me: on the 7th of November I went to the house, having had my suspicions - I had had a man to watch some days before; I found the gate open, and on going into the house I found it nearly stripped - the doors were all open, and I called a Policeman to go in and prove that they were so; I missed all the property stated in the indictment, and more - I had gone to the house on the Friday previous to the 7th of November; I saw Boone at the gate - I expressed a great wish to go into the house; she said she had positive orders from her master not to admit me, but she said if I went the next morning most likely he would be in town - I went the next morning- she was there; she did not let me in, but offered me a letter through the gate from her master - I said unless she let me into the house, and treated me like a gentlewoman, I should not take it, and I did not.
Cross-examined by MR. CARRINGTON. Q. Is the inventory in your possession? A. Yes; Jones had altered the windows by taking out old sashes and putting in new ones - Mr. Watts, who put them in, told me they were not paid for; Jones talked of making other alterations - the locks which were put on appeared to me to be a sort of lock I had never seen before; he paid me very few attentions - he did not give me time to receive them; from July till the 17th of September, I never saw him at all - it was about three weeks after he had been in the house, that I called and heard his wife was ill; I did not accept him as my future husband, unless he could prove himself to be what he had stated - I never wrote letters to him in tender terms; I think I wrote one note to him signed with my Christian name only - I went with him in a carriage to 
               
                  Beulah 
                  Spa
               



            ; I should rather think that was at my expense, as my property paid for it - he was not to have any thing to do with the books; they were in the back parlour, but any that were not locked up, of course, he would have access to -I one day asked him to bring me a book which was in a closet by the door, but that was not locked; I never received any presents from him, but I suppose you allude to the ring he offered me - this note is my writing (read).
Received from my (I hope will be for ever) dear friend and protector, a trifle, called a ring.
October 22,1832.

I do not recollect saying at 
               
                  Beulah 
                  Spa
               



             "I authorize you to manage and deal with my temporal concerns, and I will undertake the care of your spiritual concerns, and then we shall each of us know our respective duties hereafter;" I could not swear I never said any thing to that effect.
COURT. Q. Did you ever say those words or any thing of the sort, to authorize him to dispose of your property? A. No.
MR. CARRINGTON. Q. Did you not say at Beulah Spa, some words that would convey to the mind of Mr. Jones something of that sort? A. I do not know what entered his mind, I never authorized him to manage and deal with my temporal affairs; I said just now I would not swear I had not, because you confused me - there was no jealousy on his part from my having received the visits of a younger man; Mr. Cole called on me one evening, when Jones was with me - I left the keys of other locks in the house - I could not swear to a key - I do not think either of these keys would unlock the bookcase.
COURT. Q. When you did get into the back parlour, which Mr. Jones told you was sacred to his son, did you miss the books which had been there? A. Yes, and a silver cup, and some other things.

             (Police-serjeant D 11.) I went to No. 2, Bryanstone-street, on the 8th of November - we found Hicks at the attic door; the inspector asked if she had been in Mr. Jones' employ; she said Yes - we asked where he was; she said she did not know; we began to search her, and I saw this duplicate drop from her - I picked it up; it is for some furniture, pawned the night before for 1l. 1s.; we found nine keys, eight cups and saucers, a slop-basin, sugar-basin, and three egg-cups, which the prosecutrix claims - we went into the next attic, and found Boone in bed; we found Jones on the top of the house, on the tiles - he was not dressed; he had only a frock coat on, and a pair of light trousers - I found some men's clothes in Boone's bed-room, and Jones put them on - he said, "What I have done I must answer for; the things are all pawned, not sold - these women you have no occasion to take into custody; what they have done is by my orders, and I exonerate them."
Cross-examined by MR. CARRINGTON. Q. Were not the duplicates given up? A. Yes; I did not hear him say he did it from temporary distress.

            . I am an inspector of Police. I went with the officer; what he has stated is correct: on searching Jones I found this pocket-book, containing some mining shares - he said it was no use looking in his pockets for duplicates; if I would go with him, he would produce them - we went to the Delaware Arms, and asked the servant for a parcel he left there, and gave me sixty-four duplicates, saying they belonged to Mrs. De Windt's property - part of it has been given up.
MRS. DE WINDT. This letter is in Jones' writing - I received it - (read.)
MADAM, - I hope that that religion, and that God whom you so devoulty worship, will incline you to adopt towards my truly sorrowful mind a degree of mercy. I never had the slightest thought of doing wrong towards you, whom I really did, I may say worship - but this I must only now think of in my repentant mind, for having pledged your goods. In your religion you will find the noble happiness to be derived from compassion and mercy. There is still a chair and glass to be restored to you, which I had forgot, but shall not be so on Wednesday; also six cups and saucers, three or four plates, and part of a glass there, I am taking means to obtain and deliver. O spare me the continuance of a further agony, most mental agony, but sincere penitent.
Mrs. De Windt, I, Winchester-row, New-road.
10th Nov. 1832.

            . I am in the service of Mr. Aldous, a pawnbroker. I have a looking-glass, picture, and mirror, which were pawned with me on the 5th of November, by Jones, in the name of 
               
                  John 
                  Jones
               



             - he said he brought them from a friend of his, who was under distress for rent.
Jones, in a long address, stated that he had pledged the property to relieve a temporary embarrassment, fully intending to redeem them, and in no way injure the prosecutrix, for whom he had a strong attachment; that the female prisoners were his servant

s, and having left town without the means of providing them with cash, had desired Hicks, if in want, to pledge articles.

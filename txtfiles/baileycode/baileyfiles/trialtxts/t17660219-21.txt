            . I am a coachman
, a servant to a gentleman. I keep a house near Leicester-fields


, the prisoner was a weekly servant
 to me; the things mentioned in the indictment were missing, she was charged with taking them: she owned she had taken and pawned them at three different times, and I found them again by her direction, at Mr. Hodges's, a pawnbroker, (produced in court and deposed to, the pawnbroker's servant confirmed the above account.)
The prisoner said nothing in her defence.

            , my tenant at Harlington


, came and told me my leaden pump was taken away, which was fix'd to the back part of his dwelling-house.
Q. Was it fix'd to the wall of the house?
Peridge. It was, and the pipe went through into the kitchen, to serve a copper. The prisoner was working there as a day labourer.
Q. Did you ever see your pump again?
Peridge. There was a leaden pump cried at the market in Brentford; I went there, and found it to be my property.
- Priest. I live at Brentford. On the 19th of January the prisoner at the bar brought a leaden pump, with two nossels, to my mistress to sell. She suspecting it to have been stolen, would not buy it, without he'd bring somebody to his character. He went, pretending to bring somebody, but he came no more. Then my mistress had it cried, and the prosecutor came on the Tuesday night and claim'd it.
Prisoner's Defence.
I was not at work at Mr. Chapman's that days I know nothing of the pump.

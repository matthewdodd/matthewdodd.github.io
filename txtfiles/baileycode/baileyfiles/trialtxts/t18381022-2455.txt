CHARLES WORLEY
. I live at Stratford and am a clothier. On the 20th of October, I missed a coat from my place—I saw it ten minutes before I went—I received information, and found the prisoner at the back of some empty houses, with the coat in a bag—this was about ten minutes after I had lost it—I missed other property at the same time, but have not found it.





WILLIAM JOHNSON
. I live with a linen-draper at Stratford. I was going by the shop and saw the prisoner take the coat and go off with it.

 for stealing, on the 
20th of May, 1 account-book, value 2s.: the goods of 




Charles Clarke and another.







JOHN HENRY WRIGHT
. I am book-keeper to Charles Clarke and Robert Metcalf, attornies, in Lincoln's Inn Fields. I know this book was safe in the front room of the third floor of the house, a few days before the 28th—it is their draft-bill book.





MARY TOWNSEND
. I am housekeeper to Clarke and Metcalf. On the 28th of May I was standing at the kitchen window, and observed a woman going down the steps out of the house, with something in her lap—I went up-stairs, and followed her to Turnstile—she found me very close to her, and dropped this book—I took it up, and held her fast till I saw a policeman, and gave her in charge—it was the prisoner—this is the book.





THOMAS CANNON
. I am a policeman. The prisoner was given into my charge with the book.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

Prisoner. I am very sorry for it.




GUILTY

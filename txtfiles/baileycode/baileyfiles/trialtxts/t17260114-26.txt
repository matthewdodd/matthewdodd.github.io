             thus depos'd. I lost the Smock out of a Drawer, where the Prisoner's Brother lodg'd, and carrying her (upon Suspicion) before a Justice, she there confest that she had pawn'd it to Brown in Old-Street



. The Justice order'd me to fetch it from Brown, but she refus'd to let me have it. I then got a Search Warrant, and found it at her House. The Jury 

               acquitted
             Brown, and found Butler 


               guilty to the Value of 10 d.

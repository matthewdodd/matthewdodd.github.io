GEORGE ORTON. I live in Devonshire-street, Queen-square. On the 23rd of April, about eleven o'clock in the morning, I was in Lower Thames-street


, and near Botolph-lane I passed two or three persons; I had a pocket-ledger in my inside pocket, and a rule - I felt my pocket-book lifted up; my handkerchief was in my outside pocket - I turned round, and collared the prisoner, who was rolling my handkerchief up; I collared and took him into a fish-monger's-shop - I told him he had got my handkerchief; he said he had not, but I held him so that he could not drop it, and found it on him - I have made inquiry, and believe it is his first offence.
The prisoner pleaded poverty.

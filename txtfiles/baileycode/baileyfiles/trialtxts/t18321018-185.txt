            . I am shopman to William Daniel Owen and another, of Great Coram-street


. On the 9th of October, about six o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came to the shop, with another woman, and bought a short length of silk for a child's spencer - she gave me a piece of gold; I had to go to the cashier, in a different part of the shop, for change - Mr. Williams came back with me, and remarked that her cloak looked very handsome; he took hold of it, and she had this roll of silk under it, which she must have taken in my absence; it had laid on the counter right before her - it measures thirty-three yards and a half, and is on the roller.(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence (written.) It was my misfortune in the last Session to have my husband tried and sentenced to transportation for life - I was left without any means of support, and in this state of distress I was induced to commit the crime, with the hope that I might receive the like sentence of my husband, and if possible be united to him again; I therefore humbly cast myself on the mercy of the Court, and trust that it will grant my request.



               GUILTY
            . Aged 19. - 


               Transported for Seven Years
            .

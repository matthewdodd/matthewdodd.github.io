            . On the 1st of April I searched the prisoner's box, and found in it the articles stated in the indictment - they are worth 3l. or 4l.; the shirts have my name on them, and so have some other things - she said they were all mine, and that she had stolen them; she was my only female servant, and had to go through the shop to get to the safe.

            . I opened the prisoner's box, and found this property - it was full of the prosecutor's things; she said they were all her master's - she had another box, with her wearing-apparel in it.

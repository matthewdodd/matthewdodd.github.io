JOHN NORBURN
. I am assistant to William Satterly Bawdon. On 25th Oct. I missed a quantity of calico from outside the door—this is it (produced)—it is my master's.





JAMES BROOKS
. I am fourteen years old—I saw the prisoners—Mason had the calico, walking towards the Birdcage—I pulled it from under his arm—the others had loft then.

Cross-examined by Mr. Horry. Q. Was not Kelley some distance behind? A. About three yards.
----GLASGON. I saw Kelley and Mason in Birdcage-walk two or three turnings, from Mr. Bawdon's—Mason had a piece of calico under each arm—Mason dropped one piece, Kelley picked it up and gave it him—Jackson was not there then.





EDWARD SMITH
 (policeman, N 193). I was in York-street, Hackney-road,

and saw Mason in a milkman's charge—I took him—he was very violent—Jackson came up, caught hold of me, and tried to rescue him—after a great deal of difficulty, with the assistance of other constables, we took them both.

Jackson. I did not try to rescue him? Witness. You pulled him away, and kicked me several times.

Jackson's Defence. The policeman knew I had been convicted before, and said he would take me, as he knew me, and knew me to be a relation of Mason, but I am not.

JACKSON and KELLY—


NOT GUILTY
.

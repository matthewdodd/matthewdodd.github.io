JOSIAH KITE. I live at Isleworth


; my watch hung over the fire-place on the 13th of November. I am foreman at a mill
. I went out about half-past eight o'clock that morning, into the town, on my master's business; I met Herbert in the town, with the prisoner in custody, seven or eight hundred yards from my house; I heard the prisoner say, "I have thrown the watch over the wall;" I went and found it; here it is - it is mine. I had left my wife at home - I know nothing of the prisoner.

            . I am a carpenter, and live at Isleworth. I was going to do a job on the 13th of November; I saw the prisoner running, and a woman after him, calling"Stop thief! he has stolen a watch:" I collared him, and said he must stop; he said, "No, don't stop me - I have only been begging: the beadle is driving me out of the parish;" he said, "I have got no watch - you may search me;" I said, "I have no power to search you - you must come back to that woman, who was running behind you;" she came up, and said, "This is the man who stole my husband's watch;" he said, "Well, I did steal it, and threw it over the wall;" the prosecutor came up, and found it- I find he bore a good character at a place he left a year ago.

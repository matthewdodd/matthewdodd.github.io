for stealing, on the 
20th of December, 2 shirts, value 6s., the goods of 



Issac White.






ISAAC WHITE
. I am a labourer. I left a bundle of clothes in the care of Mrs. Pullen, at Bayswater, where I had lodged—I left there myself early in December, and went into Kent—I went to Mrs. Pullen's for my bundle a fortnight before Christmas, but did not get it—I knew the prisoner about Bayswater by sight, seeing him at the public-house—in consequence of what Mrs. Pullen informed me, I fell in with the prisoner about the 20th of December, at a public-house—when he first came in he said, "Well, how are you? have you had any luck since you have been home?"—I said, "No"—I then asked him where he took my bundle to—he said, "To the Queen's Head in the Borough"—I found no bundle had been left there—he kept promissing me he would go there about it, and at last brought me the bundle—I opened it, and missed two shirts from it, one of which I found on his back, and the other was completely gone.





THOMAS HARRY
. I am a policeman. I took the prisoner with the shirt on his back—he said he had taken it out of the bundle, and put it on, but he knew nothing of the other.





SARAH PULLEN
. I live at Bayswater. The prosecutor left the bundle of clothes in my care—I received orders from him to send the bundle to the Queen's Head, Borough—I asked the prisoner to take it there, and said I would pay him—I knew him by seeing him about the public-house—the prosecutor afterwards applied to me for his bundle—among other property, it contained there shirts—I told the prisoner the prosecutor would pay him for taking it when he came to town—he never came near me after I gave him the bundle—my husband drives a fly.





ISAAC WHITE

re-examined. He never asked me for payment for the job.




GUILTY

Transported for Seven Years.

EDWIN PARKES
. I live in Essex-street, Strand, and am in a merchant's counting-house. On the evening of the 14th of April, I was in Fleet-street, between six and seven o'clock, and felt something at my pocket—I turned round, and caught the prisoner, with my handkerchief in his hand, putting it into his pocket—I accused him of it—he denied it, and threw the handkerchief down—a person who was passing took it up, and gave it to me—this is it.

Prisoner. I did not have it on me at all—two young men who were walking by my side took it, and threw it down—I merely touched the gentleman on the shoulder, and he caught hold of me. Witness. I was not. touched on the shoulder—I felt him pull at my pocket—there was another with him, much taller than him, who ran away.





THOMAS LIGHTFOOT
. I am street-keeper of St. Dunstan's. I took charge of the prisoner, and received the handkerchief from the prosecutor—I found nothing on him. (Frederick Johns, bootmaker, Little George-street, Hampstead-road, gave the prisoner a good character.)

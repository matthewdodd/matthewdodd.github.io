RICHARD TREVET. I am a bedstead-maker
, and live in Sack-court, Wilson-street, Finsbury-square


. The prisoner was my porter
, and entrusted to receive money for me. I sent him to Mr. Rolls's, in Old-street-road, with a bedstead, which came to 7l. I gave him the bill and receipt. He absconded, and never accounted to me for it.
ELIZA ROLLS. I am the wife of William Rolls, who is a broker, and lives in Old-street. On the 21st of September, between two and three o'clock, the prisoner brought the bedstead. I owned his master 7l., with the bedstead. The prisoner presented a receipt for 7l., and said his master wished it settled. I gave him six 1l., bank notes, and told him the other pound belonged to the next week's account. I produce the receipt.
BARNARD GLEED. I apprehended the prisoner on the 22d of September, at the Bell public-house, Shoreditch. I found him asleep in the tap-room. I found a 1l. note in his fob, 14s. in his pocket, and 5s. 9d. in copper.

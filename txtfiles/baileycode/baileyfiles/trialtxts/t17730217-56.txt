                   Cummings
               



            . About two years ago I was butler
 to Mr. Dickenson, the brewer; I was then robbed of 40 l. 8 s. 6 d. and my watch.
Q. What watch?
Cummings. A pinchbeck watch; it was at one Mr. Sanderson's; he kept a public house; he is now dead; the prisoner came to Mr. Dickenson's house, knocked at the door, and asked if the maids wanted any muslins; I went to enquire; they said they did not want any. When I came back she told me she wanted to speak particularly with me, she had something of consequence to say to me.
Q. Did you know her?
Cummings. I never saw her before. I desired her to go to the tap house and I would come to her presently; I went; she said she could not tell me what she had to say unless I could lay down a sum of money, as much as I could get, and count it before her; I went into the compting house and borrowed a sum of money.
Q. What did you expect from this, to let a person you never saw in your life have your money?
Cummings. I did not mean to let her have it: I went and borrowed ten guineas, and then I borrowed twenty more; she then said she could not tell me there, that the house was not convenient; we went to another; she said that would not do; then we went to another which was 
               
                  John
                   Sanderson
               



            's, and I took the money with me; we went into a back room of his, and there I counted the money I had made up, 40 l. 8 s. 6 d. she bid me put it in a handkerchief; I did so, and she tied it up in three or four knots as I thought, and desired me to tie up a knot or two besides.
Q. from the Jury. Was it her handkerchief?
Cummings. No, it was mine.
Q. from the Jury. You tied some knots too did you?
Cummings. Yes.
Q. How many?
Cummings. One or two, I am not positive, and she gave me the money as I thought, and bid me take it home and put it in my box, and desired me to swear solemnly I would not look at it till next morning.
Q. Are you sure it was your own handkerchief you took?
Cummings. Yes.
Q. Who put the money in the handkerchief?
Cummings. To the best of my knowledge I put it in.

Q. How long was you to secret and not open it?
Cummings. Till next morning; when I came to look at it in the morning, I found nothing but bad halfpence.
Q. But what profit was you to have from this?
Cummings. She took such solemn oaths, and I was foolish enough to believe her, that there was a quantity of plate lodged for some years in the cellar.
Q. In what cellar?
Cummings. The cellar where I live.
Q. You was to have that plate?
Cummings. Yes. I was to make it appear I had so much money; that I was worth so much, or else she could not tell me any thing of the matter.
Court. You never was served so before?
Cummings. I did not think a man could be imposed on so.
Q. She did not tell you she put the plate there?
Cummings. No.
Q. This was all from her superior knowledge, she passed for a conjurer I suppose?
Cummings. Yes, my Lord.
Q. What did you do when you found your mistake?
Cummings. I made myself content, for I thought it was all in vain to look after her.
Q. What do you say about the watch?
Cummings. I took it out to see what was o'clock; she said it was a pretty watch; I gave it her to look at; I forgot to ask for it again; I never saw it again.
Q. Did she ask to see it?
Cummings. Yes.
Q. Did not she give it you again?
Cummings. No; I never saw it again.
Q. When did you miss it?
Cummings. As soon as I got home; I went directly home from Sanderson's.
Q. How far did you live from Sanderson's?
Cummings. About 100 yards.
Q. Did you stop any where in your way?
Cummings. No.
Q. Did you speak to any body in the street?
Cummings. I went straight home.
Q. Whose plate was this to be; did you think it was to rise out of the earth, or come from the heavens?
Cummings. She said it had been lodged there some years.
Q. You are sure you did not lose your watch going home?
Cummings. I am sure of it.
Q. How came you to meet with the woman now?
Cummings. At present I keep a public house in the Minories, which Mr. Dickenson put me in; she came one morning for a pennyworth of purl and some bread and cheese; I thought at first look that she was the woman that robbed me; at the second look I was positive she was the woman; I then sent for a constable and sent her to the Compter.
Q. When was this?
Cummings. About three weeks ago.
Q. Are you sure she had this money of your's?
Cummings. Yes, I am very sure of it.
Q. Who held the handkerchief while the money was put in it?
Cummings. She held it.
Q. Was it put in your handkerchief, and then in a handkerchief of her own?
Cummings. She had one of her own, I do not know what she did with it.
Q. It took you up a good while looking for your plate I suppose?
Cummings. I thought it was in vain to look when I found I was taken in so.
Q. from the Jury. When you took her did she say any thing?
Cummings. She said she did not know any thing of me, and made a noise and wanted to get out; I bid her sit easy, I would not hurt her; two or three persons in the tap room came to assist me.
Cross Examination.
Q. I suppose you was to have all the plate in the cellar.
Cummings. I was to look for the plate and to have it I suppose if there was any: I was simple enough then to believe it; it was the first time and I imagine it will be the last.

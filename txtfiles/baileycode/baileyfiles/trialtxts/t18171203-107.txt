            . I am a whitesmith
, and live in St. Martin's-lane. I rent a shop by Vauxhall-bridge


. On the 26th of October the lead was taken from the roof - I saw it in Mr. Bailey's house.

                  BAILEY
               



            . I keep the Roebuck, at Millbank. On the 26th of October, the watchman brought the prisoner, Thompson, to my house - He made his escape. I saw the lead folded up, and laid across the parapet wall of the building-it was moved into my house for security.
CALEB LUDFORD. I am a watchman. On the 26th of October I was going into a garden to feed a horse, and saw three boys standing by the shop, about a quarter before six o'clock at night; as I returned I saw them again. I went into the garden, and told the people to watch them; while I was talking, I heard the tiles rattle - I ran out, and caught the prisoner, Thompson, coming out of the shop without his hat - I took him to Bailey's. I am sure he is the man, I knew him before. Lecase got away - I am sure he is one of them - He spoke to me as I passed the first time.
JOSEPH COOPER. Mr Bailey and I carried the lead into Mr. Bailey's house-next morning I took Lecase - He denied being there. I found the lead in the gutter, rolled up ready to be taken away.

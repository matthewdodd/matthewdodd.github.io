WILLIAM HARRIS
. I am in the service of George Albert Chapman, linen-draper, Great Russell-street. On the 27th of April, about twenty minutes past eight o'clock in the evening, I observed the prisoner going out of the shop with a piece of print under her arm—she had not purchased any thing—I followed her, and took the print from under her arm, just outside the door—she made no excuse, but afterwards said she picked it up outside the door.





HENRY SIGSTON
. I am a policeman. I took her in charge.

Prisoner. I am very sorry, but I was in liquor.




GUILTY
.* Aged 44.—


Transported for Seven Years.

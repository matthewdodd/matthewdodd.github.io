            . The 16th of March I was at Guildhall


 to make an end of a little quarrel I had with a woman; the prisoner came and stood by me; I found the button of my coat unlosed; I put my hand in my pocket and missed my handkerchief; I charged a constable with him, who stood by, and saw him put the handkerchief in his breeches.
- Thomas, the constable, confirmed the evidence of the former witness.
Prisoner's Defence.
I saw the handkerchief lie on the floor, the gentleman was gone; I took it up and had it in my hand.
For the Prisoner.

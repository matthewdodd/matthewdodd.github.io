WILLIAM BELLMAN
 was indicted

 for embezzlement.






WILLIAM LEUCHARS
. I am a dressing-case maker, and live at No. 28, Piccadilly. The prisoner was in my employ as porter—I gave him a cheque on the 12th of August, for 28l. 17s., directed to Rogers, Holding and Co., 29, Clement's-lane, Lombard-street—I told him to get me a £20 note and the rest in gold—I sent him about eleven o'clock in the morning—I did not see him again for a week after—when he was taken I asked him what he had done with it—he said he did not know, he had spent some and lost some, and it was all gone—that he knew that he had done it and he must suffer for it.





RICHARD FULLER
. I am cashier at the banking house—I paid the money for the cheque in gold, about twelve o'clock on the 12th of August—I cannot say to whom.





JAMES SELWIN
 (police-constable F 11). I took the prisoner on the 19th of August, at the Hole-in-the-Wall, public house—I asked him if he had been in the service of Mr. Leuchars—he said, "Yes, he knew what it was for, he must suffer for it"—I found on him a duplicate for a watch which he said he had bought with the money, but was obliged to pawn it.




GUILTY
. Aged 23.—


Transported for Seven Years.

Fifth Jury, before Mr. Serjeant Arabin.

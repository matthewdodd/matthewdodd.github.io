             depos'd to this Effect. There was no other Person in my Room but the Prisoner. - When I came up Stairs I took my Money out of my Pocket, put it into a Box, and went to Bed: The Prisoner came into my Room; I asked her what she did there The Prisoner went out, and I immediately got up, and missed my Money: I am sure I did not go to sleep first, nor did any body else come into my Room.

             depos'd, That the Morning before the Prisoner was taken, he met her, and said, Susan, What do you do this Way? Don't you know that the Watch and Constables are after you? To which she reply'd, She had only some Money that she had taken out of a Box without a Lock.
The Prisoner thus made her Defence. The Prosecutor is Hostler
 at the White Horse Inn at Cripplegate, he came several Times to my Habitation, and desired me to go with him. - I must own I have been guilty of Folly in going into Gentlemens Company, and the Prosecutor has fetch'd me three Times of a Night, and whatever I got he had Part of it. Nay, I never got Half a Crown of a Gentleman, but he had a Shilling of it; and that very Night he charges me with this Fact, he told me I should lie with him, lock'd the Door, and put out the Candle. The Jury found her 


               guilty to the value of 4 s. 10 d.

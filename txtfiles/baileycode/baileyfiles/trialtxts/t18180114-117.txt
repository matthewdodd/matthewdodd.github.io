            . I am an officer. On the 6th of January, about five o'clock in the evening, I was at Norton Falgate, Middlesex, and saw Bailey's cart going by loaded with butter-tubs; the prisoner, and several others, passed by the tail of the cart from the pavement to the road-the prisoner turned back, and took the tub out of the cart, and put it on his shoulder, and ran down White Lion-street - the other men followed him; I pursued, calling out, Stop thief! he threw the tub off his shoulder - I secured him. I am sure he is the man.
BENJAMIN BEVES. I am a headborough. I heard the alarm, and stopped the prisoner. No other person was running. (Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I ran after the man, and they took me.

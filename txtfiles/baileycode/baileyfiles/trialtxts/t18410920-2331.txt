HENRY DAVIS
. I am in the employ of Mr. John Cooper and others, warehousemen, in St. Paul's Church-yard. On the afternoon of the 26th of August I was in the warehouse, and noticed the prisoner Rogers come into the warehouse, and go out with a roll of cloth on his shoulder—I spoke to him, and he said he was going to take it to some cloth warehouse, I think he said Tucker's, but I am not sure—I let him go, as cloth goods are in the habit of going out in that way, to have work done on them—this is the cloth now produced—it belongs to my employers—I know it by its being a particular cloth, with grey list to it.





CHARLES JAMES HOGG
. I am a buyer in the cloth department at the prosecutors'. I noticed some one come out of the warehouse with the cloth on his shoulder—in consequence of inquiries I made, I ran out, and found Bailey with it, in Gutter-lane, within two minutes and a half after the cloth had gone off the premises—he must have been very near the premises at the time the cloth was taken—I brought it back—he did not run away—I had seen the cloth on the premises two hours before.





JOHN BLISSENDEN
 (City police-constable, No. 331.) I was passing the prosecutors', and took Bailey into custody—they had then brought him back to the door—he said nothing.





WILLIAM HORSNELL
. I am a policeman. T apprehended Rogers in Shoreditch on the 2nd of this month—I know both the prisoners—they are acquainted with each other—I had seen them together before the 2nd of September.

BAILEY—


GUILTY
. Aged 29.—



Confined Six Months.

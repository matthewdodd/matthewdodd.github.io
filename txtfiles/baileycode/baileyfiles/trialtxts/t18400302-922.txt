JOHN WILES
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
5th of March, one handkerchief, value 2s., the goods of 



Abraham Wilde Robarts, from his person.






ABRAHAM WILDE ROBARTS
, Esq. I was passing through the Strand about half-past eleven o'clock yesterday morning—I had occasion to use my handkerchief, and I then put it into my great-coat pocket—almost immediately

after the prisoner brushed by me very sharply—I put my hand to my pocket and missed my handkerchief—the prisoner crossed the street and I ran after him, and never lost sight of him—he got some distance from me and I called out "Stop that boy"—a postman who was turning a street stopped him—when I came up the postman had got my handkerchief in his hand—this is it—(looking at it)—it has my mark on it.





THOMAS BAILY
. I am a letter carrier. I heard a cry from Mr. Robarts yesterday morning, and I turned and saw the prisoner running towards me—I stopped him—he begged me to let him go, and partly pulled this handkerchief out of his bosom and tried to throw it down—I took it and kept it till Mr. Robarts came up.




GUILTY
. Aged 16.—


Transported for Ten Years.—Penitentiary.

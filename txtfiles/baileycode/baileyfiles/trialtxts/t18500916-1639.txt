ELIZA ANN WHETMATH
. I am wife of James Charles Whetmath, of 3, North-street, shirt-maker to Mr. Dudley, of Oxford-street—the prisoner was employed by me for four months to work in the house. About 10th Sept. I had occasion to go to a little black box under the table in the room where the prisoner worked, and missed a tablecloth which I had seen six weeks before—I had missed a shirt before—I spoke to the prisoner about them—she said she knew nothing about them—I gave her into custody—this is my tablecloth(produced)—I never gave her authority to pawn it.





THOMAS THOMPSON
. I am in the employ of Tomlinson and Richardson, pawnbrokers, of Upper George-street, Marylebone. I produce this table-cloth, pawned by the prisoner in her own name, on 21st Aug.—I have seen her occasionally at the shop—she said she was authorised by her mother to pawn it—this is the duplicate I gave.





CHARLES ROBERTS
 (policeman, D 107). I took the prisoner—I afterwards searched her house, and found in her boxes fifty-five duplicates, including the one produced, which relates to this tablecloth.





JOHN JACKSON
 (policeman, A 142). I produce a certificate of the prisoner's conviction at Clerkenwell (read—convicted November, 1844, confined three months)—I was present—she is the person.




GUILTY

            . I am an ostler at the Castle Inn, Brentford.
Q. Do you know the prisoner - A. Yes. Somewhere about midsummer, he came into my master's yard with a bridle and saddle; he asked me would I buy them; I told him I did not want to buy them for my own use; if I bought it, I should want to turn a few shillings by it. I asked him where he got it; he told me he drove farmer White's team at Shipston; his master had sold the poney, and told him to sell the bridle and saddle. I bought it of him, and and gave him eight shillings for them.

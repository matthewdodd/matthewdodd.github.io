            , a market-gardener
, of Isleworth


, in gathering currants. I had a sieve about three parts full, and was kneeling down. I saw the prisoner and another young man come into the garden. I had seen him several times before - they generally came a dozen together, and the prisoner at the head of them. Seeing him coming, I took the basket up, and he took it out of my hands with great violence. I went to take it from him - he said he would murder me if I attempted to take it. He took the currants, basket and all, and both went out of the grounds with it.

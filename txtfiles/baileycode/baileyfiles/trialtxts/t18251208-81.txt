            . I am in the employ of Messrs. Thomas Brooks and George Brooks - the executors of their late father are Messrs. John and William Brooks - they have two shops, one in Oxford-street, and one in Duke-street. On the 5th of November I received information and pursued the two prisoners, who were running together; I found two pairs of stockings on Bryan, which have a ticket of my writing on them; I took him back, and Conner was taken soon after by one of our young men.

            . I am an officer. I took the two prisoners into the shop, and received the stockings, which the shopman said he took from Bryan's breast.
BRYAN's Defence. I was going up Oxford-street, and saw the stockings lying on the ground; I took them up. I know nothing of the other prisoner, but he came up and I ran on, for fear he should take them from me.

            . I live in St. Mary le Bone


, the 9th of last month the Prisoner came to my house and call'd for a pennyworth of purl, he drank it, and said he was not very well; this was about half an hour past one o'clock; he ask'd me leave to go down in the kitchen, and get a little sleep: I gave him leave, and went with him. He sat down in a chair, I left him there and went to dinner; about half an hour after this he went out at the back door, my wife informed me of it; immediately I went into the kitchen and miss'd some plates, so I went out at the fore door to look for him, and I saw him going cross the road; I sent a person after him, who brought him back, and after he came into the kitchen he dropt nine plates from under his coat, one knife he drop'd going before the Justice, and one fork we took out of his pocket before Justice Green.

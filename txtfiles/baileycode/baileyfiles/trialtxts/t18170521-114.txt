                  , from his person
            .
ISAAC MOURTON. I am a waiter
 at the York Coffee-house, in Pickett-street. On the 13th of May, abouttwelve o'clock at night. I had just shut up, and was going to order some beer; the prisoner chucked me under the chin, and said," How do you do, my dear?" Just at this moment a man came up and knocked me down. As I was getting up, the prisoner drew my watch from my fob, and gave it to the man - I saw her give it to him; they bothran away. I pursued them towards Wych-street, and secured the prisoner about forty yards off. I never spoke to her, but have been in the habit of seeing her pass the house for the last two years.
JOHN BROWN. I took the prisoner into custody, but found nothing on her.

            . On the 16th of April I was upon Tower-hill


, about ten minutes after eight. I got out of a coach and was going to pay, when Mr. Davison laid hold of the prisoner, and asked me if I had not lost my handkerchief. I felt, and said I had. Immediately my handkerchief was thrown on the pole of the coach between the horses.

            . Mr. Thorpe and I were discharging the coach, but seeing the prisoner take Mr. Thorpe's handkerchief out of his pocket, I spoke to Mr. Thorpe and ran after the prisoner, and said, You rascal, you have taken this gentleman's handkerchief out of his pocket. He took and flung it over my head, and it rested on the pole of the coach. There was another person with him, but he ran away.

I was not near the gentleman at all. I work at the glass-house
. I was sixteen years old the twentieth of last month.

             sworn.
On the 2d of December, the prisoner and another man came into my shop to look at some second hand stockings; the prisoner went out directly, which gave me a suspicion; I overtook him, and took the gown from under his jacket; it was hanging there just before; I am sure it is the gown.

Prisoner. I found the gown a few yards off the prosecutor's door; I was not in the shop.

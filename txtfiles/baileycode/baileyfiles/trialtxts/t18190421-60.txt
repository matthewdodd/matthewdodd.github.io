                  HART
               



            . On the 25th of March, about eleven o'clock, I was in Cheapside


 - there was a little stoppage. As I was making my way through, somebody touched me on the shoulder, and I saw two persons with each a man in custody. Stone had my handkerchief, which I missed.

                  STONE
               



            . I am an officer. On the 25th of March I was with Lewis in Cheapside - a horse was laying in the street, which caused a crowd. I saw the two prisoners and another person following the prosecutor; I let them go by me, and as they were passing I saw Lawrence take the handkerchief from Hart's pocket. I collared him, and took it from him - Lewis took Topley. I am certain they were in company. I saw them talking together.

                  LEWIS
               



            . I was with Stone, and secured Topley.

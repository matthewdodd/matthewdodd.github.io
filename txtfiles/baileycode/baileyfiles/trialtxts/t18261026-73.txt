HILL





            , was indicted for 


               stealing, on the 25th of September
, three 10l., and two 5l. promissory notes
            , the property of 
               
                  William 
                  Reeves
               




            , his master.
WILLIAM REEVES. I am a wine and spirit-dealer
, and live in Warwick-lane. I have been married two months, and found the prisoner in my wife's service - he was porter and cellarman
. On the 25th of September, about twelve o'clock, I gave him three 10l. and two 5l. countrynotes, to get changed, with all possible haste - three were payable at Lubbook's, one at Esdaile's, and the other at Hoare's; he never returned, but was apprehended on the 2d of October. On the 26th of September his uncle brought me 25l.

                  WOOD
               



            . I am clerk to Sir John Lubbock. On the 25th of September I paid for two 10l. Farnham notes, two 10l. Bank notes, Nos. 16,125 and 16,126; and for a 5l. note of the same Bank, No. 18,233, 5l.
MR. REEVES re-examined. Two of the 10l. and one 5l. were Farnham notes.


                  SAMUEL 
                  BENJAMIN
               



            . I keep a clothes-shop in Whitecross-street. About a month ago I changed a 10l. note for a young man, much like the prisoner; he bought a coat, two waistcoats, and two handkerchiefs, for 1l. 14s.; I changed the note at the King's Arms public-house, Whitecross-street. I believe the prisoner is the man.

                  COCK
               



            . I keep the King's Arms, Whitecross-street. On the 25th of September I changed a 10l. note, No. 16,125, for Benjamin (looking at the note); it has his name, in my writing, on it.
MR. REEVES. I received No. 16,126 from the uncle.

            . Aged 18.




               Transported for Seven Years

            . On Tuesday was sevennight the Prisoner came to my shop, under pretence of buying some silk handkerchiefs.
Q. Where is your shop?
Flower. In King's-street, Bloomsbury



. I had but one servant in the shop, and I heard two people there; I was busy writing backwards, and did not go into the shop; afterwards I heard a third person come in, it was in the dusk of the evening, and I thought three persons were too many for my boy to serve, and the Prisoner at the bar, or another woman, had some money in her hand, and paid for a handkerchief. A neighbour came in and cautioned me, that if such a person was not gone, to examine her, for she believed she was a shop-lifter . The handkerchiefs were all in a confusion, but the boy gave me a pretty good account, and I was satisfied; and I did not miss the handkerchiefs till the Friday following, and then I missed a piece. Mrs. Wycherly sent me word, that she had been searching after her goods, and had found her muslin, and that she believed she had seen some handkerchiefs that she had seen at my house. I went to Mrs. Wycherly, and she told me, if I would go with her in the evening, she believed she could find the people that had them; I told her I should take it very kindly. Mrs. Wycherly saw the two women [the Prisoner and 
               
                  Elizabeth 
                  Johnson 
               



             ] accidentally coming by, just about the dusk of the evening; these two women were taken up, and carried before Justice Broadhead .
Q. Did she take them herself?
Flower . She secured them in the shop.
Q. What in your shop, or Mrs. Wycherly's?
Flower. No, in the shop where the goods were found. The minute I saw the Prisoner's face , I was certain to her face, for I was too well acquainted with her, and knew she had been too often with me, and the person who was in my shop positively said she was the person who was in the shop that night.
Q. Did you find your goods again?
Flower. I got part of them at Mrs. Loach's, in Bow-street, Bloomsbury , and part of them in Holborn .
[The handkerchiefs were produced.]
Q. Are these the handkerchiefs that were taken out of your shop?
Flower . Yes; here are seven of them, and there have been six sold.
Q. You are sure the whole thirteen were your handkerchiefs?
Flower. Yes, my Lord.
Pris. Coun. You say there were two women in your shop, you don't know who took them?
Flower. I do not.
Q. If you had met the Prisoner in Cheapside. could you have known her?
Flower. If I had looked at her earnestly I should have known her again.
Court. Are you sure she is the person?
Flower. Yes.
Pris. Coun. Are you sure that these are part of your goods?
Flower. Yes , I am sure of it, because I never sold any but singly .
Q. They are a common sort of handkerchiefs, are there no other of that pattern but what you had?

Flower . There are some; though but few.

Q. Do you believe these to be the handkerchief?

Q. Had you any reason to suspect the Prisoner ?
Esham . No.

Q. Did Mr. Flower come afterwards?
Loach. Yes.
Q. Did he say they were his?
Loach. He did as good as say so, but he was not quite positive; he could scarcely say they were his?
Q. What did he say?
Loach. He said he could not swear they were his, but at last he was positive, and then he took them away.
Q. So you are sure the Prisoner at the bar was one of the women that brought them to your house?
Loach. Yes.

The same day the Prisoner at the bar came to me, and I bought some muslin of her.
Q. What day was it?
Loach. I think it was this day fortnight.

Q. Have you got that here?

Q. When was this?
Wells . I think it was Wednesday was sev'nnight, and I took it to Mrs. Wycherly's.
Q. How came you to take it there?
Wells . Because I sell goods for Mrs. Wycherly.

[The two yards and an half of muslin was produced.]
Q. to Mrs. Wycherly . Can you swear that to be your muslin?
Wycherly. No, my Lord, I cannot positively, because there is no mark upon it; but 'tis very like it; I had a suspicion that it was my muslin that was at the shop in Bow-street, and I sent a young woman to buy some.
Q. You cannot positively say that is your muslin?
Wycherly . No, but I have a great deal of reason to suspect the Prisoner, and the shop where it was found, for I saw 
               
                  Mary 
                  Kelly 
               



             there. I heard that part of my muslin was sold in Bow-street; I went to the shop, and told her, I wanted some goods; she asked me, if I was a country milliner? I said, yes, and I should be here a fortnight, and if she had any goods in that time that would suit me, I would buy them. I shut up my own shop, and made it my business to detect them : I went to the shop, and found Kelly and Johnson in the shop.
Q. Was this the shop in Bow-street?
Wycherly . Yes; I said they were shop-lifters, and kept them in the shop, and I was there for a quarter of an hour, and could not get any body to assist me; but at last I got Kelly and Johnson secured, and carried them before a justice of the peace: there is a piece of muslin that they had, which is in the hands of one Jones a constable; for they would have made it up with me.
[Mr. Jones was called, and produced the muslin.]
Q. to Mrs. Wycherly . Is this your muslin?
Wycherly. No, my Lord.
[This not being owned, it was the property of the Sheriffs, but Mr. Sheriff Davis made a present of it to Mrs. Wycherly.]

             sworn .
Q. What are you?
Barrett. I am a constable; when the constable brought the Prisoner before the justice, I was there with other people, and the Prisoner and the other denied it; and after she was examined before the justice , I took her down into the yard with Mrs. Wycherly, and desired she would acknowledge to Mrs. Wycherly, whether she took the muslin or no, and then she might have favour; and she did by that means own, that she took it out of Mrs. Wycherly's shop, and sold twenty yards to a gentlewoman in Bow-street, Bloomsbury, and seven yards and an half to a gentlewoman in Holborn.

            . I was at Mrs. Wycherly's shop, in order to help her, for she was selling off; I folded up this muslin, and put it into a drawer: yesterday se'nnight Mrs. Wycherly and Mrs. Wells came to our house.
Q. Which is your house?
Rishton. I live at a Linen-draper's in Duke's-Court, and Mrs. Wycherly and Mrs. Wells asked me, whether I knew the muslin? and I said it looked very much like hers, for it run a very great breadth; it run a nail above yard and half wide, and I asked Mrs. Well, whether she saw the fag end? she said, no: I said there was a mark upon it, and two stripes at the end.

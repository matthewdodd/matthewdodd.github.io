Mary Mansfield.






MART MANSFIELD
. I am a widow, and keep a shop in Bosher's-court, Tottenham-court-road. On the 4th of February I saw some persons at my door—I went out, and missed these boots—I found the prisoner about twenty yards off with them in his possession—I caught hold of him, and said, "I hate caught you now"—he begged me to let him go, and said he was a very poor man, and he seemed to be so—these ore my boots—they had been on the step of the door, but I had not put them out—some persons had been stopping at the door, but I do not know that he was one.





THOMAS MANSFIELD
. I am a relation of the prosecutrix. I went out, and saw the prisoner with the boots in his hand—I took him—when he had got about twenty yards round the corner.

Prisoner. I was coming past, and took up the shoes to look at—the prosecutrix came and dragged me in, said she had lost several pairs, and I was the thief—I was not two yards from the door—I was tried here in November, and had two months for stealing some bread—I would rather be transported—I can get nothing to do any where.




GUILTY
.* Aged 40.—


Transported for Seven Years.

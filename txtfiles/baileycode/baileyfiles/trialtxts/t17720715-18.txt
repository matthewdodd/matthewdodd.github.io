            . I keep a public house
; the prisoner was my servant
 for about two months; she went away on the 6th of June; I missed six shillings worth and a penny in halfpence, out of my till in the bar. I had put a guinea's worth of half pence into the till, at eleven o'clock over night; I found the drawer locked in the morning; as soon as I opened it I missed the money; I immediately charged the prisoner with having taken it; I told her if she would return the money she might go about her business; she denied it, and was angry at my suspecting her; then I threatened to send for a constable, and did send for one; we opened the drawer where she kept her things, and there we found 121 halfpence, tied up in her own handkerchief; the constable found a key upon the prisoner's bunch, which opened the look of the till in the bar; then she confessed she took the halfpence that morning, but said she did not take them for want.

            , the constable, confirmed the evidence given by the last witness.
The prisoner called three witnesses who gave her a good character.

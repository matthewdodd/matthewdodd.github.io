GEORGE DENT
. I am a carman and work for my father. Aboat half-past two o'clock, on the 2nd October, I was in the Poultry, and saw the prisoner try several gentlemen's pockets—I watched him, and saw him come near the prosecutor, and take a white handkerchief out of his pocket—I told the prosecutor, who went after him down Charlotte-row—I saw the handkerchief found in his side-pocket—he denied that he had got it.





JAMES THOMAS
. This is my handkerchief—Dent informed me that my pocket had been picked—I followed the prisoner, and in Bucklenbury taxed him with taking my handkerchief—he said he had not—I saw it taken from his side-pocket.





EBENEZER KIBBLEWHITE

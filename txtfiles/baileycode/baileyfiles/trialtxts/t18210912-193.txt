GEORGE BUCKLEY. I am steward of an East Indiaman
. On the 15th of August at half-past two o'clock in the morning, I was in Whitechapel


, going home to Kennigton-lane - I had been drinking, but knew what I was about, and met the prisoner. I am sure she is the woman; we chatted together for three minutes, she asked me to give her something to drink, I gave her 6 d., my brother, mother, and sister, were about four yards a-head, agreeing for a hackney coach, she kept me in conversation three minutes, I then left her, she was close to me, when I gave her the money, a man said feel if you have got your watch, I felt and missed it; it was safe just before - we went after her with the watchman, who overtook her - she swore she had not got it, he overhawled her, and found it in her bosom.

            . I am a watchman. Buckley came to me; I overtook the prisoner and asked if she had got the watch, she said she had not. I found it in her bosom.

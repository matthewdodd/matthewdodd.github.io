            . I am a brewer's servant
; I have a house in Grub-street


; my wife and I went out on Thursday the 13th instant, about one o'clock, and returned about six in the evening; before I went out I saw all the things mentioned in the indictment in a box in the kitchen; when we returned I found the box open, and missed all the things mentioned in the indictment. The prisoner lodged in my house; I suspected her; I went up stairs and asked leave to search her apartments; she consented; upon searching I found a key that opened my door; in a warming pan in her room, I found my money; I expostulated with her upon this, and then sue confessed she took the money and the otherthings, and she informed us where we might find them.

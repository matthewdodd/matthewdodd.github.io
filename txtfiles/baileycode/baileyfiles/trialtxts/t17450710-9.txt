            . I am servant to Mrs. Matthews, the Prisoner came to work a little after six in the morning. I saw her take the bone and put it into her petticoat, and when she had got as much as she could well carry, she was going away, I stopped her and took it from her. She desired me not to tell my mistress, but to carry it up stairs and put it among some pieces of bone. I told her I would tell my mistress, and she might do what she pleased with her; and I called Mrs. May down.

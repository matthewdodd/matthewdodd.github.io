JOSEPH HARRIS
 was indicted

 for stealing 1 handkerchief, value 1s, the goods of 



Samuel Howe, from his person; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






SAMUEL HOWE.
 I live in Davies-street, Berkeley-square. On 29th March, about a quarter before two o'clock, I was on Blackfriars-bridge—I felt something, I turned round and missed my handkerchief—I saw the prisoner, and took it out of his hand—it was my handkerchief.

Prisoner. Q. Was I the only person behind you? A. Certainly not, there was a crowd—I saw no engineer.

Prisoner. I am innocent; I am not in the habit of doing such things.





ALEXANDEP HODSON
 (police-constable M221.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction—(read—Convicted 19 August, 1844; and confined three months)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY.* * Aged 21.—


Transported for Seven Years.

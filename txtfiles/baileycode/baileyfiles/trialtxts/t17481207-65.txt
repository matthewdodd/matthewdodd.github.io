             stole from on board a ship, my chest, and in it a long cloth coat, one pair of cloth breeches, six handkerchiefs, made of silk and cotton, one cotton one, and 17 s. in money, this was about five weeks ago.
Q. How do you know he took the chest away?
Quinn. Robinson himself said so, it was from on board the Prince of Orange



.
Q. Have you found any of your things again?
Quinn. I have found my coat, breeches and all the seven handkerchief, and eleven shillings in money; I found them the same night they were taken away, at 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Stevenson 
               



            's house, St. John's Wapping; I went ashore to get a pint of beer, and Robinson the black was on board when I returned, my chest and all in it was gone, the malatto that brought the black on shore bid me go to Stevenson's house, and he came with me to the house; Stevenson denied the black when we asked for him; I went to the next house, and about half an hour after I got into Stevenson's house, I found my chest put into a chimney broke open, and Robinson was got up another chimney, he desired me to look in a closet, and I found there my coat, breeches and all my money but six shillings.

             had 17 shillings in my chest, we found it in Stevenson's house; I went along with Quinn, and was the re when the things were found: Stephenson opened the door three or four times when we asked for Robinson, and put all the lights out; when we got in, we found Robinson up the chimney; Stevenson gave me the key of the chest, the closet was lock'd, and he would not give me the key a long time, but at last he opened it.

            , sergeant. I belong to the same company Stevenson does; he has always behaved well in the military way, and I always esteemed him an honest man.

            . I know Stevenson, and can say no other than what my sergeant has said; I never knew any misdemeanor committed by him; he always appeared clean under arms, that is all, my Lord.

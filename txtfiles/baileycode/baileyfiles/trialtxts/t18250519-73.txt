            . I am a labourer. On the 5th of April I was coming from Smithfield into Duke-street, and saw two boys at Jones's shop window, one of them laughed and turned to the shop, holding his apron up, as if to receive something - I turned my head and saw the prisoner come out of the shop with this Dutch cheese in his hand - I stopped him with it, and gave it to Jones's mother.
Prisoner's Defence. He caught hold of me and said a cheese was gone. I said I did not take it.

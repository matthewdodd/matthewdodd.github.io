               did steal one brass stove, six chairs, one leaden bird, four spades, two tin watering-pots
            , the goods of

Edward Carter. On Sunday morning the 6th of this instant, I was informed my house had been broke open; I missed the things mentioned. On, Tuesday morning I went amongst the brokers. I saw my stove standing at a door in Peter-street. I enquir'd how they came by it, I was told they bought it. I told them it was mine, and desired if the persons that brought it should come again, to stop them. I went to another place, and was sent for back; they had stop'd the two persons who came again, they were two women; we have them here to give evidence. I examined them how they came by them; they said their husbands gave them to them to sell, I had found a watering pot of mine at the other place, and ordered the people there to stop the person that brought it, if they came again; than I had word brought me, the person was stopt who brought that. I found all the goods, at different places.
Court. We cannot examine women against their husbands.
Prisoners. Please you, my Lord, the women do not belong to us.

            . I bought the stove of 
               
                  Mary 
                  Gobart 
               



             and 
               
                  Ann 
                  Prehue 
               



            , I know nothing of the prisoners.

                  Ann 
                  Prehue 
               



             came to me, and desired I'd help her carry these things to sell; I thought they were her own.


                  Ann 
                  Prehue 
               



            . I was ordered to sell the stove by 
               
                  Isaac 
                  Dubuck 
               



            , he told me he bought it, so I sold it to Mrs. Rial.


                  Isaac 
                  Dubuck 
               



            . The two Prisoners and I were all together when we got these things, we pull'd down the stove amongst us; it was in the night, I can't tell the exact time, they were gone to my habitation with six chairs, when I pulled the stove down. I met them as I was carrying the stove away. There was a leaden bird; I saw it melted, one of the prisoners carried two spades, the other a spade and watering-pot, and I carried a spade and one watering-pot. I sent the woman that lived along with me (
               
                  Ann 
                  Prehue 
               



            ) to sell them, and 
               
                  Mary 
                  Gobart 
               



             went along with her, to make the thing look the better: the money that was brought back was put into a drinking-glass, and we took it out, each of us, as we wanted it: we lost some of it at skittles. The prisoners have beat me while in goal with a broomstick, and made me swear upon a common-prayer book, that I would clear them.
Harwood's defence. That witness knows, if he will speak the truth, I was at home and a-bed at that time these things were taken.

Carrol's Defence.
I was at that evidence's house at the same time along with Harwood; and the evidence went out and brought these things in; how he came by them I do not know.
Both

            . The prisoner had lived servant
 with me about six months, and was discharged the 1st of August last. On the 6th of November, in the morning, my servants told me there were five silver spoons missing, and they had a suspicion of the prisoner, who had been backwards and forwards in the house for some days to see the servants. She happened at that time to be in the kitchen. I ordered her and all the servants up, and made a very strict examination, and at last the prisoner told me she had taken and pawned them in Wych-street with one Mr. Fryer. I went to Sir John Fielding, and he sent for Mr. Fryer to bring the spoons there he had pledged with him in her name. He came and brought them (produced in court) These are my property, here are the initial letters of my name on them. The prisoner is a young girl, but I fear she is got among bad people.
Mr. Fryer. I am a pawnbroker. I have known the prisoner only since October last; she brought these spoons to me at different times, in the name of 
               
                  Mary 
                  Smith 
               



             in the Strand. The first she brought was on the 5th of October; I lent her 8 s. upon it; the next she brought on the 12th, the next the 16th, the next the 22d, the next the 24th, on which I lent her 7 s. for each.
The prisoner said nothing in her defence.

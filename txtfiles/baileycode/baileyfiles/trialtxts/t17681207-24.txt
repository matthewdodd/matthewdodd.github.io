Mr. Smith. I work for Messrs. Williams and Bellamy, linen-drapers, in the Poultry


; I was there when the prisoner came into the shop, on the 2d of November, between two and three o'clock. I saw her take a piece of printed cotton, put it under her cloak, and carry it out of the shop; I went out, brought her back, and took it from her, it being their property.
Prisoner's Defence.
A woman desired me to hold it, while she went into the shop. I did not go into the shop.

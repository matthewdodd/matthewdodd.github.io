SAMUEL BAKER. I lodge at No.1, Tennis-court, Middle-row, Holborn


; I am a tailor
 - the prisoner lodged in the same room. On the 20th of August he left the room at half-past five o'clock in the morning; I got up at half-past eight, and missed a ring, a waistcoat, a knife, a half-crown, and some halfpence - the prisoner was brought home the next night: he gave me the ring off his finger and the knife - he said they were my property; but the waistcoat he could not account for, as he had made away with it.

            . I met the prisoner in Gray's Inn-lane, and took him back to the prosecutor's; he gave up the ring and knife, and wanted to give up two duplicates of clothes of Mr. Haydon's, his master, to make it up with him.

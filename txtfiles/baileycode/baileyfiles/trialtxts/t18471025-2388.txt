WILLIAMS pleaded 


GUILTY. Aged 26.—



Confined One Months.






ELIZABETH ROBERTS.
 I am single, and live at 60, Stanhope-street Hampstead-road, in the house of Mrs. Ellis—I went into the country and left a box of clothes there—I returned the first week in Aug., found my box nearly empty, and twelve yards of silk was gone—I do not know the prisoners—they were not at the house when I left—the silk produced is mine.





HARRIET ANN ELLIS.
 I am the wife of John Ellis, of 60, Stanhope-street—Roberts lived at my house—Williams was there as housemaid—Oakshot said she was her mother, and used to come backwards and forwards to her two and three times a day—I found Robert's box broken open and the things gone.





JAMES MARLOW.
 I live with Mr. Castle, a pawnbroker, of Camden Town. I produce the piece of silk which has been identified by Miss Roberts—it was pledged by Oakshot on the 2nd July.

Oakshot's Defence. I pledged it not knowing it was stolen.





ELIZABETH ROBERTS

re-examined. It is new silk.

OAKSHOT—


GUILTY. Aged 55.—


Transported for Seven Years.

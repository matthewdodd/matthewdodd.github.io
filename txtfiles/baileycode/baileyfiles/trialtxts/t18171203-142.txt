THOMAS THOMPSON. I am a constable. On the 14th of November, about six o'clock in the evening, I was in Long-acre


-two gentlemen were coming from Queen-street, and a boy behind them, whom I suspected. He beckoned to the prisoner - They had some conversation together for a minute - They ran after the two gentlemen, whom I did not know. The boy (who has escaped) drew the handkerchief from the gentleman's pocket, and gave it to the prisoner, who was covering him. He crossed over to the other, and turned towards Covent-garden. I watched to see if they would come back together, which they did, and went towards Drury-lane. I could not go after the gentleman - They laughed together. I saw the prisoner shove something down his coat sleeve; I laid hold of both of them, the other made his escape. I held the prisoner - I was not able to call the gentleman. I took the handkerchief out of the prisoner's coat sleeve.

            . I am a patrol. I saw the prisoner, and a boy, run down Long-acre. Thompson called me. One got away - I pursued, but lost him.
Prisoner's Defence. It is a troublesome business-let the Jury settle it among themselves.

            . I am a druggist
, and live in St. Paul's-church-yard. On the 6th of November, about half-past four o'clock in the afternoon, I was at the corner of Sweeting's-alley


, looking at a picture shop, and felt my handkerchief go from my pocket - I turned round, and saw the prisoner going in a direction from me; I followed and collared him; he pulled my handkerchief out of his fob. I gave him in charge. I observed nobody with him.

             sworn.
I am servant to Lord Rivers; on the 6th of March last, about eight o'clock in the morning, I was returning from below stairs, I saw the prisoner Mitchell come out of the steward's room with the four teaspoons in his hand open; I observed the bowls of the spoons in his hand as he went up the area steps; I pursued him about forty yards; the other prisoner was waiting for him; he seemed to want to shift them from his hand to the other prisoner; the other prisoner was not in the house; Mitchell was not a quarter of a minute out of sight; he was taken, and the spoons found just under his feet.
- RYMER sworn.
The gentleman's servant cried stop thief! I saw the man in the blue coat; I ran past him; I stood two seconds; the footman came; he said, what have I done? says I, if you have done no harm, you have no occasion to be afraid; we went back, the four spoons were hid just where he was standing.

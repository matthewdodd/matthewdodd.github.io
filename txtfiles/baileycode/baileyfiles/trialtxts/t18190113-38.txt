            . I am clerk to Messrs. Holah and Co. - the firm is rightly set out in the indictment - they are wholesale tea-dealers




, and live in Nicholas-lane. On the 5th of January I delivered a truss of tea to the carter, directed to Mr. Thompson, of Walsal, to take to the Axe Inn, Aldermanbury


.

            . I am a warehouseman, and live in Lad-lane. On the 5th of January, about one o'clock, I was in Aldermanbury, and saw the prisoner drag a truss of tea from a cart, which stood at the Axe Inn, fully loaded - he passed me, and went up Three Nun-court - I suspected him from his manner. I saw the carter come up the Axe gateway, and told him. I took care of the cart while he ran in pursuit. He returned in about ten minutes, and said he had taken the man with the tea, and had given him in charge.

            . I am the carman. I was at the Axe Inn, with the tea in the cart. I went up the yard to see if there was room to drive up, and returned in two minutes. Redmead came, and said a man had taken the truss. I pursued, and overtook him in Basinghall-street, about twenty yards beyond Coopers' Hall, with the truss on his shoulder. I asked him where he got it from? he said a man gave it him to carry. I took him into the Justice-room in Guildhall-yard.

            . The Prisoner is a Ticket-Porter


; I have known him two or three Years; on the 12th of last Month I met him going up Fresh Wharf Gateway


 , with a Piece of Fustic on his Shoulder; I asked him, what he had got there? he said, a piece of Wood for the Fire; this is the Piece of Fustic; said I, you know better what to do with this than to burn it, you have been backward and forward here all this Evening, and I believe you did not come honestly by it: I went with him into a Victualling-House, and sent for Mr Fuller, and asked him if he missed any; he said, there were ten hundred and odd Weight of it, and that there were several Pieces missing: - It is for the Use of Dyers. - There were three or four Parcels of it, so I cannot tell whose Property it is. - He owned he took itt off Fresh-Wharf.
Prisoner. It was a Thing I never did before in my Life; I was very much in Liquor. 


               Guilty 10 d.

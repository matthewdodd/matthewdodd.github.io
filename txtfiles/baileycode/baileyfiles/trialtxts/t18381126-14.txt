 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
8th of November, 1 shift, value 5s.; 3 yards of linen cloth, value 6s.; and 1 unmade shirt, value 8s.; the goods of 



Emma Andrews, from her person.






EMMA ANDREWS
. I am single, and live in Carlisle-place, Marsh-gate, Lambeth. At half-past eight o'clock, on the evening of the 8th of November, I was in Bridge-street, Blackfriars, and had a parcel on my arm containing the articles stated, and the prisoner took it over my left shoulder—I am sure he is the man—I followed and did not lose sight of him—he was stopped in my presence, with my parcel on him.

Prisoner. She was a quarter of an hour, or twenty minutes after I was taken, before she came up.





THOMAS MEDHURST
. I am a watchman of Farringdon Within. About half-past eight o'clock that evening, I heard a cry, and saw the prisoner in custody of a gentleman, with this property—the lady was close to him, and said, "That is the man that took it"—I took the parcel, and the prisoner—he tried very much to get away from the person who had got him.


Prisoner. I know nothing of it—I did not have the parcel at all.




GUILTY
.* Aged 31.—


Transported for Ten Years.

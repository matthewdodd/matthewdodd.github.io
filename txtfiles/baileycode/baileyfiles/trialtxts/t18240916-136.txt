            . On the 28th of August, I was walking up Holborn


, and on turning up Fetter-lane


, I felt a hand in my pocket; I turned round and saw Duncan with my handkerchief in his hand; he gave it to Budd, who put it under his arm pit. I seized Duncan, he said he had not got it; I seized Budd, and told him to give it up; he said he had not got it, and had never seen the other prisoner. I gave him a twist round, he put up his arms to get from me, and the handkerchief fell from him: I picked it up, and secured them both; a crowd collected, no body would send for a constable, and I conveyed them to the watch-house myself.

            . I was crossing from Leather-lane to Fetter-lane, and saw Duncan take a handkerchief from the prosecutor's pocket and throw it to Budd, who concealed it under his arm pit; the gentleman turned round and collared both; Budd dropped it, and he picked it up.

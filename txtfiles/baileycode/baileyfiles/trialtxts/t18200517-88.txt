            . I live at Hammersmith. I took the scarf - the prisoner, who is my brother, just shewed it to me, and I took it off Mr. Baker's counter. A great many people were in the shop - it was about five o'clock in the afternoon of the 11th of May. My brother was two or three yards from the shop; he pointed it out to me, and asked me to take it. I went in and took it, came out again, found him in the same place, and gave it to him. I do not know where he took it to. Downs lives in King-street - I believe it is not far from the shop. I never had any conversation with her about it. I was taken up on the Saturday after, and told what I knew about it. My parents live at Hammersmith.
Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. What are your parents - A. Nothing. I do not know how they live. I am fourteen years old.
Q. You took the scarf, put it in a basket, and went off with it - A. Yes, and gave it to him.

            . I am a constable of Hammersmith. About four o'clock on Friday afternoon, the 12th of May, I was sent for to Mr. Carter's shop, and took the prisoner, Johnson, into custody, who was charged with stealing a pair of breeches. He said, of his own accord, that if I would go with him to his mother he would tell me wherehe sold them and other things which he had taken. He said he sold the scarf to Mrs. Downs for 6 s. - she keeps a clothes-shop about two hundred yards from Mr. Baker's shop - I took him there about six o'clock that evening, and enquired about a pair of breeches. I afterwards put him in the cage, returned alone to Downs, and asked her if she had not bought a scarf of that boy? she paused, and then said it was sold, and if I would give her her liberty she would go and see after it. I called again, she was not returned. I called between nine and ten o'clock, and observed she had got it laid on the counter.
Cross-examined. Q. Did not the boy shew it to you on the counter when you took him there - A. I do not think he did. The Magistrate blamed me for not taking it away. She said the boy told her he brought it from his mother. I did not take her into custody - she came herself to the office.

DOWNS'S Defence. I believed the prisoner's friends to be in distress, and bought it without knowing it to have been stolen. I gave it up the moment they came for it.

            , who is a clothes salesman
 at Hammersmith





, about three hundred yards from Downs's shop. On Friday, the 12th of May, between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning, the breeches were stolen from the door. About seven that evening I saw them in the possession of Edgson - they are a very small size.

            . I apprehended Johnson between four and five o'clock at an apothecary's shop, and asked him if he had not taken a pair of breeches from Mr. Carter's shop door? he took me to Downs's, I asked if she had not bought a pair of breeches of the prisoner? she said Yes. Johnson's father is a tall man, about six feet high; he is well known about Hammersmith. She produced them immediately, and said he told her he brought them from his mother.

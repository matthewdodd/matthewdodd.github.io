            . I am a Police-constable. On the 24th of March I saw the prisoner and another man in St. Martin's-court - I watched them for three-quarters of an hour; they were dressed very shabby, and were looking into respectable shops; I told the prisoner to go away - he went one way and I went the other; there were two persons going the same way as he was - I saw him go to the prosecutrix's shop, take these shoes, and put them under his arm - I took him with them.

. The officer brought the prisoner and the shoes to my shop about five o'clock - they are mine, and are worth 6s; I had seen them safe about half an hour before.

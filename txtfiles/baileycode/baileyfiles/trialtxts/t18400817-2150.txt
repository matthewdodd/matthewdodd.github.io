MARY GOULD
. I am a widow, and keep the Old Swan public-house, in the parish of St. Luke, Chelsea. On the 10th of August I did not get up till after eight o'clock—I received information, and found the property stated, gone from the bar in the lower part of the ground, where there are two rooms and a bar, in which my daughter serves—it is all enclosed with the house—the bar had been broken open—a half-door, the bottom part of which is wood, had been cut open—a hand could then be put in, and the door unbolted—that is the way they had, got in—the prisoners were employed about the ground, one to put up the skittles, and the other attending to the boats.





JAMES WOOLGAR
. I am a policeman. On the 10th of August, about a quarter after five o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoners within 300 yards of the Old Swan public-house, going as from the house—they each had a bundle—I stopped them, and found the bundles contained the articles stated—I asked what they had there—they said at first dirty clothes, and then said it was two bottles of wine—I took them into custody—I said, "Do you call these dirty clothes?"—they then said they had bought them at a public-house in Jew's-row, and were going to a fight to sell them that day—I took them to the station-house.





SARAH ANN GOULD
. I am the prosecutrix's daughter. I know the bar door was locked the night before.

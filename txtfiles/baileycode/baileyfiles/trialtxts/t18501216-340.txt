JOHN INGRAM
 was indicted

 (with
WILLIAM BUCKLEY, not in custody), for stealing 42 yards of cotton, value 21s.; the good of 



Samuel Hughes and another: having been before convicted.







ROBERT LEWIS
. I am in partnership with Samuel Hughes—this piece of print (produced) is our property—I saw it safe in the lobby of our doorway a quarter of an hour before the prisoner was taken.





WILLIAM MOLSHER
. I am a tailor, of Tothill-street, Westminster. On 3rd Dec, at nine o'clock in the evening, I met the prisoner and another man in Tothill-street, just coming from Mr. Hughes' door—the prisoner had this property under his coat, trying to conceal it, he could not, and attempted to pass it to his companion—I cried, "Stop him!"—he threw it down—I picked it up, and a constable met him and took him—I had not lost sight of him.





WILLIAM MILLERMAN
 (policeman, B 95). On the evening of 3rd Dec, a little before nine o'clock, I saw the prisoner and Buckley in the Broadway, and in Tothill-street, forty or fifty yards from Mr. Hughes's—I heard a cry of "Stop him!" and saw the two run—I saw the prisoner throw something away; I cannot say what it was—I pursued him and caught him; the other got away—I received the print from Molsher.

Prisoner. Q. Did you not take me on suspicion of picking a gentleman's pocket? A. I thought he had picked a pocket, because he had a handkerchief loose in his hand.

Prisoner's Defence. When he found he could not get the handkerchief against me, the gentleman brought up this print.





WILLIAM MILLERMAN

re-examined. I produce a certificate of the prisoner's conviction—(read—Central Criminal Court, Oct. 1849, Joha Ingram convicted of breaking and entering a dwelling-house, confined one year)—I was present—the prisoner is the person—he had been out three weeks.




GUILTY
.† Aged 21.—


Transported for Seven Years.

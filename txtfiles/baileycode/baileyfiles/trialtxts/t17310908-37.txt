             the 15th of July
 last.
It appeared by the Evidence, that the Prosecutor having sent the Gown by a little Boy, the Prisoner cutic'd him to go of an Errand for him, to ask for a Scarlet Cloak and a Lac'd Hat of one Squire Jone's , pretending to hold the Gown till he came again; and the Boy going, there were no such Things left there; and when he returned, the Prisoner was gone with the Gown. That the Prisoner was known by the Boy, he being in St. James's Park, who tax'd him with it, and he was apprehended; but while an Officer was a fetching, he made an Escape, but was apprehended a second Time. The Boy, Ezekiel Everet , was positive he was the Person that took the Gown; and the Fact being fully prov'd, the Jury found him 


               guilty to the value of 39 s.

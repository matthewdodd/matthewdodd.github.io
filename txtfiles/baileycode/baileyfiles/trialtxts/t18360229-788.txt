CHARLES HENRY HODGSON
. I am a merchant's Clerk. I was in Bishopsgate—street, on the 1st of March, about five o'clock—I felt, all on a sudden, that my pocket was considerably lightened—I turned round, and saw the prisoner doubling something in his hand; but I did not see what—I missed my handkerchief—I laid hold of the prisoner, and taxed him with stealing it—he stoutly denied it—I stoutly asserted that he had it—I was he this time sunounded by the prisoner and three others—the prisoner still denied that he had taken my handkerchief, or know any thing about it—one of his companions, who saw I was determined not to let him go, said, "Jack, you had better give the gentleman his handkerchief, you have got it"—the prisoner still did not seem to like to give it up, and one of his companions took it from the prisoner's waistcoat or trowsers, and gave it to me—this is it—I gave him into custody.

JURY. Q. Is it marked? A. I am not aware that it is—I had it given me to about four months back.

COURT. Q. You had a handkerchief of that sort about you? A. Yes, exactly like this.





EDWARD KIRBY DARLINGTON

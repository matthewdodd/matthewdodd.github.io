            . On Wednesday, the 28th of November; a person came to the shop and gave me information. I went to the door and found the prisoners on the step; it was about ten o'clock at night. They went away on seeing me, but came back in about twenty minutes, and a person came in to sell flints and steels. While I was trying to get him away, the prisoner, Schofield, ran on the step of the door, and took three pair of stockings; both were in company - he saw me and dropped them on the pavement. I ran and took him, the other was taken directly.

            . About five minutes before ten o'clock on the 28th of November, I saw the prisoners standing at the prosecutor's door, Schofield went on the step, put his arm through the rails; the other saw me and gave him a nudge, they went away - I informed the prosecutors, and went down in the kitchen to watch them, and saw Mr. Ellis run out, and take Schofield. Newton dropped the stocking on the pavement.

1950. 




HENRY CORNWELL
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
29th of May, 1 pair of trowsers, value 1 1s., the goods of 



Henry Wharton and 



John Wharton; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






JOSEPH HASLETT
. I am in the service of Henry and John Wharton, at Newington. On the 29th of May there was a pair of trowsers inside the shop—when we were closing, at eleven o'clock at night, when three persons came into the shop to buy a flannel jacket, the prisoner was the hindermost of the three—while I put the trowsers down, to get the jacket, the prisoner went off with the trowsers—I pursued him, and saw him near a lamp-post, folding up the trowsers—I followed him, and took him with them.

Prisoner. I did not take them. Witness. I did not see you take them, I saw you with them, and missed them from the shop.





HENRY BIRT
 (police-constable P 176.) I took the prisoner with these trowsers—he said, in going along to the station, that he meant to give it up altogether now he had got into regular work, he could not think how he came to do it.

Prisoner. I never said so, I never opened my mouth.





JOHN PALMER SUMMERS
 (police-constable P 24.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from the Clerk of the Peace for Surrey—(read)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 19.—


Transported for Seven Years.

Before Mr. Recorder.

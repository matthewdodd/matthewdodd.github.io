THOMAS WILLIAMS,


 SARAH ROE
, and 



WILLIAM NORMAN
, were indicted for

 stealing, on the 
31st of Dec, 1 boot, value 2s. 6d.; the goods of 



Thomas Dousbery: and that Williams had been before convicted of felony.






CHARLES KEEN
. I am in the service of Mr. Thomas Dousbery, wbo keeps a shoemaker's shop in Liquorpond-street—I was in his shop on the evening of the 31st of Dec.—I missed a boot from the door-post—I heard a snap—I ran out, and saw Mr. Webb struggling with the prisoner Williams—I saw a boot thrown away by somebody, which was my master's—I looked round, to see where it would drop, and I heard a female say "Nail it, Bill' or Jem.






GEORGE WEBB
. I was passing in Liquorpond-street, and I heard Roe say to Norman, "D—n it, look at Jem"—I then saw Williams standing in the shade, with his right hand round the prosecutor's door-post, taking

hold of some boots—he had got one before I got up to him—I stopped him with it, and he threw it away—he slipped from me, but I took a second hold of him, and walked him back to the prosecutor's shop—Roe and Norman followed him to the shop, and then down to the station, and there I identified them.





JAMES WILD
 (police-constable G 182.) I was on duty from four o'clock till Williams was taken—I saw the three prisoners pass me in conversation, four or five times, and for the last two months Roe and Norman have been in Leather-lane and Liquorpond-street, associating together.





THOMAS WARE
 (police-constable G 240.) I produce a certificate of Williams's former conviction, which I got at Mr. Clark's office—(read—Convicted on the 21st Oct., 7th Vict., of larceny as servant, confined one year)—the prisoner is the man, and he had been before convicted of felony.

WILLIAMS—


GUILTY
. Aged 20.—


Transported for Seven Years.
ROE and NORMAN—


NOT GUILTY
.

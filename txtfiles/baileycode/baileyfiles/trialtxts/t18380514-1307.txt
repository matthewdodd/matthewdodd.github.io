CHARLES BRAND
. I am in the employ of Messrs. Glascott, brassfounders, in Great Garden-street, Whitechapel. On Tuesday morning. the 24th of April, I went with a truck of theirs along Minton-street, containing thirteen or fourteen pieces of metal—I was going up a hill—the prisoner came and shoved up behind the truck three times—the third time he went away on to the pavement, and I saw something under his arm—I ran after him and said, "There is my piece of brass"—he said, "Is it

my man?"—he gave it to me, and went into a house—a policeman came up—we went and found him sitting on the top stairs.





WILLIAM THOMPSON
. I saw the prisoner walk from behind the truck, and as he came past me he had this brass under his arm.





THOMAS TOWNSEND GLASSCOTT
. The firm consists of myself, my brother, and mother.

Prisoner's Defence. I saw the boy standing with the truck, and said, "Can't you get up?"—he said "No"—I said, "I will give you as hove" which I did, and going back I picked the brass up.





JAMES CLARK
 (police-constable N 15.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—I was present at the trial—the prisoner is the man.

            , I was present and saw the commissioners administer the oath. I was by when he was declared a bankrupt, it was at a coffee-house where the commissioners met, I was the clerk, and took the prisoner's deposition down on the 16th of November at Guildhall the second sitting; after he had sign'd it the commissioners gave him his oath, to make true answers to those questions which were afterwards asked him; 1st, whether it had been read to him: 2d, whether the contents of it were true: 3 d, and that the name was his hand-writing.

                  William 
                  Sopp 
               



            , my brother, was indebted to me almost 200 l. some money lent him, some paid for him to keep him from trouble. I have notes and bills to prove the greatest part of it.
Q. Where are the notes and bills?
Sopp. They are at home.
Court. We should be glad to see them.
Sopp. I will go and fetch them. He went out.

            . I know

                  Hitie 
               



            , who kept the Three Tuns in Darkhouse-lane : when I first came acquainted with the affair, which I shall hereafter relate, I kept the Dog and Bear Inn in the Borough, there William and 
               
                  Robert 
                  Sopp 
               



             brought nine horses to my house, at which time there was an extent in 
               
                  William 
                  Sopp 
               



            's house, I believe Mr. Jones in the Borough was then in possession of his premisses. I went with the prisoner and 
               
                  William 
                  Sopp 
               



             before the commissioners for the bankruptcy to prove a debt that very day; there was a paper drawn up between them at some house near Guildhall, which was a tavern, some head, I know not the sign. This was about nine weeks before last Christmas; there was a note drawn by the prisoner, which Sopp signed; then Sopp gave a bag to me with some money in it, and ordered me to deliver it to the prisoner Hine, which I did, and Hine delivered it to Sopp. This was all done in about two or three minutes. I don't know what sum it was; but there was thirty-six shilling pieces, for Sopp gave me three out of the same bag afterwards, to pay to the clerk of the commissioners, Mr. Maschal, which I did; then we went all three together before the commissioners, Hine proved the note under the commission, and he was after that made an assignee.
Q. What date was put to that note?
Seyden. It was dated 16 or 18 months back, but I will not be positive to the exact time. A note was shewn to him by the prisoner's council, with the commissioners names folded in.
Q. Is this the note?
Seyden. No, it is not, but when it was unfolded he said he'd swear it was the note.
Q. How long after the note being wrote was it that you went and proved it?
Seyden. It might be an hour or two.
Q. Who had it in their possession?
Seyden. Hine had.
Q. Was there any objection made to the shining of the ink being fresh wrote?
Seyden. No, there was not.
Q. Was the body of the note wrote before the date was put to it?
Seyden. Upon my word, I can't be particular as to that, I know it was consulted betwixt them two to date it back on purpose to prove it.

            , proving his brother was indebted to him to the amount of 90 odd pounds; he said he had more, but could not find them. Being asked if he owed him any debt besides, which was not in these accounts, he answered, he sold him a horse for 12 guineas, which had not been paid; this together made upwards of 100 l.
For the Defendant.

             between six and seven years; I lived at Mr. Hine's seven years and upwards, and am related to him; I remember 
               
                  William 
                  Sopp 
               



             coming there often to borrow money, and had it of me when Mr. Hine was not in the way. She is shewn the note.
Q. Do you know this note?
Churchman. I can't write, but can read writing, I can read this; I saw 
               
                  William 
                  Sopp 
               



             give Mr. Hine a note for money, which I saw wrote in his kitchen, and believe it is a little better than three years ago. I believe it was for 50 or 60 l. it was not less I am sure, and I saw Mr. Hine give Sopp money at that time, it was counted on the table in gold and silver; there has been frequent transactions between them for money, before the commission of bankrupcy; Mr. Hine has given me a charge, to desire none of his customers, if they come, to borrow money.

Stamsby. I heard Seyden say to Hine and Sopp, if they would give his father Maschal ten guineas, and him five, he'd manage it so, that they should never be brought in question, and desired them to keep out of the way, for there were warrants out against them through his means.

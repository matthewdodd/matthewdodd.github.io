his pocket—the gentleman turned, and called "Stop thief"—I and a gentleman I was with, pursued the prisoner, who ran across the road, and threw down this handkerchief—the gentleman took it up—the prisoner ran up in alley—I pursued and took him—the gentleman who lost the handkerchief gave the name of Winder, and that name is on the handkerchief, but he did not attend the next day, as he said he would, and they could not find him.

WILLIAM MILLS
 was indicted

for stealing 1 handkerchief, value 2s., the goods of 



George Nicols, from his person; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






GEORGE NICOLS
. I live in Redcross-street, Borough. On the evening of the 25th of Dec. I was walking in Blackman-street, Borough—the constable spoke to me—I put my hand into my pocket, and missed my handkerchief, which was safe not two minutes before—I had had it in my hand and used it—this is it.





JOHN WILD
 (police-constable M 94.) I was on duty in Blackman-street between six and seven o'clock that evening—I saw the prisoner and two others following a gentleman and lady—when they got to the end of Lant-street the prisoner took the tail of the gentleman's coat, and took the handkerchief out—the other two persons went after the gentleman and lady—I followed the prisoner, he ran and dropped the handkerchief—I took him, and gave him to another officer—I came back, and took up the handkerchief in the dark place where he had thrown it.

Prisoner's Defence. I was going up Blackman-street; I saw two young men following this gentleman, and they took his handkerchief; I said, "Hey! what are you about?" they chucked the handkerchief in my face—I threw it down, and they ran up Lant-street—I stood still, and the officer took me.





THOMAS BENT
 (police-constable V 95.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction at Kingston-on-Thames—(read—Convicted 23rd March, 1845, and confined six months)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
.* Aged 22.—


Transported for Ten Years.


Before Mr. Recorder.

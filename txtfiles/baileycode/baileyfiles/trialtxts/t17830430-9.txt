                  THOMAS
                   CARPENTER
               



             sworn.
I am a constable; I apprehended the prisoner Littlepage, Mrs. Warrickshall, and her son; on the 11th of March, I was called up at five in the morning, to go and take possession of two thieves that were taken in the night for stealing yarn, and carried to Mr. Lowe's on Poplar Causeway; accordingly I went there and took them both in charge, and as I was going to handcuff them, one of them, whose name was Lane desired me to let him alone, and he would discover the whole transaction, I told him; if he would do that, we would clear the room and get a sheet of paper, and I would take his examination, which I accordingly did; after I had taken his examination, I read it to him, and he signed it in my presence, and one Mr. Tindall.
Prisoner's Council. That totally lies out of this case.
Carpenter. Previous to my going to Mrs. Warrickshall's house, I charged Lowe to assist me to go there, to search for more yarn.
Court. What is Mrs. Warrickshall? - She keeps a private house, and is a waterman's widow; while I was searching the premises, Mr. Hankey and Mr. Blackmore the King's surveyor came and asked me, whether I had found any copper pintles belonging to a ship's rudder and desired me to search for some, which I promised I would.
Court. What is a pintle? - It is what is fastened to the rudder, for the rudder to swing backwards and forwards. (The pintle produced.)
Court. What is it made of? - It is made of base metal; I told them I had not, I searched further, and Mr. Hankey and Blackmore assisted me, we found none; after they were gone, I begged of Mrs. Warrickshall, if she had any copper pintles to deliver them to me, for it would be better to throw herself on the mercy of the gentlemen, Hankey and Blackmore; she told me then, to fetch Mr. Hankey to her, that she might first hear what he said; I went and told Mr. Hankey, and he came and asked her what she wanted with him, she said, she wanted him to shew her mercy in this affair; Mr. Hankey told her, it was not in his power to grant her any lenity, but the law must take place.
Court. What did she say to that? - Mr. Hankey then went away, and then she asked me what she should do, I told her she had better deliver them up, for I had not done rummaging, she then said she had but one the other was disposed of; I then told her she had better give that up.
Prisoner's Council. Did you say what you should do, if she did not give it up, I told her I had not half done rummaging, she then begged that a sack might be brought to put it in, that it might not be exposed in the streets; this was in the bed chamber she begged me to take hold of one part of the bed, and she took hold of the other part, and there lay the pintle, between the sacking of the bed and the bed itself.
Was there any appearance of it under the bed, did the sacking sway down? - I had not looked under that bed, this was the 11th of March, in the morning, I afterwards went to take Littlepage; he got from me, but I took him afterwards at Lambeth; he told me that every thing that Stannard, who was admitted an evidence had discovered was true, and that he would speak the same words before the court.
Did he mention any of the particulars to you? - No, not to me, he said he would tell the Justice every thing that was transacted.
Did you take Bell? - I took him with them, he said nothing to me.
Court. Had you read that examination to Littlepage? - It was read before the magistrate, in the presence of Littlepage and me, I heard it read, and there was hardly a word of alteration.
Prisoner's Council. The examination that you talked of first of all, was not relating at all to this business of the pintle? - That was concerning the ropes.
You had made your unsuccessful search in this woman's house, and found nothing? - Yes.
What had Mr. Hankey to do there, he does not belong to the King's yard I believe, only Mr. Blackmore? - No.
They having been gone, and nothing yet found, you say you and the woman were together, and you told her, it would be better for her, if she would discover where the pintle was what did you mean by that, or what did you she meant? - To give it with herself.
You thought at that time, that she thought she should save herself by making this discovery? - I think she did.
I think you said it would be better for her to discover this? - Yes.
After that I believe she shewed you where the pintle was? - She found by Mr. Hankey that he would shew her no mercy.
Council for Prosecution. He was gone before the pintle was found; then you had some conversation? - I told her she had better give it up, and throw herself upon the mercy of the prosecutor, for I had not done rummaging.
Prisoner's Council. Then she still thought she should have favour? - She could not after Mr. Hankey was gone, because he told her, she could have no favour; I told her she had better give it up, it would save us a great deal of trouble, I do not know whether she would have delivered it up, but she saw I had not done rummaging.
Well, but the fact is, she did deliver it up? - Yes.
Court. She asked you what you would advise her to do? - Yes.
First you told her, if I understand you, that she had better throw herself upon the mercy of those two persons, one was an officer in the yard, and the other a merchant.
And she then desired to see Mr. Hankey, and hear what he said? - Yes.
Then he came? - I fetched him myself.
What are you? - A ship carpenter.
Mr. Keys. My Lord, I am council for the prisoner Bell, and I submit that the accomplice cannot be examined, unless there was some evidence to affect Bell.
Court. What has been said cannot have any affect as to him.


                  JOHN
                   STANNARD
               



             sworn.
Council for Prosecution. You are an apprentice I believe to a shipwright? - Yes.
You know the yard of Messrs. Perry and Hankey? - Yes.
Do you know the Maidstone frigate? - Yes.

Do you know the prisoner 
               
                  William
                   Littlepage
               



            ? - Yes, he was an apprentice too.
Do you know any thing of the loss of these two pintles, or either of them? - I called on Littlepage on Sunday morning, between eight and nine, I cannot rightly say what month, it was three weeks before we took the last pintle, and Littlepage was taken up after we had taken the last about three days.
Then that brings it to about the 17th or 18th of February? - I and Littlepage went the Sunday morning down to the yard, and about eleven we went down to the dock where the Maidstone was, the Maidstone was a King's ship, and we laid the pintle upon the timber pile ready to be got away in the night, then between eight and nine we went down to the yard, and we had agreed to get 
               
                  Jane
                   Warrickshall
               



            's boat, and to sell it to her, I had not seen Mrs. Warrickshall before; between eight and nine in the evening we went down to 
               
                  Jane
                   Warrickshall
               



            's house, to get the boat to take it away, and she asked us what we had got; and we told her a piece of a copper pintle; then she told her son to go out with us, to get the boat, and to go with us to take it, and he rowed us.
Court. Was the son present when you had this conversation with the mother? - Yes.
Did he hear what was said? - Yes.
Are you sure of that? - Yes.
Did she know Littlepage? - Yes.
Did the son go with the boat? - Yes, he rowed us down with the boat, he landed us at the Dock, and her son held the boat, while I and Littlepage went and brought the pintle into the boat, then he rowed us back, he staid in the boat, and Littlepage and me carried the pintle into her house; Mrs. Warrickshall came into the cellar and weighed it, and it came to 1 l. 3 s.
Court. After what calculation? - Four-pence per pound.
Did she pay you that 23 s.? - Yes, she gave it to 
               
                  Thomas
                   Littlepage
               



             and I received half of it.
Court. Did you at any time after this go to the same yard, and take any other pintle? - Yes, I and 
               
                  Thomas
                   Littlepage
               



             went down on Sunday morning, the 9th of March, he called upon me, we went on board a new ship that was building near to this ship; and we boared some holes for two young fellows that had some work to do; while we were boaring these holes, 
               
                  Joseph
                   Bell
               



             came on board this new ship, then we went round the yard together, and I and 
               
                  Thomas
                   Littlepage
               



             came back again; Bell came back afterwards to us on board this new ship, and Bell asked me if I had a mind to get any copper bolts, I said there was none to be got; then he asked if I had a mind to get one of the pintles of the Maidstone's rudder, I agreed to it, and I and Littlepage went down to the Dock and knocked two of the nails out, while 
               
                  Joseph
                   Bell
               



             stood above, to see that nobody came to disturb us; then we came up out of the Dock, and 
               
                  Joseph
                   Bell
               



            , I, and Littlepage went round, he told Littlepage to stop a bit, and he would get a fellow servant of his who had just come into the yard out of it, and then come back, we staid till about eleven, and he did not come back, then I and 
               
                  Thomas
                   Littlepage
               



             went into the Dock, and took the pintle, and put it under the ship's bottom till night; between eight and nine we went to Mrs. Warrickshall's house to get a boat, she asked us what we had got, and we told her, she said we should find her boat at the stairs, and we found it there; and I, and Littlepage went with this boat, and rowed it down to the Dock, and we made the boat fast, and went into the yard, and took the pintle, and put it into the boat, and carried it to 
               
                  Jane
                   Warrickshall
               



            's about nine; she was at home, and Littlepage carried it up into her house, and she went down into the cellar with us, and weighed it, and it came to one pound six shillings and four-pence; she gave us but a guinea that night, and told me to come back the next morning for the rest of the money, and she would give it me; I went there the next morning, and she gave me five shillings, and said she would not give me the odd four-pence.
(The other pintle produced, and deposed to by the witness.)

Prisoner's Council. Is that the pintle that was taken first or last? - The last.
When you first concerted this, Bell was not with you? - No.
Mrs. Warrickshall is a waterman's widow, is not she? - Yes.
She has a boat that works upon the river? - Yes.
Is not her son apprentice to her? - Yes.
Is he out of his time? - I believe not.
Did the boy take any notice of what you was talking of? - He was close by.
But you did not say any thing that you had taken it out of a man of war, or that you had stole it? - No.
The boy was not by when it was carried, did he help you to the house? - No, he staid in the boat.
No part of the bargain was made, or any payment before him? - No.
Nor you did not tell Mrs. Warrickshall where you had got it? - No.
Was not it a broken pintle at first? - No.
I believe those that are made of base metal, when they are broke are fit for nothing but old stuff, waste stuff? - I do not know.
Are they not cast? - I believe they are.
What did she give you a pound for it? - four-pence.
Court. Both times the same price per pound? - I believe it was, as to the last, the boy was not there at all? - No.
Council for the Prosecution. Did the boy know where the boat was going to? - Yes.
Court. The mother bade the son go with you with the boat? - Yes.


                  THOMAS
                   GARRARD
               



             sworn.
I am a ship carpenter for Perry and Hankey; I know the ship Maidstone, and when she came into the Dock the pintles were all on, and some time afterwards, I suppose near a month before this happened; I think she came into Dock the fourth of January; the second pintle was taken the ninth of March.


                  JOHN
                   BLACKMORE
               



             sworn.
I am a King's surveyor, I inspect the repairs of the works, I have tried this pintle, and it firs exactly; unless it was the identical pintle it could not fit so well.
What are they worth? - About six guineas a 100, near about 13 d 1/2. a pound.
About what time was the first lost? - I do not know.
Court. What would they sell for as old pintles, merely on account of the metal? - This is a useful pintle, and would do again, but the other I believe is worth about 3 l. 10 s. per hundred.


                  WILLIAM
                   FORBES
               



             sworn.
I made this pintle, I have not fitted it on, it has my mark upon it, my name, and the broad arrow; the value 14 d. a pound, and we give 10 d. for the old one.
What do you think that is worth? - This is as good as ever, there is no sort of difference, and the old ones are worth 10 d. or 9 d. per pound.
Court. The examination must be read, if you make use of his evidence, which is that, every thing is true, that is therein contained, therefore it must be read or else I cannot take it; the other man swore it was read over to him, and that he said every word of it was true; now what is contained in that we have never seen.
Court to Carpenter. You said that the man desired you might be alone together, and you dismissed all the rest, and then you took pen, ink and paper, and wrote the examination, of one of these men, that examination led you to the discovery of these facts? - Yes.
To those facts relative to Littlepage? - Yes.
Then in consequence of this, when Littlepage was taken up, after the time you had searched at Mrs. Warrickshall's, then he was carried before a Justice of peace, and that examination which you had taken before in writing was read over? - Yes.
Where is Stannard's examination? - The magistrate took it.
He confessed then nothing but that, what was contained in one of the examinations was true? - No, Stannard sign'd his examination.
Court Is there any examination returned.
Council for Prosecution. We have a copy of it, the examination read, the voluntary information of 
               
                  John
                   Stannard
               



            , proved by Carpenter.
Court to Carpenter. Did you see the Justice sign this? - Yes, read the voluntary information of 
               
                  John
                   Stannard
               



            , taken before us.
Of the Justice's, of his Majesty's peace, on the 15th of March 1783, about three weeks ago, he with one 
               
                  Thomas
                   Littlepage
               



             took from the Maidstone frigate, at the dock at Blackwall, a large piece of metal, belonging to the rudder of the said ship, called a pintle; and one 
               
                  Thomas
                   Warrickshall
               



            , did assist in conveying the same away in his boat, being a waterman, by the directions of his mother, who received the same, well knowing it to be stolen, and paid three and twenty shillings for it: Also says, that on the 9th of March, they took one other piece of metal, called a pintle, and put the same down in the Dock, till evening; 
               
                  Joseph
                   Bell
               



             was present, and looked out while they took out two nails, to loosen the side pintle; says, that about nine o'clock they carried the same to Warrickshall's house, with the help of her boat, who did receive the same knowing it to be stolen, and that she paid to them one pound six shillings; for the last piece of metal.
Council for the Prisoner. You too Littlepage at Lambeth? - Yes.
Had you this information, about the pintle then? - No.
I think you said he confessed in the coach? - No, Sir, I said he confessed nothing to me; it was at the magistrates after hearing the examination and informantion of Stannard's read.
What did 
               
                  Thomas
                   Littlepage
               



             say before the magistrate? - Mr. Staple's asked him if that was true; and he said it was all true; and Mr. Staple's, rather marked it, and he turned to me, says he, carpenter, you see it is of no use, Littlepage saying what he has, it is not like a thief that has been brought up from his cradle.
Prisoner's Council. What, that he was not hardened; there is a great deal of difference between contradicting it and owning it? - Littlepage was silent till the Magistrate had done, then the magistrate asked him if that was true, and he said yes.

                  Jane
                   Warrickshall
               



            . My Lord, I beg have to ask whether upon the evidence of Mr. Carpenter, your Lordship should think this confession of Mrs. Warrickshall's, was a confession made in expectation of that favor offered, and held out to her, by the constable, that it would be better for her, if she would discover where the pintle was; he himself says, he apprehended she thought so, and my Lord, I humbly apprehend wheresoever a confession is made by a prisoner, and promises of favor are held out to them, these courts have always held that the public faith should not be broken, therefore I hope that that promise made by the constable, shall be considered as the cause of this confession, and that a confession made under such influence, will not be received by the court.
Mr. J. Nares. In this case the prisoner applies particularly to Mr. Hankey, and when the man says you had better throw yourself on the mercy of Hankey, and the other person now Hankey does not appear to be an immediate officer under the King, but a person immediately concerned as a Merchant; he was a person then enquiring into that fact, and who could prosecute, as any body can for a felony, and he give her no hopes in the world; says he, it is no in my power, and he adds besides, the law shall take its course; then afterwards away he went, and the prisoner advises with this man, not as considering him in the quality or office of constable, but as a friend, and adviser; says he, you had better deliver it up; now she had heard what the other person Hankey had said before, and this man adds, I have not done rummaging yet; she must know at that time that he certainly meant farther to go on, with respect to his rummaging, and that these goods must be found; therefore I think under the circumstances of this case, this is such a confession as should be laid aside; and I think it is proper evidence to be received; I should be glad to hear what my brother says.
Mr. 
               
                  Baron
                   Eyre
               



            . It has been stated at the bar by Mr. Chetwood, as if it was the constant practice and rule of law, that both confessions and goods produced, in consequence of promises held out to the party, were to be rejected, from a regard to public faith: The rule however is this, that confessions or declarations by prisoners; are, or are not credible, and as such are or are not to be left to the Jury, as they appear to obtained with or without promises, or other inducements; if they are frank and voluntary, there is then no impeachment of their credit, and upon that ground of their being credible; they are left to the Jury to prove the fact, to which they are adduced, if they are obtained improperly, they deserve no credit, and because they deserve no credit, they are not to be left to the Jury. But this rule with respect to confessions has no application from principles and has never received any application in my practice, with respect to goods produced; because where goods are produced whatever was the inducement, by which the party is prevailed upon, their being found there does not depend upon the mere confession or parole declaration of the party, because the evidence that results from it is, that they are actually found in such custody; if they cannot make out that, they are found in the custody of the prisoner, if they cannot be brought home to the prisoner, without taking in the evidence of the prisoner, then so much of the evidence as depends upon the parole testimony of the prisoner must be rejected. It is novel in law, and extremly dangerous, and not consonant to the general principles of criminal law, for courts of that juridiction, to be holding out support of this sort of public faith; it is to say in other words, that felony may be compounded; if the party is promised encouragement, and upon the strength of that, the evidence of the goods that are found, is not to be produced against them; so far is the law from having this idea, with respect to public faith in promises, that the law goes great lengths against criminals; for instance in a civil case, the law would not allow a constable to put his hand into the pocket of the prisoner; whereas prisoners, and their lodgings are searched, and their pockets even rifled; all which, upon the principle of law is extremely different; and tho' I agree with my brother, whatever should be thought, to be the law on this subject, that this case does not fall within it; still I would not hear the council at the bar, assert that it has been the universal practice; without stating what has occurred to me, as to the practice, from the experience that I have had here.
Mr. Justice Nares. I perfectly noticed that in this particular instance, that case does not come within the rule laid down by Mr. Chetwood; yet I think no man should be bound to accuse himself, nor should any man, when lulled into a fatal security, with promises of being free, if he makes a confession, have that confession afterwards turned against him; I do not give my opinion here particularly, but I speak my own sentiments; suppose the crime to be ever so great, if a man having authority or power, a prosecutor or constable, says, let me know where these things are you shall go free, his life is concerned; and he relying on that promise, does make a confession, or does tell where the goods are, he ought to have the benefit of that promise; and so far I will venture to say, that in the little experience I have had, wherever confessions have been made; the people have been always asked whether it was voluntary; nay farther, whether the party was not apprized, that his life was at stake; if what my brother has mentioned is the opinion of the majority of the Judges, as he thinks it is, however I am bound by it, yet at the same time, I think it would be an exceeding hard case, that a man whose life is at stake, is to be lulled into security, and then because goods are found, which he has confessed, that confession is to operate against him. I only speak this as my opinion, as I think it a great hardship: We have read in other histories of other nations, that it is one of the particular species of fortune to tell the wretched; they shall be free if they confess, and immediately to turn that confession against them, I do not say, but my brother's law may be exceeding right, and he seems to mention it as the received opinion of the Judges; I do not contradict it, I only cannot help speaking the feelings of my own heart.
Mr. 
               
                  Baron
                   Eyre
               



            . There is no doubt, but that other Judges have thought on this subject, in this same manner, that my learned brother does: This subject has more than once, undergone solemn consideration, and according to my recollection not having my papers here; (I do not mean to speak with absolute certainty, and the case before us, does not require, that I should;) but according to my best recollection, upon a solemn decision of the subject by the Judges, a majority of the Judges were of that opinion, of which I have now professed myself to be; and I do know extremely well, that very able men did at one time think otherwise, and that was the occasion of the subject brought under decision.
Mr. Judge Nares. I believe something was mentioned, at the meeting of all Judges, but I did not understand, it is the separate opinion of all the Judges.
Mr. 
               
                  Baron
                   Eyre
               



            . If a point should arise, it would be a very proper thing, that it should be determined in some solemn way, that it may receive a decision, one way or the other, in order that the law on this subject may be administered uniformly.
Prisoner's Council to Mr. Blackmore. Tell us exactly what was said?
Mr. Blackmore. I was, my Lord, at Mrs. Warrickshall's, at the delivery of the pintle, I went in with Carpenter, I took Mrs. Warrickshall aside, on the landing place of the stairs, I said, Mrs. Warrickshall this matter differs from the yarn; she said, will you speak for me? Says I, I can do no such thing believe I said with the navy-board; there were no considerations of favor or mercy, offered her by me, and I was particularly careful not to give any idea favor or mercy, because I knew to the contrary.
Prisoner's Council. My Lord, there is no evidence against young Warrickshall, but his going with the boat, and he is an apprentice to his mother, and he staid with the boat after he had landed his fare.

             called six witnesses who gave a good character.
The Prisoner 
               
                  Thomas
                   Warrickshall
               



             called one witness who gave him a good character.
The learned Judge then summed up the evidence to the Jury, and added as follows.
You know gentlemen, if the two principals are not guilty, the accomplices cannot: With respect to Bell, who is one of the principals, there is nothing affects him, for what the other man says, who is a mere accomplice, without something confirm it, cannot affect him; because it is a certain rule, where one man thinks proper to take the guilt off himself, to put it on another, the law never credits that declaration: With respect to the other principal Littlepage, although the evidence of the accomplice, is very circumstantial, yet that would not do, without something to confirm it; but here is the strongest conformation in the world by Littlepage himself, for he says, that every word of this information was true: So, that there is a direct evidence by this Stannard, confirmed in the strongest manner by the prisoner, reduced into writing, and which cannot deceive: I cannot therefore see any thing that can be said in his favor, if you believe the evidence; supposing then, that Littlepage is guilty, then the question is, with respect to the other prisoners, who are indicted as receivers; and they you will observe, must know these things were stolen at the time they received them in order to be guilty: Now with respect to 
               
                  Jane
                   Warrickshall
               



            , there seems to be the strongest evidence in the world that can be given against her: Here are two shipwrights apprentices, come and tell her, they had got such a thing, she never asked them how they came by it, lends them a boat, orders her son to go with them, she weighs it, and pays these two lads for it: how she came to, were how to put any value upon it, is not material; for it is that sort of value, that is one of the strongest evidences in the world to prove, that she must know that they did not come honestly by it, because it is not half the real value of it, considered even in the light of an old pintle, but here it is as good as a new one: You see gentlemen, these circumstances of her bidding her boy go with her boat at one time, at another telling where her boat was, afterwards putting this pintle in the cellar, and its being found between the bed and the sacking; and another thing, her wanting to see Mr. Hankey, and when he says, what do you want with me? she says, I want to apply for your mercy; if she had been doing what she thought an honest thing, what mercy did she want: And therefore this confession she had made at all hazards, and all events, knowing she was guilty, and knowing there was a man in the house, that if she had denied it would have proved what she said to be false: Therefore, it stands for you to decide upon it, whether under all these circumstances, you think she received it, knowing it to be stolen: But I must make one observation more, and that is with respect to the little boy, her son, and apprentice; he might hear what was said, but he had nothing to do with it, he had nothing to do with the contract, between his mother and these men, he goes with the boat, is to bring what is mother agreed, they should fetch, but he know nothing particular of it, and therefore, I own for my part these are circumstances in his favor, and as many a lad acting under the conduct of his mother, I think it would be two hard to make him partake of the consequences of guilt, in an equal degree with the mother herself, however, gentlemen, you have the whole before you, you will take the whole into your consideration, and you will give your verdict accordingly; you will find Littlepage guilty, if you think he is guilty, and then with regard to the other two, the two Warrickshall's, you will find one or both guilty, as you think in point of conscience you ought to do.

               NOT GUILTY
            .
Tried by the first Middlesex Jury before Mr. Justice NARES.
N. B. When sentence was pronounced on the Middlesex prisoners, Mr. Recorder thus addressed 
               
                  Thomas
                   Littlepage
               



             and 
               
                  Jane
                   Warrickshall
               



            ? With respect to you 
               
                  Thomas
                   Littlepage
               



            , the law has left a power in the Court without applying for the interposition of your Royal Master, to mitigate the sentence of the law, and to reprieve you from the execution of that sentence; the Court are of opinion, that the circumstances of your case are not such as immediately require, the severe example of death; and therefore, it is the order of the Court, that you be transported to America for the term of seven years. And with respect to you 
               
                  Jane
                   Warrickshall
               



            , you stand convicted of receiving stolen goods, on two several indictments; the offence is in sight of the law, so heinous, that the punishment of it is more severe, than that of other felonies, which are not punished with death; for in cases of all other felonies, the punishment seldom exceeds transportation for seven years, but the law wisely and truly judges that the offence of the receiver, is in general more dangerous, and pernicious than that of the thief: The Court has in your case, no power to mitigate your sentence, which is, that you be transported to America for the term of fourteen years.

            . I live in Cannon-street, St. George's in the East, and am a gingerbread-baker
. I had a stall at Stepney fair


. On the 25th May, about one o'clock in the morning, I missed all these things from my stall. I found my booth was cut open. I heard my bed and blankets were found at Hyde's - he keeps a drinking booth - I went and found twenty or thirty persons there. I found Martin there, and he said,
"Mr. Jackson, what are you come here for?" - I said I had lost something. I set two men to watch the booth, and fetched a constable. Moss called me, and I found Martin in his custody - a pelisse, the stockings, cap, and bonnet, were found on him. I found the rest of the property in Hyde's booth and secured him.

            . I am a servant to Jackson. About three o'clock in the morning I went into Hyde's booth, Martin came in and said,
"I suppose that **** has come to look after the bed and blankets, knock his head off his shoulders." I made no reply, but came out; and in about ten minutes I saw him come out with a bonnet and bundle - he dropped the bundle. I pursued him and took him with the bonnet in his hand. I picked up the bundle and knew the property. I afterwards went to the booth, and found the other things in the morning.

JOHN BROWN. I am an officer. I received the prisoners in charge with the property.

MARTIN'S Defence. I never had the things.
HYDE'S Defence. People come to my booth and bring tea-things - I supply them with water and take care of their things. I do not know how these things came there.

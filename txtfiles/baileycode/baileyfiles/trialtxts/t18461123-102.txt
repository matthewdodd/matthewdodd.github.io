FREDERICK REDMAN
 was indicted

 for stealing 16 yards of woollen cloth, value 6l., the goods of 



Henry Regless and others, in their dwelling-house; and that he had been before convicted of felony, 
MR. HUDDLESTONE
conducted the Prosecution.






ROBERT BOUSFIELD
. I am in partnership with Frederick Sherratt, at 107, St. Martin's-lane—this cloth is our property—I saw it safe on the premises between four and five o'clock of the afternoon of the 11th Nov.—we did not sell it to anybody—Henry Regless is a partner with us—I know the cloth by this mark, which it would not bear if it were sold.





JOHN SIMS HANDCOCK
 (police-sergeant E 12.) At a quarter after six on 11th Nov., I was on duty in Chandos-street, and saw the prisoner and others—the prisoner had this roll of cloth under his arm—he passed me and turned the comer of a court—I turned back after him, and he commenced running—I ran after him, got close to him, and he dropped this cloth—I called "Stop thief"—he was stopped by a gentleman—I took him in charge, and received the cloth from Mrs. Balls.

Cross-examined by
MR. BALLANTINE. Q. Did you lose sight of him? A. Yes—I am certain he is the person.





MARY BALLS
. I picked up the cloth and gave it to the policeman.





FREDERICK CULMER
 (police-constable E 117.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction from Clerkenweli—(read—Convicted 1st April, 1846, Confined six months)—I was present at the trial—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 20.—


Transported for Seven Years.

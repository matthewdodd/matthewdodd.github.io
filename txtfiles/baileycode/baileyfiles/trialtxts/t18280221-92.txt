            . I am the brother of Francis Harrison, who keeps a shop in Tottenham-court-road


. Some umbrellas were standing at his door, in the morning, and when I took them in at night, one was missing; I know this to be my brother's; It has my writing on it.

            . I am a watchman. The prisoner passed me in Church-street, St. Giles', with this umbrella, about half-past nine o'clock at night, on the 22d of January; I asked what he had got, and told him to stop, but he ran the faster - I caught him, and he told me a man of the name of Keith gave it him to carry; I went to that man, but he denied it.
Prisoner's Defence. There was a boy pursued by a gentleman, and the boy threw this umbrella down - I took it up, and called to the gentleman, but he did not hear me; I was running because I had no shoes on, and was collared by this watchman.
JOHN MURPHY. It was a very dirty day, but the umbrella was quite clean. 

               GUILTY
            . Aged 21.

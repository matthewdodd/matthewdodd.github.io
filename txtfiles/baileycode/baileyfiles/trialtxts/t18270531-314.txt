            . I am a constable of Broad-street. On the 23d of April, about half-past seven o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner and another in Cornhill


, as the mail coaches were starting - I saw the prisoner go behind a gentleman, and take a yellow handkerchief out of his pocket; I touched the gentleman on his back, and told him what I had seen - he turned to come across the street with me, but my eye was upon the prisoner, and I lost the gentleman; I followed the prisoner and his companion into the Old Jewry - they went down Princes-street, and were coming into Cheapside again; I took hold of the prisoner, and companion ran away; I took the prisoner up Meeting-house-court, and searched him - I found the handkerchief in his hat; he said it was his own - he had no other. I do not know the gentleman's name.
JURY. Q. Was he out of your sight? A. No.
Prisoner's Defence. I had bought the handkerchief on Monday, and gave 2s. 6d. for it - I put it into my hat, and was going down the Old Jewry; this man came and took me - the handkerchief has a blue stain on it; I got into conversation with the other lad, and he went to the pump.

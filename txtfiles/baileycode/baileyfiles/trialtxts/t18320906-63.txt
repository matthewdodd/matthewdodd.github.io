. The prisoner was in my employ for three weeks; I missed a silver spoon on the 31st of July - I made inquiry the next day. but could get no answer; I went to a pawnbroker, who sent his shopman to my house-he looked at the persons who were there, and indetified the prisoner as the person; I called him into the parlour, and asked him how he came to do it, and if he was in distress; he said he had not done it - I said, "You are a good-for-nothing scoundrel, and you may go about your business;" he said he would be d-d if he would - I was forced to get an officer to take him.

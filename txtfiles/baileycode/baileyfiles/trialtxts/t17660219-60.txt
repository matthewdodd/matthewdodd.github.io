            . I have been acquainted with the prisoner about two years and a half. I, him, and 
               
                  James 
                  Wedle 
               



            , went out one night together a thieving, a fortnight ago last Wednesday: we went into Little Russel-court. I saw the door of the prosecutor's shop open. Wedle went in and fetched the shew-glass out, and blowed out the candle upon the counter; then Bouden and he ran along Vinegar-yard with it, I followed them between two coaches and into Catherine-street, then into Southampton-street; there Wedle gave the shew-glass to me. I carried it to the ruins of St. Giles's, there we opened it. Wedle took the things out, and put them in a handkerchief, then we threw the shew-glass into a sawpit. We carried the things to where I lodge; we all three lay together, and put them under the head of the bed. The next morning we went to see for a Jew, that Wedle called Nickadowser: we bargained with him for near one hundred seals for 4 s. Then we sold him a large silver medal, and he made us give him another medal into the bargain. We sold him an instrument case, with scissars and things in it, all for 29 s. Then he said he had no more money, but he would go and get some, and buy the rest of the things: he went and came back, and gave us 24 s. for three pair of paste buckles, two pair of oval ones, and a pair of true-lovers knot buckles. After that he gave us 1 l. 14 s. for eight gold rings, with stones in them, and some watch chains, necklaces, and ear-rings, with stones. On the Sunday morning following we were going to Holborn, and met him again. I gave him a little hat buckle that I had. We went in at the Py'd Bull, by Bloomsbury-square; he bargained with us for three watches under a gateway, in Ormond-street, for three guineas; after that we shewed him a pair of silver buckles like a true-lover's knot: he insisted upon our giving him them; we would not; then he allowed us 3 s. for them, but gave us but two. Then we went to the Rummer, in Oxford-market, and from thence set out for Hounslow, and staid there till the Wednesday, and came home in the evening, and on the Monday following Wright came and took me; after that he went and took Bouden. On the Tuesday we were carried before Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            ; they wanted me to be an evidence; at first I would not, but after that I consented, and told Sir 
               
                  John
               


             the same as now. At night the prosecutor came; then we went to see after the Jew. We went to the Three Pigeons, where Nickadowser took the things: we found him. He and the prosecutor went out to whisper together, and between the prosecutor, who is a Jew, and one Lyon, they let him go. They talked in their own language together.

            . I live in Castle-street, Piccadilly, and am a carver and gilder

            . The two prisoners, Quin, and I, went out one night, and got nothing. Coming home by where the prosecutor lives, they proposed going into his house. I was not for going in. Bouden and Quin said if we would not, we should have none of the things; then Bouden opened the door, he, I, and Quin went in, and Berryman stood at the door to see who came: we went up stairs, and brought down the several things mentioned in the indictment (naming them.) Berryman went and pawned a shirt for 4 s. after that a waistcoat for 6 s. 9 d. at Mr. Styles's. Quin sold two boys shirts in King-street, Seven Dials, for a shilling. There were two frocks, one of them I have on now.
Mr. Styles. I live in Little Castle-street. I am a pawnbroker (he produced a black waistcoat, deposed to by the prosecutor.) This Berryman pledged with me the 20th of November. I have known him ten or eleven years, he lived in the neighbourhood.
Bouden's defence.
This evidence met Berryman and me together at the end of Monmouth-street; he asked Berryman if he could pawn a waistcoat for him, and he took and pawned it.
Berryman's defence the same.

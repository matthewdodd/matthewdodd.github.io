            . On the 25th of October, I met the prisoner and Garde in the New-road - Garde had the lead; the prisoner knew me, and told Garde I was coming, who dropped the lead, and the prisoner got away. I was looking after him some time, and at last found him in custody at the watch-house. I knew him perfectly well before.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I was with Garde, and saw a sack against a door. He asked me to lift it on his shoulder, and said he would take it to the watch-house.

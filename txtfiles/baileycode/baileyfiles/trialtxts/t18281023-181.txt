            ; against the Statute.
TWO OTHER COUNTS, varying the manner of laying the charge.
MR. ADOLPHUS conducted the prosecution.
WILLIAM GOODHALL. I am nearly fifty years of age; I have been ten years as butler
 in the service of Mr. Warren, Chief Justice of Chester - he lives in Bedford-square. On the 3d or 4th of August, about eight o'clock in the evening, I was coming down Oxford-street, and saw a man with paintings on a board - I was looking at them and a person spoke to me; we walked on together, and in consequence of some representations he made to me, I gave him a little silver - I had never seen him before, to my knowledge, but I gave him the silver out of charity; he said he was in distress, and had a wife and child - I had no other conversation with him, except about the pictures, and about his wife and family: the shops were open and people were about - there was no look or act of an indecent nature passed between us; I was going to Mr. Hatchard's in a few days afterwards, when the prisoner, and the person I had met before, and another person, overtook me; they said "You know what you have been doing, and if you don't give us money, you know what we can do with you;" I said "I am a servant - I can't afford to give any money, and I have done nothing that I know of," with that, to get rid of them, I gave them a shilling; they did not name any sum of money that I was to give - this was about seven or eight o'clock; after this, the prisoner and the other two men, came to my master's house and rang the bell - I spoke to them from the area; the prisoner was with them, but not close - he was within sight; the man I had met first asked me to give him 5l., or otherwise he would expose me: I said I had no money - I was a servant and could not afford to give any money; I said "Whatever you have to do, you must do;" the next day, which was the 9th, we went upon the Circuit, and returned on the 9th of September. On the 10th Mr. Warren went down to his country seat, near Seven Oaks, and I was packing up the things, to send to him: in about a quarter of an hour after the carriage was gone, the prisoner rang at the bell - I opened the area-door and he threw down this note. (The Note was put in and read.)
September, 1828.
SIR, - I should be glad if you can oblige me with the loan of 5l., and I will let you have it next Monday week, without fail. Be so kind as to meet me in half an hour's time, at the corner of the square.
Mr. Goodall, at Mr. Warren's, No. 15, Bedford-square. I asked him who it came from, but he went away; in about a quarter of an hour a servant of Lord Chief Justice Best's called - I showed him the note, and had some conversation with him; he went and got the streetkeeper, and I went to the corner of the square, to see if I could see any thing of the prisoner, but I could not: on the following morning there came another letter, by the twopenny-post - this is it; I went out the next day, and met the prisoner and the man I met first, but the third man I never saw afterwards - the other man said to me, "Have you got the money? the 5l.?" I said, "I have not;" the prisoner then said, "You can let us have half-of it now, and half another time;" I said, "I can neither let you have half, nor the whole - I have not so much:" the prisoner said, "Come, you can surely let us have half, for I am going out of town this evening, and want to pack up my things;" I told them I would make an appointment to meet them at any house at any hour they thought proper - the prisoner and the other man whispered together, and appointed the Orange Tree public-house, in the New-road, opposite Gower-street, at half-past two o'clock; I told them I might perhaps get some money by that time. I went to Bow-street, and got two officers, and went to the Orange Tree - I waited there some time, but saw no person; I then said, "I think we shall not meet them here - we are more likely to meet them in going home;" the officers said, "You go on, and we will follow you;" I went down a street, and saw the prisoner at a distance, sitting on a step; he got up, and walked a little way, then looked behind him, and ran - I followed him, but he turned down a street, and I lost him - about eight o'clock that night the area-bell rung; I went to the door, and there was the prisoner and another man - they said, "Have you got the money?" I said, "I can do nothing to-night, but I will meet you to-morrow, at the public-house; Why did not you meet me at the public-house?" they said they must have the money, or part of it, that night: I said, "I can give you no money to-night - if you will call at eleven o'clock to-morrow, I will see what I can do for you;" had I had any one in the house I should have taken them then. I wrote a letter immediately to Mr. Wheatley, who sent me word he would pay attention to my letter, but he did not come, and the prisoner was in the square from ten o'clock in the morning till half-past two, when he was taken - we had coals coming in, and the prisoner walked by two or three times, but did not take any notice of me; the officer came about half-past two, but Mr. White took him - he said to Mr. White, "What business have you to take me? Are you an officer? I will make you pay for this;" I said, "Never you mind that - you are my prisoner;" Mr. White went for another officer, but could not get him - Mr. Wheatley and another officer came down the area, and asked if that was the man; I said Yes: they took him to Bow-street, and I appeared in the evening - the prisoner, in my hearing, said, he did not deliver the first letter, but he afterwards said that two gentlemen gave him 6d. to throw it down the area.(The second letter was here read.)
September, 1828.
SIR, - I am surprize at you not cumming to meet me; on the second thought I am not, for I perceived a friend call on you - you was so kind as to let him se my letter, and then go to the street-keeper to come to you; but youto think to frighting us, it is all in vain, for your friend is a person that I can expose, knowing is character so well; and the first time i se him any were, i shall make a publick example on him. Sir, i sent to you for the loan of a small sum of money; and if it was not convenient for you to oblige me, you might a come and spoke to me your selfe, for i should have taken more kind of you; but as you thought proper to expose your selfe, i shall think proper to, for sending for that street-keeper yesterday, is the worst day work you ever did, My friends say that if you do not come to meet us to-night, at the Orange Tree Public House, near the turnpike gate, New-road, opposite Gore-street, at half-past six o'clock to-night, without fail; and please to bring no one with you, for if you do, you will only get yourself expose with all your fellowservants - for we shall acquaint them all, and your master will have a line dropt him; for we shall closely watch your actions to-day, so be on your guard, for my friends you will know nothing of them to look after you: if you can oblige me with the sem of money, you will never hear from us again; if you have any reguard for your selfe and character, you will not hesitate one moment; for knowing the state i found you in, whould hope sent you to prison for a yeare or more, for you know there is five or six whitness i can bring against you with are respectable character, that know you to be guilty of that annaterall crime; so if you can oblige me to-day, come, and you will once more make yourself a h man; for i shall never call on you again, if not - you may expect to se bill up at every corner of the square about you, you name, and where you live, and the situation - as my friend is a printer.
COURT. Q. Were they all total strangers to you? A. Yes, and no conversation took place but what I have stated.

            . I am pot-boy at the Gower Arms public-house, in Store-street. The prisoner and another man came to me, and the other man asked me if Judge Warren was in town - I said, "Yes, he came to town last night;" they then asked, "Is the butler come?" I said, "Do you mean Mr. Goodhall?" they said Yes - I said, "He has come;" the prisoner did not say any thing, but he heard what the other said: I saw them again the next day, and the man in company with the prisoner asked if Mr. Goodhall was at my master's; I said I did not know: I have frequently seen the prisoner and the other walking about Bedford-square - Mr. Warren's house has the name on the door.
WILLIAM WHEATLEY. I am an officer of Bow-street. I went with the witness to the Orange Tree, and waited there four hours, but they did not come; the prisoner came near the house, but before I could get out he ran down the road, and got away - I said we had better go towards the square; I told the witness if he saw any one to take no notice, and I would come up - in going along he saw the prisoner, but he got away; we had before marked some money for him to give them. I received a note in the evening from Mr. Goodhall, but I could not go till half-past two o'clock the next day - I then found the prisoner in custody in the area, I said he was my prisoner - he said, "What about?" I said, "You know what - it is about those letters;" he said, "I did drop one down the area, but two men gave me 6d. to do it." I took him into the butler's pantry.
JOHN WHITE. I am a tailor, and live near Bedford-square. I saw the prisoner on the Friday evening, talking to Mr. Goodhall, and another taller man with him; I saw the prisoner in the square the next day - I went to him, and told him to come with me to the butler; he said he would not - he made great resistance; I seized hold of him, and he tore his shirt; I got him into the area - he told me he would bring an action against me, and offered to fight me; he said he had never been in the house, and then he turned round, and said he had, and he could bring witnesses to prove what he had done.
Prisoner's Defence. I was coming along Bedford-square, and two respectable men stopped me, and said,"Have you any thing to do?" I said No - they said, "I will give you a shilling to take this note to No. 15;" I took it, and they gave me but sixpence, told me to meet them the next day, and they would give me a shilling; I went, but they did not come - I staid half an hour, and was taken.

            . I am an officer. I saw the two prisoners follow this gentleman and another down Old-street: and before they got to Golden-lane, I saw Diacre take this handkerchief and give it to Markes - I sent Cadby, who was with me, to tell the gentleman; and in going along Goswell-street we took the prisoners in company again - we put them into a shop, and this handkerchief was picked up there.

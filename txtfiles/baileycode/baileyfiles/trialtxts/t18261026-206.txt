ANN TARLIZZIC. I am a widow, and live in Golden-lane


. The prisoner is a stranger; on the 3d of October I found this blanket on the landing-place - she had been up-stairs, and taken it from a room, which was not occupied.

            . I am the prosecutrix's grandson; I saw the prisoner sitting on the landing-place, on this blanket; she asked me for some person whom I did not know: I made no answer, and went into a back-room, and shortly after she asked how long the person who lodged in the front room would be; I said, "I could not tell;" she shut the door - I heard her go down soon after; I looked after her, and saw this blanket fall from her on the landing-place; I asked her what business she had to take it - she said she had not taken it, that she kicked it on the stairs, but I had seen her sitting on it; an officer was fetched, and took her.

            . I lodge in the house; I heard a noise, opened the door, and Tippett said, "This woman has taken a blanket."

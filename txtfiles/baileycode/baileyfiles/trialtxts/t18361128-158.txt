WILLIAM WEST
. I live in Carnaby street. The prisoners occupied a ready-furnished room at my house for about three months—Fletcher took the room—they passed as man and wife—but at the office the woman called herself Caroline Dean, and she said she was not his wife—I received information, and examined the room, and missed all these articles.





ROBERT HOWARD
. I produce a tea-pot, which was pledged at my house for 4d.; by a female—my employer took it in—this is the duplicate given for it.





ALFRED DUMBRELL
. I am in the service of Mr. Harris, a pawnbroker in Wardour-street. I have a bolster, blanket, pillow, and two sheets, pledged by a female, I do not know who—I only took part of the things in—these are the duplicated of them.





JAMES DRISCOLL
. I am an officer. Fletcher said it was through distress he was forced to pledge the articles.

Fletcher. It was through distress—they were pledged a different times, as we were in distress.

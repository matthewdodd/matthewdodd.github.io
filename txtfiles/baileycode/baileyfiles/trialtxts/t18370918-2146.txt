DANIEL REEVE
. I live at No. 48, St. John's-street, Clerkenwell, and am in the service of Richard Douglas, a hosier. About six o'clock in the evening on the 8th of September, I heard a twitch at the door—I jumped over the counter and saw the prisoner and another boy running away—I ran and caught the prisoner—he dropped these braces, which are my master's—I gave him into custody—he had got fifteen or twenty doors off.

Prisoner. I did not take them.




GUILTY
.* Aged 17.—


Transported for Seven Years.

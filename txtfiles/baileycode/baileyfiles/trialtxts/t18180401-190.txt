            . I am a feather-maker
. On the 15th of February I was going up Brick-lane


 with my wife, and was stopped by a mob in the road. The prisoner was on my right side - He snatched my seal and key, and ran off. I pursued him; four or five of the gang followed me. I returned, and gave information at the Office - He was taken the next day. I picked him out from among several others,and am sure he is the man. He was exactly under the gas-light.
Prisoner's Defence. I was not there.

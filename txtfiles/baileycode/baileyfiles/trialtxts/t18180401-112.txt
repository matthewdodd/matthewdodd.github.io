            . I am a wine-merchant, and live in the Kent-road; I have a counting-house in the City. On the 20th of August, I owed Mr. Wilson 6l. for coals; I paid a cheque on Messrs. Perting and Co., for that sum, for Mr. Wilson, and took a receipt for it; I paid the money to the person who signed the receipt - I do not know that it was the prisoner.
JOHN WILSON. I am a coal-merchant
; the receipt is the prisoner's hand-writing - He was in my employ, and entrusted to receive money for me; he never paid me the money. On the 8th of December he absconded, I offered a reward for his apprehension - He was taken soon after.
Prisoner's Defence. I went into a public-house after receiving the money-left my pocket-book on the table, and lost it - I meant to return the money.

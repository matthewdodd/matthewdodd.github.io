            , ESQ.
 I was in Piccadilly


 on the 5th of January, about five o'clock in the afternoon, and felt something at my left side pocket - I turned a little to the right, and caught the prisoner passing by me, against the rails of Burlington-house; he said, "What do you stop me for?" a gentleman came up, and said, "You rascal, you have picked that gentleman's pocket;" I then saw my handkerchief on the ground.

            . I saw Mr. Dalton going along - the prisoner was close to him, and drew the handkerchief from his pocket; the prosecutor turned to the right,and pinned him up against the rails; as he was passing the handkerchief was dropped on the ground.

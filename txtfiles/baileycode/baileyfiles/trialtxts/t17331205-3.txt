            . About 10 at Night, I was drinking at the Prosecutor's House, in Walbrook


, when the Prisoner came in, call'd for a Pint of Beer, drank it, and call'd for a Penn'orth more; then he went and set the Door open, look'd out, came in again, and drank; and so he did two or three times, which making me suspicious of him, I stood upon the Watch 'till he went out, when I perceiv'd him have something under his Coat. I follow'd, and stopt him, at the Corner of Walbrook, where he drop'd the Pot, I call'd the Watch, and carry'd hua back to the Prosecutor's House; he begg'd us to consider his Grey-Hairs, and offer'd Money to make it up. 


               Guilty 10 d.

GEORGE CLARKE
 and 



JAMES PRESCOTT
 were indicted for

stealing, on the 
23rd of October, 3 shirts, value 5s., the goods of 



Thomas Hutchins.






SARAH HUTCHINS
. I live at Hayes, in Middlesex. On the 23rd of October, I hung three shirts out to dry, about the middle of the day—one was my husband's, Thomas Hutchins—I had taken the others into wash—I missed them.





JAMES GALE
. These two shirts belong to me—I gave them to Mrs. Hutchins to wash.





EDWARD NASH
. I saw the prisoner Prescott on that ay—he asked me the road to Harrow—I said he had come past the lane—Clarke came up directly afterwards, and I directed them—in a short time, Mrs. Hutchins came to me, and in consequence of what she said, I went after the prisoners, and Drink water had them in custody.






GEORGE DRINKWATER
. In consequence of information, I got my horse and cart, and overtook the prisoners—I rode by them both—they looked very hard at me—I drove about 300 yards past them, then got out and met them—I saw Clarke throw the bundle down, and run away—I followed and collared him—Prescott did not run away—I said to Clarke," You have got three shirts belonging to Mrs. Hutchins "—he said they belonged to the man in the path, meaning Prescott—Prescott said, "You know they are not mine "—he then said, "Well, I found them in a ditch."

Cross-examined by
MR. MAGUIRE. Q. If Prescott had been disposed to run away, might he not have done so? A. I do not think he could—there were several men about.

Clarke's Defence. I had been living in service at Andover—I then got a situation at a barrister's, and I was going to live with him on the 3rd of next month.

CLARKE—

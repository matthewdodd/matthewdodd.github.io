 was indicted

for stealing, on the

FRANCES LUCRETIA SIMMONDS
. I am the wife of Samuel Simmonds, and live in George-street, Snow-hill. About eight o'clock on Sunday evening, the 10th of March, I was walking in the Strand with Susannah Tasker—I had my baby in my arms and my reticule in my hand, containing a pocket handkerchief—I saw the prisoner, with two more boys, and two girls at the corner of Wellington-street—they followed us to King's College—the prisoner then came before me, and held me back with his right hand while he snatched at my bag with his left—he got it from me, and ran away—my friend ran after him, and caught him—I do not know where the other four were—I had seen them behind me two or three minutes before—the prisoner was brought back in three or four minutes—this is my bag and hand-kerchief—(looking at them.)





SUSANNAH TASKER
. I live in Brunswick-street. I was with the prosecutrix, and saw the prisoner snatch the bag from her—I pursued him to Newcastle-street, crying "Stop thief"—the policeman followed, and caught him—he threw the bag away—I had seen the others with him just before.






WILLIAM HOWARD
 (police-constable F 94.) I was in Newcastle-street, and saw the witness following the prisoner—I pursued him to Holywell-street, and there took him—I saw the bag drop, but did not see him drop it.

Prisoner's Defence. I work for Mr. Hilliyard, and was out delivering medicines—on coming along the Strand I heard a cry of "Stop thief," and the officer picked me out among the crowd—I had not been twenty minutes from Lord Glenelg's when I was taken.




GUILTY
. † Aged 14.—


Transported for Ten Tears—to the Convict Ship.

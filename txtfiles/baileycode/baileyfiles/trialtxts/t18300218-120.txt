            . I am a Police-constable. On the 18th of February, between eight and nine o'clock at night, I was on duty in the Strand


, near the house of Mr. Middleton; I saw the prisoner and two others watching about for twenty minutes or half an hour, looking into different shops - the prisoner opened Mr. Middleton's shop door, put his hand in, and took a handkerchief; I went and took him into custody as he was running across the road.
Prisoner. He says he saw me take it. I saw a person come from the shop and drop it - I picked it up; he said,"What have you there?" I said a handkerchief; he said,"What shop have you been robbing?" I said None - he took me to two or three shops, and asked if they had lost the property. Witness. A gentleman stood at his door, next door but one to Mr. Middleton, and as I went by I asked him if he had lost any thing, as I had seen him go to several shops; the other two had separated from him, when I disturbed them from another shop.

            . I am in the employ of Mr. Thomas Middleton. We have handkerchiefs of this pattern, and missed one, two or three minutes before the prisoner was brought in.
Prisoner's Defence. He did not know which shop it came from, and at the office he brought a man who had been convicted of perjury to swear the same thing.

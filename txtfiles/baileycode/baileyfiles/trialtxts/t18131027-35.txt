            . I found this piece of cloth in the prisoner's breeches, one part; and the other under his braces and under his waistcoat, buttoned over: it was so concealed.

            . I was in the employ of Mr. Maberley. I am inspector of the cloth; I prepare it for the tailors. This was used for waistbands of breeches; here is my hand-writing upon it, for waistbands. That is my writing; it is wrote with red chalk.
MR. STEVENS. The prisoner was one of the cutter
s in the employ of Mr. Maberley. The value of that cloth is three shillings and sixpence.
Q. What is the value of all the cloth you found taken that night - A. Twenty pound.
The prisoner said nothing in his defence; called one witness, who gave him a good character.

It appear'd by the Evidence, that there being no body in the Prosecutor's Shop, the Prisoner came in, and took the Cloth off from a Shelf, and went away with it; but being seen by one of the Family that was at work in the Kitchin, who came out and cry'd, Stop Thief, he was Stopp'd as he was running along Red-Lion-street, and the Cloth drop'd from him. The Fact being plainly prov'd, the Jury found him

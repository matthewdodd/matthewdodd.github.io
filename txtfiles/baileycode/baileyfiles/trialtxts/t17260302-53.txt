            , was indicted for 


               privately stealing 35 s.
             the Money of Will Pew.


                     William 
                     Pew 
                  




                
             thus depos'd. I went in by myself, to drink at the Bull and Butcher in Long-lane


. I saw the Prisoner up and down the House, and thought she was one that belong'd to it. At last she came and sat down by me, and ask'd me if I would not drink to her: I told her yes, and while I was drinking, she thrust her Hand into my Pocket, and took out my Money, and thrust it into her Bosom, I catch'd hold of her Hand, but she got away, and run to the Woman of the House. I call'd the Watch, and we search'd her, and found only 6 Shillings upon her, one of which was in her Shoe. The Prisoner said in her Defence, that the Prosecutor was drunk, and pickt her up, and carry'd her into that Ale-House, but that she never saw any of his Money, and tho'd they search'd her from top to bottom, they could find nothing about her, but what was her own, and therefore she thought it very hard that the Court did not Order the Constable to return her the Six Shillings that he took from her, 


               Guilty 10 d.

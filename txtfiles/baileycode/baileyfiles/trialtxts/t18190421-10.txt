            , who is a shoemaker

. On the 2d of March, about eleven o'clock in the morning, the prisoners came to buy a pair of shoes for Thompson; while I was attending to 
               Thompson
             I saw Guyer take two pair off the shelf, and put one pair into his pocket; he then said,
"We will go into the lane below, and see if we can get a second-hand pair." I told my master, and he sent for an officer, who came as Thompson was trying his shoe on - he stopped them as they were going out, and found the shoes in Guyer's pocket.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
THOMPSON'S Defence. I was trying a pair. I did not take them.

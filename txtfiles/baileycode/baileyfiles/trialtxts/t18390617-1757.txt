MARY CHRISTOPHER
. I live with my father, James Christopher, of George-street, Foley-place. In the evening, on the 24th of May, I was

sitting in the front-parlour—I heard a noise in the passage, as if somebody was walking—I went out, and saw the back of a woman making her escape from the passage—I then missed the things, which had been hanging in the passage to dry—I followed, and saw two gentlemen standing next door—I told them, and they went after her with me—she was running, she dropped them on the road—I only saw her back—the things were picked up, and I took them up going back—I had seen them two minutes before—these are them.

Prisoner. I did not take them.





JAMES BELL
. I live about five minutes' walk from the prosecutor's—I was passing the door, and the prisoner came out—I saw the clothes in her arm—the witness came and said, "Please to stop that woman"—Iran after her, and she dropped these in Middleton-buildings—she went on, I caught her.





THOMAS MEAD
. I am a policeman. I took the prisoner and have the things.





CORNELIUS SAVORY
. I am a policeman. I have a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—I was present when she was tried—the prisoner is the person.

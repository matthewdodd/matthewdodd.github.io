JOHN BOSBURY
. I live in White Lion-street, Chelsea. A few minutes before eight o'clock at night, on the 27th of November, I saw the three prisoners at my door—they walked up the street—I was going that way,

and directly they got to the corner, they ran—I had suspicions, and ran some distance, then came back, and under the window next to my door, I saw a basket—I got a light and found this basket with the damper and iron, which had been taken out of my cellar—I left it there, and looked for a policeman-in about a quarter of an hour all the three prisoners came down the street together—they loitered about, and Tunny said to Neale, "You fool, no one will see you, go for it"—they all went up the street again-in about ten minutes all three came back again-Neale then went and fetched it half-way across the road—I pounced and caught him—the officer took Tunny -Worrell escaped then, but was taken afterwards.





BENJAMIN POOL
 (police-constable B 143.) I was with the prosecutor, what he has said is true.

Worrell's Defence. We were looking into a picture shop, and saw this basket under the window—we went away, and came back, and Neale said he would have it, it might be useful—he went to get it, and the prosecutor took him.





JOHN BOSBURY

re-examined. The basket is not mine-Neale's mother has been and claimed it as her basket—they must have lifted up the cellar flap, and one held it up, while the others gone in and got the iron out.

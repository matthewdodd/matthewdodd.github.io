            . I am a Bow-street patrol. On Wednesday, the 8th of February, about two or three o'clock in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner in company with another person, in High-street, St. Giles's


 - there was a gentleman passing them, and this is his handkerchief; the prisoner crossed over the way - took the handkerchief from the gentleman, and shoved it up his back - he afterwards ran away, and threw down the handkerchief, which my partner picked up - I could not find out who the gentleman was, for he would not give his name or address.

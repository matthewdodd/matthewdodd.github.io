             sworn.
I know some lead was lost, the property of which was Lord Southampton's; it was missed the 23d of July, and found on that day, I did not see it till the Monday; I live in my Lord's rents, and am his carpenter.


                  WILLIAM
                   WILSON
               



             sworn.
I am a labouring-man? I took the prisoner at the foot of Highgate-hill, on Thursday morning, the 23d of July, between seven and eight; they were sittingon the sack on one side of the road; I have sawn them before, but not to have an acknowledgment of them; we had a mistrust of them; I was by myself when I first saw them; they got up, and Crosdale took the sack on his shoulder; I laid hold of the sack with one hand, and the man with the other; and I asked him what he had got? and he told me lead; he said he found it; and I asked him where? and he said in some lane; I took him to the constable, and the property was turned out; it was lead: the next witness apprehended the other prisoner, Leason; they made no resistance; they were sitting close together when I first saw them; they were talking together.
Prisoner Leason. Was not I on the footh path, fifty or sixty yards before the other? - He helped the other up with the sack, and then he went off.

                   BATEMAN
               



             sworn.
On the 23d of July, the prisoners were brought to my house; and as I was taking Leason to Bow-street on the same morning, I observed him put his hand to his pocket, to throw something away; and I found it was some pieces of lead; and they were taken out at Bow-street; and this knife (a clasp knife) from his pocket: the lead is here that was in the sack.


                  JOSEPH
                   IMPEY
               



             sworn.
I was standing at my shop door, the bottom of Highgate-hill; I saw Crosdale come by with the sack on his shoulders, and Leason about ten yards before; they went and sat down at the end of my garden on some pipes; they sat together; Crosdale sat down first, and Leason, who was first, came back and sat by him; then they got up, and Leason helped Crosdale up with the lead, and walked on before; I took Leason to a Constable.
(The lead deposed to by

            . It fits to the top of the little dwelling-house, belonging to the farm; it fitted exactly to the place, nail-holes and all; one piece I knew at Bow-street, and wrote my name on it; this piece which has a smoke hole, was found in Leason's pocket; the lead was on it on the Tuesday; I saw it all safe then; the lead was fastened with nails, and has been ripped.

             sworn.
The prisoner Crosdale made hay for me last summer, within a few days before the lead was gone.
PRISONER CROSDALE's DEFENCE.
On the 21st and 22d, I was looking for hay work; and coming down Highgate, I saw this sack laying close beside the ditch, and put it on my back, and brought it towards town; I rested, and this fellow prisoner came past, and I asked him to help me up; and two or three bits fell out of the sack, and I gave them to him, to get him some beer, and he put them in his pocket: when I was taken, I said I found it.
PRISONER LEASON's DEFENCE.
This man was resting a load, and he asked me to assist him up with it; and two or three bits came out, and he gave them to me.
Court to Wilson. Did you see any bits of lead fall out of the sack? - No.

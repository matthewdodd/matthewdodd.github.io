                   JONES
               



             sworn.
I am servant to lady Bamfylde. On the 11th of December the prisoner 
               
                  Elizabeth
                   Smith
               



             came to our house, and desired me to go up stairs to my lady, and ask her for a letter to admit her into an hospital; she appeared to be very ill; my lady sent 
               
                  Martin
               


             the butler down with the message; when I came down the woman was gone.


                  THOMAS
                   MARTIN
               



             sworn.
I was up stairs when the prisoner 
               
                  Elizabeth
                   Smith
               



             came to our house: my lady Bamfylde sent me down to tell her she could not get her any letter of recommendation; I thought she looked ill and was an object of charity; I directed her to another lady to get a letter of recommendation to the hospital: about three in the afternoon I went to the cupboard and missed the spoons; then I suspected that she had taken them: I went to Sir 
               
                  John
                   Fielding
               



            's and found 
               
                  Robert
                   Smith
               



             there, who was stopped offering them to pawn; I swore to the spoons; the justice asked him if he had a wife, he said he had: I told the justice I should know the woman again if I saw her; I went with some of Sir John's men to the prisoner's lodging, she was not at home, we staid about a quarter of an hour, and she came in: one of Sir John's men let her in, and said how do you do, Mrs. Smith? she seemed confused, said her name was not Smith, and went into the yard; I went to look at her, and knew her again as soon as I saw her; I charged her with stealing the spoons, and told her her husband was in custody, but she denied it.


                  RICHARD
                   MIRTHWAITE
               



             sworn.
I am a pawnbroker in Oxford-road: on the 11th of December the prisoner 
               
                  Elizabeth
                   Smith
               



            , I think, brought one of these spoons, and I lent her eight shillings upon it; about two hours after, just as candles were lighted, the other prisoner, Robert, brought two more; observing the marks were erased, I suspected they were not honestly come by, he said his wife had left one before; I looked at it and saw it was one of the same.
[The spoons were produced in Court, and Martin deposed that they were the property of lady Bamfylde.]


                  CHARLES
                   JEALOUS
               



             sworn.
I am one of Sir 
               
                  John
                   Fielding
               



            's men: 
               
                  Robert
                   Smith
               



             was stopped with the spoons and brought to Sir John's; on his examination he said he lived in Gouge-court, Tottenham-court-road: Martin came to Sir John's to lay an information; he said he should know the woman again; I went with him to the prisoner's lodging, she was not at home; I let her in, soon after she went into the necessary; I followed her, and desired her to come out, and searched her, but found nothing upon her; I told her she had better tell me where the rest of the spoons were, for three of them were stopped and her husband was in custody; she fell a crying, and said they were there, pointing to a dust-hole; I found these three spoons there (producing them).
[They were deposed to by Martin.]

                   SMITH
               



            's DEFENCE.
I did not steal the spoons; please to ask the pawnbroker if he will swear I pawned one of them.
MIRTHWAITE. I am not positive to her person, I believe it was her; I am positive to the man.

            's DEFENCE.
I have nothing at all to say.

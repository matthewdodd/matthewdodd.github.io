            . I live in Fetherstone buildings; Holborn; I lost a silver watch, and it was found again at Spencer's a pawnbroker's, the woman that pawned it informed me where it was; the prisoner had been in my house the day it was lost, which was last Tuesday; upon which I suspected him and took him up, and before the justice he owned that he took it, and sent

             with it to pawn it for a guinea. I have employed him fourteen years, and never knew him guilty of any thing before this.

            . The prisoner employed me to pawn this watch, and I carried it and pawned it at Mr. Spencer's in Holborn for a guinea, and delivered it to him. I was with him before the justice, and heard him own he stole it.
Diana Butler. I am servant to the prosecutor. The watch was hanging upon a nail in the kitchen; the prisoner was employed by my master, and was in and cut there; I did not see him take it, but missed it soon after he was gone out, which was about half an hour after four o'clock.

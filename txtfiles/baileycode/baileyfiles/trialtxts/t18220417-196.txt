            . I live in Globe-street, Bethnal-green


. In February, 1821, the prisoner took a furnished room of me, at 4 s. a week, and left in May, without notice. He owed me 5 l. 15 s., money lent. I went into his room, and missed the sheet and curtains. I met him in March last, and asked what he had done with my property; he denied it. I gave him in charge; he then said he meant to bring them back.
JOSEPH REEVES. I am an officer. I took him in charge in a public-house; he immediately ran out, I followed and secured him. He said he would return them. He would not tell where he lived. I found a letter on him directed to Legg-alley; I found his wife there, and she gave me two duplicates.

            . On the 29th of July, I observed the prisoner, with others, and especially one Germain. who had an adze in his hand, pretending to be a cooper, but he was no cooper, I think the prisoner had an adze also, and they were busy about the tobacco hogshead on the key. I saw the prisoner pull out tobacco, and put it into his pocket; I went and charged him with it; he was very abusive, and shov'd me about, and swore he would take tobacco, pretending to have a right so to do. I, with a great deal of difficulty, searched him, and found a pound of tobacco upon him; he, with the others, threw some away, and his companion Germain threatened me, if I took the prisoner in custody. I know no business they had on the key, except that of pilfering, which I had before observed several times.
Prisoner's Defence.
I was there, heading up a hogshead: I asked the man for a chew of tobacco, and he gave me that tobacco, and when Mr. Burch had me in custody, that man came and told him he gave me that tobacco.
Burch. That is not true.

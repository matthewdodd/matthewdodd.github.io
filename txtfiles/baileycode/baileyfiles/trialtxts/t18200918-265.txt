            . I am a milkman
, and live in Tower-street, Westminster-road. On the 31st of August, about half-past eleven o'clock in the morning, I was in Parliament-street


, her Majesty was coming past; I was pressed and pinioned. I put my hands down, missed my watch, and found the prisoner in custody. My watch was produced.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

            . I am an officer. I saw the prisoner in company with two others, whom I knew before. I watched them from the corner of Parliament-street, they attempted to take every gentleman's watch who came near them. I saw the other two get on each side of Jones, the prisoner stood in front, and drew his watch out; I seized him and took it from him as he was putting it into his pocket. About forty thieves surrounded us, and if it had not been for the Bow-street officers we could not have kept him. I found a handkerchief on him, which he said was marked, but it was not.

JOHN WOOD
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
15th of August, 1 handkerchief, value 4s., the goods of 



Charles Castell, from his person; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






CHARLES CASTELL
. On the 15th of August I went to Lee races with my family—I felt something at the back of my coat, and turned momentarily—there were a number of persons round me, but I saw the prisoner close behind me—I said, "You have stolen my handkerchief"—he said, "I have not got it"—I looked at him very earnestly, and the handkerchief was partly under his feet—I did not see it in his hand, but the people were so thick that he could not get away—I shoved him away off the handkerchief, and said, "Is there no officer here?"—one came up and took him—the prisoner had stood close behind me—I believe it was him, and him alone, that took it—the people were so thick that I could not move scarcely—it could not have fallen out, as my pocket is inside—I felt the tag, and turned immediately.





GEORGE BEASOR
. (police-constable R 110.) I was called, and took the prisoner.

Prisoner's Defence. I stood there—a constable was pushing this gentleman about—he said, "Don't strike me, I am a gentleman"—he turned, and saw his handkerchief on the ground—he asked the constable to take me—he would have nothing to do with roe, and then he called mother, and said, "This boy stole my handkerchief;" and then he followed him a little way, and he said, "I think that is the boy"—I never took it—it was not under my feet—I saw him pick it up behind me.

MR. CASTELL. re-examined. No, I pushed him off it to get it—he was Partially upon it.





GEORGE GOOD
. (police-constable R 114.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got at Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the boy.




GUILTY

Transported for Ten Years.—Convict Ship.

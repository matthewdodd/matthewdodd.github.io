SUSAN RAWLINSON
. I am the wife of William Rawlinson—I kept a stall at Greenwich-fair. On the 3rd of April, I lost a rose-wood box, with an ink-glass, sealing-wax, and wafers in it—this is it.





ROBERT BRODIE
 (police-constable L 132.) I was at the fair, and saw the prisoner in company with two thieves—the prisoner had an apron on—he sidled up to the prosecutor's stall, took the box, and put it under his apron—I stopped him with it—he said he did not take it, the other boys did.

            . I lodge at the Castle public-house, in Smallborough Green; I and my fellow servant

, Jaques, slept in one room there; we belong to one of the coaches. I got up in the morning, and went to look after the horses, and when I returned to the bed room, I missed my property.

                  JAQUES
               



            . I slept in the same room with Gambling; we both got up at six o'clock to look after our horses; about half an hour after that, I saw the prisoner running from the house; I immediately ran up to the bed room, and saw my clothes gone. I took a horse out of the stable, and pursued him; I took him near the Isleworth-road; I found one waistcoat and a jacket on his back, and a bundle of clothes under his arm.

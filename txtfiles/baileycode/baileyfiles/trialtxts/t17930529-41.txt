; I am a house keeper; I let lodgings to Mrs. Beane, she came in that name to me, as the wife of the prisoner, she came and paid earnest, and he paid the week's money; she came the 2d of March last, she took the chamber; we have only one room to let, they took it furnished, they came the same day they took it, they were to give 3 s. a week, and he paid the half crown to make up the 3 s. when the week was up, they had all the things let with the room mentioned in the indictment; they stayed three weeks; they went away the 23d of March and took the things away with them; I was in bed and my wife too; it was between five and six in the morning; I am a cooper

Prisoner. What name did the woman come in? - She said her name was Beane.
Court. Who paid the fortnight? - He paid the one week; and they ran away before the other week was due; here are some things that were found.

             sworn.
I was present when the lodgings were let, and my husband too, we were both in the room; I am deaf.
Q. Could you hear what passed? - Nothing particular; she put down the six-pence; I was there when the man and woman came; says he, I like the apartment very well; and I said to her, I am very glad your husband approves of what you have done; they continued three weeks, and went away the day the the rent was due; I went after them that morning, and I missed the things after breakfast about ten o'clock, the 23d of March; she had locked my husband and I in; I found these here things in Bunhill-row, in Twister's-alley, and the prisoner was laying on the outside of a mattrass, stuffed with straw; it is part of a mattrass, and part is gone; they have taken the inside out: I know it to be part of my mattrass, because I made part of it and I stuffed it with fine flocks; I saw it as he lay, and when he got up I said, that is my mattrass; I know these bellows, I have had them twenty years; here is a quilt which was pledged in the name of

            ; nothing else was found in Twister's-alley but the bellows and mattrass, the woman is here who keeps the house.
Prisoner. I would ask whether that cloth was not torn off from some other which it was before joined to in the room? - Yes, the officer took a piece off.

             were in the room; the prosecutrix said it was part of her mattrass, and there were her bellows; I told the prisoner he must dress himself and go with me; I found these duplicates, but they are nothing to the property the people lost; I know nothing about the quilt.

             sworn.
I am a pawnbroker, I live the corner of Brown's-lane, Spitalfields; the quilt was pawned the 12th of March for two shillings, it was not me that took it in; I cannot tell who pawned it; the person who took it in is very ill of a fever, and I see from him it is pawned in the name of

             sworn.
How old are you? - I am twenty nine the 6th of June; I lived with the prisoner two years and a half, and whatever we did we meant to get out as soon as he got work; I used to work at the silk business; our trade is so very bad we did it out of distress.
Court. Young woman, mind you are upon your oath; let nothing tempt you to take a false oath; you know very well you are liable to punishment if you speak falsely, not only here but hereafter. Now with that caution to you, what do you know of this transaction? - I made away with nothing but what he knows of; we had it between us, he desired me to pledge the quilt, and he said when we had work he would get it again.
Prisoner. I am really drawn into this affair by that woman, that Mrs. Davis can prove where we lived.

             sworn.
They took a room of me in Twister's-alley; the woman came and she offered me three pence earnest; I thought she was a poor woman, and I told her to keep the money till the week was up, and they paid me duly and truly; I asked her if she was a married woman? she said she was lawfully married; I let a man in one night, he was a little man, I think they came on Wednesday the 24th of March, but I cannot be positive.
Q. Do you mean to say then that he was not taken away the very next day, after he came to your lodgings? - No the next day, it was turned three weeks or a month.
Court to Armstrong. What day did you go to this place? - Wednesday the 24th of April.
Court to Mrs. Davis. Did you and Armstrong come there? - I did not, I cannot swear to the man, but I can to the woman; I don't know that I see him but once.
Prisoner. I unfortunately lived and cohabited with this here woman, and I believe, who has been the perpetrator of the act, and to screen herself has entirely laid it on me: I know no more of Bunyan's things nor never handled any thing of them, or took any thing out of the room; I met that woman in the street on the 2d of March; she told me she lived in Corbert's-court; did not know Mr. or Mrs. Bunyan before she said if I would come and be with her as usual she would be glad; accordingly I went with her, she took me up stairs into the chamber and walked round the room, after some few words passed I said, I suppose these things to be none of your own; she said they were not, but part were and part were Mr. Bunyan's; I then asked her what she paid a week rent for the room? she told me half a crown; on Saturday night following she asked me for the money, she said she had no money to pay her rent; I asked her what the rent was? she said, three shillings; I thought she wanted to impose upon me to get the six-pence for herself. I am very sorry, my lord, if the law allows by my paying for that week's rent to be brought into a scrape for what is done; I went to Mrs. Bunyan's and paid the two shillings and six-pence, little thought what I was to come to through that, I stayed there the whole three weeks; in the course of this time I found one morning a sheet pawned off my bed, I said to 
               
                  Jane
                   Gubbins
               



            , that I thought she had done very wrong, for that propertywas not her own, but Mrs. Bunyan's, and if she wanted money it was better to pawn her own things; she answered me, it was no concern of mine, and without she liked it I should not be there for she was the mistress of the room, and I was not the master. Another time I came home in the day time I missed a saucepan, I asked her what she had done with it? I said, I hoped she had not pawned the saucepan; she said, no, Mrs. Bunyan had got it down stairs for her own use. Another time I found a different quilt on the bed to what I saw at first, I was then told that Mrs. Bunyan had changed it; I told her I did not chuse to stay with her any longer, and then I found out this quilt she had pawned; I then gave her the money to fetch it out again, and insisted on her fetching it home; she went out and when she returned she brought a quilt, which I thought was the same that she had first when I came away, I did not know whether she meant to stay there or not, she told me she should stay, and I sees no more of her for five or six days, when I was accidently going through the street and she called after me, she then told me that she had got a room in Twister's-alley and had left Mr. Bunyan's; I then went home with her into Twister's-alley. On the 24th of April Mr. Armstrong and Mrs. Bunyan came up into the room, as soon as Mrs. Bunyan came up she took up a pair of bellows, she said they were her property; I never carried them to the place where they were, nor was I there till after the bellows were there; the things which Mrs. Bunyan calls her mattrass was joined to another piece which we made use of for a bed, being stuffed with straw; I was then carried before a magistrate, when I came there 
               
                  Jane
                   Gubbins
               



             said that if in case they would forgive her she was willing to tell the truth; I little thought that the truth was to lay a falsity on me, when we came to the justice's the justice heard what she had to say, she began to tell a story that I got up in the morning on the 23d of March, and that I packed up the bed and bedding and every article mentioned in the indictment; the magistrate asked her how many times I came backward and forwards? she said I carried it all away at once; the magistrate said it was impossible to carry all away at once; they then asked her where they were carried to? she said to a house in Long-alley: they asked her whether she should know the house? she said she should. Mr. Armstrong took her down to Long-alley, and then she said that she could not find out the house where they were carried to; I was then committed till the Saturday following, when I was carried up for other examinations, and 
               
                  Jane
                   Gubbins
               



             told a different story to what she did at first, she then said, instead of saying that I carried the things to Long-alley, there was a deal of conversation passed between her and Mr. Armstrong in the office; Mr. Armstrong is present and I hope will give an account of what passed; I then was committed here to take my trial; in the course of which time a man whom I have subpoenaed on my trial came to me in Newgate, and told me that

             had applied to him with some duplicates of some things, for him to fetch out of pawn for her, and he was apprehensive they were belonging to the lodgings; as such I got a friend of mine to go to the pawnbrokers to see if such and such things were there, and then I told him to go and acquaint Mr. and Mrs. Bunyan; he returned to me and said that he had been to the pawnbrokers and that the pawnbroker had produced the things, and the pawnbrokers declared that they knew nothing of me, but they were brought by a woman whom they shouldknow again if they saw her; I then thought when I had found out this matter that this woman had been guilty of making away with this property unbeknown to me, and that she had swore falsely, by laying the matter on me; I had some hopes that I should clear the point and prove to this honourable court that I am innocent of the matter; I have subpoenaed

             in a private room at the office, and whether you did not tell her what words to say? - I had orders before the magistrate to take her into a private room to ask her if she would be a witness, and I did so.

                  , on the 1st of January

            . I keep a haberdasher's shop
; I live in Old Gravel-lane


; I am servant to a Leather-seller
 in Newgate-street: my wife attends the shop. On the 1st of January between six and eight at night, as my wife informs me, a pane of glass was broke in our shop window; my wife is not here; I was at Newgate-street, at my master's; I returned home at eight o'clock; when I came home I found a pane of glass broke; I left it whole at six o'clock in the morning; there were some stockings and a cloak missing. Some men brought Wigmore to my house, and desired me to go to Sir 
               
                  John
                   Fielding
               



            's; there I saw eight pair of stockings, some of which I can positively swear to; I believe all to be mine; I will not swear to the whole, but two pair I am sure are my property; I have had them in my shop ever since I kept shop, which is about half a year.

            . I am an old-clothes-man; I live near Devonshire-square. The day before New Year's Day, Butcher came to me, and asked me where I lived, and whether I would buy any clothes of him; I told him I would accordingly the next day, which was Saturday, all the prisoners came to me, about eight or nine at night, and brought two bundles of stockings, and some shoes, which have nothing to do with this indictment, and asked four pounds; I bid them three pounds; they agreed to sell them for that sum. I suspected they were not honestly come by; I said I had no money by me, but I would go to a friend and get the money for them; I went accordingly to the 
               
                  Brown
                   Bear
               



             , in Bow-street, opposite Sir 
               
                  John
                   Fielding
               



            's, and told his people I had some men at my apartment that I suspected; Mr. Clarke and others came with me; we took the prisoners and brought them before Sir 
               
                  John
                   Fieldings
               



             and these stockings were part of what they brought with them.
Q. from Sheene. Was I there or not?
Barnard. No; he stood down by the steps; he did not come up to me but was with them as much as the others.

            . I was at the 
               
                  Brown
                   Bear
               



             this evening; we went to Barnard's house by his request, and found Butcher there; about three minutes after Trusty came in likewise; I asked him how he came there; he said he had been with one 
               
                  Bill
                   Sheene
               



             at the alehouse; but they came up together so soon that I believe they met him at the bottom of the stairs; I searched Sheene and took that knife out of his pocket; Wigmore, the evidence, surrendered on Monday morning, and then the whole story came out.
- Wigmore. On New Year's Day, Thursday, Butcher, Gold, and myself, went out with intention to do the first robbery that offered; we went to another house, after which we went on to Gravel-lane, to the present prosecutor's, and went to the window; Butcher said here is some stockings, I fancy they will come; I do not know whether the window was broke at that time or not, but as I stood at a distance, Trusty and Butcher went to get them; I and Sheene stood at some distance; I heard some kind of cracking of glass as I suppose, but whether it was by breaking the window, or drawing the stockings, it being ready broke, I cannot be positive; they brought several pair of stockings and gave them to Sheene and me; Butcher went to this Jew in order to sell them; they did not come so soon as I expected; I went there and saw these three men coming hand-cuffed, then I ran away.
Butcher called five witnesses, Sheene one, and Trusty three, who gave them good characters.




               All three guilty of stealing the goods, but not guilty of breaking and entering the dwelling house
            .

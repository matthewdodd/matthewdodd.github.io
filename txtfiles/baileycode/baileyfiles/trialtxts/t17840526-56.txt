                   HILL
               



             sworn.
I am wife of Luke Hill, the prosecutor, he lives in White Hart Yard; on the 31st of May 1783, the prisoner came to me and asked me to oblige him with four or five guineas worth of change; he said he was the foreman of Mr. Mortimer's shop, who is a scowerer; he said if I could oblige him with that he would be a customer; I told him where they had their beer they would have the change; I asked him where his gold was; says he, if that is all you want, I will fetch it; he went out and staid about three-quarters of an hour, and asked if the change was ready; I counted him two half guineas, and three guineas worth of silver, and he took and swept it into his hat; then he asked me if I could oblige him with other two half guineas, I told him I did not know that I could, I went up stairs to fetch them, he met me at the bottom of the stairs, and took them from me, and run through the tap room, and the door opening and shutting I lost sight of him.
Court. Did he never give you the gold in change? - No, he ran away through the tap room.
Had you ever known any thing of this man before? - No, never saw him before.
You had great faith in trusting him so far; how came you to do that? - I had no thoughts of any body behaving so, I never heard of such a thing in my life.
Are you sure the prisoner is the person? - Yes I am.
Prisoner. I never saw the woman in my life to my knowledge, it does not stand to reason that I should have waited for the two half guineas, but I should certainly have gone off with the four guineas worth of change; I was at Hallifax in Yorkshire at the time.
Jury to Prosecutrix. Was he foreman to that man he said he was? - No.

                   CROSS
               



             sworn.
I was in the house and saw the prisoner; a man came into Mrs. Hill's house and asked for four guineas worth of silver.
Had you ever seen the prisoner before? - No, I never saw him before.
Nor between that time and this? - No.
And will you positively swear that is the man? - Yes.
Did you hear any conversation pass between Mrs. Hill and the prisoner? - She made some scruple in letting him have the change, and she asked me if I knew the person where he came from, he said it was not above one hundred yards from where he lived, she then said she would let him have it, he came the second time, he said we were in the living way, we were eating our suppers, he came round her, I saw him put his hand up and take something from her, and I saw him go to meet her at the bottom of the stairs, and I saw him after at the Rotation Office.
PRISONER's DEFENCE.
My Lord, I have nothing to say, any further than this, I know nothing about it, nor her house, nor where she lives; I should hardly have waited in the house while she went up stairs for two more half guineas, but have gone off with the four guineas.
What is your way of livelihood? - I am a scowerer and dyer; I never lived with Mr. Mortimer, I never knew him; I have been in the brokering business for some time, and when I was out of that, I used to be put in possession at times, I have people to my character, I was in Hallifax, but I have nobody to prove that here.
The prisoner called four witnesses, who all gave him a very good character.
Court. Gentlemen of the Jury, the account Mrs. Hill gives is a very strange story indeed, and it is very extraordinary that the prisoner, as he says, should not be content with four guineas, but should wait for one more; Mrs. Cross was in the house at the time, and they both swear positively to the person of the prisoner, and yet they say they never saw him before in their lives: if there was no testimony on the part of the defendant, I should think this evidence too slight to convict him, but much more so when opposed by so many respectable witnesses.

            ; on the 29th of April, I gave two guineas and a half to the prisoner at the bar, he came to me to desire me to send two pots of beer to the silk dyer's and scowerer's in the Strand, and desired to know if I could supply them with change, as they were going to change the house where they dealt, and they should be exceeding good customers; he desired me to send as much change with the beer as I could possibly spare to pay their men; I supposed him to be a journeyman, I sent a man with him that was to bring the two guineas and a half back, and the money for the beer, I gave the change into the prisoner's hand.

             sworn.
I went into the prosecutor's just as the prisoner had received two guineas worth of change, her husband came in with me, and she got some more silver of him, and she desired me to go over with the prisoner and to take the two pots of beer and the two guineas and a half, I went along with him out of the back door to the top of Essex-street, and crossing the Strand, there were some coaches that interrupted us, and I stepped up to the door, and having one pot of beer in each hand, I missed him, and I could not get sight of him again then, but I found him the next morning; I am sure the prisoner is the same man.
PRISONER's DEFENCE.
I gave him two guineas again, and he promised to release me if I would give him the other half guinea.

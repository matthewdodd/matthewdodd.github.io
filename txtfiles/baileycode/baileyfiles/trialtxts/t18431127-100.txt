JOSEPH CORDERY
 was again indicted

 for stealing 4 wooden boards, value 2s. 6d., the goods of 



John Cutts; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






THOMAS BUCKLE
. I am in the service of John Cutts. On Saturday night, the 28th of Oct., I had the boards now produced safe on my master's premises—they are my master's, and were in a ground where we were building a house, at New Hampton—I missed them on Monday morning—I left them close in a corner about five o'clock on Saturday night, and set some doors before them.





BENJAMIN COLLINS
 (police-constable V 271) I went to the prisoner's house about nine o'clock on the 31st of Oct., and found these boards—he did not say anything about them.

Prisoner's Defence. I was going home from a public-house on Sunday, and saw the boards lying in a ditch; I took them home.





CHARLES CHURCHILL
 (police-sergeant V 29.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 39.—


Transported for Seven Years.

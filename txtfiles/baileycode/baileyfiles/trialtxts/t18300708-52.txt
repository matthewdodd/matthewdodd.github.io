MARGARET CRAWLEY. I am a widow
. On the 2nd of June I lost a cloak, a parasol, and a shawl, from my front parlour in Crown-street, St. Giles'


 - I did not see them taken; I went over the way for half a pint of beer, and the young woman who gave me the beer saw the prisoner - she ran and took the articles from him: these are them - they are mine.

MARY STACEY. I saw the prisoner go cut of the prosecutrix's house with these things - I pursued, and saw him stopped in five or ten minutes; these are the things I took from him.

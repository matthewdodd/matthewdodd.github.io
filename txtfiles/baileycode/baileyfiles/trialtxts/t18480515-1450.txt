WILLIAM JOHNS.
 I live at Kennington. On 28th April, about half-past eight o'clock in the evening, I was in Walworth-road—I felt my handkerchief taken out of my pocket—I turned, and the prisoners were behind me—I charged Rutt with having taken it—while I was speaking, West came and took him.

Rutt. Q. Did I go away? A. No.





THOMAS WEST
 (policeman, M 249.) I was in Westminster-road between seven and eight o'clock that evening—I saw the prisoner Crawley try a lady's pocket, Willsher was covering him—they went on and attempted another pocket, but did not succeed—they went on to the Walworth-road—Crawley put his hand into a gentleman's pocket, and took out something white—I asked if he had lost anything—he said, "A white handkerchief," but he should not know it—in about ten minutes Mr. Johns passed—the prisoners followed him about 200 yards—Willsher stepped into the road, just by a stall—this handkerchief, which Mr. Johns claims, was found there—I went up, and found Rutt in conversation with Johns, who said, "They; have just picked my pocket"—I took Rutt and Willsher—Rutt said, "I know nothing of that man," meaning Willsher.





THOMAS TOURESEY
 (policeman, M 237.) I was watching the prisoners—I saw what West has stated—they were all trying pockets.





MARTHA EASTER.
 I wa sitting at my stall about half-past eight o'clock that evening—I saw a handkerchief lying—I picked it up and gave it to West.

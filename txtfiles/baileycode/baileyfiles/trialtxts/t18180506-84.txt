            . I am servant to 
               
                  William 
                  Segnier
               



            , who is a baker, and lives in Green-street, Kentish-town. On the 2d of April, between ten and eleven o'clock at night, I heard that some persons were stealing lead off the premises, No. 7, Mortimer-terrace, Kentish-town


- I went there, remained at the door, and saw some persons doing something at the top of the house; I waited there a few minutes, and Thomas White came out of the door- I collared him. He asked me why I collared him? and said he had been at work for Meyers, but knew nothing of him, and asked me to let him go- I took him to the watch-house. The door was shut the moment he came out.
Cross-examined by MR. ARABIN. Meyers lived in the house.

                  SHIPTON
               



            . I am a carman, and live in Pleasant-row, Mortimer-terrace. I was coming from my stable at half-past nine o'clock at night, and heard a noise on the top of some uninhabited houses in Mortimer-terrace. I got over a garden opposite the houses, waited there sometime, and saw some men go along the roofs of the uninhabited houses to the roof of No. 7, with something under their arms. I went to Segnier and told him.


                  ROBERT 
                  VIZER
               



            . I am a timber-merchant, and live at No. 8, Mortimer-terrace. I came home about nine o'clock, Mr. Mensal gave me information - I staid there listening, and thought I heard something rattling. On coming out of my door, I saw somebody open the door of No. 7, and peep out. I then went and supped with Mr. Mensal. While we were at supper Segnier fetched us- we all went to the back of the terrace. We got some pistols, went on the top of No. 10, and got on the roofs of the houses. I found a large hole in the roof of No. 7. We returned, and went to the front of the house, and found the constable demanding admission, which was refused by persons within. I went to the back of my house to prevent their escaping behind. I heard them climbing over the palings to make their escape. I ran through my own house, gave information, and returned to the back again. One of them came running back and climbed over the paling into the garden of No. 7. I told him to stand, or I would blow his brains out- he ran into the house. I got over, tried the back-door, and called out that I would fire if they came out. Segnier and the constable came to my assistance. We broke the back-door open and got in. Meyers ran from the back-door into the front parlour; I followed, pushed the door open, and told him I would fire if he resisted- we secured him. I found John and 
               
                  Sarah 
                  White
               



             in the back parlour. 
               
                  Sarah 
                  White
               



             called out, "For God's sake, what is the matter? here are only me and my brother." We secured them, opened the back-door, and let the witnesses in. I went down to the kitchen, and found the copper and range, which had been fixed, was removed. When we got to the upper floor we found a ladder under the trap-door, which communicated with the roof, and a great deal of dirt on the floor, as if something had been taken off the roof. I found a quantity of lead rolled up, and put in the fire-place of the front room- it was fresh cut; there were two or three hundred weight. We took the prisoners to the watch-house - We found Fernandi and Thomas White there.


                  JOHN 
                  HENSON
               



            . I am a constable. I was sent for about a quarter after eleven o'clock, and took charge of the prisoners. I took the lead to the office, and afterwards fitted it to the houses Nos. 5 and 6, Mortimer-terrace, and found it fitted the gutters. - there was about 21/2 owt. Nos. 5 and 6 were empty houses.


                  WILLIAM 
                  SEGNIER
               



            . I am a baker, and live in Green-street. On the 2d of April, after nine o'clock at night, I was informed that some persons were stealing lead, I went through No. 10, got on the roof, and saw a person on the roof of No. 7, handing something down to the upper room. We came down, went to the door, and demanded admittance. Sarah White said that Meyers was not at home- that no person was at home but her, and she would not open the door. I went through Vizer's house, next door, to the back, which is close to the back-door of No. 7, and heard a scuffling over the palings which parted the gardens of the empty houses from No. 7. I went round to the back of the empty houses to No. 7, and heard somebody running before me. Vizer and I broke open thedoor; we found John and Sarah White in the passage- I found Meyers in the front parlour behind the door. I told him he appeared a very different character than when he came to my house two days before; he was then like a gentleman, but now he was like a plumber's labourer. He was dressed as a labouring man, and appeared to have been working very hard; his hands were very black, as if he had been getting lead off the roof. I found nineteen pieces of lead folded up in the fire-place of the upper room- it appeared to have been recently cut. There was a hole in the roof; the tiling had been taken off and the lafhs broken-the trap-door only goes into the cock-loft. I took Meyers to the watch-house - I found a false frill on him. He came to my house two days before, and said he had taken the house, No. 7, Mortimer-terrace, and a stable in Glocester-place, and wanted hay, straw, and corn. John White afterwards came with an order from him for hay and corn, and represented himself as his groom.
Cross-examined. The girl would not let us in. I heard her voice. The people called to her from the top of the house to refuse admission.

                  JONES
               



            . I am a watchman. I went to the back of No. 7, about a quarter before ten o'clock. Fernandi came over a fence seven feet high, making his escape from No. 7- I laid hold of him. He said, "What is the matter? I have done no harm, let me go;" I refused until I knew what was the matter.
WILLIAM BROWN. I am constable of the night. I was fetched to the premises, saw 
               
                  Thomas 
                  White
               



             come out, and stopped him. He said he was Meyers's hostler.

            . I was standing at Mr. Master's door (Mr. Wallis in the Poultry


) and saw Mr. Blake and another gentleman going along; who should follow them but the prisoner and his partner, (for he had another with him) they walked backward and forward five or six times, which made me think they were upon no good design, and I saw the prisoner put his hand into Mr. Blake's pocket, draw out a handkerchief, and put it under his coat. I took hold of the prisoner, called to Mr. Blake, and said, Sir, your pocket is picked; he turned round to the prisoner, who had the handkerchief in his hand, and said, that is my handkerchief.

            . Mr. Short brought the prisoner up to me, and told me my pocket was picked. The prisoner had my handkerchief in his hand under the breast of his coat, and I knew it to be my handkerchief. - To the best of my opinion it is my handkerchief.
Prisoner. You said before the Alderman, you would not swear to the handkerchief.
Blake. I swore as I do now to the best of my opinion. 


               Guilty 10 d.

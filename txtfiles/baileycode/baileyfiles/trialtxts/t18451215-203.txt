 was indicted

for stealing, on the

JOHN BOLTON
. I live at No. 17, Matthew-street, Bloomsbury. On the morning of the 14th of Dec, I went into the Acorn public-house, at the corner of Acorn-street and Bishopsgate-street, about three o'clock in the morning—I am a vender of ham sandwiches—I went in there to sell my goods—Sweet and a few others were there—the prisoner was there—I sold all my sandwiches but four—I had a soot-bag chucked in my face, and felt a man's hand in my pocket—I caught the hand as it came out of my pocket—it was the prisoner's hand—I had in that pocket, as near as I can tell, three shillings, two sixpences, and two fourpenny pieces—I held his hand for a minute or two, but he got it away, and I saw him give my money to another.





JAMES MILLER
 (policeman.) I was on duty in Bishopsgate-street, about three o'clock—I heard a cry in Acorn-street—I ran up, and found the prosecutor and prisoner struggling together—the prisoner said, "Let me go"—the prosecutor said, "I shan't, you have robbed me of all my money"—he gave him into my custody.

Prisoner. A gentleman came to the station who saw the occurrence; there was sparring in the house, and he got wrestling, and was thrown down several times; two gentlemen came to the station and spoke on my behalf.





JAMES MILLER

re-examined. There was no disturbance, except between the prosecutor and prisoner—two gentlemen came to the station, but they knew nothing of this case, and refused to give evidence.




GUILTY
.** Aged 34.—


Transported for Ten Years.

            . I am a constable. I was going along King-street, Clothfair, about five o'clock, three persons passed me, two of them were carrying a cask. I followed them, endeavouring to get assistance to take both. I lost sight of them, and saw them again in Charterhouse-lane, Coleman and I stopped the prisoner with the cask on his shoulder. He said he was employed to carry it.

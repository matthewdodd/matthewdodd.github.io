I am a constable; I live in Houndsditch; on the 20th of April, Sunday in the evening, I was standing at my door, and seeing the prisoner pass by with a bundle under his arm, I asked him what he had got, he said some things to sell; I took the bundle and opened it, and found these pair of breeches, and a coat without buttons; I then began to question him, and he shewed me only one of the buttons; on which I searched him, and found thirteen more all shanked Queen Ann shillings; he did not tell me where he had taken them from, or how he came by them; I advertised them the next day and the prosecutor

WILLIAM STRONG
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
23d of May, 1 microscope, value 1l. 10s., the goods of 



Thomas Bassett Matthews.






THOMAS BASSETT MATTHEWS
. I live in Athol-place, Pentonville. The prisoner worked for Mr. Weedon—he came to me on the 23rd of May, and said Mr. Weedon would be much obliged to me if I would lend him a microscope, one that he had made for me before, to look at it—I sent it by the prisoner.





MICHAEL WEEDON
. I am an optician, and live in Chapel-row. The prisoner formerly lived with me—I did not send him for this microscope on the 23rd of May—he did not live with me then—he has not brought it to me.





HORATIO ANDERSON
 (police-constable G 163.) The prisoner came to me on the 13th of June, and said he stole a microscope, and wished to give himself up, as he thought the police were on the alert after him, and he thought he should not be concealed long.

Prisoner. I never went to Mr. Matthews for it.





THOMAS BASSETT MATTHEWS
 re-examined. I had seen him at work at his master's—I am certain he came for it—I let him have it to look at.




GUILTY
. * Aged 24.—


Transported for Seven Years.

There was another indictment against the prisoner.

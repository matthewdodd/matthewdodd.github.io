My fellow servant went with me to him; she said she could swear that he was the person who swept the chimney the day the spoon was lost. I got a constable, and before we got to the justice the prisoner confessed he had stole the spoon, and had pawned it in Peter's street. I went by his direction and found it. It was produced in court.

            . The prisoner came to sweep our chimney the 8th of June, and a little boy with him. While the boy was up the chimney the prisoner stood by, he asked two shillings and sixpence for sweeping the chimney. I went up stairs to get a shilling for him, and when I came down again the spoon was gone; the next day we took him up, and he confessed taking it, and carried us to the place where he had pawned it.

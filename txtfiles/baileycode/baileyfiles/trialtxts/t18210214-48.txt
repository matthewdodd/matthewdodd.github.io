            . The prisoner came and took the things from me as I stood unlocking the door; he ran away, and I pursued him. I am ten years old - I called Stop thief! and he was taken; there were two other boys with him, who ran away. I do not know what he did with the things - I am sure he is the boy - I did not lose sight of him.

            . I was going up Howland-street


, and heard this boy cry Stop thief; I stopped the prisoner who was running; he got from me. Another man turned him back, and I caught him. The property was never found.
Prisoner's Defence. I was passing by when the gentleman took me. I had nothing to do with it.

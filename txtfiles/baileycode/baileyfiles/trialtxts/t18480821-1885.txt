JAMES BURR
. I am a salesman, at Stepney. On 30th July, a little after nine o'clock, I had fifty-two sheep, with "L" on them, safe—I received information, and found only fifty—there was blood on the bank and on the ditch—I saw the skins of my sheep at the station, with "L" on them.





THOMAS KELLY
 (police-sergeant). On 30th July, at twenty minutes to two o'clock in the night, I saw the prisoner with a bundle under his arm, in Whitechapel—I asked what he had—he said, "Do you want to see," and threw it down—I found portions of sheep-skin in it, bloody and warm—I asked how he came by it—he said a man in Brick-lane gave it him—on the way to the station, he threw the bundle down, and escaped—I took him again to the station, and found blood on his clothes—I also found knee-marks on the bank.





ALFRED LORMAN
 (policeman). Between one and two o'clock on Sunday morning, I saw two parties with a bundle—I asked what they had got—they threw it down—it agreed with what was found on the prisoner.




GUILTY
. Aged 21.—


Transported for Seven Years.

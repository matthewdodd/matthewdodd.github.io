            . I was in Mr. Colwell's employ - he discharged me about three weeks ago - I had lived two years and ten months with him; the prisoner was in his employ as a stove-grate maker, and left last April; Fryett and him were on friendly terms; I frequently saw the prisoner about the neighbourhood after he left, and in company with Fryett; about two years ago, I saw Fryett hand the front of a stove through the iron railing to the prisoner, who took it away - it was taken out of Mr. Colwell's shop; I have heard Fryett quarrel with him at times - I heard Ward ask Fryett for a coffee pot, some metal spoons, and a japanned waiter - I do not know whether Fryett gave them to him: I have heard them reproach each other about what was done, and have heard Fryett say, in Ward's presence, among others that Ward had taken things to Scoltock's shop; and that he had seen things in Scoltock's shop which he could prove were Mr. Colwell's; this was before he left - Ward made no observation about it.
Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON. Q. Do you mean to swear he did not deny it? A. I have no recollection of his denying it - I have heard the same thing mentioned two or three times; I did not tell Mr. Colwell of it- it might be eight or nine months before I was discharged; I was discharged on account of Mr. Colwell losing so much property, he did not suspect me - I was not charged with it; I was discharged in consequence of what was reported in the papers, principally that Fryett should say I had stolen more than anybody else, and had shared in it; I have not seen the stove front since, and do not know what Ward did with it; it had come from the foundry; Ward finishes them - I do not know whether it has been found.
MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You did not tell your master any thing till after Fryett was found out? A. I did not.


                  JOHN 
                  UPSON
               



            . I am an officer. In consequence of information, I went to the prisoner's lodging, at Wharton's, No. 9, Crown-court - the prisoner was not at home -Wharton shewed me up to his room, which is a front room on the second floor; I saw his daughter there, and asked her for the key of a cupboard which was padlocked; she did not give it to me - I forced the closet open, and found a large quantity of goods of various descriptions, and forty-five packets of nails and screws, which I produce in the state I found them; the prisoner came in while I was searching, and saw what I had found - he said they were not his, they were his daughter's - the daughter was not them present; a quantity of old locks and keys were found in the closet - he said they were part of an old stock which he had brought from his shop in Belton-street, where he formerly lived.
Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Have you got the keys here? A. No, they were not claimed by the prosecutor; they were old iron, laying at the bottom of the cupboard.
Q. Did not his daughter tell you the things had been brought there three weeks before, by a person who she described, and in her father's absence? A. No, nothingof the sort - I never heard it; I went to his house on Thursday, the 21st of August - Mr. Colwell was with me, and two other officers, and I believe heard what passed; she did not, in my preasence, say anything about the man not having called for payment.
MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. What did the daughter say? A. She said her father always kept the key of the closet; I then broker it open - the prisoner never gave me the key of it.
MR. COLWELL. I went with Upson to Wharton's house, and saw the search made; the daughter said her father kept the key; and on Upson saying he would break the closet open, she said he would be very angry if he did; she did not claim any property there - I believe I can speak to all these things - the papers enclosing the nails and screws are marked by my young man; there are twenty-four parcels of nails, and the rest screws - I never sold the prisoner any of them, nor authorized him to take them.
Cross-examined. Q. Did the daughter say the goods had been brought there by Fryett some time previous? A. I never heard it; Ward lived between two and three years with me - Fryett had access to all the property - he was allowed to go where these things were, and Ward was not; he was a porter, and Ward a workman.
MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Ward had no authority to go there, but could he go if he chose? A. If he went there, I should expect he was going to ask Fryett for something - he could go there in our absence.

            . The prisoner lodged at my house, in the second-floor front room - I directed Upson to his room; when he moved in, a quantity of old iron and chains were brought, and several other things were put at the bottom of the cupboard. but nothing like these goods - he came in October, 1827.
Cross-examined. Q. You saw him bring the old iron with him? A. Yes - I do not know when the other goods came; I have frequently seen Fryett there.
COURT. Q. Had anybody the control of the closet besides him? A. Not that I know of.
MR. CLARKSON to MR. COLWELL. Q. Do you know when any or all these things were taken? A. I do not; the prisoner was two years and a half in my service, and left in October. GUILTY. Aged 54.

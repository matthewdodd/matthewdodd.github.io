I was sent for on the 15th of April to Mr. Price's in William street, Marybone, he had took a woman on suspicion of taking a frock from his house; I searched the prisoner, I could not find his frock, but I found a white muslin frock wrapped up in a coarse apron; she was very unwilling to give it me; I took it from her.

JOSEPH MILTON
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
7th of December, 5lbs. weight of bacon, value 9d., the goods of 



John George; and that he had been before convicted of felony.







SAMUEL LLOYD
. On the 7th of December, I was going to Mr. George's who keeps a cheesemonger's shop, in Chandos-street, and saw the prisoner take the piece of bacon, and put it under his coat—I collared him, and told him to go back with it—he dropped it inside the door, and said, "So help me God, I never touched it," but he had it when I took hold of him.





JOHN GEORGE
. This bacon is mine—there is about 5lbs. weight of it—I was behind the counter at the time.





SAMUEL WOODWARD
. I took the prisoner, and have the bacon.





JOHN LAWRENCE
 (I police-constable F 9.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from the Clerk of the Peace, at the Guildhall, Westminster (read)—the prisoner is the man.

Prisoner's Defence. I was passing, and the gentleman said he saw me take it off the shelf, and put it into my bag, but I did not—he said at the office he saw me put it into the bag, and then he said I did not put it in the bag.




GUILTY
. Aged 22.—

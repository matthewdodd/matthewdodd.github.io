            . I am a headborough. About half-past seven o'clock, on the evening of the 17th of October, I saw the prisoner and another woman in conversation near Mr. Jackson's house - they then went to the shop, and looked very hard in at a gentleman who was at the back of the shop; they then stooped down: the prisoner took the fender from the shew-board; I crossed over, and took her.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

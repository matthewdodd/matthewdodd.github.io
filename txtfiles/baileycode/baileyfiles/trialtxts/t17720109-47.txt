            . I am a sawyer
. I lost my great coat about two in the afternoon last Monday, from a saw pit near the brickfields, Islington


; I left it while I went home; when I came back it was gone.

            . I am a carpenter. I was in the buildings near the saw-pit; I saw the prisoner take the coat from the saw-pit, and put it under his arm; I threw up the sash and bid him let the coat alone; then he ran away with it; I cried, Stop thief! and he dropped it about one hundred yards off; he was never out of my sight till he was taken.

I was running after a mad bullock, and saw the coat lie in the road; I took it up and laid it down again, and they cried, Stop thief!

JAMES WILSON
 was again indicted

 for stealing, on the 
17th of March, 1 lock, value 8s., the goods of 



Samuel Rooks; and fixed to a certain building; against the Statute, &c.






SAMUEL ROOKS
. I am owner of the house in Grove-street, Hollows. It was unoccupied at this time—I went there, in consequence of information from a police-officer, on the 17th of March, and found the front door open, and the lock off—it had been screwed to the door—this is it (looking at it)—the plate was partly broken off before—it is now quite so—I am certain it is my lock—I have the key which fits it—there were only three screws in the lock—I had put it on a few days before.





JOHN PA BROCK
. I am a constable. On Friday afternoon, the 17th of March, I took charge of the prisoner, and searched him in the parlour of the house, No. 25, South-street—I found a lock on the sideboard there, and three screws on the prisoner, with six skeleton keys—I matched the screws with the lock, and they fitted it—the prisoner told me he had taken the glass down from over the mantel-piece of that room, but said be knew nothing about the lock—I took it away with me, and afterwards found Mr. Rooks, who had a key belonging to it.





EDWARD BE ALE
. I gave the prisoner into custody, and this lock was lying on the sideboard of the parlour of No. 25, South-street.

Prisoner's Defence. I do not deny taking the glass, but I solemnly deny

the lock ever being in the parlour when I went in—the keys and screws were down in the passage, and I picked them up, but I saw nothing whatever of thc lock.




GUILTY
. Aged 38.—


Transported for Seven Years.

First Jury, before Mr. Recorder.

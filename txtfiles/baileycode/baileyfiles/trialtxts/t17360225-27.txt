Dr.
 Hulse. I was stop'd at Chancery-Lane-End


, and in the Hurry, I found my Sword drawn out of my Scabbard. I call'd my Servant and told him some Body had got my Sword; he ran back and saw the Prisoner with a great Coat, he pull'd it open and saw my Sword upon him. There was not more than a Minute between my losing it and seizing the Prisoner.
The Servant swore the same and the Jury found him 


               Guilty to the value of 10 d.

, called Rotten-row


; the portmanteau was behind the carriage - I lost it.

            . I am a bricklayer. I was going through Hyde Park; just as I got to the gate I saw the prisoner peeping from under the rail into the horse-road. When I came up I found he was sitting on the portmanteau. I passed on till I came to the barracks, and there saw the carriage, with the strings hanging to it, as if the portmanteau had been taken from it, and informed thepost-boy of it - he got off, and missed it. I was on horseback - I rode back to Stanhope-street gate, and saw the prisoner trying to get it on his shoulder - I got over the rail, and took him. There were two others just before him.

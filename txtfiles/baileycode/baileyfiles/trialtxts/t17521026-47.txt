            . I live in Duck Lane, near Smithfield


. I have a room up two pair of stairs in the house of

                  Buckaridge 
               



            , and work with the paviours


. I came home on the 15th of September at night, between seven and eight o'clock. I found the prisoner and my wife talking Welch together. The prisoner told me she was a poor country girl, and had been up in London but about two months. I said to my wife, it is pity to let her go out at this time of night, fearing she should get into bad hands; we'll contrive and make her up a bed to night. We did, with a sack, one blanket , one sheet, some fowl clothes, a pillow, and things that we could spare. We went to bed just about nine o'clock. I saw the prisoner in bed, and wished her a good night. I double lock'd my own room door, but left the key in the door. About a quarter before twelve the watchman alarmed the house, and said the door was open. It alarmed me. My landlord below got up, and fastened it. I went to sleep again, and arose in the morning about five o'clock, as usual. I saw the prisoner was gone, my door open, and the things mentioned in the indictment missing. I found her in St. Martin's round house on the 18th in the morning. One

             took her and fetched me to her. We found some of my wife's apparel upon her, and she confessed she had sold one cotton gown at the Duke William's Head, in Kent Street, Surrey. I went there, and found it at an old cloaths shop the next door to it.

            . On the 15th of September, in the morning, I was talking Welch to a countryman in the street; the prisoner went past us. I parted with the man, she came back again, and asked me if I was a Welch woman in Welch ? I said, yes; she said, so was she, and asked me if I knew of a place, saying she had been but two months in London. I found she could talk English very well. I took her up stairs and gave her a breakfast; I was washing. She said she would help me, which she did accordingly. Upon this she dined with me. She then said, she would stay till my husband came home, which he did about eight o'clock. The rest as her husband had before deposed. She also deposed to the things as they were produced in court; and that a purple and white gown was the property of 
               
                  Eleanor 
                  Williams

            . I was going into the borough on the 17th of September, about ten in the morning, and saw the prisoner coming over the New Bridge towards Westminster. I have seen her about two or three years ago in Westminster. When I met her last, she was dressed very well.
Q. Are you a relation of hers?
Rowland. No, my Lord, none at all. I knowing she was run away from the turnkey at Bridewell a little before, came back again, and in the evening a woman said to me, these are the people that have been robbed by 
               
                  Elizabeth 
                  Rowland 
               



            , meaning the prosecutor and another person, who had been inquiring about, and describing her. I said, I met her about ten at night, and described her dress, taking a direction where to find the prosecutor. A little before ten at night I heard she was in the park. I went to see, and met her and a drumer coming over the parade together. They parted at the treasury. I went on, and at the end of the New Bridge, which I thought a convenient place for assistance, I stopp'd her, and told her for what. She said, if I would come with her over the bridge, she would give me all the things. I had her put into the round house, and carried the prosecutor some of the cloaths she had on. He deposed to them, and I heard the prisoner confess some of the things were in Kent Street.
The prisoner had nothing to say.

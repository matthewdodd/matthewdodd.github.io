            . I am an accountant
. On the 12th of June, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon. I was walking along the Strand


, a person tapped me on the shoulder at the corner of Beaufort-buildings


, I turned round and a young man told me my pocket was picked-The prisoner was running. I immediately pursued, and saw my handkerchief on the pavement, some person picked it up and gave it to me. I continued running, and at the corner of Exeter-change the prisoner was stopped and given into my charge. I believe him to be the man I was pursuing.

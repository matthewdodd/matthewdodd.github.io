            . I am a Weaver
, and live in Milk-street, Cheapside


. On Monday last, about ten minutes after two o'clock, I was at dinner. I had sent a little girl for some beer: she, on coming in, said, she met a woman with some bottles in a tub, coming up out of my cellar. I went out, and there was the prisoner. She had them in a tub with which she cries about for kitchen-stuff. I desired her to bring them back; there were thirteen of them. She said, she had bought them of a servant. She would not go back for some time. She persisted she bought them. I sent for a constable: then she began to cry, and fell on her knees, and implored mercy, and acknowledged the fact. She said, she was necessitated to go down into the cellar to make water, and the D - l tempted her to steal the bottles. That door is usually open in the day-time.
Prisoner's Defence.
I buy old glass bottles and hare-skins. I bought these of an old clothes woman in Coleman-street, for a shilling.

            , I am wife to

                  Wood 
               



            ; I lost the goods mentioned in the indictment (mentioning them by name) on the 7th of August last.
Q. How did you lose them.
J. Wood. I was very ill, and my husband was out of town; I lay down on the bed, not having much sleep for several nights; 
               
                  Ann 
                  Bassey 
               



             came in. I desired her to sit down, and if any body came in for her to awake me; I thought I could have trusted her, and while I was fast asleep, my hand, with my wedding ring on my finger, being on the outside the bed, she took my ring off, it was rather too big for my finger, and she took the other things mentioned, and went away; when I awaked I miss 'd her and them.
Q How do you know she took them; you say you was asleep?
J. Wood. There was nobody there but she.
Q. What is the other prisoner?
J. Wood. The other prisoner is a stranger.
Q How long do you think you slept?
J. Wood. I might sleep near 3 hours; I awak'd before my husband came in; I was so astonished at missing my shoes and buckles, and ring, that I did not look for the other things till after my husband came home. After this, the prisoner had the impudence to come the next night, and went up stairs to bed, knowing I had beds in the house; I had her secur'd and taken to the watchhouse, and they let her go again; and I being ill, could not get her again for several days; when I charg'd her with taking them, she own'd, she went to pawn the things that same afternoon that she took them.
Q. What do you say to 
               
                  Ann 
                  Bell 
               



            ?
J. Wood. She had my shoes and shift on; they were taken from her at the constable's house; she was taken 7 or 8 days after the other prisoner.
Q. Did you ever see 
               
                  Ann 
                  Bell 
               



             in your house?
J. Wood. No, never in my life till she was taken.

            . I am a pawnbroker; my servant took these things in on the 7th of August when I was out, I knew nothing of it till Mr. Welch sent for me; there was the prisoner before him; she there acknowledged she had pledg'd such things at my house (he produc'd a gold ring, and a cotton gown) deposed to by prosecutrix.
Q. What was lent upon them?
Spencer. There was 8. on the ring, and 5 on the gown; I took them to Mr. Welch; there the prosecutrix swore to them; the prisoner there own'd she took the ring from her finger, and the gown from out of her room.
Q. to Spencer. Do you know any thing of 
               
                  Ann 
                  Bell 
               



            ?
Spencer. No.
Bassey's Defence.
The prosecutrix keeps a disorderly house; there are lodgers there every night; she was in liquor when I was with her; I never took care of her house in my life; there was a man lying on the bed with her.

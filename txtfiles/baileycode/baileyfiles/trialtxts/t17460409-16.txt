                  Daniel 
                  Miller 
               



            , came into the House and call'd for a Pint of Beer; I took my Grandmother's Pint Mug, and brought it up with the Beer to the Prisoner, and the Half-Pint Mug I gave to 
               
                  Elizabeth 
                  Ford 
               



            ; then I went to the Necessary-House; my Grandmother call'd I bid my Sister go, I told her I could not go; when I came in again, my Grandmother said, this Man has had no Beer, he has only been eating a Red-Herring; said I, then he is gone. I had heard that he liv'd with one 
               
                  Mary 
                  Bell 
               



            ; I went to the Door, and I saw him and two Women with him, Bell and Carter; upon which I run directly after him, the two Women made off, and I laid hold of 
               
                  Daniel 
                  Miller 
               



            .
Q. Have you any thing more to say? Have you found it since?
Stephens. Yes, Sir, it was found at Mr. Hoskins's, in Chick-Lane, in the Parish of St. Luke's, Foster's-Buildings.
[The Mug was produced in Court by Knight, the Constable.]


                  Q. 
               


            (to Stephens.) Is that your Grandmother's Mug?
Stephens. Yes, Sir.
Q. Whence had you this Mug?
Stephens. I had it of one Haskins in Chick-Lane.


                  Q.

                  Ford 
               



            .) What have you to say to the Matter?
Ford. I went into the Widow
 Atkin's House, and called for Half a Pint of Beer; the 
               
                  Young 
                  Man

            , the Prisoner, toasted a Red-Herring, whereof I did eat a Bit with him: After I was gone from the House, and got home, he took the Mug.

                  Carter 
               



            . On Wednesday the 12th Day of March, this 
               
                  Daniel 
                  Miller 
               



             coming down to the Room where he lodges, please you, my Lord, he called 
               
                  Mary 
                  Bell 
               



            , the Prisoner at the Bar, to the Window.
Q. When did this happen?
Carter. The 12th of March: He called 
               
                  Mary 
                  Bell 
               



            ; the Prisoner said he had something to speak to her: When they came to sit down by the Fire-Side where they lodg'd, he pulled out this Silver Mug, and ask'd me if I would go along with them to sell or pawn it, which we could: It was carried to Haskin's in Chick-Lane, and it was pawn'd for 18 s. and the Money deliver'd to the Prisoner, 
               
                  Mary 
                  Bell 
               



            .


                  Q. 
               


            (to Carter.) What is the Prisoner, Miller?
Carter. He is a Horse-Courser.
Q. Had you no Curiosity to ask him how he came by the Mug?
Carter. I never heard the Man bore an ill Character before.


                  Q. 
               


            (to Miller the Prisoner.) What have you to say to this?
Miller. When I went into this House I was much in Liquor; there I fell asleep, and 
               
                  Mary 
                  Bell 
               



             took the Mug and carried it home, without my Knowledge.


                  Q. 
               


            (to 
               
                  Elizabeth 
                  Ford 
               



            .) Was the Man in Liquor at this Time?
Ford. No, I did not see he was at all.


                  Q. 
               


            (to 
               
                  Eleanor 
                  Hoskins 
               



            .) What do you know of this Cup? Do you know of Miller's having that Cup?
Hoskins. Please you, my Lord, I know nothing of the Man; I never see him with my Eyes before this Time: The Woman I have seen; she came to my House; I keep a Publick House. She ask'd me if I would buy a Silver Pint Mug; I told her, I never dealt in Silver, nor never intended it.
Q. What did you do upon that?
Hoskins. The Creature (So I may call her) she wanted to bring me into a Premunire. My Husband, please you my Lord, was asleep; he had been a Journey, and he did not awake at this Time. She said, I wish you would be so good as to buy the Mug, or let me have a Trifle upon it. I refus'd it; she said she was not in a Dress fit to go out with it, and said, will you please to let your Girl go out to any of your Acquaintance, to borrow as much as they can upon it; so the Girl agreed to go, and ask'd what she must borrow upon this Mug; the Prisoner said she might borrow 20 s. if she could; but they would not give her any thing unless I would come; I went, and told them the People were at my House, and so they gave 30 s. for the Mug.
Q. Have you any thing more to say.
Hoskins. My Lord, there were 18 s. deliver'd into her Hand.
Q. How came the People by the Mug again?
Hoskins. When the Prisoner receiv'd the 18 s. she said it would get him his Coat, or something, for she believ'd he was in Confinement; these Words dropping, gave me a Suspicion; I got the 18 s. again, and went directly with my Servant to the Pawnbroker's for the Mug, and no Use was paid for it.
Court. You Woman Prisoner, will you ask this Witness any Question.
Prisoner. This Maid she speaks of has been a Plyer these three Years in her House.


                  Q. 
               


            (to - Miller.) Are you related to the Prisoner at the Bar?
Miller. I am his Mother, he has a very good Character; that

                  Carter

Jenkin Jones. On the 22d of December about noon I was transacting business on the Custom-house-key


, I felt something at my pocket; I turned about and saw my handkerchief in the prisoner's hand, he was close by me; I said he had stole my handkerchief; he acknowledged he had; it was desired to give him the discipline of ducking, but being high water it could not be done with safety; I took him before my Lord-Mayor and he was committed; ( the handkerchief produced and deposed to.)
Prisoner's defence.
The handkerchief was hanging out of his pocket about three parts, and I took it out; he turned about, and said it was his handkerchief.

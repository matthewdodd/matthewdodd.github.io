            . I am the wife of William George: we live in Darby-court, Piccadilly


. I let a lodging to Jordan on the 10th of December - she did not say Fox was to live with her, but she brought her with her as a friend to sleep with her a night or two - that was on Wednesday, and on Saturday they were taken; I had been in the room, and missed two sheets, a pillow, and a blanket; my husband had them taken up.

            . I am a pawnbroker. On the 11th of December, Jordan pawned this one sheet - on the 12th Fox pawned another; she said she was sent by Jordan; and on the 13th, Fox pawned a blanket for 1s. 6d.; they each time stated that the other sent them.(Property produced and sworn to.)
JORDAN'S Defence. I was waiting for my box coming from Wandsworth; I was distressed, and meant to replace the things on the Monday - I pawned the blanket to get my gown to go out.
FOX'S Defence. I was sent by her to take the sheets and the blanket each time - she told me it was because she wanted the money, she told me she would replace them when her box came from Wandsworth - she was ashamed to go to the pawnbroker's herself, not having any gown.
JORDAN - 

               GUILTY
            . Aged 31.
FOX - 

               GUILTY
            . Aged 23.

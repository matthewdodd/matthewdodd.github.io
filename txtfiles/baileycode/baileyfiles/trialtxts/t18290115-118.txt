            . I live at Epping-forest. On the 14th of December I called on a friend in Alpha-road


; I left my two coats on my horse - I had not been in the house two minutes before the prisoner came and took them- I saw him through the window, and went out; he saw us, and threw down the coats - he went down a turning which is no throughfare; my friend got up to him and took him: we brought him back to the Nightingale public-house, and gave charge of him - I am quite certain of his person; I never lost sight of him - these are my coats.
The prisoner put in a written Defence, denying that he had touched the coats.

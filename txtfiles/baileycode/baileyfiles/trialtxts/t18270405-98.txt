THOMAS LATHAM. I am a ribbon manufacturer
. I live in Well-street, Cripplegate. About half-past eight o'clock on the evening of the 18th of March, I was in Coventry-street, Haymarket


; I had a pocket handkerchief in my left-hand coat pocket - the officer touched me on the shoulder, and asked me if I had lost any thing; I felt, and missed my handkerchief, which I saw lying on the ground- the prisoner was then in custody.

            . On the evening of the 18th of March, I was on duty in Coventry-street, and saw the prisoner in company with five or six others, following the prosecutor; I stood in a door-way, and saw the prisoner put his right-hand into the prosecutor's pocket, and take out this handkerchief. I seized the prisoner, and he dropped it from under his coat - his companions all went away.



               GUILTY
            . Aged 18.

conducted the Prosecution.






JOHN PAYNE.
 I am butler to Lord Harrington—his christian name is Charles—he lives in Whitehall-palace, in the parish of St. Margaret, Westminster—I went into his dressing-room on the 20th of July, at a quarter before eight in the morning—I missed a pair of silver candlesticks, a pair of silver snuffers and tray, a pincushion from her ladyship's writing-room, and a pair of candlesticks and a gold watch from another room—I had seen them safe at one o'clock that morning—there were no chimneys swept that morning, nor any to have been swept.

Cross-examined by
MR. PRENDERGAST.
Q. Your master is called Lord Harrington? A. He is the Earl of Harrington—I know that by the letters directed to him—is they are directed to Lord Harrington we may take them in—his name is Charles Stanhope, Earl of Harrington.

Cross-examined by
MR. PAYNE.
Q. Whose duty would it be to attend on sweeps? A. When sweeps are expected they knock at the front door, and are let in by the porter—they then go to a second door, and are let in by a second porter, and get a light.





FRANCIS STURGES.
 I am porter at the Earl of Harrington's, at Whitehall-gardens. On Tuesday morning, the 20th of July, about half-past three o'clock, I was awoke by a tapping at the window, and a calling out "Sweep!"—there were two men dressed as sweeps—I got up, and let them in—I cannot identify them.





HENRY TATTAM
 (policeman A 160.) On the morning of the 20th of July, about a quarter before four o'clock, I was on duty in Whitehall-gardens—two sweeps came and spoke to me—I can swear Wiltshire was one—I am not positive that Roach was one—he resembles the man, but I had not the chance to speak to him—Wiltshire was coming along the pavement with a bag on his back, and said to me, "Policeman, is it gone four?"—I said no, it wanted a quarter—they went over to Lord Harrington's, and tapped at the window—they were admitted in about a minute—on the morning of the 25th of July I took Wiltshire in Oxford-street from information—I told him what it was for—he said he was innocent, and could prove his innocence by his having worked on that Tuesday morning, at No. 55, Lower Grosvenor-Street—he also said he was at work at another place, No. 44, Davis-street, that morning.

Cross-examined by
MR. PAYNE.
Q. Was he sober? A. yes—I had seen him twice between the Tuesday and the time I took him—I saw him on the 22nd of July in a public-house for about a minute or two, and again on Friday, the 23rd of July, for about two or three minutes, and again on Sunday morning, the 25th, when we took him—I did not have any conversation with him, but I was with another constable who had—I was within two or three yards of them when the conversation took place—I now and then heard a word—I did not hear Wiltshire saw to me, "After all I have told you it is very odd you should take me"—I did not hear the policeman ask him where he lived—I did not tell him not to get out of the way, and I would call on him in the course of the day.


Cross-examined by
MR. PRENDERGAST.
Q. The person who was with Wiltshire you described as being rather taller than the other? A. I described Wiltshire as being about five feet three inches high, and the other five feet three inches and a quarter—I gave the description to the inspector by word of mouth—there was no description given in writing.





SETH THOMAS.
 I am a private in the Grenadier Guards. I was on duty on the 20th of July—about half-past four o'clock that morning I saw two sweeps—I feel positive that Roach was one—he had a bag—my attention was directed to the Earl of Harrington's, from the closing of the door—the bag which Roach was carrying projected more than a bag does which is carrying soot—I stopped them, and asked the person who resembled Wiltshire if he could oblige me with two or three lucifers—he said he had not got any—he asked Roach if he could give me them—Roach said no, but he could give me two or three fusees—I said, "You have got a very heavy load, old mate"—they made no answer—I feel quite positive Roach is the man who gave me the fusees—Wiltshire carries the description of the other man, but I will not swear to him.

Cross-examined by
MR. PRENDERGAST.
Q. You are quite sure Roach carried the bag? A. Yes—I saw him again on the following Monday morning, at King-street Police-Station—when I saw him on the Tuesday morning he was dirty, as sweeps usually are, but his face was not so dirty as sweeps usually are, there were come marks of dirt about his face, whether it was soot, or no, I cannot say—I should think, from his size, he does not go up chimneys, but sweeps generally continue rather dirty—I did not see the persons come out of the house—the persons were three or four paces from the door at the time the sound of the door closing reached me—the house is rather in front, it is in Whitehall-gardens—I cannot say whether it is a stone house—there are two gates which lead to it—it is exactly in front of my post.





GEORGE BUTT
 (policeman, A 135.) On the 25th of July, between eight and nine o'clock in the morning, I was in Oxford-street—Wiltshire came up to me, and said he wanted to give me some information respecting the parties who committed the robbery at the Earl of Harrington's—he said he was standing at the corner of street near Oxford-street, and saw two sweeps, who he thought were the persons who committed the robbery—he described one about his one height and size, and little legs, much like himself, and the other a little taller—he said he had told a sergeant of D division, and he had desired him to follow them, that he did follow to the Great Western Railway station, and lost them, and thought they went off by the train—he offered to go with me to see to find them—Tattam was near me—I had some conversation with him, then returned, and took Wiltshire—I said he was charged with the robbery—he said he was satisfied, he could state where he was at work; that he had two jobs that morning, one at 55, Lower Grosvenor-street, and the other at 44, Davis-street—when the charge was taken, he said, "In order to clear myself, I will speak the truth"—he said there was a man of the name of Matthew Roach, and if I were to go to see him, I should think he was the other man—he said, in fact, he was certain that he was one of the parties that was there at the robbery—in conesquence of that I went to Marylebone Court—Wiltshire asked me if I was going to take the other man—I said I should see—he said, "If you take him, most likely he will turn round against me, but that I can't help"—I asked him why he had made that previous statement—he made no reply—I took Roach—I told him what he was charged with—he said nothing.


Cross-examined by
MR. PRENDERGAST.
Q. Did you not ask him if he had ever swept the Earl of Harrington's chimneys, and did he not answer, "I have not for years?" A. No, I told him I apprehended him for the robbery at the Earl of Harrington's—he said nothing—I had no conversation with him on the subject of robbery.

Cross-examined by
MR. PAYNE.
Q. You took Wiltshire into custody, when had you last seen him before that? A. On the Saturday evening, the 24th of July, in Oxford-street—I saw him on the Friday—I saw him almost every day—I was in company with Tattam sometimes, but not always—I saw a person walking with Wiltshire, in the street, on Sunday morning—I took Thomas into one of the public-house—I did not see Wiltshire there—I do not know whether he was there pr not—I did not notice him in the Clarendon.





ELLEN CONDON.
 I live in the service of Mr. Mead, 55, Lower Grosvenor-street. Our chimneys were not swept on the morning of Tuesday, the 20th of July—they were swept on the next day, on the Wednesday, by a person in Wiltshire's employ—Wiltshire came and had the money for them.

Cross-examined by
MR. PAYNE.
Q. Are you sure it was not on the Tuesday morning they were done? A. Yes—my master had company the night before they swept them, which was on Tuesday night.





SARAH BURNETT.
 I am in the employ of Mr. Wicker, 44, Davies-street—there were no chimneys swept there on Tuesday morning, the 20th of July—they were swept on the Thursday morning by morning by Wiltshire.





WILLIAM ANDREWS.
 I am a chimney-sweeper, and live at No.10, Angel-court. Roach was in my service four or five years—I will not swear whether he was in the habit of sweeping the Earl of Harrington's chimneys—it is most likely he did—there was no reason why he should not go there—I swept the Earl of Harrington's chimneys up to 1843.

Cross-examined by Mr. PRENDERGAST.
Q. You have been dismissed since? A. Yes—I kept nine person in my employ, and do now—I cannot say that all the West-end chimney-sweepers have been in my employ—I have some who have been in my service twenty years—it is between ten and eleven years since Roach left my service—I know nothing against him.

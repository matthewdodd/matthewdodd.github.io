. The Evidence depos'd, the Prisoner came with a Man to lodge at the Ram in Smithfield


, and after they had been in the Room some Time, they pretended not to like to lodge there, they came down, and one of the Servants perceiving something of Linnen hang below her Coats, ran up, and found one of the Sheets gone, whereupon they detain'd her, set her down, and the Sheet was drop'd under the Table. This was confirm'd by another Evidence. The Prisoner pretended, That she went with a Friend to the Ram Inn to sup, and he resolving to lie there, her Friend desir'd her to go up with him to see if he was to have a good Bed, but the Servant demanding 3 s. for the Night, they came away, and after she was gone away one of the Men came after her and carried her back, and the first Evidence told her, he heard she was going to lay a Child to him, which if she did, it would be the Ruin of him, and to prevent her doing that he would transport her; that upon that another came and said, she had done enough already to be transported, for there was a Sheet stolen, and so took up a sheet from under the Table, but she knew nothing how it came there. The Jury found her 

               guilty
             of the Indictment 


               Transportation

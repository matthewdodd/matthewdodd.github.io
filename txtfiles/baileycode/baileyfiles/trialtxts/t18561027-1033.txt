RICHARD EDWARD FELSTEAD
. I am thirteen years old, I live at No. 26, Merlin-place, Wilmington-square, I am errand boy to Charles Hawkins, a watch gilder, in Perceval-street On 14th Oct, I was sent out by my master with some work, about ten minutes before 8 o'clock—I went to Powell-street west, and delivered some work all right—I had some move, and as I went to deliver the other work, I saw the prisoner at the corner of President-street—from there you can see into Powell-street—if the prisoner had watched he could see where I went to—he spoke to me, and asked me to tell him where Mr. Johnson, the dial painter, lived—I told him I did not know—I was alone at that time—another boy then came up who had come out of our place—he asked him the same question, and he did not know—the other boy went in another direction, and I was going on, and the prisoner called me back, and asked me to go to the corner of Powell-street with him—he said, "Come with me to the corner"—when we got there, he said, "See what number that is"—I looked, and said, "No. 49"—he said, "Knock at the door, I think he lives there"—I stood up to knock, and he hit me suddenly on the top of the head—I had this cap on—he knocked me to the ground—it was a hard blow; it stunned me for the moment—I had my bag containing the goods I had to deliver—the string of the bag was round my neck, and the bag was tied in my apron strings round my waist—the prisoner forced the bag off my head—I did not feel anything as he was getting it off—I did not know where I was till I saw him at the corner of Powell-street—I got up, and ran after him, and called, "Stop thief!"—I saw he had my bag with him when he turned—I do not know what became of it—I did not see him stopped—I had just turned the corner, and two gentlemen had stopped him—when he turned into Powell-street I lost sight of him—I turned into Powell-street—I saw him again—he turned the corner to go up Goswell-street—he was running.


COURT. Q. How for is it from the corner of Powell-street to Goswell-street? A. About sixty yards—I continued to cry out—I lost sight of him when he turned into Goswell-street—I ran up Goswell-street—from the place where I lost sight of him to the place where I saw him in custody is about 100 yards—I had the bag given me by some one—this is it—it contained watch materials.

Cross-examined by
MR. RIBTON. Q. Had you ever seen the prisoner before? A. No, I know the other boy's name is Cark—he came out of our place, and joined me about three minutes after the prisoner spoke to me—he walked on with me, and the prisoner walked on with us—the blow did not cut my head—I was stunned, and was insensible about three minutes—I fell down, and shortly afterwards recovered myself—when I got up the prisoner was in sight just at the corner going into Powell-street—he was then about sixty yards from me—I could see that distance—there was a lamp alight—I saw my bag in his hand—it was a blue bag—I saw no one else running—I found two gentlemen had taken him—there are a great number of little streets about there.

COURT. Q. Was there any lump on your head? A. Yes, about the size of a walnut, just on the top of my head—I did not see whether the prisoner had got anything in his hand.





ARTHUR GENGE
. I live at No. 21, St. John-street, Clerkenwell, and am a tailor. On 14th Oct., about 8 o'clock, I was at the corner of Upper Charles-street, leading into Goswell-road—I heard a cry of "Stop thief!" and "Murder!" and "There he goes!"—I saw the prisoner coming from Powell-street west, running fast, and crying, "Stop thief!"—he had something like a bag in his hand, and as he got further into the road, he threw it away-followed him, and never lost sight of him till I caught him by his right hand collar—I came up to him at the same time as another man did—I saw the constable arrive from President-street—I saw the boy come up just after the constable had got hold of the prisoner's collar—the boy was crying for his master's bag and property—he laid hold of the prisoner directly he came up—he was very much frightened—this is such a bag as I saw the prisoner throw away.

Cross-examined. Q. What distance were yen from him when he threw it away? A. As near as I am to you—I did not see anything of it after he threw it away, till a gentleman brought it up just after the boy arrived—when the constable came up, I said to him, "You lay hold of him; you will soon hear what it is about"—I am quite sure I saw the prisoner throw away a bag very much resembling this—I could not swear it was this bag—it was something in the shape of a bag—I can swear it was not a mere motion of his arm—both his hands went together—I saw a bag go out of his hand.





WILLIAM MARSHALL
. I live in William-street, Peter-street, and am a watch engraver. On the night of 14th Got, I was standing three or four yards up Powell-street west—when I had been there a minute and a halt or two minutes, I heard a child halloo, "Stop thief!"—I thought it was some boys at play in the square—presently the prisoner came running along on the opposite side to me—I crossed the way, and followed him—as he passed me I saw he had something in his left hand—I could not tell exactly what it was, but when I saw this bag I could tell it was most likely to be that—it was something dark—the prisoner hallooed, "Stop thief!" himself; but no one had passed there before the prisoner for a minute and a half before—I followed close behind him, and saw something fall in Gosfwell-road—I kept up close with the prisoner; and saw him caught by two or three persons

altogether, at the corner of President-street—the boy came up, and instantly said, "That is the man," and cried for his master's work.




GUILTY
. Aged 20.—


Transported for Fifteen Years.

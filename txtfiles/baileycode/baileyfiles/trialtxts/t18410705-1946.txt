1946. 




CHARLES BALLAM
 and 




PATRICK STANTON
 were indicted for

 stealing, on the 
30th of June, 3 spoons, value 5s., the goods of 



James Allett Leigh; and that Ballam had been before convicted of felony.






SOPHIA UPTON
. I am servant to James Allett Leigh, of Upper Kennington Green. These three spoons are my master's—I placed them on a waiter on a chest of drawers, near the kitchen window, about eleven or twelve o'clock, on the 30th of June—I was away for a short time—when I came back the window was open, and these spoons were gone.





JAMES BROOKS
 (police-constable L 14.) I was on duty near Vauxhall-Gardens—I saw the prisoners, and watched them—(hey went into a number of gardens with pencils in their hands—they went to the prosecutor's—Ballam went to the kitchen window, and Stanton stood at the gate—Ballam came out, and showed something to the other—they ran, I pursued, and took them, and found these spoons in Ballam's pocket.





CHARLES BURGESS GOFF
 (police-constable L 31.) I produce a certificate of Ballam's former conviction, which I got from the office of the Clerk of the Peace, at Surrey—(read)—the prisoner is the person.

ROBERT HOLLAND
. I was in Drury-lane on the 24th of November, at half-past eleven o'clock in the evening—I felt a touch at my pocket, I turned, and the prisoner was close behind me—there was no one else near me—I seized him—he said he had nothing, and I might search him—I was going to do it, when a boy at a window gave me my handkerchief.





JOHN STALLARD
. I was in Drury-lane, and saw the prosecutor there—the prisoner threw the handkerchief at me—I did not see him take it from the prosecutor, but he threw it at me—I did not see him take it from my prosecutor, but he threw it at me from under his waistcoat—It fell at my feet, and the prosecutor took him.

Prisoner's Defence. I never touched it—he did not see me throw it from under my jacket—I had been to the play, and was returing, when this gentleman caught hold of me.




GUILTY
. † Aged 18.—


Transported for Seven Years.

JOHN KELLY
 and 



WILLIAM SHEPHERD, alias
 Ward

, were indicted for

stealing, on the 
23rd of July, 1 truck, value 3l. 10s., the goods of 



Robert Warry.






ELIZABETH WARRY
. In the middle of July last year, the prisoner Shepherd came to my house to borrow a truck by the hour—he said ais name was Smithers, and he lived in the Strand, and was a cleaner and dyer—that his cart was under repair and he wanted a truck—he said he kept a porter and would send him for the truck—in about an hour Kelly came—he called himself his porter—he brought a note signed Richard Smithers, 364, Strand—(read)—"To Mrs. Warry, No. 2, Dean-street.—Please let the bearer have a truck which I named to you." I am, &c.
"364, Strand. "RICHABD SMITHERS."

Witness. My son gave the truck to Kelly in my presence—Shepherd was to have it at so much an hour—he said he should want it about six hours a day, while his cart was under repair—I did not see it again, nor the

prisoners, until the 13th of last month—it is the property of Robert Warry, my husband.





WILLIAM GAGER
. I am servant to Mr. Jacks. In July last year, the prisoner Kelly brought the truck to my master's door, and be bought it of him. On the 13th of June I was going up Fleet-street with the same truck, and a young man got out of a cart and said it was his father's.





WILLIAM HUMMERSTONE
 (police-constable C 65.) From information I took Kelly, he said that he fetched the truck from Warry's by the direction of a man of the name of Shepherd, and sold it to Mr. Jack, of Wapping.

Kelly. I was employed to do it—I did not know it was wrong—I did not know that it was the same truck that I sold—it was broken up.





ELIZABETH WARRY
. The front board which had our name on it was broken off when I saw it again.

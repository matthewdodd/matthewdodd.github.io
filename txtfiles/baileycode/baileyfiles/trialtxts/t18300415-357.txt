            . I was close against St. Dunstan's-church, in Fleet-street


; a person touched me. and asked if I had lost any thing - I felt my pocket and missed my handkerchief, which I had put there but a few minutes before the officer produced it; it is a very old one, and before I went out, I had torn this piece which I have here from one of the corners.

            . I gave the prisoner into custody to the City officer - I saw him put his hand into his pocket; he then fell back and put this handkerchief into his insidegreat coat pocket, and when I seized him he took it out and threw it down - I did not see him take the handkerchief from the prosecutor, but he took it from his own pocket and threw it down; he endeavoured to get away -I tried to pick up the handkerchief, and he kicked me.
Prisoner's Defence. I was going home - that young man accused me of picking the gentleman's pocket, which is a falsity.

GEORGE LEONARD. I am a boat-builder
, and live at Poplar


. On the 26th of September I lost a pair of oars out of my shed, which was locked; I had placed them there about one o'clock, and, at a half-past seven, when I left work. I saw the prisoner and another about two hundred yards off, with them on their shoulders; I looked at the mark - they threw them down, and ran away; I pursued, and took the prisoner - they must have got over my wall.(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. A man asked if I could row - I said, Yes, and he fetched the oars, but where from I do not know.

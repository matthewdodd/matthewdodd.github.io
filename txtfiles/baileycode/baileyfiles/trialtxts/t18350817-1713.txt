 was indicted

 for stealing, on the

WILLIAM MATTHEWS
. I live in Sun-street, Bishopgate-street, and am shopman to Mr. Samuel Adams. About twenty minutes before ten o'clock, on the 7th of August, I was in the shop, and saw the prisoner enter, I called to him distinctly three times—he did not attend, but took a hat off the stand within the door—he escaped with it—I ran out, and overtook him, and collared him—he used great violence to me with the hat, and broke it all to pieces—he threw me down three or four times, and cut my lip—I still held him till the officer took him—my neighbour took up the remains of the hat.





DANIEL PAMPLET
. I received the prisoner in charge at the watch-house, and have the hat.





JOSEPH MORRIS
. I was returning to my master's, and saw several young men about. I watched, and saw the prisoner take the hat from the shop—I took the hat up—this is it.

Prisoner's Defence. I was very much in liquor.





DANIEL PAMPLET
. No, he was not.




GUILTY
. Aged 23.—


Transported for Seven Years.

                  Nicholson 
               



            . I live in Greek-street, Soho


. The first time I missed the things was on the 24th of October. My maid, 
               
                  Elizabeth 
                  Anson 
               



            , had then left me. I sent to her; she came to me.
I asked her if she knew of the things. I then missed a napkin and two table-cloths. She said she had let the prisoner come into the house on mornings unknown to me. She went and found the prisoner, and brought her to me; who, upon being asked concerning the things, confessed to the taking them, and several other things that I had not missed. She said my maid had let her in to help her one morning, and she had taken them at different times. She had a cheque apron on, 
               
                  Rachel 
                  Eveling 
               



            's property. She had pawned the other things at five different pawnbrokers. I sent the money by my maid 
               
                  Margaret 
                  Porter 
               



             along with the prisoner, and they went and got the things out. [The goods mentioned in the indictment produced in court, and deposed to]. The prisoner owned before Justice Welch, that she had taken these things away.
Q. Where had these goods been used to be left?
M. Nicholson. some of them used to be in the parlour in a chest of drawers, and some were in the foul cloaths bing.


                  Elizabeth 
                  Anson 
               



            . I was servant to Mrs. Nicholson, and left her service the 24th of October. I always took the prisoner to be a very honest girl. I let her into my mistress's house four mornings to help me forward with my work; they were the Monday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, and I went away the Saturday night.
Q. How long was she in at a time?
E. Anson. Not above an hour in the morning. I let her in about seven o'clock, and she did business in cleaning the parlour and kitchen.
Q. Did you leave her alone?
E. Anson. I did. I never saw any thing about her when she went away. I know all these things here produced to be Mrs. Nicholson's property. I found the prisoner in St. Giles's after my mistress sent for me, and asked her if she knew any thing of the things missing. She owned she had taken them, and they were in pawn; and said she had not money to fetch them out. She went with us when they were taken out; at a pawnbroker's in Hanover-yard we had two table-cloths; at another in St. Giles's we had two napkins, a cap, and a few odd things; at another in Smart's Buildings we found a shift. The prisoner had 
               
                  Rachel 
                  Eveling 
               



            's apron on when I found her.


                  Margaret 
                  Porter 
               



            . I succeeded 
               
                  Elizabeth 
                  Anson 
               



            . I was with her and the prisoner at the taking the things out of pawn. She confirmed the account of Anson.
Prisoner's Defence.
I was out of place, and 
               
                  Elizabeth 
                  Anson 
               



             asked me to come and help her till her mistress was got up. She had no money to give me, and she gave me these things till she got her wages; and, as she was a married woman, I thought thy were her own.
Prosecutrix. The justice asked the prisoner if 
               
                  Elizabeth 
                  Anson 
               



             knew any thing of her taking the things. She said the maid was innocent, and knew nothing of it; and that she took them out of my house herself.



               Guilty

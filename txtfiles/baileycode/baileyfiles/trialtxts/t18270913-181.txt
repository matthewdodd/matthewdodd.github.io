JOHN COOPER. I am a sawyer
. I was at work for Mr. Meggs, in Kingsland-road


. I left three saws and a line, in the saw-pit house where I was at work, about six o'clock, on the 16th or 17th of August; I fastened the door after me, and when I returned the next morning, the place hadbeen broken open, and the tools were gone - the saws were found at a saw-maker's, in Whitechapel, a day or two afterwards.

            . I work for Mr. Hughes, a saw-maker, of Church-lane, Whitechapel. I bought these saws of the prisoner, as old steel; they weighed 171/2lbs. I gave him 11/2d. a lb. for them. I did not ask him whether they were his - I considered them as old saws - and, being worn out, I bought them.

WILLIAM COGGAN BOLTON. I live in Furnival's-inn. On the evening of the 30th of June, about five o'clock, I was in Chandos-street


, and felt some person push me on one side, and presently the prisoner came before me - she muttered something which I did not understand, and upon surveying me, she took my handkerchief from my breast-pocket, and ran away - I saw her run into a house; I found the constable, and she was taken.
Prisoner. You went home with me - you had no money, and left the handkerchief with me. Witness. I had not the slightest conversation with her.

            . The prisoner came to me, and gave me this information; I went into the house with him, and the prisoner was standing in the yard - I took hold of her, and behind her there was a cellar, and I saw the handkerchief down there - I got it up; she said, "For God's sake let the gentleman forgive me."

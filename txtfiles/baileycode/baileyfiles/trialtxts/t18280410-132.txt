. On the 31st of March, I was coming from the back of the house, and saw the prisoner leaving the front area door; I knew he had no business there, and followed him, calling Stop thief! he stopped about half a dozen doors off, and asked what I wanted; I said he had something, which he had no business with; he said he had not, and I might search him, which I did, and found the spoons and forks, in his breast pocket - he said distress drove him to it; they are my mistress's, and had been in a closet in the pantry.

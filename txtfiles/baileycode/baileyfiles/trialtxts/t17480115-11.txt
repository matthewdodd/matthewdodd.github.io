                  Long 
               



            . On the 24th of December I lost a pair of leather shoes, a hammer and two knives out of my stall in Piccadilly


, for in the morning I found my stall broke open, and the things gone.

                  Skate 
               



             , Watchman. About two o'clock in the morning the Prisoners asked me what it was o'clock; I said past two, and that it was time for all honest people to be in bed: I heard a noise afterwards, and some time after that I found the stall had been broke open; about three o'clock I saw the Prisoners at the bar come back again, and having a suspicion of them I took them, and found the things.
Q. When do you think it was broke open?
Skate . About half an hour after two.
Q. Who did you find the things upon?
Skate. Upon 
               
                  Elizabeth 
                  Maybank 
               



            .
Pris. Maybank. I was going to market, and met the other Prisoner with some things under her arm, and I bought a pair of shoes of her I have no witness to prove it.

             . I have known 
               
                  Sarah 
                  Jones 
               



             almost these six years; she sells fruit about the streets in summer, her mother keeps a green-stall , and I believe the Prisoner got her bread in a very honest way; I live within a stone's throw of her.

            . I have known 
               
                  Sarah 
                  Jones 
               



             about seven years, I live just by her, and never heard any thing but that she was very honest, and got her living by selling fruit and other things.

            . I have known 
               
                  Sarah 
                  Jones 
               



             about a year and an half, and she always behaved very well; I know she has had money lent her to buy goods, and when she could not buy the goods she carried the money back again, and if she was discharged, I would trust her as readily as I did before.

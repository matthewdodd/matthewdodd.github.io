 last. The Prosecutor deposed, that the Prisoner (who lodged just by him) was drinking in his House the 11th of March at Night and staying longer than ordinary could not get into his Lodging, whereupon he came back again and set up in his House all Night, and staid till the next Day in the Afternoon, when he went up to lie down on the Bed; that his (the Prosecutor's) Wife told him she saw the Prisoner on the top of the House, which made him suspect him; that when he came down he stopt him and found the Perriwig in his Pocket, one Shirt in  his Breeches, and the other on the House where he had been seen. The Constable deposed that the Wig was delivered to him when he came; and that he saw the Shirt taken out of his Breeches; the Wig and Shirt were produced in Court, and swore to. The Prisoner in his Defence said, it was a malicious Prosecution, the Prosecutor and himself having quarrelled and fought; and that he had set up drinking Brandy and Fine Ale from 7 a Clock one Night till the same Hour the next; and called several to his Reputation. But the Fact being fully proved, the Jury found him

WILLIAM THOROGOOD
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
19th of November, a quarter of a pound of cigars, value 2s. 6d., the goods of 



Henry James Jones; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






HENRY JAMES JONES
. I keep a tobacconist's shop in St. John's Square, Clerkenwell. On the evening of the 19th of November, I was in the parlour behind the shop—I saw the prisoner in the shop with his hand in the window—he took a bundle of cigars, which weighed about four ounces—there were about 40 in the bundle—I charge 2s. 6d. for them—he left the shop with them, and I followed, calling "Stop thief"—the prisoner was taken in the next street, and brought back to my shop—on the way back I found the cigars scattered on the footpath in the court which he had run through, in the same direction in which he had run—these are the cigars—they were tied up in a bundle, with a ribbon—the tie has not been found.





JOHN ARCHER
 (police-constable G 150.) I was in St. John-street, and heard a cry of" stop thief"—I stopped the prisoner, who was runnings—I found the cigars in the court through which the prisoner ran.






EDWARD PARFITT
. I am a jeweller, and live in Clerkenwell Close. I saw the prisoner in the prosecutor's shop, about six o'clock in the evening—I saw him put his hand in the window and take the cigars away—I immediately followed him, crying "Stop thief"—tine policeman took him—I followed the prisoner up Jerusalem Court—he turned and threw down something, and when we came back with the policeman, I pointed out the spot, and the cigars were discovered scattered on the stones.





JOHN WITHERFORD
 (police-constable A 22.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got at Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person who was then tried and convicted.




GUILTY

            . On Wednesday, January 21, about a quarter after six in the evening, I came home, and found many people about my door; I was told a man had stoln a hat from me.
Q. Where do you live?
Chamberlayne. I live on Ludgate-hill


, and am a hatter
; a man had hold of the prisoner, so I fetch'd a constable, charged him, and took him before my Lord mayor; and he had nothing to say for himself.


                  Samuel 
                  Nichols 
               



            . I was coming up Ludgate-hill, and saw the prisoner and two men come out of the Bell-savage yard. I saw him go into Mr. Chamberlayne's shop, take a hat off a nail, and come out. I went and took hold of him, when he drop'd the hat, and one Mr. Anderson brought it to the prosecutor.


                  William 
                  Anderson 
               



            . I was going by at the time, and saw the prisoner going to cross the channel. Nichols said, Now you have got it, you shall not take it away. The other said, let me alone. The prisoner drop'd a hat, and was going to take it up, but a young man took it up, and gave it to me, and I carried it to the prosecutor's house.
Prisoner's Defence.
I was going by the door, and the gentleman accused me with taking a hat, but I know nothing of it.



               Guilty

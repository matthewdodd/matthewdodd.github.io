             sworn.
I saw the prisoner get over the pales the 6th of this month, between twelve and one, he pulled a petticoat off the line, and put it into this bag, which he took from his pocket; he put four sheets also into the bag, which he took from the same place; when I attempted to stop him, he left the bag in the ditch and run. I hallooed stop thief! he was taken. I took up the bag, and have had it ever since.
- PERRY sworn.
I am a gardener, I was in my master's garden, I heard somebody cry stop thief! I saw the prisoner run down the orchard, and jump over a brick wall; he had passed the ditch when I saw him run, I stopped him; seven or eight minutes afterwards I saw the property.

PRISONER's DEFENCE.
Your Lordship, I know nothing of it any more than the child unborn; if that man can swear against me, after taking me a mile and a half off, he can swear any thing.

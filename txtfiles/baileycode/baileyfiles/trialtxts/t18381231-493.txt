EDWARD JOHNSON
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
28th of December 1 box, value 6d., and 2lbs. weight of cigars, value 2l.; the goods of 



John Rogers.






CHARLES HENRY CURRY
. I am a servant, but am out of a situation. On the 28th of December I was in Oxford-street, looking in at Mr. Rogers's shop-window—I saw the prisoner standing by the side of the counter—he put his hand two or three times to where a box was standing on the counter—he then took the box, put it under his right arm, and ran down Great Chapel-street and Compton-street, with another person—I lost sight of them—I went down several streets, and did not see them—in coming back I saw the prisoner—he went on to Charles-street—I went and took him—he had a bundle, which he threw into the road—I took it up, and found it was this bundle of cigars, in a white apron.

Prisoner. Q. Why did not you take me when I came out of the shop? A. In consequence of the mob of people.





GEORGE ROGERS
. My father, John Rogers, keeps this shop—I was up stairs at the time—I missed a box from the counter, containing about 2 1/2 lbs. of cigars—these cigars which are found are about 2 1/2 lbs.—the box has not been found—they are a particular sort of cigars—and I missed just this quantity—my father was in the counting-house.

Prisoner's Defence. I was coming up Charles-street, and a young man behind me threw the bundle into the road—the gentleman took hold of me and took them—I know nothing about them.




GUILTY
.* Aged 18.—


Transported for Seven Years.

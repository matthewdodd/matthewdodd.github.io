            . I am an auctioneer
. On the 7th of June, about eleven o'clock at night, I went to Whitechapel-market


, and was bustled by two or three men, in Whitechapel; I felt a drawing at my fob, and laid hold of my chain, the prisoner laid hold of my seals, and by a sudden jerk snatched them off the ring, the ring gave way; he got away afterwards - I took him and never lost sight of him - He said he had thrown the seals into the mud.

            . I am a constable. About ten o'clock at night, I saw the prisoner and several more men together; in consequence of several robberies having taken place there, I followed them, and saw the prisoner and three others run against Billet near Petticoat-lane, the prisoner made a snatch at his watch. I secured him; he said the seals were on the ground.

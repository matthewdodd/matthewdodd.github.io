            . I am servant to the Dean of Raphoe, who lives in Orchard-street


. On the 12th of June, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I found the prisoner behind the door in the housekeeper's room, with the waiter in his hand; he said he was begging for bread, and took it up to look at it. I suppose he must have got in at the area, which leads into the room. I sent for the Dean.
REV. RICHARD ALLOTT. I am Dean of Raphoe. I was called down, and found the prisoner behind the door, with the waiter in his hand, and gave him in charge.

WILLIAM JORDAN
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
14th of January, 2 boxes, value 6d.; 1 3/4lb. weight of cigars, value 1l. 1s.; the goods of 



Elizabeth Soper: and that he had been before convicted of felony.






ELIZABETH SOPER
. I am a widow, and keep a shop in Princes-street, Ratcliff-highway. On the 14th of January I saw the prisoner come to my shop window—he looked in—he staid about a minute and a half, then went away, and came again—I afterwards saw him in custody—I missed two boxes of cigars from the counter—these are them—(examining them) and the labels that were on them.





CORNELIUS FOOT
 (police-constable H 98.) I was in Pennington-street on the 14th of January, about eight o'clock, in the evening—the prisoner and two other boys passed me—after they bad passed I found an empty cigar box with a label on it, and in about five minutes the prisoner came running along with this other box of cigars under his arm—I took him with it.

Cross-examined by
MR. PAYNE. Q. You saw them running, and then in five minutes after you saw the prisoner again? A. Yes—they turned round a street, and came round again in the same direction—this was about two hundred yards from the prosecutrix's shop—the prisoner said a man in Old Gravel-lane gave them to him to carry, and was to give him 2d.





WILLIAM STOTTER
 (police-constable M 186.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got at Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 17.—


Transported for Seven Years.

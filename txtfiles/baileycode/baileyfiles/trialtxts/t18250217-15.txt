WILLIAM FARMER. I am a cooper
, and live at Little Chelsea


. I missed three pails on the 19th of January, about six o'clock in the evening - it was dark: I saw them again between seven and eight, on the prisoner's shoulder. No person was at home at the time but my wife. I asked where he got the pails; he said he found them under some trees in Chapel-row. I gave charge of him.

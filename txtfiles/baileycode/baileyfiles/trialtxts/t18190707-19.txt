MARSHALL ROBINSON, ESQ. On the 17th of June, about one o'clock in the day, I was walking in Bedford-square


, felt something pull my coat behind, turned round, and charged the prisoner with picking my pocket - he had his hand behind his back - I took hold of him, and he instantly gave me my handkerchief, said he was very sorry, but he did it from distress, and if I would let him go he would never do so again; two others were with him, who went off. I took him to Marlborough-street.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. Two men were following the gentleman, one of them threw the handkerchief over his shoulder, and I picked it up.

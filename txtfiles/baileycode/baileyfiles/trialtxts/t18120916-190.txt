NATMANIEL RUTH. I live in Norton Falgate


. I lost the hats on the 18th of April. The prisoner came to me. He is a hatter
 himself. He asked me to let him have some hats to sell. I did. I let him have four of the best hats in the shop. They cost me a pound each. He said, if I would send my servant with the hats, the money should be returned, or the goods. I sent a man and a boy with him. The man came back as if he had been drinking, and the boy crying, said, he had lost the four hats.
JOHN TOMS. The prisoner took the hats from me, and went into a public-house, called for a pint of beer, and went out with the hats. I did not see him for some time, and when I did I brought him back to my master.
- . I and the boy went with the prisoner with some hats, and at the Nag's Head the prisoner and the boy went out together. I never saw the prisoner afterwards.
Prisoner's Defence. I took four hats, and went from one public-house to another to dispose of them. I found myself the worse for liquor, and finding that I had not sufficient money to pay Mr. 
               Ruth
             I did not return, and may God, of his infinite mercy, direct you to do what is right.

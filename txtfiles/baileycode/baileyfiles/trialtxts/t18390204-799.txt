JOHN TOPPER
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
7th of August, 1 shawl, value 6s.; and 1 pair of spectacles, value 18s., the goods of 



John Plummer, his master.






SUSAN PLUMMER
. I am the wife of John Plummer, a cotton manufacturer, in Tower-street. His manufactory is in Golden-lane—the prisoner had been in our service about eight years as an engineer—we missed the shawl and spectacles.





CHARLES WOODHAM
. I am in the service of Mr. Boyce, pawnbroker, in Great Charles-street, New Cut. These spectacles were taken in by a young man who has left us, and this is the duplicate of them—(looking at one.)





BENJAMIN MEECHAM
. I am in the service of Mr. Walter, pawnbroker in Aldersgate-street. I produce a shawl—I cannot say who pawned it—this is the duplicate of it—(looking at one.)





EDWARD WARE
 (City police-constable No. 79.) I took the prisoner on the 22nd of January, and found on him fourteen duplicates, and amongst the rest, the duplicates of these things.

Cross-examined by
MR. DOANE. Q. They were pawned in August, were they not? A. Yes, both of them.





SUSAN PLUMMER

re-examined. These are my property—the prisoner had access to the place where they were.




GUILTY
. Aged 19.—


Transported for Seven Years.
(There were three other indictments against the prisoner.)

            . On Thursday, the 26th of September, about half past six o'clock in the evening, I was at the back of the warehouse, and hearing a noise at the door, I went out, but could see nothing. I turned up Botolph-lane, and saw the prisoner at the bar with the goods in question on his head; I said to him, my friend, you must come back, you are wanted. In the mean time I sent for an officer.

            . I am master of the Blossom Inn
: I lost some cotton stuff called corderoy, out of the Manchester warehouse; I saw it about the 9th or 10th of December; it was directed to a person in the Strand; the porter could not find the owner; it was brought back and laid on a shelf where we lay goods that we cannot find the owners of; it was stole from this shelf on the 20th of January; I heard the prisoner had some such things in his custody; I had him taken up and carried to the Compter, where he confessed the fact; he was servant to me when he stole them; he told us he carried the corderoy to Bugdens at Hoxton; I sent Jones and Row to search there, and there they found it.

            . When the prisoner was taken to the Poultry Compter I asked him about the things; he said he took them and they were in Bugdens cellar; I went and searched there and found the corderoy, (produces it).
Barlow. I cannot swear to it; I have a bill of parcel of it; when any parcel is wanting I must pay for it.
Robert Row. I was with Jones when he found the goods in Bugdens cellar under the stairs; it has been in my custody ever since.

Owen carried it to Bugdens; I never took any thing out of the yard in my life.

1755. 




JOHN GILDER
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
26th of May, 5 half-crowns, 21 shillings, 2 sixpences, and 4d. in copper, the monies of 




John Turner, his master.






WILLIAM RUSSILL
. I live with John Turner, a grocer, in Clare-street, Clare-market. The prisoner was engaged on the 25th of May to go on errands and give out a few bills—at a quarter before twelve o'clock on that Saturday night I saw him put his hand into one of the tills, and heard the money chink—I then saw him put his hand into one of his pockets—I told Mr. Turner of it the first opportunity.


Prisoner. It was a round piece of tin, it was not a till—it is quite false, Witness. There are three tins that serve as tills on Saturday nights.





JOHN TURNER
. I had the prisoner about two days on this occasion—my young man told me of this—I went behind some chests where the prisoner was, and asked what he had taken—he said, "Nothing"—but having a great many customers, I asked another young man to watch him—I then went to him, and he had found 2s. 5 1/2 d.—he said, "I have just taken this from Jack"—he put it on the counter—the prisoner heard it, and said 1 1/2 d. of it was what his mother gave him, and he went on his knees and begged I would not prosecute him—I searched him at far as I could, and found nothing more—I said I should have the policeman, who came, and found 32s. 6d. in a little private pocket, which the prisoner acknowledged he had taken from me, and then he went on his knees again.





RICHARD LESLIE
 (police-sergeant T 15.) I was called in, and saw the prisoner on his knees, begging to be forgiven—in the fob of his trowsers I found this money—I asked How he came to take it—he said it was temptation.
(The prisoner received a good character.)

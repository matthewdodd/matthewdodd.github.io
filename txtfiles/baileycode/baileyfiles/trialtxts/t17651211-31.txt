Mrs. Lamb. I am wife to the prosecutor. We keep a haberdasher's shop
 in Drury-lane


. The two prisoners came in the shop on the 13th of November, about six in the evening. Briggs wanted a pair of stockings; I shewed him some. Nothing would do. I went to reach down some black ribb'd; he said there was somebody at the door: he opened the door: the goods mentioned in the indictment were just at the door. Treviss was standing just without the door. I saw him hand out the handkerchiefs and lawn mentioned in the indictment, to the other, who ran away with them. I shut Briggs in, and called my husband down stairs, who kept him while I went for a constable. I went to Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            's, and brought two officers, who took him in charge; then he said the other man was gone to Bennet's-court, and if we were not quick he would sell the things. As they were carrying Briggs from my house to Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            's, Treviss came up to them. They secured him. I am very certain Treviss is the man that received them, I saw his face through the glass very distinctly. Briggs asked Treviss, what he had done with the handkerchiefs and lawn. Treviss's answer was, he had lumped them. We never found our goods again.

            . I am the prosecutor. As we were carrying Briggs along, Treviss came and looked him in the face. Mr. Street secured him. When we were got in at Sir John's, Briggs winked to me to come high, to hear what Treviss said; then he asked him what he had done with the goods; Treviss answered he had lumped them. I desired Sir John to ask him the meaning of lumping; Briggs said, lumping was pawning.
Mr. Street. I was at a public house, near Sir John's. Mrs. Lamb came in, and said she had got a thief in her shop. I went with her. I knew Briggs. I said, what have you been at; he said it was one Blinkey, going along to Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            's: the other prisoner came to us; then we took them both together to Sir John's. I heard Treviss say to Briggs in the street, that he had lumped them. The prisoners in their defence both said, they knew nothing of the things.
Both

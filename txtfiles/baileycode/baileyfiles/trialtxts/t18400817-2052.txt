THOMAS GILBERT AUSTIN

I was going along Eldon-street on the 13th of July, witnessing a procession of "Old Friends "—I felt my pocket tugged—I turned, and saw the prisoner behind me—I watched him, and saw him go to Mr. Austin, and from his pocket he conveyed a handkerchief—Mr. Austin went up—he threw the handkerchief away from him, and ran up Long-alley—there were two others with him, who escaped.

Prisoner. You said that two more had it. Witness. I did not say any such thing—I said I saw you take it—the prosecutor went and collared you.

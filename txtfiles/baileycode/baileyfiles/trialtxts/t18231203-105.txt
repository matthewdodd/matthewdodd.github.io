            . I am the wife of Thomas Galloway. On Friday, the 31st of October, I missed this curtain from the back parlour window; we keep the Rainbow, public-house, in Queen-street, Ratcliff




; I found the prisoner in custody with it; he is a stranger.

            . I am a constable. On the 30th of October, at half-past eight o'clock at night, I stopped the prisoner in High-street, Shadwell, with this curtain concealed under his jacket; he said it was his own, and he had had it six months, and had just redeemed it, over the water; but he could not tell me who the pawnbroker was, or where he himself lived.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

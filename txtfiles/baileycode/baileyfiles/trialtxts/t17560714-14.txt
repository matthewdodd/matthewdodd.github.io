            . I am wife to Gowin Williamson. I was brought to bed on a Friday, on Saturday the prisoner wash'd for me, and on Sunday she came for her money; that day I missed a pair of stockings. She came again on the Monday night to help me out of my bed, when I spoke to her to come again on the Tuesday morning, which she did; that morning I missed a shirt. Then I sent to the pawnbrokers about, and at one the corner of Russel-Court I found the stockings and shirt were pawn'd in the prisoner's name. [They were produced in court, and deposed to.]

            . I am a pawnbroker, and live at the corner of Russel-Court. The prisoner at the bar brought a pair of stockings and a shirt, and pawn'd them with me. She brought the stockings on a Monday night, and the shirt on the Tuesday morning following; but they have been out of my custody some time, I can't say they are the same, but they are like them.

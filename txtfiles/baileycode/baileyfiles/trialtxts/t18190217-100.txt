            . I am a publican
, and live in Great Windmill-street, Haymarket


, the prisoner lodged three weeks with me - I let him a bed-room, furnished, at 4 s. per week, I boarded and lodged him - he never paid me any thing, except part of the first week. On the 6th of February he left me - not returning in the evening I went up, and found the door locked and the key gone - I forced it open, missed the sheets off the bed, and three gowns, which had been given to his wife to repair. I received a letter from him, saying he was under the necessity of going to Croydon before he could settle his business. His wife left with him.

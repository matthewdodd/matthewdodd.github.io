JOHN HENRY HEANY
. I keep a turnery warehouse in Crawford-street. On the 29th of September the prisoner came in, about nine o'clock in the morning—he wished to see some toy watches—my wife served him—I saw him take these two boxes of dominoes off the counter, and put them into his cap—I went and asked what he had got—he said, "Nothing"—he went

out—I pursued, and he was taken—he gave me the two boxes out of his cap.
(Mary Oliver, the prisoner's sister, gave him a good character.)




GUILTY. Aged 16.—Recommended to mercy.





Transported for Seven Years.

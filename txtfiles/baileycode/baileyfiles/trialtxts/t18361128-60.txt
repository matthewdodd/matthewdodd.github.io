GEORGE AYLMORE
. I am a letter-carrier, and live in Rahere-street, Goswell-road. On the 28th of October, about twenty minutes after eight o'clock, I was in Aldersgate-street, and lost my handkerchief from my coat-pocket—I turned round, and saw the prisoner passing the handkerchief behind him—I collared him immediately, and also seized a person behind him, to whom I supposed he had handed it; but he made his escape—whether he received it I cannot say—I gave the prisoner into custody—this is my handkerchief—I saw it in his hand.





STEPHEN SADLER
. I live in Glasshouse-yard. On the night of the 28th of October I heard a cry of "Police" in Goswell-street, and received charge of the prisoner from the prosecutor.

Prisoner's Defence. I had something to drink, which overcame me—the gentleman accused me of the robbery, which I denied.





JAMES MURRELL
. I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—I was a witness in April last, when the prisoner was tried—he is the same person mentioned in the certificate.




GUILTY
. Aged 22.—


Transported for Fourteen Years.

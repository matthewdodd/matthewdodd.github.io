JOHN MILLS. I keep a public-house

. The prisoner came into my service on the 13th of May, and last Wednesday I gave her leave to go to the dispensary, as her finger was bad - in consequence of suspicion from her peculiar manner of going out at different times, I went up to her room with my wife, and found in her box a handkerchief with two duplicates in it, one for a handkerchief, pawned the day she came to us, and the other for two sheets - there was nothing else in the box.

. I am an assistant surgeon, and live in Holborn. I was going down Fetter-lane, about two o'clock on the 2nd of August—I saw the prisoner running by me, and heard a cry of "Stop thief"—he ran down a turning—I went after him, and the policeman came up—the prisoner acknowledged he had taken my handkerchief, and said if I would not say anything he would give it me—he took this handkerchief out of a dust-bin—it is mine, and the one I had in my pocket just before





FRANCIS WRIGHT
. I live in Fetter-lane. I saw the prisoner pick the prosecutor's pocket, and gave information.





CHARLES HALL

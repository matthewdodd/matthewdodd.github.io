            . The prisoner picked my pocket of two shillings and upwards, and owned it before my Ld. Mayor. She had bought some flounders of me, and came back to cheapen a cod, and took an advantage, and picked my pocket. Before my Lord Mayor, I swore to two crooked shillings; we found two crooked shillings: in the whole, there were five shillings all but one half-penny. She is twelve years old, as she tells me: I know I had the money in my pocket the minute before she came to me.
The prisoner said nothing in her defence.

, on the 15th of Sept.
 last. It appeared that the Prisoner was Servant
 to the Prosecutor; that she took the Goods and ran away, and being taken, confess'd the Fact. In her Defence at the Bar, she said, that her Master gave her the Cloaths and Money too, for Favours that he often desired of her, when he came to her Bed-side in the Morning to call her up: But for the greater Secrecy, he bade her take a Lodging in some Place where he might conveniently visit her.

She own'd that she did not make this Defence when she was first apprehended; but that (she said) was only because she was then unwilling to disgrace her Master.

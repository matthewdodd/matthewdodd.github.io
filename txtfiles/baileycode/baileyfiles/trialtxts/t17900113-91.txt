I live in Great Windmill-street, St. James's. On Tuesday, January the 14th, between four and five in the evening, I lost a leather strap, with a large quantity of pots.
DENNIS M'CARTY sworn.
On the 5th of January I had information of a great number of pots being carried up two pair of stairs in Star-court: I went up stairs; the door was fast: I got a constable, who is here: I found the pots at No. 2, in Star-court; and the prisoner was putting a lock on the door; when the constable came he broke open the door; and these pots were in a quilt or rug in the bed; and Mr. Freeman took them. I am sure of the prisoner.

             sworn.
I received information, and went to Star-court; and there I found these pots wrapped up in a rug of a bed; the prisoner acknowledged it to be her rug.
Did you tell her it would be better for her to acknowledge it? - Nothing of the kind passed. I found some bits of melted pewter in the ashes.
(The pots deposed to by the prosecutor.)
I missed two dozen.
PRISONER's DEFENCE.
I know nothing at an about them.

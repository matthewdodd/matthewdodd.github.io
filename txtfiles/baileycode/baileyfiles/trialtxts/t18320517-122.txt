            . I live at Enfield


, and am a slop-seller
. On the 24th of April a person asked if I had lost any thing - I looked, and missed a pair of breeches; the constable brought the prisoner to me with them in about half an hour; I had not seen him near my shop.

            . I met the prisoner about ten yards from the shop - he was running, and I suspected him; I did not see him carrying any thing, but I went to the prosecutrix, and asked if she had lost any thing - she said a pair of breeches.

            . I am a constable. I was sent for to the prosecutrix's shop - Haydon was there, and told me if I followed

             I should be all right - I went, and found him in a public-house, with these breeches under his arm.(Property produced and sworn to.)

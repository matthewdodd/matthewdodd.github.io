            . Mr. Moore lodges in my house in Three Arrow-court


. On the 21st of the last month, betwixt 12 and 1 at night, the prisoner was coming down stairs with a six-leaved India screen of Mr. Moore's, I said, what have you got there? he said, a screen that Mr. Count (my husband) had given him, and he was carrying it up stairs; I said, then carry it up, he did, and set it in the same place it stood before.
Q. Did you know the prisoner before?
S. Count. He used to write for my husband, my husband writes for stationers. After that he was charged with taking a pair of breeches that were missing; he owned he did take them, and sold them near the Seven Dials; I went there and found them; he mentioned his selling the waistcoat at another shop, where Mr. Moore found that. (Produced and deposed to by Mr. Moore.)
Prisoner's Defence.
I depended she would not appear against me, so I have brought no witnesses, thinking I should be acquitted. Pray, Mrs. Count, what is my character?
S. Count. He has worked for my husband about six or seven months, he minded his business some little time, he might have earned 30 s. a week, but he latterly neglected his business, and I was afraid he would bring himself to something bad.

            , of St. Sepulchres


, was indicted for 


               feloniously stealing a Silver Watch
            , on the 2d of August
 last, the Property of 
               
                  
                     Richard 
                     Watkins 
                  




                
            .
The Prosecutor depos'd, That a Woman pick'd him up in the Streets and intic'd him to the Prisoner's House, and after some familiarities she took his Watch from him, and having other Things in her Hands let it fall, when the Prisoner at the Bar took it up, but as the falling of it caused the Case to fly off, he got that up himself, but the Body of the Watch, he said, the Prisoner conveyed away, and the next Day he being sent to the Compter, promised he should have it again.


                  William 
                  White 
               



             depos'd, That he heard the Prisoner confess that one 
               
                  Mary 
                  Groves 
               



             took the Watch from the Prosecutor, and she letting it fall he took it off the Ground.


                  Thomas 
                  Le Fever 
               



             depos'd, That he heard the Prisoner say, if the Prosecutor had not took him up he should have had his Watch again.
The Prisoner said in his Defence, That he was very innocent of what they charg'd him with; and to prove himself so he call'd 
               
                  Mary 
                  Gardener 
               



            , who depos'd with an uncommon Share of Assurance, that she herself was a Party concern'd, and the Prisoner knew nothing of the Matter: But her Evidence having but little Weight with the Jury, he was found 


               guilty to the Value of 4 s. and 10 d
            .

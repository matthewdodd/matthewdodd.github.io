I live at No 8, Howard-street, Strand
; on the 5th of June, about seven in the morning, I lost the things in the indictment, as my wife told me; I enquired after the prisoner, who was a servant
 to me, and came the 2d of June to live with me; the prisoner and my wife went that morning to clean a house which I had taken, where I now live; I then lived at No. 2, Water-street, Arundel-street; I went to enquire after the girl, and when I returned, I found her at home at breakfast; afterwards she was taken to the Justice's.

             sworn.
The prisoner was my servant; we went to clean a house about seven in the morning of the 5th of June; I came back that morning before breakfast, I left her at the house; I came to look for a cloak, which I saw in a drawer two days before, the 3d of June; I then went to another drawer, where I had left five guineas, from thence I missed two guineas; there were three left; after breakfast I looked and missed a cap and a pair of ruffles; I had five guineas in my hand, on the Sunday morning the 31st of May; I had not seen it or meddled with it since; the drawer was locked when I went out; I cannot say I never left the drawer unlocked; it was in the parlour; the prisoner came home to breakfast about nine o'clock, soon after I missed the things, my husband was not up, I told him I was robbed; I told her I had missed my cloak but nothing else; I asked her if she had lent it to any body; she said no; and when the constable came she told me where it was; the constable came about ten o'clock, I said nothing to her; when the constable came I heard nothing said to her; she said she had not pawned the cloak, but taken it to a place in Wych-street, but not for what purpose; she said the person's name which she took it to, was Mrs. Collins; my husband went there, the cloak is here.

            . The prisoner told me the cloak was at Mrs. Collins's; I went there and found the cloak; I gave it to my wife and the constable; my wife has had it ever since; (Deposed to) there I found a work-bag, in which was the cap, and the robins, which my wife knows.
(Deposed to.)

             sworn.
I know the black cloak was brought to my apartments from Mrs. Collins's, to alter against Sunday se'nnight by the young woman; she left nothing else, and I never saw the cloak, only as she put it in the chair; I saw the prisoner once before; I do firmly believe it to be the same girl, I am so far sure that I think so.

             sworn.
I did not come home till ten, and then I heard this cloak was brought; I threw it on a box, and the owner came on the Fridayand fetched it, I never opened it, I was so busy: the prisoner brought me some things to wash for her, she brought a work bag, and hung it by the fire side. I knew her by living at a public-house, I believe the work bag was brought on the Friday or Saturday, what was in the bag, I did not know.
Constable. I spoke to the young woman, she acknowledged where the things were, I promised her pardon.
PRISONER's DEFENCE.
I went as a servant to the prosecutor; I was in very great distress, and the drawer being open, I took one guinea, I have no witnesses.

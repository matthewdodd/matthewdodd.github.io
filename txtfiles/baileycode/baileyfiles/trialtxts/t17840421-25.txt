            , No. 106, Oxford-street; on the 7th of April, about seven o'clock, I was bringing a piece of ticking from one Mr. Limes in Milk-street in my cart; I stopped at the
Crown and Mitre, in Little Russel-street, Bloomsbury


; when I went in the piece was in the cart, I left the cart about two minutes, and when I returned to the cart, I found the piece was missing, there was but that one piece; on missing it I looked about the streets to see if I could see any body, the people came out of the house to look for it, and I went home to my master and told him; afterwards I saw the advertisement in the Daily Advertiser about the prisoner at th e bar being detained with a piece of ticking on his shoulders; I went in consequence of that to the office in Hide-street, where the advertisement mentioned, that was the Saturday following when I went to the office in Hide-street.
Who did you find there? - The prisoner and the ticking were both there; I did not know the piece of ticking.

             sworn.
I apprehended the prisoner on Wednesday night the 7th of April, about nine, I met him coming down Portpool-lane, and he passed me with this on his shoulder; I knew him and pursued him, and he run away; I stopped him; he run knowing of me; I overtook him in Bradshaw's-rents, and then he threw this piece down off of his shoulders, I saw him drop it down, I called out stop thief! and some people came out with a candle, and he run into the corner and I took him; I never lost sight of him, there was no thoroughfare in the court, I took up the piece of ticking and him by the collar, I took him to Clerkenwell Bridewell, and the piece of ticking was advertised.
Prisoner. Had not you that piece of ticking in your arms when you came and laid hold of me at the bottom of the court? - Yes, you had dropped it.
- LIMES sworn.
This is the piece of ticking that I delivered to the first witness

                   James
               



            , there is the maker's name and my own private mark what it cost me, and the day of the month when it was bought; I have no doubt of it at all; it was on Wednesday the 7th of this month.
PRISONER's DEFENCE.
I never had the piece at all, I had been to my sister's, I never saw the piece till I saw it at the Justices; I have no witnesses.
Court. This depends intirely on the evidence of Meecham, and it is right to tell you in this case, that there is no reward, so that the witness comes under no influence.

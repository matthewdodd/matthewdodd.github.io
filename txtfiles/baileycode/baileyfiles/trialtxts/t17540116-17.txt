            . I am servant to Mr. Hambleton, a brass founder. The prisoner brought this parcel to sell, [ taking up a parcel.] Dec. 31, about eight at night, it weighed 11 ounces, and the prisoner had fivepence halfpenny for it. As it was patterns and suspicious brass, my master blamed me for buying it, and the prisoner coming by the next day, we took him.
Q. to Prosecutor. What is the value of it?
Jeffery. As old brass, it is worth 5 d. a pound

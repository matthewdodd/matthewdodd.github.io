             - we live in Shoe-lane; the prisoner was in our service. On the 10th of September, about eight o'clock in the evening, when he left work I called him back, and sent for a constable, who found four pieces of copper in his bosom, and one in his pocket - I claimed it; he made no answer: two pieces had been marked.

            . I am foreman to Messrs. Devy. In consequence of suspicion I marked some copper, and placed it behind a wooden trough, where I had found it; it had no business there. I afterwards saw it found upon the prisoner. My master's account is correct.

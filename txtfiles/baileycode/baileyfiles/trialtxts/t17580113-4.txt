            . I am servant to the prosecutors, they keep a grocer's shop


. I saw the prisoner put his arm in at the door, and take a paper of starch from off a butt of currants. I said, friend leave it behind, he put it under his coat and I ran after him, he ran and flung the starch away. I took hold of him at about ten yards running. I brought him back, and took up the starch. This was last Tuesday.
Q. Whose starch is that?
Jones. It is my masters property, I weigh'd it, and had put it there.

1762. 




HENRY WALLIS
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
11th of July, 1 sheet, value 2s. 6d., the goods of 



Thomas George Ricketts; and that he had before been convicted of felony.






THOMAS GEORGE RICKETTS
. I live in Devonshire-street, Lission-grove, and sell fruit. I employed the prisoner on the 11th of July; I gave him sixpence and his tea—I had a box with two sheets in it, and I missed one of them on the Sunday following—I saw him that evening and I asked him about it—he said he had not had it nor seen it—I said the lodgers had seen him go through the passage to the yard three times—he then said he had pawned it at Till's, in the name of Henry Smith—I believe this is it, but there is no mark on it.





GEORGE HALLIDAY
. I am Mr. Till, a pawnbroker. I took in this sheet, in the name of Hentry Smith, for 1s.6d. I have some recollection of its being a young man, I cannot say who.





DAVID LYNCH
 (police-constable D 64.) I took the prisoner—the prosecutor charged him with stealing the sheet—he said it was pawned at Till's in the name of Hentry Smith, and he had torn the duplicate—I went and got the sheet the next morning.





THOMAS HARRISON
 (police-constable D 18.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction—I know he is the man.

Prisoner's Defence. The prosecutor took me out with him at one o'clock, and kept me till six; he gave me some tea and 3d.—he told me to come at ten o'clock, and he would give me some supper—I went, and his wife could not get supper—the prosecutor afterwards asked me when the sheet was—I said I had seen none.




GUILTY
. Aged 17.—


Transported for Seven years.

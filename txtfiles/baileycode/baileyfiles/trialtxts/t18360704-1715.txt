 for feloniously receiving the same, well knowing them to have been stolen; against the Statute, &c.






WILLIAM JEAKES
. I live in Great Russell-street, Bloomsburry, and am an ironmonger. Beesley was my porter—I have been missing several dozens of brass cocks, some cranks, and a great quantity of other things—I gave Beesley in charge—he was taken to the station-house, and said he was induced to take them by Davis—he acknowledged he had robbed me, and sold them to him—they were afterwards produced, and he said they were what he stole.





DAVID PHILLIPS
. I live in St. James's-market. I have seen Beesley go several times to Gee's-court, where Davis lives—I purchased these brass cocks of Davis—they have all the maker's name on them.





WILLIAM JEAKES
. These are similar to what I have, and marked with the maker's name, but they have been taken out of the papers—I cannot swear to them—I have lost a great quantity exactly similar in every respect—they are my taps—they have been taken out of the papers—I cannot swear to them.





GEORGE AVIS
. I took Beesley—I told him I had got a warrant for his place—he then told me I should find one cock there, and he had sold some things to Davis, who had induced him so to do.
Beesley. I did take the cocks, but I bought the screws and other things.

            . I live at No. 7, Finsbury-street


, and am a saddletree-maker. On the 14th of December I was at my parlour window, and saw the prisoner on the other side of the way; I saw him put his hand into a gentleman's coat pocket and take out a handkerchief, which I think had a green ground; he then crossed the road towards my house - I went out and charged him with the theft - he ran off; I pursued him about a yard - he threw the handkerchief at my feet, and was stopped within three yards of me; the gentleman had gone off - I did not attend to him; I do not know his name.

            . I am a Police-serjeant. I was in Rope-maker-street on the 14th of December - Finsbury-street comes into that street; I saw the prisoner running and took him - the witness stated what he had done, and gave me this handkerchief.
The prisoner put in a written Defence, stating that on hearing the alarm he joined in pursuit of a man, who he saw drop the handkerchief, and was taken himself.

            . I am a police-constable. On Saturday, the 24th of April, I was on duty in Regent-street, and saw the prisoner with another person; I knew the prisoner - I laid hold of the other; the prisoner ran away - I pursued, took him, and found these handkerchiefs in his hat; I had seen the two go into a shop, and come out - I went to the shop, and asked what they went in for; the people said they could not tell - I found these other two handkerchiefs in his pocket.
Prisoner. I bought a cotton handkerchief, and a man asked me to buy these; I gave him 5s. for them.

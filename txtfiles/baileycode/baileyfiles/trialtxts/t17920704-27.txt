             sworn.
I am servant to 
               
                  William
                   Scott
               



             and

                   Stonehewer
               



            . The prisoner was porter
 to Messrs. Scott and Stonehewer: on the 22d of June, I saw the prisoner about half after seven in the evening. I went to wash myself as usual; the prisoner passed me; he went into the warehouse and I followed him; he put off his working-jacket and dirty apron, and put on his clean ones; and he said to me, I will not wash myself till I get home; I said very well: I stopped in the one pair of stairs warehouse while he shut the top warehouses; it was his business so to do; after he had shut up the top warehouses I heard a rustling among some papers; I came down and informed 
               
                  John
                   Mayhew
               



             and 
               
                  Benjamin
                   Hay
               



            ; we all went up; the prisoner was then in the yard; he came into the yard and began to play among us; he put his hand into his coat pocket, and we were all convinced he had nothing; then the clerks went away; the prisoner then went up to the one pair of stairs warehouse, and he came down again, and I could observe something in his left hand pocket; I told the clerks, and they thought as I did; I said we will all go home; the prisoner stopped before me, and I went close behind him. 
               
                  John
                   Mayhew
               



             and 
               
                  Benjamin
                   Hay
               



             were standing at the door; Mayhew stopped him; he put his hand into his pocket, pulled out a parcel, and bid me untye it: I untyed the parcel and laid it down on the floor; it contained Spanish indigo; the prisoner was stopped till the constable was sent for; it was the same kind of indigo as was kept in that warehouse. I can say it was Messrs. Scott and Stonehewer's property.
Mr. Garrow. Did you tell the lord mayor all that you say now? - I believe I told him great part.
Did you tell the lord mayor about the wrestling? - No, not the whole of it.
Whether you was not distinctly asked before the lord mayor, whether you would venture to swear, whether this might not have been in his pocket when he went up stairs the second time? - I say it could not be in his pocket.
How long is it since you was before the lord mayor? - Near about a week. He was a steady man, had not been drinking; we had three pots of beer among four.


                  JOHN
                   MAYHEW
               



             sworn.
Late in the afternoon, Thompson gave me information that he suspected the prisoner: Mr. Hay and myself went into the warehouse; Wilson was with us. I looked at the prisoner and supposed there was something in his pocket; on his leaving work, I said George, you have some property which you should not have; I took a parcel fromhis left hand coat pocket; he said he did not know that he had any thing about him; I asked him what made him be guilty of such practices; he said it was the first time, and desired I would forgive him.


                  BENJAMIN
                   HAY
               



             sworn.
Corroborated the testimony of the last witness.

             sworn.
I produce the indigo; it has been in my custody ever since.
Wilson. This indigo is Messrs. Scott and Stonehewer's. It is damaged.
(Deposed to.)
Prisoner. I leave it to my counsel.
The prisoner called nine witnesses, who gave him a good character.

Recommended by the jury to mercy, on account of his good character.




               Transported for seven years

                  Price 
               



            . I am a journeyman taylor
, I lost a silver watch the 16th of December last was two years.
Q. Did you ever find the watch again ?
Price. No, I never did.
Q. What is the value of it ?
Price. It is worth 4 l.
Q. How did you lose it?
Price. The prisoner Powel and I were lows, and he and the watch were missing together in the morning; I had left it in my pocket when I went to bed over night; the prisoner quitted his lodging, and I never saw him till last Thursday-morning.
Q. Did you ever-look after him?
Price. I advertised him twice.
Q. What past last thursday?
Price. I charged him with the taking my watch, and he owned it.
Q. What were the words that passed ?

Price. I asked him if his name was 
               
                  Joseph 
                  Powel 
               



             ? he said it was; I asked him if he knew one Price? he said no, he did not. I sent for a constable; he came and took charge of him; then I asked him how he could serve me as he did, to take my things ? his answer was, he was very sorry for it, and owned he took them.
Q. Where was you robbed?
Price. At the house of John Desephant in New-inn-passage; he was taken before Sir 
               
                  Samuel 
                  Gore 
               



            , there he was examined, and said I had agreed for him to pawn the watch; he said he had pawned it in Whetstone-park by Lincoln's-inn-fields, to 
               
                  William 
                  Reynolds 
               



            ; he went along with the constable and me to 
               
                  William 
                  Reynolds 
               



            , and asked for the watch he had pawned in his own name; Reynolds asked him how long ago? he said two years last December; Reynolds said he had sold fifty watches since that time, and possibly that might be one of them; so it was not produced, The time he took my things he took a pair of silver shoe-buckles, value ten shillings, and my pumps, and left his own shoes in the room.
Q. Did any body else lie in that room?
Price. No, nobody else that night; he also took my silver stock-buckle; when I took him up he told me he had sold the buckles in Drury-lane, but could not sell the house, before he went to Reynolds's house; this he said before 
               
                  William 
                  Hoare 
               



             the constable. The night that he robbed the he got up twice, and awaked me; I asked him why he disturbed me? he said he had been drinking very hard, and got up to make water; and a third time he got up and went out, and when I got up I missed the things.
Powel. I will give the court no farther trouble, I took them; I told the buckles in Drury-lane, and pawned the watch to this gentleman, (pointing to the other prisoner:)


                  John 
                  Banbury 
               



            . Yesterday morning I went along with the prosecutor to Mr. Reynold's, and I heard the prosecutor ask him if the constable did not ask him to produce his books, and he refused it ? and he owned it.


                  William 
                  Hoare 
               



            . I am constable; I went with Powel (the prisoner ) and the prosecutor to Reynolds's; Powel asked for the watch he pawned with him; Reynolds asked who he pawned it with? he said, to himself; that Mr. Reynolds first was for letting him have but a guinea and half till said he wanted two guineas, then he let him have it. Mr. Reynolds said he knew nothing of it, it might be so for what he knew; he asked how long it was ago? Powel said it was two years ago; Reynolds said he had sold fifty watches since that. I asked him to produce his books, saying, it might save some trouble, shewing him my search-warrant; but he refused shewing me his books, and took us up stairs, and said, we might search and welcome; he also shewed us in a Buroe several silver watches, and also he shewed us some below, but the prosecutor said none of them was his watch. As far as I could understand Mr. Reynolds behaved like an honest man in a very pretty manner.
Powel

            .
Reynolds 

               acquitted

I perceived she had something in her apron: I had no doubt of it was a great coat I immediately sent for a constable, he examined her apron; it proved to be a great coat, the great coat was taken from her; she must have taken it from the back of the accompting house, about three or four minutes before I saw her in the back part of our premises, we had lost a great many coats.

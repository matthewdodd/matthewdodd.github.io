HENRY COOK. I was in Long-acre


 on the 21st of November, when a man tapped me on the shoulder, and told me I had lost my handkerchief; I felt my pocket, and it was gone. I had it a few minutes before.

            . I was in Long-acre about half-past five o'clock, with Roberts - I saw the prosecutor and the two prisoners about the middle of Long-acre, coming towards Drury-lane; I watched them down Queen-street, to the corner of Wild-street, where I saw Stevenson take the handkerchief; I told Roberts to watch the prisoners while I told the prosecutor; he gave me his direction - I do not know what became of it. I took Hayman afterwards in Long-acre.

            . I was with Bertraun. I saw Stevenson take the handkerchief and run down Wild-street; he dropped it there; I took it up, and he got away; Hayman was about a yard from him when he took it.(Property produced and sworn to.)
HAYMAN'S Defence. Roberts passed me twice, and almost knocked me down - he and the other man then came and took me.

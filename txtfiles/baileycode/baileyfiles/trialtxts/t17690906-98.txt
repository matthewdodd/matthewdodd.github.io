            . On the 6th of this instant I had been at Hockley in the Hole, and coming threw Bartholemew fair


, staring at the Merry Andrew, Mr. Pain clapt me on the shoulder, and said, That man has robbed you, and bid me lay of him. I took hold of the person, which was the prisoner. I saw Mr. Pain take my handkerchief out of the prisoner's breeches.

            . This day se'nnight the prosecutor was in Bartholomew fair, and his wife was on his arm. The prisoner was taking a great deal of pains to show him which was the best show, and all the time making attempts at his pocket. I saw him take this handkerchief out of the prosecutor's pocket, and thrust it into his breeches. Then I told the prosecutor of it. We led him into a public-house, and I took the handkerchief out, which the prosecutor owned. (Produced and deposed to.)

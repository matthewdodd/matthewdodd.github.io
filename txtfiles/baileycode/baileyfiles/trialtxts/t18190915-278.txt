            . I am a labourer
. On the 11th of July, about half-past three o'clock in the afternoon, I was sitting in my chair with my handkerchief over my head. I heard a noise, and saw the prisoner putting these things into his hat, which he had taken off the table. He asked me for some water, and ran out; I followed and took them from him. He made a great resistance.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I went into his house after a woman, whom I was told had gone in there. He pushed me out, and gave me in charge.

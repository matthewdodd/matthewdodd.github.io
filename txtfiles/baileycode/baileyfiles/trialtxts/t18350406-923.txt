CHARLES FRANKLYN
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
23d of March, 1 handkerchief, value 4s.; the goods of 



Henry James Preston: and that he had been before convicted of felony.






HENRY JAMES PRESTON
. I live in Threadneedle-street. On the 23d of March, I was in Picket-street—I lost my handkerchief there—I did not miss it till I was told of it—I went to the prisoner and charged him with having it—I put my hand into his trowsers' pocket, and found it there—this is it.





JOHN CHAPMAN
. I am a painter, and live in Monmouth-court. I was in Picket-street—I saw the prosecutor—the prisoner and another were following

him—the other person took the handkerchief from the prosecutor's right-hand pocket, and gave it to the prisoner—he was a lad about eighteen—he made off when I spoke about it.





RICHARD MARTIN
. I am an officer. The prisoner and the handkerchief were given to me.





WILLIAM HOWELL
. I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from the office (read)—I know he is the man.

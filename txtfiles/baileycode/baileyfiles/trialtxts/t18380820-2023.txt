ISAAC ISAACS
. I am a rag-merchant, and live in Sandy's-row, Spitalfields. On the 19th of August I took the prisoner into my service—I had a reference to a gentleman at the West-end of the town—I went on the Monday following to see if it was correct, and as I came back I found the prisoner in the act of going away—I found her concealed in the privy—she was taken to the station-house, and had on her a gold ear-ring, a shift, a black silk handkerchief, and a variety of articles, belonging to me.





NANCY LEVY
. I was engaged as nurse at Mr. Isaacs'. I missed from my box a gown, a collar, a handkerchief, two caps, a comb, and a pair of stockings—they were found on the prisoner's person.





SARAH BACKHOUSE
. I am the wife of a policeman. The prisoner was brought to the station-house on Monday evening, the 20th of August—I found on her a pair of ear-rings, and all the articles named in the indictment.





WILLIAM ROWLAND
. I am a policeman. I apprehended the prisoner,

and found the duplicate of a gown and shawl on her—she said she had given the gown to a dumb woman to pawn.





WILLIAM THOMAS CHINN
. I am assistant to George Barber, a pawn-broker, in Aldgate. This duplicate, found on the prisoner by Rowland, is he counterpart of one I gave for a gown and shawl, which was pledged by dumb woman, a person I have known for some time as a customer.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

The prisoner lodged with me one night, the Wednesday before Christmas day he took half a bed to have it weekly, and while he sent me to enquire after a person I could not find, he robbed the lodgings of these things.
How long was you gone? - I suppose better than an hour, the goods were taken upon him.

I am the prosecutor's wife, I heard a foot on the stairs, I pursued and took the prisoner and found the property upon him, four blankets, three sheets, two blankets, and two sheets had been upon the bed, he said they were his own things, then he said somebody had put them in his bag and taken his things out.
Prisoner. Did I ever go up the stairs or come down without acquainting her of it? - He asked leave to go up and leave this bag, he went up and locked the door and left the key in the place.

             sworn.
I saw him come out with the bag.
Prisoner. My Lord, I had savoys in the bag, and wood and other little things, I tied the bag, and left it up stairs, and I had my dinner in the house, and I went down stairs and left it, and she asked me what I had there, and I said nothing but my own property, I said look at it, so she caught hold of me, I had a word or two with a man that lay there, so the man said he would be even with me, I know nothing of putting them into the bag if I was to die.
How came you to send your landlord of that errand? - The man is a dyer.
The prisoner called one witness to his character.

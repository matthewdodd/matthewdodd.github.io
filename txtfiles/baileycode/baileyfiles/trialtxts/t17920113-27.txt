             sworn.
I am a private gentleman: I had a letter directed to me down in Kent, upon which I came to town last Tuesday, the 9th; 
               
                  Catharine
                   Ratcliff
               



             rents a house of me; I went upon the top of the roof of her house, and I looked at it, and found it almost unroofed, and likewise over the garret and gutter lead; at the Rotation-office the next day I saw the prisoner committed.

I am brother to

                   Ratcliff
               



            ; she rents the house; I lodge there: on the 6th of January, near twelve o'clock at night, I was going to bed, and heard a noise in the next house, a very great rumbling; I said, there is somebody in the next house a-thieving, and I heard the talking; there might be four or five, by the talking; I supposed them to be up stairs, for the noise of the talking came from the top of the house; I went and alarmed Mr. Lack, a baker; I came into my house again, and jumped off a wall ten or twelve feet high, and stood in order to prevent them running away; one Smith came with a light, and we went into one of the houses; we went and rummaged there, and saw nothing of them; then we came to the house next our house, and the first thing we found a great piece of lead rolled up in the yard, ready to carry away; then we went into the shop, and there was another piece rolled up; then we looked round, and found the prisoner under the stair-case, concealed, with his head right in under the stairs; we hauled him out; we had no means to get him but by breaking the door, because the door was locked; I broke the door open with my stick; he was in the shop, and the shop-door goes into the street; he had nothing about him; and then I had him committed: I saw another man get off our house into an empty house; I went all over the houses, and our house; there is a piece taken off the dormer window of the garret; the other two houses were entirely stripped; I tried one of the pieces of lead, and it fitted that garret-window; it was measured; I was present; here is a garden-pot stand, which stood on the lead, and there is the mark of it on the lead; the lead was carried up to the watch-house by the constable; I believe it to be the same now as was taken from the house; the mark of the garden-pot stand is on it now.

             sworn.
I am a plumber: I went to these houses with Mr. Ratcliff on Wednesday, the day we went before the magistrate, and there was a piece of lead missing off the dormer window; I am well satisfied this is the lead; I compared it, and it fitted exactly; there was a bit of lead nailed where they have torn it away; I took the pot-stand, and tried,and am very positive it came from this place.
Prisoner. I would only ask this gentleman, whether, when he found me, I was not asleep, and in liquor; and whether I did not say that it was an empty house, and I had no money to pay for my lodging, and I found the door open.

            . How do you think he got into the house? - No way but by getting over a wall ten or twelve feet high; that is Esquire Maddox's house.
Was the lead found in the same house in which he was, or in the adjoining house? - In the same house where he was; one piece was not above five or six feet from him: not one house is inhabited in the whole buildings, except my sister's.
Prisoner. I want to ask him whether he found any property on me.

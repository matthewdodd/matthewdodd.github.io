 last, and taking from him ten Guineas
            . It appeared that as he was coming by Fleet-street, about six or seven at Night, the Prisoners met him and ask'd him if he would go and drink a Glass of Wine; and he answered, yes, if it was good. Then they went to the Star Tavern in White-Fryers


, and whilst they were Drinking, Precious thrust her Hand into his Pocket, and he catcht her with a Guinea in her Hand. Precious denied the Fact, and said that his Breeches fell down, and the Money fell about the Room, and that she did take up one of the Guineas, which was that which was taken in her Hand. Blewit said that she had none of his Money, nor was not near him. The Prisoners being known to be Night-walkers, and could give no account how they lived; the Jury found them both 

               guilty
            .

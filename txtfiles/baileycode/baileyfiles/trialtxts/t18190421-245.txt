            , who is a weigher in the Custom House
. On the 16th of March, between eight and nine o'clock in the morning, the coats were in the butler's pantry, at a gentleman's house which I have the care of, in Marlborough-street


. My little girl called me; I ran and saw the prisoner in the passage with tracts in his hand, which he wanted to sell. I sent him away, and told him he should have knocked at the door; I bolted the door, and saw him with the coats, on the area steps. I pursued him, and secured him in the street with them - one belongs to 
               
                  William 
                  Hayman
               



            , and the other is my husband's.

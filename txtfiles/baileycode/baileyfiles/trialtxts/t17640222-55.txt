            . Last Tuesday, about seven at night, I was in the Butcher-row, near Temple-bar


; there was a great crowd of people, and the prisoner was behind me; he had a companion with him: the prisoner gave me a shove on one side, and put his hand on my neck, and took my cardinal from my shoulder; then he threw me down; after I had recovered myself, and called Stop thief, he threw the cardinal before him, and the other man took it up, and ran away with it; I should know him again, if I saw him: I never lost fight of the prisoner, till he was taken; I was within 5 yards of him when he was taken; there were some brewers servants putting down beer in Shire-lane; he fell over the ropes, and was there secured: he offered to pawn his coat, or sell a German flute he had, to give me money to buy another cardinal.

            . I was in Shire-lane; I heard the cry, Stop thief; the prisoner ran up the lane, and his foot took a rope that belonged to some brewers servants in striking some beer, and down he fell, and I secured him.
The prisoner said nothing in his defence. He called six people to his character, who said, they never heard any ill of him before.

            . I keep a jeweller's shop
; the prisoner worked for me; I missed the things mentioned in the indictment at different times; I applied to several pawn-brokers to desire them to stop any of the articles that might be offered them, in consequence of which, the cornelian seal and six spoons were stopped.

On the 9th of July, I went out between nine and ten in the morning; I left the prisoner in the room, and I left all my property in a box; I used to see it every Sunday; on the Monday following it was taken; I returned to my lodging about two o'clock, the prisoner was gone off; when I came into my place I found my box was broken open with a hatchet; the hatchet was upon a chair; the prisoner locked my door, and took the key with her; in eight days time I catched the prisoner upon London-bridge; I found my key upon her.

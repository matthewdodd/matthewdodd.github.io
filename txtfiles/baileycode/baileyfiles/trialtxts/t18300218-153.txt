                  , from his person
            .
WILLIAM EDWARDS. I am a patten-maker
, and live at Winchester. I was in London on the 25th of January; I left the Bell and Crown, about eight o'clock in the evening, to go to Union-street, Bishopsgate; I called in Rose-alley, to see a friend, who was not in the way - I told the woman I would go over to the public-house, and wait for him; I went to the sign of the Rose


, and asked the landlord if he knew the person I wanted; he said he believed he did - it was then a quarter before nine o'clock; I had a pint of beer, and then asked for a Welsh-rarebit - I had been at business all day, and was not to say very sober; being very tired I went to sleep - the landlord awoke me, and said, "Come, you must get up. we are going to shut up;" I got up, and in going out of the door, I said."My money is gone - I have lost my money and purse" - the landlord said, "You have not been robbed here" - I said Yes, I had; I had 24s. 6d. in my purse, and 1 1/2d in my waist coat-pocket; I had lost my pocket-book, which contained three 10l. and four 5l. notes, which I had put in at the Bell and Crown. and several papers and letters - I saw the book the next day: the officer showed it me, but not the notes - there were fourteen or sixteen people there - I cannot swear the prisoners were there.


                  THOMAS 
                  PETCH
               



            . I am superintendent of the watch in Bishopsgate. About two o'clock on Tuesday morning, the 26th of January, the prosecutor said he had been robbed of a pocket-book, containing 50l. in Winchester and Bank of England notes; and his purse, and that he had been at that public house; I told him to come to me at eight o'clock in the morning, and I would accompany him to the house to ascertain who had been there - as he did not come at eight o'clock I went by myself to the house - I asked the landlord who had been there, and he could not give me any account - he said he had no doubt he should know the persons if they were brought before him; I went with my brother officer to Rose-lane, Spitalfields, and went into a room on the ground floor, in a house near the top - I found Allen, Relf, Magnus, and Flemare and Lewis who was in bed with another woman; I told Allen I wanted to speak to him - he came out and asked what I wanted; I asked if he had been at the Rose - he said he had been at a public-house; I said I supposed he knew what I wanted him for - he said, "What, for the man that was robbed last night;" I said Yes - he asked if I was an officer, and desired to see my authority; I showed it him, and then told my brother officer to go in and search the room - he called me in; there was nothing but a bed in the room - he placed his back against the door; I searched and found this pocket-book in the bed - it contains every thing but the money - I asked how they came by it, and they all said they knew nothing about it: I took Allen and Relf into custody, because I heard they had been at the place over night - I took them to the Bell and Crown, where the prosecutor was, and he owned the pocket-book; I then went back to the house to get Magnus and Flemare, but they were gone - I brought up Lewis, and two other women, whom I found there, and before the Magistrate, Lewis said she rented the room; we then took them to Worship-street- I went to the Rose, and took Rogers; Lewis said Allen had given her the pocket-book.
Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. And you found Allen in the room with her? A. Yes.
Allen. he came and said he wanted me, and said,"Were you at the Rose?" I said I was - he said, "There was a robbery committed there;" I said, "I am innocent"- I had no objection to go with him. Witness. He mentioned the robbery first, I am quite sure.
ROBERT DICK. I went to the house, and we found all the prisoners there but Rogers - I heard my brother officer tell Allen he wanted him; Allen said, "What, for the robbery at the Rose?" - he said Yes; I said,
"I have known you from a boy, if you act well I will not ill-use you" - I had agreed to meet Relf in Bishopsgate-street; I went there, saw him meet the pot-boy, and speak to him, and as soon as he saw me he set off - I could not follow him, but I met my brother officer, went to Rose-lane, and took them there; I afterwards went to the Rose, and saw Rogers- I called him out, and asked if he knew any thing about a purse - he said Yes, it was a skin purse that Allen gave it to him, and they burnt it.
COURT. Q. Were you in the room at Rose-lane before the officer was? A. We went together - I knocked; the door was not opened, and I pushed it open - I went in; the room was very dark, but I looked round, and saw Allen.
Allen. Q. You say you was with the other officer when he asked me if I knew any thing about the robbery? A. No; he said, "I want you; I suppose you know what for?" and you said, "What, for the robbery at the Rose?"
Allen. When the knock was at the door it was opened - Relf was brushing his shoes; he had not been there five minutes - he asked him where Allen was; he said, "There, by the fire;" I said, "Do you want me?" when they got me outside they said there was a robbery last night, and they wanted me - I said I had no objection to go with him. Witness. I am quite sure he first mentioned the robbery.
Relf. Q. Did not I tell you, if you thought there was any thing, to go in and search? A. Yes, you did.
WILLIAM TURNER. I am landlord of the Rose. I believe all the prisoners were there that night, in company with twenty more, except Lewis; they were there the greater part of the evening, but I did not know any of them by name - I saw the prosecutor come in tipsy, about half-past nine o'clock; I had only been in the house six days - the prosecutor sat at the end of the tap-room; I saw no one near him - he went to sleep after taking a pint of beer.
Allen. Q. Was he not tipsy? A. Yes, very tipsy - hecould hardly get the money to pay for the beer; I stood I suppose, ten minutes before he gave me the shilling, and I gave him the change - they all went out together; they all knew of the robbery before they went - the prosecutor first said he had lost 14s., and then 25s.; he then clapped his hand to his side pocket, and said he had lost his pocketbook and all his property; it was then ten minutes before eleven o'clock - I said, "Upon my word I think you have not lost any thing, as you give such different accounts, but you can go to an officer, and come to me in the morning."
Allen. Q. Did not I go away at a quarter before ten o'clock? A. I do not know.
Magnus. Q. Did you not get me to assist in moving your goods up and down? A. Yes, for two or three days.
COURT. Q. Then he did not come in with the others? A. I do not know that he did, but he was there - I thought he seemed to be industrious, and I asked him to assist me - I let him have 5s. to start him in business to sell oranges, lemons, and clothes.
JOHN GARDNER. I am pot-boy at the Rose. I saw the prosecutor there asleep - Allen was by him at one time, and Rogers was near him at the same time; I do not know that they sat there all the time - I was in and out of the room; I saw them once or twice - they might be near him five or ten minutes; Flemare was sitting opposite him, singing all the evening - the others were a good way off; Relf was near the door - I saw Flemare go out once, that was all; Magnus was just by Flemare -Lewis was there in the evening while the prosecutor was asleep - I suppose she was two or three yards from him, and not at the same table; I heard him say he had been robbed of 14s., and then of 25s. - he then put his hand to his side pocket, and said he had lost his pocket-book.
Allen. Q. Did you see me touch, or take any notice of him? A. No, you were sitting by him - I did not see any of them touch him.
Relf. Q. Did you see me near him? A. No, you sat at the further end of the room,
Magnus. Q. Was not I there with a few oranges? A. Yes.
JURY. Q. Did you see one of them the next morning? A. Yes, I saw Relf, as I was going for some sugar, and he asked what time the soup would be ready - I told him at twelve o'clock - I left him and two or three more talking.
Flemare. Q. Was I sitting near the prosecutor? A. No, you were sitting opposite, and went out about two minutes before the rest; Allenwent out at a quarter-past ten o'clock, and came back just as all the rest were gone - he said he had been to get some money to have something more to drink.
JAMES SHUTTLEWORTH. I am a bricklayer. I went to the Rose about eight o'clock, and sat there till half-past nine; I saw the prosecutor come in, and have some beer, and bread and cheese - I went out, and came back five minutes after ten; I saw Allen sitting by the side of the prosecutor, and Rogers near him, but a girl sat between him and the prosecutor - Lewis was there when I went about eight o'clock.
Cross-examined. Q. You did not see Lewis do any thing with the prosecutor? A. No, nor near him - there was another female with her.

                  HALL
               



            . I am an inspector of the watch. On the night of the 7th of February I took Flemare from information - I put my hand on his shoulder, and said, "I want you;" he said, "What for?" I said,
"If you will come with me, I will tell you" - he walked about one hundred yards, and then ran from me; he was stopped and I took him to the watch-house - he admitted that he was at the Rose on the evening of the robbery; I could not find him before.
Flemare. Q. Was I not in liquor? A. I did not perceive it if he was - it was at half-past eleven o'clock at night.
WILLIAM EDWARDS. This is my pocket-book - I had two purses. one a canvas one, and one was the dried skin of a bullock's heart.
Allen's Defence. I saw the prosecutor come into the tap-room at the Rose - he looked about, and went into the bar; I went to get my pipe filled, and saw him there - he had some bread and cheese in a plate; he came into the tap-room, and sat down at the further end - Relf sat five or six yards from him, and Rogers by the side of him for about a minute; Magnus was sitting there, and Flemare was singing songs - I saw two or three women there, but not Lewis; one of the women shook the prosecutor- I took no notice; she had a plaid cloak, and a white Leghorn bonnet on - in a few minutes I saw her take his arm, and then lay it down - she then went out; I went to light my pipe at the gas, and saw a kind of skin lying - I said to Rogers, "Put it on the fire, it will make a blaze;" I was not half a minute by the prosecutor, and know nothing of the transation.
Relf's Defence. I came out of the Rose with the prosecutor - he said he had been robbed, and would go for an officer; I went home to bed, and went to Rose-lane in the morning - I suppose the officer watched me; I went to get a brush to brush my clothes, to go after a situation.
Rogers' Defence. I was in the house most of the evening - the prosecutor came in at half-past nine o'clock; I was by the fire - there were a great many people, and we sat down to make room; I sat near the prosecutor - there was, I believe, one person between us; Allen picked up a purse, and said to me, "Put that on the fire to make a blaze;" I did so.
Magnus' Defence. I know nothing of it; I went the next morning to get my bag and basket, and was taken.
Flemare's Defence. I went and had a pint of beer, and on coming out I saw a journeyman baker, named Green- he asked if I knew where to find Relf; I said I might find him, and the next morning I went towards the Rose- the man came out and said Relf was not there; I went to Rose-lane, and saw Relf go into the house - I went and told him Green wanted him; I was there smoking my pipe when the officer came.
Lewis' Defence. Allen gave me the book that morning - had I known to whom the book belonged, I had plenty of time to have got away; it was ten minutes before the officer returned and took us.
Allen. If you will allow me to be evidence on the Crown side, I will disclose it all - I know all about it, butI am not guilty of the transaction myself, nor do I believe any one at the bar is.
JURY to 
               
                  WILLIAM

            . Q. Your boy says he saw Rogers near the prosecutor, but somebody was between them? A. Yes, but I do not know who it was - I did not know any one in the room.
Allen. At the time the woman was touching the prosecutor Rogers was not near him.

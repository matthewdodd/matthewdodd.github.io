Charles Hills. I keep a public house
; the prisoner lodged at my house; he went out and took away the key of the room; I heard him come in some time after; then he went away, and I missed the things; I suspected him, and I took him at the Bull and Mouth in Drury-lane the Wednesday following, and delivered him to the constable; then he owned the taking of the things, and named the places where he pawned the shirt, great coat, and marrow spoon.
The several pawnbrokers produced the different articles.
The prisoner in his defence acknowledged the charge, said he had been mate of a ship
, and was out of employment, and in great distress.

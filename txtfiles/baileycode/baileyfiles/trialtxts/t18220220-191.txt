            . I am an officer of Mile End. On Sunday morning, at quarter past six o'clock, I saw the prisoner and another lad at the back of Hull's house; the other one got over the rail, and handed something over to the prisoner, who put it in a bag - the other ran off. I secured the prisoner with the bag, containing the sack and canvass.

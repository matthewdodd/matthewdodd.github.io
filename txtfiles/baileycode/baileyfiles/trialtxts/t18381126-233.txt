JOSEPH BURNBY
. I live at High-street, Deptford, and am a glass-dealer. At a quarter before twelve o'clock on the morning of the 7th of November, I was coming from the back premises and saw the two prisoners at the counter—I called to them and they immediately left the shop—I followed them—I missed four decanters—one was left on the board outside the door, and Joseph Terry dropped two of them on my following him.





BENJAMIN LOVELL
. I am a police-man. I found this one decanter at the house of Joseph Terry, in about a quarter of an hour.

Joseph Terry. It was found at home, but I did not put it there nor take it.

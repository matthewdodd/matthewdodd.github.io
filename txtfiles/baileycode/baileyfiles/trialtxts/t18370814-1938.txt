CHARLES SMITH
. I am in the employ of Mr. William Henry Thomas, who keeps a shoe-shop in High-street, Shadwell. The prisoner and another came there about five o'clock in the afternoon on the 8th of August—one asked for a pair of shoes, and while I was serving, the prisoner put a pair under her shawl—I was absent from them a short time—I then missed the shoes, and asked the prisoner whether she had got any shoes—she said she had not—I was sure she had, and I found them under her shawl—these are men's shoes—they asked for women's shoes.

Prisoner. I am a dealer in Petticoat-lane, and I went with this young woman to take a walk, and she asked me to go and buy a pair of shoes—she went in, and I with her; and in coming out he stopped me, and said I meant to rob him of a pair that were down half a yard behind me—he sent for a policeman, and took me.

JURY
to
CHARLES SMITH. Q. Did you take them from her person? A. Yes, they were not on the floor—she denied having any shoes.




GUILTY
.* Aged 18.—


Transported for Seven Years.

            . I keep a stall opposite to Mr. Osborne's window, at the corner of Crown-street, Finsbury


. On the evening of the 30th of November, I saw two boys near the shop - one of them came to me, asked how I sold my fruit, and then the other came up, and pulled my bonnet down over my face; I put it up, looked round, and missed a piece of cheese from the window before me; I called to the shop-boy.

            . I am in Wm. Osborne's employ - he is a cheesemonger
. Burns alarmed me; I missed the cheese from the window; I went in pursuit, and when I got to Long-alley, a boy said, "Are you looking for the cheese?" I said, Yes; he said, "He is gone over the way with it;" I crossed over, but saw nobody - the officer afterwards brought it to the shop.


                  WILLIAM

            . I am a constable of Islington. I was going along, and saw the prisoner and two others - one of his companions pulled Burn's bonnet over her eyes, and the prisoner took the cheese - I pursued, and took him with it under his coat; I saw Saunders pursue him - the others sent him quite a different way; I believe the prisoner was in distress - he has no home to go to.

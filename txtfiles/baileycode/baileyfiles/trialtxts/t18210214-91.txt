                  JAMES 
                  NEWPORT
               



            . I am clerk at the prosecutors wharf, at St. Saviour's-Dock, Borough


. In December last, they had a quantity of saltpetre, in bags. I missed twenty bags on the 1st of January, after receiving information of the robbery.


                  WILLIAM 
                  MITCHELL
               



            . I pleaded guilty to stealing this property, and have been fined 1 s. I am a waterman, and know the prosecutors. Johnson was their porter
. Howard is a scavenger
 and dustman
, and lived in Church-lane, Commercial-road. There was saltpetre in the prosecutors warehouse at St. Saviour's-dock. Johnson and others told me of it; it was first proposed to steal some-lead, that was gone, and Johnson said we could have some saltpetre, and that would pay better. He told me so a week or a fortnight before Christmas. Howard was not there then. Painter and Herbert asked if we got it - whether I knew any one who would have it. I came over to Howard, and asked, if he would have some saltpetre - he said, Yes, and told me to bring him a sample, and asked where it was to come from; I said, from Mr. Brandram's, I asked where it was to be landed if I brought it; he said, at St. Catherine's-dock. (which is in Middlesex). I told the other two men that he must have a sample, and in two or three days, they gave me one. I took it to Howard, he was not at home, and I left it with his wife. I went over two or three days after and saw him. He said he had got a customer for it, and I might bring it when I liked. Previous to that, Johnson had told us we were to get in at the shutter, which he would leave open, then we could get in at the window, and find the keys of the warehouse gates. On the Thursday before Christmas, I and the other two were standing at Dockhead, we took a barge, and put it under the prosecutor's warehouse, which joins the river, and when the tide was down, we walked down, and got in at the window, and I found the keys hanging in the counting-house; we took twenty bags of saltpetre, one was sweepings and dirty, we chucked that overboard, and had nineteen left. We went over to Howard, and told him we had got the saltpetre, and was going to bring it over when the tide was up, he said he wished he had known it sooner, as he did not know where he would get the keys of the wharf at St. Catharine's-dock. We went with him to some street in the Minories, he went into a house, brought me the keys, and told me to put it into a wooden counting-house, on the wharf, and bring him the keys in the morning. We went home and brought the barge to St. Catharine's-dock, and put the bags of saltpetre in the counting-house, as he desired, and next morning I took him the keys. We went to a public-house kept by Avel, he told me he had got a man that would have it. I asked him for some money towards the saltpetre. He gave me two half-crowns and 1 s., and said he was going to Smithfield, to buy a horse, and said he should be at home in the evening. I went over in the evening and saw him at the public-house again. He said he had got a person who was coming to look at it. We went home and saw him again on the Saturday morning. I asked for some money. He said he had seen a wine-merchant, who was coming to look at it, and was to bring 10 l. or 15 l. and when he took it away he would bring the rest. I do not know when he was to pay for it. We waited till between eight or nine - no one came. I asked him for 1 s. to get some bread and cheese, he gave me one; we had three or four pots of beer, at the public house, which he said he would pay for - nobody came. I told him we would take the saltpetre away, as I thought by his manner, he had taken it away from us. He gave me the keys; I went to the wharf and found it was gone. I went and accused him of taking it, he said he had not. He went down to the wharf with us, we made inquiry, and heard it was gone to the Thames-police. I was apprehended at his house the day after Christmas day, and had two hearings when I told this to the Magistrate.
Cross-examined by MR. BRODERICK. Q. Howard was taken before you - A. Yes, I was not promised a light punishment to plead guilty. I never said I would be revenged on Howard. I said it was through him that I was taken, and called him a rogue.

                  MACKEY
               



            . I am a wharfinger, and live in Vine-street, Minories; my wharf is at St. Catherine's Dock. On the Thursday before Christmas, about ten o'clock at night, Howard called on me, and said a friend of his was going to unload a barge of goods at my wharf - he said part of it was saltpetre, and asked if I would be down there at three o'clock in the morning, which was high-water time? I said No; that Smithers had the keys of the barge gate of the wharf, and he had better get them of him that night, in case he should not be there early enough for him to cart them. He said he wanted the key of the small shed, as some of the goods might be damaged if it was wet. I gave him the key - that shed is a counting-house. I was afterwards fetched to the office about this, and was detained until an explanation was given.
Cross-examined. Q. What goods came to the wharf - A. I do not know, I never saw them. I went to Howard'sand left a message for him to appear at the office, and he surrendered himself.
MR. ALLEY. Q. When he surrendered, Mitchell was not taken - A. No.

                  MITCHELL
               



            . I am a lighterman, and brother to the witness. About Christmas I saw Howard with my brother, at a public-house on this side of the water, with two others; I think it was on Boxing day; they had a deal of talk together, and then went to St. Catharine's-stairs. I went with them, but do not know what their conversation was about; they all four got over the wharf gate, and were quarrelling. I now remember that it was on a Saturday.


                  HENRY 
                  AVEL
               



            . I keep the Cherry Tree, public-house, Church-lane, Whitechapel - Howard lives a few doors above me; I saw Mitchell with him at my house, but not together; four men asked for beer in the tap-room on account of Mr. Howard - the last witness was one of them; Howard then came in, went into the parlour, and told me to let them have it.


                  JOHN 
                  MURRANT
               



            . I am a Thames Police officer. On the 23d of December I had received information that stolen saltpetre was at St. Catharine's-stairs; I went and found nineteen bags of saltpetre there, in a shed or counting-house; next day I took Mackey, and went to Howard's house - he was out. He came down to me on Christmas Day, and asked if Mackey was in custody. He said he had borrowed a key of a shed from him for a friend of his, named Mitchell, to put some goods in.

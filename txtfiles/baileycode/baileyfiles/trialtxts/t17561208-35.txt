John Radbourn. About five weeks ago, as near as I can guess, the prisoner stole a vessel off the dray.

Radbourn. It was Mr. Willoughby's dray.
Q. Where does he live?
Radbourn. He lives upon Tower-Hill.
Q. Where was the dray when the vessel was taken?
Radbourn. It was in Watling-Street


. I saw him take it, and he was carrying it away.
Q. Was the dray standing still or going on?
Radbourn. It was standing still.
Q. How near the dray was you when he took it?
Radbourn. I believe I was about a hundred yards from it
Q What time of the day was it ?
Radbourn. As near as I can guess it was between one and two o'clock.
Q. How far did he carry it?
Radbourn. He carried it about forty or fifty yards. I followed and collar'd him, and he seemed to make resistance against me, by shoving me two or three times.
Q. What did he say for his so doing?
Radbourn. He said he took the vessel from the dray to knock a nail down in the heel of his shoe.
Prisoner's Defence.
I took the vessel down as it was going along, with ent to set it down. There was a coach and car going by I set it down as soon as I did not carry it above four steps.

            . I live with Mr. 
               
                  Samuel 
                  Denton
               



             - he is a lawyer
. I went on the 8th of December to Mr. Churchill, for a pound of eels - I asked for change for a sovereign; she said she could not give it me, she had no doubt I could get it at the corner - the prisoner was in the shop, and asked if he should get me change; I thought he was the woman's son, and gave him the sovereign - he did not return with that, nor the change.

            . I received information of this robbery, and took the prisoner; I found 8s. or 10s. on him - I asked him how he came to do it; he said his father turned him out, and caused him to go stealing - he could not starve.

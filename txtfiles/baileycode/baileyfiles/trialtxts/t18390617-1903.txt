WILLIAM DIDDLE
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
6th of June, 1 brush, value 1s., the goods of 



William Lenny; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






MARY LENNY
. I am the wife of William Lenny—he lives in Greek-street. On the 6th of June I went into the wash-house, and missed a brush, which I had seen safe at nine o'clock the night before—some one had taken down a board of the wash-house, and taken out a brush and a copper saucepan—this is my brush.





WILLAM MILLERMAN
 (police-constable B 95.) On the 6th of June I stopped the prisoner about half-past six o'clock in the morning in Strutton-ground—he had a bag with this brush in it—I took it from him, and asked him where he got it—he said he found it in Milbank—there was another lad with the prisoner who got away.

Prisoner. The lady cannot swear I stole it—I found it in a little ditch at the back of some houses—he searched the other boy, and found nothing on him. Witness. I did not search the other one—when I took the prisoner, the other ran away—I did not tell the Inspector that the other boy had only a lot of old rags and bones.





WILLIAM PEARCE
 (police-constable B 131.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 18.—


Transported for Seven Years—Penitentiary.

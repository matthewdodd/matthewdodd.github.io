JOHN BAKER
 I am in the employ of Stephen Robinson Heath, shoe, maker, of Giltspur-street. I heard a noise in the window, went to the door, and in consequence of what a woman told me I went after the prisoner, and took him with these boots secreted under his coat—they are my master's—he had no business with them.





WILLIAM HART
 (City-policeman, 427). I produce a certificate—(read—William Ochiltree, convicted Jan., 1849, and confined four months)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 21.—


Transported for Seven Year.

 in Petticoat-lane


; the prisoner came in for some things he had in pawn; I had taken down this watch for a person that came to redeem it; I bid my little boy look the prisoner's things, and the prisoner said he would go and get some rolls; in the mean time when he was gone, I missed the watch; on his return I charged him with it; he denied it; then a woman that was in the shop talked to him in Hebrew, and then he owned he had taken the watch, and hid it in a cellar; he went with Taylor and brought it.

            . I live within two doors of the prosecutrix; I saw a boy stop the prisoner; I went with him to Mrs. Alefounder's; she charged him with taking the watch; a woman in the shop talked to him in Hebrew; I bid her talk English; she then said that he said he had got the watch; then he went down on his knees, kissed Mrs. Alefounder's hand, and said he would bring the watch; I went with him down into a cellar just by, and he pulled the watch out of some rubbish, and said he would give me half a crown to carry in; I would not, but took him back with it. (The watch produced and deposed to by the prosecutrix.)
The prisoner said nothing in his defence.

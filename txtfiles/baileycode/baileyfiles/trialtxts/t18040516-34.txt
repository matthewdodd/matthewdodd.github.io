Q. On Friday the 13th of April had you any check in your possession on the house of Messrs. Sansom, Blake, and Postlethwaite? - A. I had; I put it in with others; I have the book that I made the note in.

Mr. Gurney. Q. Was this the draft you gave him to put into the box? - A.(Looks at the draft.) It was.
Q. How soon afterwards did you discover any thing wrong? - A. Between three and four hours after; in the course of that evening I discovered the draft was missing, I discovered it in my book, by their not giving me the total credit of all the drafts; I believe it to be checked, because it corresponded with the sum.

Q. Did he attend at the clearing-house on Friday the 13th of April? - A. He did.

Q. Was it in the power of the prisoner to take any out without your observation? - A. It was; but then it was his duty to have given them to me, if he had, I should have put it down in my book; I am certain no such draft came to my hands.

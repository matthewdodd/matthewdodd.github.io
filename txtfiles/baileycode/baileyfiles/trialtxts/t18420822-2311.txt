ANN MASON
 was again indicted

 for stealing, on the 
8th of July, I shirt, value 4s., the goods of 



Alexander Munro.






ALEXANDER MUNRO
. I lodged at Mr. George's house in a room adjoining the prisoner's—on the 18th of July, when I heard Mr. George's things had been taken, I looked over my shirts, and missed one from a shelf in my room, where it had been among half-a-dozen others—I think I had seen it about a fortnight before I missed it—I generally locked my room door when I went out, but Mrs. George had a key that opened it, and I have since found that the key of the prisoner's room opened my door—this is my shirt.





THOMAS MANSELL
. I live with Mr. Wells, a pawnbroker. This shirt was pawned by the prisoner on the 8th of July—I know her, and can say that it was her.

Prisoner. You cannot say that I pawned it. Witness. Yes, you did.

Prisoner's Defence. It was my husband's shirt, and I did not pawn it.




GUILTY
. Aged 26.—


Transported for Seven Years.

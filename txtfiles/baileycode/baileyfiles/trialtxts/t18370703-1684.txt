JOHN HAWKES HEWITT
. I keep a leather-cutter's shop, at No. 2 Lower terrace, Islington. Four men came to my shop on the 22nd of June, within a minute or two of each other—the prisoner was one of them—I soon began to perceive that they had a connexion with each other, and I went round the counter to see where my property was going, as I missed it from the counter—I went round, and saw the prisoner with a bag in his hand, three parts full—I had seen the bulk diminishing as I was getting things for them, and stooped under the counter—I saw the prisoner was discomposed, and he left the shop, leaving two of the things that he had asked for—I followed him, and asked him to come back—he said he should come back presently—I insisted upon his coming back, and he did and, without my saying any thing, he emptied the contents of the bag on the counter, and there were seventy-nine pieces of leather, which are mine—they were all marked by myself, most of them the same afternoon—he then said he had got none of my property.





RICHARD MARTIN
 (police-constable M 175.) I took the prisoner, and have the property.




GUILTY
.* Aged 19.—Recommended to mercy by the Prosecutor.—


Transported for Seven Years.

                  MARY 
                  PEARCE
               



            . I am a spinster, and live in Bluegate-fields, St. George's in the East


. I rent two rooms in the house; Hyam Isaacs is the landlord, he does not live there. 
               
                  Benjamin 
                  Johnson
               



            , Jun.'s sister lives up stairs, and I let 
               
                  Celia 
                  Noy
               



             one of my rooms. On the 13th of May I went out about half-past ten o'clock, returned at half-past eleven, found the place open, and her box and the bed-clothes gone - she had gone out before me.


                  CELIA 
                  NOY
               



            . I am the wife of 
               
                  Isaac 
                  Noy
               



            , and rent a room on the ground floor of Pearce - my husband does not live with me. I went out at half-past ten o'clock, after locking my door; I returned about half-past eleven, found the room open and stripped, and my box was gone, which contained a bonnet, a spencer, and a gown - I lost the other things from the room. The bed-clothes belonged to Hyam Isaacs, who had let the room to Pearce. The door had been opened by some key. This was on Saturday night, and the next morning I found all the things at the watch-house - the three prisoners were in custody. They all lived in one house in the same fields. They used to come to see the sister, who is the daughter of 
               
                  Benjamin 
                  Johnson
               



            , Sen. I once saw him there.

            . I live next door to Pearce - the prisoners live a little lower down than I do. About half-ten o'clock on the night of the robbery I saw 
               
                  Benjamin 
                  Johnson
               



            , Sen. and 
               
                  Benjamin 
                  Johnson
               



            , Jun. in Pearce's house - I do not know whether she was out or not. I saw them come out of the house together. 
               
                  Benjamin 
                  Johnson
               



            , Jun. had something heavy and white under his arm. In about an hour I heard the place had been robbed, and told what I had seen. I did not suspect them as their sister lived there.


                  GEORGE 
                  ORD
               



            . I am a patrol of St. George's in the East. About half-past eleven o'clock I came past the house, and was told of the robbery - we immediately searched the house next to Pearce's, but found nothing; we then made enquiry of Ilbank, she gave me information, and I went to the prisoners' house - they all lived together. I only found the father, mother, and some some small children at home. I found the box up stairs in a cupboard open. The father was abed. I found a spencer in the box, and on the first floor I found the blankets, sheets, pelisse, and quilt - no person slept there; also a gown and a bonnet.


                  PETER 
                  PAGE
               



            . I am a watchman of Shadwell. I went to the prisoners' house with Ord, his account is correct.


                  JAMES 
                  SUMMERS
               



            . I am a patrol of Aldgate. Between twelve and one o'clock in the night of Saturday, the 13th of May, I saw the two younger prisoners together, they both had something. I took Benjamin, the other ran away. I asked Benjamin what he had under his coat? he said it was a petticoat, I found it was a pelisse, which Noy claimed. He refused to give me his name or address.


                  THOMAS 
                  HARRISON

                  Benjamin 
                  Johnson
               



            , Jun. was brought to the watch-house, I asked him how he came by the pelisse? he said it belonged to his sister, and he came out to pledge it. I said it was an odd time to pledge things. His mother came to see him at the watch-house on Sunday, and in his presence said it was his sister's, and told me the colour of it. I asked her how it was made? she would not tell me.


                  FRANCIS 
                  JACKSON
               



            . I took Johnson, Sen. in charge at St. George's watch-house, about twelve o'clock at night. I then went in search of the other prisoners, and found Robert at his father's house, about two o'clock in the morning - I knew they all lived together there. I told him what I took him for, he denied it, and the father said the things were brought into the house unknown to him.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
BENJAMIN JOHHNSON, SENIOR'S Defence. About ten o'clock that night I went home and went to bed - between eleven and twelve the officer came, knocked at the door, and said I had the property there. They found the linen in a closet; I went to the cupboard in my room, and there found the box.

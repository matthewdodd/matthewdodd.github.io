EDWARD CARUTHERS
. I am foreman to John Robinson, a tailor in Nassu-place, Commercial-road. On the 20th of July I was at the door, and missed a coat—it had been inside the door—I received information, and ran down Cannon-street—I saw the prisoner there, running with the coat, and wrapping it up—I called "Stop thief," and he was taken—I picked up the coat, which I saw him throw down.

Cross-examined by
MR. DOANE. Q. Were you in the shop? A. Yes, the greater part of that afternoon—it could not be taken off without coming into the shop—it was close to the door—I never lost bight of the prisoner—I was not in advance of him when he was taken—some boys said something to me, and then I went round Cannon-street, and saw the prisoner-a Thames police-officer took him—I lost sight of him for a moment, as he turned some corners, but I caught sight of him again-when he was taken I was running—the man that caught him and the prisoner fell down together—I could not stop myself at the moment—this is my master's coat—(looking at one.)

JURY. Q. Had he thrown down the coat before he turned the corner? A. No.

            . I was standing at my Door the 12th of August, about thirty Yards from this Gentleman's, I saw the Prisoner take it off the Bulk, and she brought it within a Yard of me; so I stopp'd her, and took her to the Shop, and the Gentleman miss'd it, and he took the Nankeen out of her Apron.
The Prisoner had nothing to say in her own Defence; but said, she could have a Da and more from Greenwich to her Character.



               Guilty

FRANCISCO ANTONIO
. I am a sailor, and live at the Sailor's-home. I went to bed about eleven o'clock on the 28th of July, leaving my shirt and trowsers hanging on my cabin—I lost them—these are them—(looking at them.)

Cross-examined. Q. How do you know them? A. The trowsers were given me by a passenger, who bought them at Monte Video—they have a number "907" and letters on them—I know that was on my trowsers—the prisoner has seen me with them on many times—the shirt has got some varnish on the breast, and the sleeves are dirty.





JOHN M'NORTON
. I am a waiter at the Sailor's-home. I went into Antonio's cabin and saw his shirt and trowsers—I afterwards saw them found in the prisoner's box, and said they were Antonio's.

Cross-examined. Q. Was the prisoner by? A. Yes—he said the shirt was his, and the trowsers might be his—I had never seen him wear them—they are chiefly worn by Portuguese.




GUILTY
. Aged 27.—


Transported for Seven Years.

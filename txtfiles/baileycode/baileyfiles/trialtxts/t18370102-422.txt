WIILIAM EDWARD BURMAN
. I am a hatter. This pipe was fixed in My shutter-box and belonged to a water-closet—about half-past five or fix o'clock on sunday afternoon, I heard a knocking at the pipe—I opened the shutterbox door, which had the padlock broken off, and found the prisoner inside he was a perfect stranger—he said, in about five minutes, "Pray forgive me"—he had broken three pieces of the pipe quite off.

Prisoner's Defence. I did not touch any thing of the kind—he did not find it on my person. Witness. No, I did not.




GUILTY
. Aged 65.—


Transported for seven Years.

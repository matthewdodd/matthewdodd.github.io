, got up earlier than he usually did, and went out, and he saw him no more till the Tuesday Night, when he was taken up at Billingsgate by a Constable: That he own'd he had taken 5 l. 15 s. out of his Master's Drawer, and that he had paid the Fees of one of his Acquaintance, one Mason, and spent about 3 1. in Cloaths, clothing him from Head to Foot. Two other Evidences depos'd, They heard him own this before Sir 
               
                  Francis 
                  Forbes 
               



            : And the Constable depos'd, That he saw the Prisoner and his Comrade drinking in an Alehouse near Billingsgate very extravagantly, whereupon he examined him how he came by the Money: That he told him, his Cousin at Stratford had given him 17 s. but he suspecting him, said he believ'd he had robb'd his Master, and secur'd him; and that he confess'd he had so done. The Prisoner deny'd the Fact at the Bar. The Jury found him 


               guilty to the Value of 39 s.

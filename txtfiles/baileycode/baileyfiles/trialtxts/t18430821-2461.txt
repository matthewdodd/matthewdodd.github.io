WILLIAM CAMERON
. I am boatswain of the ship Madagascar—she was taking in her cargo in the West India Docks—part of it was copper. On the 19th of Aug., I was in the forecastle—I looked aft, and saw the prisoner standing in the gangway—he had two tyes of copper—I went to him and asked what he had to do with those two tyes of copper, and where he got them—he said from one of the lumpers who were working in the hold—I detained him, and the commanding officer came on board, and went for a policeman—these are the tyes of copper.





SAMUEL AVERY
. I am constable of the Docks. I took the prisoner, who was in the ship in the Docks—I found one of these plates of copper between his skin and the waistband of his trowsers—the other he had slid down by his side, because he said it hurt him—I asked how he came by them—he said one of the lumpers, a tall Irishman, with grey whiskers, promised to give him 6d. if he would take them on shore, and leave them there till night—I took him to the men, and then he said it was not either of them, and one of the men said, "You scoundrel, it was only two days ago you stole the watch."





JAMES RUDGE
. I am first officer of the Madagascar—he commander's name is Charles Grange Weller, and the shipper's is John Henry Vivian.

Prisoner's Defence. A man said, "If you take it on shore, lay it against the wall, I will give you 4d.;" he took the handkerchief off my neck, and tied it round me.

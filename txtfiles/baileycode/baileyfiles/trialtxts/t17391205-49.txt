Mr. Robinson . On the 2d of November, about Six at Night, I was coming through the Temple


, and felt a Hand sliding into my Pocket. I immediately saw the Prisoner with my Handkerchief in his Hand, but he could not get it away, because it was ty'd to my Pocket. I got hold of his Hand; he struggled, and got from me, but the Mob seized him, and pump'd him. Just after this, Mr. Fern lost his Gold Watch, and the Prisoner having been pumped, was taken again, and detained by Mr. Fern: Then I was sent for, and he acknowledged his having attempted to take my Handkerchief, but he said he was not Artist enough to take a Watch.
Prisoner. I was coming thro' Butcher-Row , and the Gentleman's Handkerchief hanging out of his Pocket, the People about him, took me and pumped me. 


               Guilty, 10 d.

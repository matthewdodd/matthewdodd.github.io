GEORGE CHENEY
. I am a constable. At half-past eight o'clock, on the 5th of April, I saw the prisoner lurking about Mr. Gash's shop, in the Old Jewry—he saw me, and went up Cheapside—I knew him before, and followed him, and saw something in his pocket—I followed him down Queen-street, and when I saw a watchman before him, I pounced upon—him, and asked what he had got—he paused, and said, "A pair of shoes"—I said, "What sort, are they Bluchers?"—he said, "Yes"—I found this pair of Wellington boots in his pocket—I asked where he got them—he said he bought them, and made a very improper answer—I took him, and want to Mr. Gush., who identified them—I found 1s. 8d. on him.





AARON GUSH
. These are my boots—I know them by the make—they were on my counter at eight o'clock—when the constable brought the boots to me I missed them from there.

Primer. I did it through distress.




GUILTY

Transported for Seven Years.

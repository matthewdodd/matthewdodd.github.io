WILLIAM WOOD
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
16th of February, 1 handkerchief, value 6s., the goods of 



Benjamin Rider, from his person; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






BENJAMIN RIDER
. I am a leather-cutter, and live in Redcross-street, Borough. On the evening of the 16th of February I was coming through Smithfield—the prisoner and another followed me—I saw the other, who was a lad about sixteen years old, draw my handkerchief from my pocket and hand it to the prisoner—I seized the prisoner—he struggled and got from me, and ran through the pens—some persons came round me, and tried to prevent my taking him—two of them stood before me to stop me—I knocked one of them down, and got through them—I was then tripped up—I however pursued and got hold, of the prisoner—the handkerchief was lost.





THOMAS ISITT
 (City police-constable No. 58.) I was off duty that night, but I heard the cry of "Stop thief"—I ran down the court I live in, and found the prisoner—the prosecutor had him by the collar—I took him—there was a large mob round him, and some of bad character.





WILLIAM TAMPLIN
. I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got at Mr. Clark's office (read)—I know he is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 26.—


Transported for Fourteen Years.

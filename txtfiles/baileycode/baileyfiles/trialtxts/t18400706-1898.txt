1898. 




DAVID BARRY
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
20th of June, 8lbs. weight of beef, value 4s., the goods of 



George Beale; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






GEORGE BEALE
. I am a butcher, and live at Deptford. On the 20th of June I lost a brisket of beef from the shop window—I do not know what has become of it.

Prisoner. Q. Did you see me about.? A. No.





JEREMIAH M'CARTHY
. I am a labourer. About five o'clock in the evening of the 20th of June I was walking down King-street, and saw the prisoner with a basket—he took the beef off the board outside, and I saw no more of him—I knew him before.





JOHN ENRIGHT
. I was with M'Carthy, and saw the prisoner take the meat off the window.

Prisoner. You have been convicted here before for the murder of a policeman at Deptford. Witness. I was tried here, and got one month's confinement.

Prisoner's Defence. M'Carthy said he did not know whether it was beef or mutton, he was twenty yards from me.





BENJAMIN LOVELL
 (police-sergeant R 15.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Wild's office at Maidstone—(read)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 18.—


Transported for Seven Years.

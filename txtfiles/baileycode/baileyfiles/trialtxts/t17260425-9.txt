             thus depos'd. The Prisoner came into my Shop along with a Gentlewoman of good Credit, who had been her Mistress, and who bought several Pieces of Linnen; and therefore I had not the least Suspicion of the Prisoner; but the Thing was found out by a Miracle, as a Body may say; for you must know, Sir, that the Floor of my Shop was a little broke, and my Man being in the Cellar, and hearing some Woman in the Shop, he peeps up this Hole in the Floor, over which the Prisoner happen'd to stand, and what should he see under her Coats, but - a - this Piece of Holland; and so up he comes, and tells me of what he had seen: We tax'd her with it, and she soon confest that she took it. The Jury found her 


               guilty to the value of 10 d.

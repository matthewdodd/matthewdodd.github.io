1589. 




JOHN WILLIAMS
 was indicted

 for stealing 1 handkerchief, value 2s. 6d.; the goods of 



George Kember, from his person, and that he had been before convicted of felony.






GEORGE KEMBER.
 I live near Welling—on Saturday, the 12th of June, I was walking near Finsburry-square, somebody stopped me and told me something—I felt my pocket, and my handkerchief was gone—I had felt it safe before—I cannot say how long—this produced is it—it is mine.





STEPHEN REEVE
 (police-constable G 49.) I was on duty in Featherstone-street—I went to Tabernacle-row, saw the prisoner, stopped him, took him into custody, searched him, and found this handkerchief in his pocket—he gave no account of it.

Prisoner's Defence. I found it.





JOHN WHITE
 (police-constable G 180.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction—(read—Convicted May, 1846, and confined nine months)—he is the person so tried and convicted—I have not seen him since—ten silk handkerchiefs were found in his trowsers at that time.




GUILTY. Aged 24.—


Transported For Seven Years.

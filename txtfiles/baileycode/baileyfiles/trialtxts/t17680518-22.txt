            . I am a barber
, and live at Windsor; the prisoner was my journeyman
, three weeks last Saturday; I sent him to cut some young ladies hair last Tuesday morning, his own clothes being but indifferent, I hired him a coat and waistcoat, and lent him breeches and stockings of my own; I happened to send my other servant to the place where he was to cut the hair, and found the prisoner had not been there; I went in pursuit of him, and overtook him upon Hounslow-heath; he had all the things in his pockets mentioned in the indictment (produced and deposed to;) I took him before a Justice at Hounslow, he was so abusive people would not be satisfied without I would prosecute him.
Prisoner's defence.
I was afraid of being arrested; my master lent me these clothes that I have on, and the hair was in the pocket unknown to me.

JOHN TASKER



 was indicated for stealing, on the 
28th of May, 1 waistcoat, Value 2s., the goods of 



Edward Gibbs; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






JOHN DRUGGAN
. On the 28th of May I was opposite Mr. Gibbs's shop—he is a tailor in St. John-street, Clerkenwell. I saw the prisoner go up, put his hand to the door, break a square of glass, and take a waistcoat out—he put it into his hat and ran away—I went after him—he took off his hat, and dropped the waistcoat—I took it an brought it back—I did not see him taken, but I am sure he is the person—I followed him—he got into a coal shed—I called to the man to stop him there—I got a policeman, and gave him into custody—he ran more than half a mile—I never lost sight of him, but when he turned the corner.





MARIA RING
. I was next door to Mr. Gibbs's. I saw the prisoner take the waistcoat.





JOHN HURLEY
 (police constable G 24.) I took the prisoner, and have the waistcoat.





EDWARD GIBBS
. This is my property.






CHARLES SCOTCHMER
 (police-sergeant G 2.) I have a certificate of the prisoner's convictions (read)—the prisoner is the person, I am certain.




GUILTY
. Aged 19.—


Transported for Seven Years.

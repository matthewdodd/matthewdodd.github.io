On the 2d of December the prisoner came into my shop with another boy, who bought a pair of scarlet cuffs for 6d.; while the shopman was serving him I was in the parlour behind, watching, and saw the prisoner take a piece of handkerchiefs off the counter and hand them to the other boy, who put it under his apron - I immediately went out and collared the prisoner; the other dropped the handkerchiefs, ran out, and escaped.
Prisoner. I never took them.

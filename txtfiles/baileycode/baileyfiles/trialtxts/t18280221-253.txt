. The prisoner came there on the 14th of February, and asked for a pennyworth of porter; said she was extremely cold, and went into the tap-room, where she remained some time; there were five persons there drinking; she had a black apron on, which she threw over the tea-kettle, and took it away; I received information, pursued, and took her in Ray-street, about fifty yards off with it.

            . I live in Berner-street. On the 28th of June, about six o'clock in the evening, I was walking by St. Giles's church


, and felt something at my pocket. I put my hand down to it, and missed my handkerchief. I turned round, and the prisoner was pointed out to me - he was within two yards of me. He started off very brisk on hearing what the man said. We both pursued him, and he was secured; the handkerchief was given to me.

            . I am an officer. I and my son were walking together; we heard the cry of Stop thief! saw the prisoner running, and several others pursuing him. I caught hold of him, but he wrenched himself from me, and my son collared him, with the handkerchief hanging from under his waistcoat - part of it was on the ground. It was just at the end of George-street.

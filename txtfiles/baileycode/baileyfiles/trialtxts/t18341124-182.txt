182. 




WILLIAM AMER
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
25th of October, 2 sovereigns, and 1 half-sovereign, the monies of 



Gervase Stanley, his master.






GERVASE STANLEY
. I am an ironmonger, and live in Upper-ground-street, Blackfriars'-road. The prisoner was my porter for three months—on the 25th of October, a customer paid me two sovereigns and a half, which I put into the till—the prisoner, my apprentice, and another person, were there at the time—I then went out, and, when I returned, I looked into the till, and missed the two sovereigns and a half—the prisoner was then gone—he did not return for his wages, which were due that night.





EDWARD ELLIOTT
 (police-constable L 111.) I took the prisoner, on the 7th of November, in Blackfriars-road—I did not ask him about the money, but he told me he had taken it; and he said the same at the station-house.

Prisoner's Defence. I gave myself up to him—I was going to Mr. Stanley's—I had heard on the Sunday that the money was missing; and I did not go, supposing I should be suspected of having taken it.




GUILTY. Aged 18.—Recommended to mercy by the Jury.





Transported for Seven Years.

First Jury, before Lord Chief Justice Denman.

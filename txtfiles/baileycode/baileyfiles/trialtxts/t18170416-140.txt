            . I live in George-street, Adelphi. On the 31st of March, between two and three o'clock in the afternoon, I was walking between Temple-bar and Essex-street, in the Strand


, a gentleman told me my pocket had been picked of my snuff-box. I turned round, and found the prisoner in custody. I found my box in my pocket, on the top of my handkerchief. I am quite certain that, before this, it was at the bottom of my pocket, under my handkerchief, and must have been removed to be placed there. He made his escape, but was taken.

            . I am a surgeon, and reside in Ratcliff. I saw the prisoner take the box out of Mr. Downs's pocket - I am sure I saw it in his hand - He held the pocket up with his right hand. I collared him - He endeavoured to make his escape.

THOMAS WEBB
. I am coachman to Mrs. Hutchinson. I pulled the coach out of the coach-house in Charles-street Mews, Chelsea. about five minutes before half-past two o'clock, on the 8th of November—I put my box-coat on the box while I got the horses out, and when I came out with the horses, I found the policeman with the prisoner, and my coat—this is it—(looking at it)—I have a particular mark on it that I can swear to.





THOMAS HATCHETT
. I am a fly-master. I was in Charles-street Mews, washing my flys—I saw the prisoner and two other boys come down the mews—the prisoner returned and took the coat off the coachbox—he rolled it up under his arm—the other two went out at the other end of. the mews—I ran and took the prisoner, and brought him back with the coat.

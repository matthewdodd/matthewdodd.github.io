            . I am a brewer's servant
. On the 24th of September I was coming home from my lodging, I met two women; I was in liquor, and I went with them. The people refused to let us in at two houses; we went to a third house, where we got admittance. We went up two pair of stairs; I fell asleep there; when I came down stairs again I was going to pick up another girl; I put my hand in my pocket and missed my money. I am sure I had the money in my pocket when I went up stairs. I don't know that any body else came into the room but the prisoner and the evidence, who is the other girl.

            . Bet Green and I picked up the prosecutor court; we went to several houses before we could get admitted; at last we got admitted at

            's. This man liked the prisoner best, and he had me go down stairs. *

             came up to be paid for the use of the room; she came down and told me that Green wanted me up stairs, for the man had money. I went up; the prosecutor lay asleep upon his back. I saw the prisoner take the money out of his pocket. First she took out a quarter of a guinea, then a guinea, then two half guineas, and a 4 s. 6 d. piece. We divided them money among us.

             tried No. 586. last sessions, for receiving stolen goods.
The prisoner said nothing in her defence.




               Guilty of stealing, but not privately from the person
            .

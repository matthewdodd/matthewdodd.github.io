            . I am a constable. The prisoner was a 
               labourer


             at Enfield. In consequence of suspicion, last Monday week, I went to his house with a search-warrant, and found two baskets, one nearly full of potatoes, they appeared not to have been out of the ground above two or three days. He said he bought them, and found the baskets floating down the river. I took him on another charge.

1481. 




JOHN SANDERS
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
12th of May, 231bs. weight of cheese, value 13s., the goods of 



Peter Austin.






EDWARD AUSTIN
. I live with my brother, Peter Austin—he keeps the shop. On the 12th of May, about half-past nine o'clock, an alarm was given—I ran out and this cheese was afterwards produced—I believe it is my brother's—the prisoner was afterwards brought in—the cheese was in the window not a minute before.

Cross-examined by
MR. PAYNE. Q. In an open window? A. Yes.






RICHARD CLARKE
. I am a herald-painter, and live next door to Austin. I was inside my door, and saw the prisoner run off the curb, across the road, with the cheese in his handkerchief—I collared him—he dropped the cheese at my feet, and ran—I pursued about fifty yards—he fell—I held him till a policeman came up, and took him into custody.

Cross-examined. Q. Where did you see him come from? A. I saw him step off from Austin's side of the way, cross from the pavement to the opposite side, and there I collared him—there was no one running but him that I perceived—I have never seen him before—he rolled about as if he was drunk—he was not more than two yards before me all the time.




GUILTY
.* Aged 30.—


Transported for Seven Years.

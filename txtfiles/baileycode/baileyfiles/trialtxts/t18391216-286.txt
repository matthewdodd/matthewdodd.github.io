REBECCA MILLARD
. I am the wife of William Millard, a green-grocer, in Paul-street, Shoreditch. On Monday, the 9th of December, I was in my back kitchen, and heard an alarm of "Stop thief"—I ran to the street door, and picked up the till at the side of the door, on the pavement—it was upset and empty—I had seen it safe in the counter about a quarter of an hour before, and it then contained about 4s. in coppers—the prisoner was shortly after brought in—be said he was innocent, but he had better give me 5s. than be put in confinement.





JAMES MILLARD
. I live with the prosecutor, who is my brother. On the 9th of December I was in the parlour—I heard a noise, and saw the prisoner between the counter and the door, with the till in his hands—I heard the money jingle—another boy stood at the door, and when the prisoner got out they both ran away in the same direction—I saw the till lying just on the pavement—I did not stop to pick it up, but ran and caught hold of the prisoner, and charged him with stealing the till—he denied it, and struck me, and be in without assistance, he made his escape.





HENRY JOSEPH SNELLING
 (police-constable G 203.) I went to the prosecutor's shop, and found the prisoner here—he was charged with stealing the till—he denied it, and said he was passing accidentally at the time—he gave his address, "No. 28, Hoxton-square," but he does not live there—it is a gentleman's house—I found nothing but a penny and a tobaccobox on him.




GUILTY
. Aged 16.—


Transported for Seven Years.

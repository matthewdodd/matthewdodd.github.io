            . I keep a Publick-House
. On Sunday the 27th of February, between five and six in the Morning, four fellows rushed forcibly into my House after a Woman, who was at my Door and she said, they threatened to knock her Brain out if she would not let them lie with her. They forced into the Room on the Ground-Floor, where our Bed is, (I did not see them do it) but I know that I catched these two Fellows there: They knocked my Wife down twice, as she tells me - There was nothing found upon them.

            . I had been up all Night with a sickly Child; and on the 27th or 28th of February, between five and six in the Morning, a Woman, who did lodge in the House, came to the Door, and called Mrs Lowrie; I opened the Door and saw four Men behind her Back. I thought they did not look like honest People. They pushed the Door against me, and forcibly came in and said, Come Brother, come in; Come Brother, come in, and they fell a d - g their Eyes and Limbs.

            , d - d his Eyes and Limbs, and said he had hanged three, but he would hang ten. I called to my Husband to let him know there were People in the House that I did not like; (I took them to be dishonest People by their Expressions) I could not easily awaken my Husband, so I went to awaken the Girl who lies a few Steps up the Stairs, in the mean Time one of the Men was gone. Said 
               
                  Francis 
                  Hynes 
               



            , D - n your B - d, you old B - h, if you speak a Word, I will knock your Brains cut; he knocked me down twice, and I was afraid he would kill me. My Husband came out without any Breeches, and went to the Street-Door, and put the Key in his Pocket; said I, Cry out Murder, or we shall be all murdered; and when he (Hynes) found my Husband was getting up, he threw himself dead on the Floor, as if he was asleep. I was for fourteen Days afterwards so bad by the Fright, that I could not help myself. The first of them went off with two Pair of Stockings, one Table-cloth, and three Caps; all four were in the House, but one went away directly. -

             did not offer to molest or strike me, but Hynes said, D - n his Eyes, he would be the Death of me.

            . On Sunday, the 27th of February, be tween five and six in the Morning, hearing a Disturbance, I went over to these People House, who live over-against me, and Mr Lowrie was endeavouring to keep these two Fellows in, and Mr Lowrie and Mrs Lowrie said one of them was gone out of Doors. I took one of them, and carried him to the Round-House, and Mr Lowrie took the other and carried him to the Round-House, and had them before Justice Frasier, and he committed them to the Gate-House; and 
               
                  Francis 
                  Hynes 
               



             said, D - n my B - d, I may as well be hanged now, as he hanged another Time. Cooms said they came from Shoreditch, and that they came out with a Design to rob: and he would have been an Evidence but the Justice would not let him. Cooms said he would sign his Confession: Says he to Hynes, I will sign my Confession if you will, and the other said. I will if you will; but what they said, was with Respect to the two Fellows that were got away; they said they knew where to direct us to them; and when I went into Shoreditch to enquire after them, there was such a Mob, that I could hardly get away.
Prisoner Hynes. I desire I may make my Offence [Defence]. We had been drinking, and staying later than ordinary, we did not know where to go to lie, so we took a walk into St. Giles's, and there we met with a loose Woman; and 
               
                  Charles 
                  Coker 
               



            , who is got off, was with us. We did go into the House, and I fell asleep, and the Gentleman beat us and abused us, and struck us with an Iron Poker, and with a Chair, and would not let us go out of the House: We cried out Murder, but no Body came to our Assistance; and the Constable took hold of Cooms, and the Prosecutor took hold of me. We have been at the Gate-House these five Weeks and three Days; it is hard we should suffer for nothing at all. I am a Silver Spinner by Trade, and would go to work with all my Heart.
Prisoner Cooms. We were with a loose Woman, and she desired us to give her a Dram, which we said we would, if she would show us where to get it, and she carried us to this Gentleman's House, and they showed me up Stairs with this young Woman to drink with her, and while I was drinking with her, the People cried out they were robbed. and said we had robbed them; then Charles Coker got over the Wall and run away; the other Person was gone before, and the Prosecutor knocked me down, and kicked me, till I was all over in a gore Blood.
Q. to Lowrie. Had they any Liquor in your House?
- Lowrie. Upon my Word they had not a Drop of Liquor in my House, and never asked for any.
Prisoner Cooms. They took us up Stairs, and left the Creature with us; the Woman pulled off all her Cloaths, and wanted us to lie with her. It is a Gin-Shop and Bawdy-House.

                  Lowrie 
               



            . When these Men came into the House, what became of the Woman?


                  Hannah 
                  Lowrie 
               



            . The poor Woman was very much frightened, and I believe sat down.
Q. Was she a young Woman?


                  Hannah 
                  Lowrie 
               



            . No, an old Woman, a poor Creature, and vastly deplorable; she had not six-pennyworth of Cloaths upon her Body. - I am sure she is a great deal above fifty.
Q. Did the Woman go up Stairs?


                  Hannah 
                  Lowrie 
               



            . I am sure she did not go up Stairs. - She is a poor old Woman that used to wash for me. I have not seen her since.
Mr Stately the Constable. I did not see any Woman in the House.

            . He knocked me down with his Fist. Both

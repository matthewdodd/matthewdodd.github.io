MARY HARDING



 was indicated for stealing, on the 
6th of June, 2 gowns, value 15s.; and 1 shawl, value 5s.; the goods of 




George Wilkins Wallington, her master.






LOUISA WALLINGTON
. I am the wife of George Wilkins Wallington—he is a brush-maker, and lives in Upper North Place, Gray's-inn-road. The prisoner was my servant, and left with out giving notice, on the 6th of June—I missed this gown and shawl, about of an unlocked drawer, about a quarter of an hour after she left—I lost several other things.





CHARLES LITTLE FLETCHER
 (police-constable U 8) I took the prisoner, on the 6th of June, in Leather-lane, with this gown and shawl on—she was walking the street as a prostitute, I should consider.




GUILTY
. Aged 18.—


Transported for Seven Years.

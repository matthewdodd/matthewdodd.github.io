            . I am a constable. On the morning of the 2nd of August I saw Smith coming out of Chapel-street, into Lamb's Conduit-street, drawing a spring-cart; I saw him again in Brunswick-square, and Froom with him - Smith then gave up the shafts, and Froom drew it some distance; then Smith took it, till they came to Gower-street, and there they left it; I stopped Smith in Gower-street North, and said he must come with me - he said it was all nonsense; I took Froom on the 3rd of August, in a stable - I was behind a door, and heard him say,"We shall go down to the office to-morrow, and hear more about it."
Smith. I was hired to draw it to the corner of Tottenham court-road. Witness. He did not say so at the time; he did at the office.

            . I live in Queen's Head-court, Grays' Inn-lane. The cart is mine; on the Monday night I had left it safe in Cockpit-yard


, which is no thoroughfare; it had stood there for two years - I missed it the next morning, between five and six o'clock, and saw it again between seven and eight; it is worth 15l. - my name is on it.

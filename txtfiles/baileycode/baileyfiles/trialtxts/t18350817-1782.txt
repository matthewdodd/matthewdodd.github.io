HENRY RUSH
. I am a labourer in the St. Katharine Docks. On the 10th of August, I saw the prisoner on a bale of hides—he had no right there—he put on his hat, came off the bale, and walked down the quay—I stopped him, and asked what he had got—he said, "Nothing"—I took him to the watchman, who found these things on him.





MATTHEW MILCHARD
. I am watchman at the St. Katharine Dock. Rush brought the prisoner to me, and I found on him a canvas bag with these articles.





JOHN COLLINS
. I work in the Docks. The bag is mine—it had some tonque and some bread in it for my dinner.





JOHN KING
. This is my hat and handkerchief—it had some veal in it—I left it on hte top of a pile of hides, where I was employed.

Prisoner's Defence. That hat belongs to me—I have no other hat—they would not allow me to go in without a hat—the man might have seen me put the hat on, but I might have taken it off to scratch my head.




GUILTY

Transported for Seven Years.

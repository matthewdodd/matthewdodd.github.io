GEORGE TWINE
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
30th of Aug., 1 coat, value 8s., the goods of 



Alexander Harvey; 8 waistcoats, 10s., the goods of 



George Fuller; 1 coat, 7s., the goods of 



George Fuller, the younger; and 2 pairs of reins, 10s., the goods of 



William Riches; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






ALEXANDER HARVEY
. I am in the service of Mr. William Riches, a coach-master, at Clapham Common. On the 30th of Aug., I locked the stable, and left it safe a little before one o'clock—my coat was then on my fellow-servant's box—the reins were there—this is my coat, and these are my master's reins.





GEORGE FULLER
. I am in the service of Mr. Riches—I missed two waistcoats and a jacket out of my box in the stable—these are them.





GEORGE FULLER, JUN
. I had a frock coat there—I saw it safe a little before eleven o'clock—this is it.





JOHN DEMPSEY
 (police-constable V 268.) I found these things outside Mr. Riches' stable door, at half-past one o'clock in the morning—the prisoner was inside the stable—I took him—the door was locked inside—he had lifted up a flap on the stable loft, and got in.

Prisoner. He did not find the coats at all—he did not see them till the ostler called him back, and he took them. Witness. The ostler saw them as we were going from the stable door.





JAMES SLATER
 (police-sergeant V 15.) The prisoner was brought to the station—he said when he left Lambeth he did not intend to do any thing, but he thought he might as well take something, and if he got these he would set up costermongering next day, and leave off thieving—he said he expected to have a ride over the water.

Prisoner. I don't think I did.





JOHN MENNIE
 (police-constable V 70.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got at Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 25.—


Transported for Seven Years.

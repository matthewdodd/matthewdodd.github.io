 for stealing, on the 
25th of November, 1 pair of ear-rings, value 5s., the goods of 



George Joseph Ford, from the person of

MR. HORRY
conducted the Prosecution.






REBECCA FORD
. I am six years old. I was going to school last Monday morning—I met the prisoner—she said I was to have my ear-rings out and have some drops in them—we then went to the pawnbroker's, in Baldwin's-gardens—I there saw five gentlemen—the prisoner said, "Please, Sir, will you take this little girl's ear-rings out, and lend me 2s. on them!'—then we let him take them out, and she left us at the top of Hatton Garden, and went off—my sister was with me—she is younger than me.





GEORGE JOSEPH FORD
. I am the father of this child. She left home with her ear-rings, and returned without them—I went to the pawnbroker's, and saw Mr. Barry more—they were found there after the third application, when the prisoner was taken—the pawnbroker denied it three times—I gave the pawnbroker into custody—he was out on bail.

BARRYMORE. I produce the ear-rings—they were taken I at my brother's shop—the prisoner Drought one pair in her hand, and said her mother had sent her, and the other pair was so difficult to take out, she could not take them out—I was not in the house when the prosecutor came, and my brother knew nothing about it.




GUILTY
. Aged 14.—


Transported for Ten Year.—Recommended it the Penitentiary.


(There were three other indictments against the prisoner.)

Before Mr. Recorder.

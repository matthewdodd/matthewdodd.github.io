JENNISON BARRETT
. I keep a cheesemonger's shop in Chichester-place, St. Pancras. About seven o'clock, on the night of the 13th of December, I was in the parlour—I saw the prisoner take a piece of bacon from the window, which was shut, and go out—I followed, saw him drop it, and took him and the bacon, and gave him in charge.

Prisoner. Two boys sent me to take it.




GUILTY

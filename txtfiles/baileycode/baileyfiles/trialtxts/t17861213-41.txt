; the prisoner came to my standing the 28th of October, between six and seven; and I missed three velveret waistcoats; he run by as swift as thought; but a gentlewoman told me he had snatched something; I pursued him, I lost sight of him, and he was taken in an alley.

PRISONER's DEFENCE.
I went to buy a waistcoat; I heard the cry of stop thief, and I cried the same, and presently the man dropped these waistcoats, and that man stopped me.

JOHN HIGGS
. I am a carpenter, and live at Pimlico. On the 17th of April I was at Greenwich fair—about eight o'clock at night I felt a hand in my pocket—I turned and caught my handkerchief, which both the prisoners had hold of—while I was struggling with them for it a part of it was torn off—I kept that part in my hand—the prisoners were taken into custody—this is my handkerchief.

Wells. It was not in my hand; I am quite innocent; I was four yards from Brown. Witness. It was in Wells's hand—he was close by Brown.





GEORGE KEMP
 (police-constable N 82.) I was at the fair between eight and nine o'clock—I saw the two prisoners together—I watched them, and saw Wells put his hand into the prosecutor's pocket, and take the handkerchief out—both the prisoners had hold of it together—I took them, and searched Wells—I found another handkerchief round his neck, under the black one.





THOMAS BURCHAM
 (police-constable H 33.) I was with Kemp—I saw Wells put bis hand into the prosecutor's pocket, and take out the handkerchief—both the prisoners had hold of it—I took Brown—I found on him three handkerchiefs, one round bis body, one round his neck, and one he threw down.
(Wells received a good character.)

WELLS—


GUILTY
. Aged 18.—



Confined Six Months.

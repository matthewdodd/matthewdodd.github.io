            . I am foreman to Henry Miles and John Edwards, upholsterer
s, Oxford-street


. The prisoner was in their service nearly two years, as needlewoman
 - there is a printed regulation stuck on a board, at the entrance of the workshop, which states, that no one is allowed to take any thing off the premises, however small, as it would be considered a felony; on the 7th of December some property was missing - the workmen were searched, but nothing was found on them; the prisoner gave her address at No. 4, Tottenham-place - she went there with Mr. Edwards and me; we found a large quantity of my employers' property, and she then produced two pieces of print from her person, which she said she had taken that day while the men were gone to dinner, and asked me to say what I could in her favour - I know several of these from the pieces which they were cut off, which I have here, and I know the whole of these to be patterns which are made for my employers only.
Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. Some of these are very small bits? A. Yes, but they are valuable - several of them cost us 4s. 6d. a yard; we do not sell any cotton in pieces, but made up into furniture.

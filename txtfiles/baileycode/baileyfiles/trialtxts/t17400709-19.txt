             was indicted for 


               receiving 2 Bed-quilts, knowing them to be stole
            .
Mr Watson. The Prisoner Miles was my Servant
. On the 21st of June, one Mr Cripple came to me, and told me he believed my Servant had robb'd me, and if I would take up Grace Morgan, and 
               
                  Mary 
                  Thomas 
               



            , I might hear of my Goods again. I took up Grace Morgan, and she told me she had sold a Quilt to one Lee, at Admiral Carter's Head, in Bartholomew Close, and 2 others to one Brown who keeps the Blue Anchor in Little Britain. I went to them, and they said they would return them to me again. Soon after this, the Man at the Stationers Arms, in Little Britain, came to me, and said he believed my Servant had robb'd me of a Tick, and if I would send my Servant to him, he should have it. I cast up my Stock of Ticks, and miss'd one, but I can't be positive that this was mine

             the Constable went after the Prisoner Thomas, and she was tax'd with receiving the Quilts, knowing them to be stole. Then I came Home to Miles, who was detain'd in my House, and says I to him,- You're a pretty Fellow, to wrong me in this Manner,- I have found 3 Quilts; have you robb'd me of any more? He told me, he believed he had taken 5. The Prisoner Thomas, when she was going before my Lord Mayor, own'd she had receiv'd 2 Quilts, and if I would be quiet, and easy with her, I should have them again, for they were at the Pawnbroker's. I carry'd Miles and Thomas before my Lord Mayor; and he would have committed them to Newgate, but I desired they might be sent to the Counter; and as we were carrying them thither I desired the Constable to take Thomas to the Alehouse, to see if he could get out of her, where the Quilts were; he carry'd her into a House, and in about 2 Hours Tim, the Quilts were brought to me, by a Man, she (Thomas) told me she had sent for them to the Pawnbroker's, and that they were the same Quilts my Servant Miles had brought to her House. This Quilt I can't swear to; the other 4 I can. My Son is in Partnership with me, and the Goods are mine and his.

                  Cripple 
               



            . I had Information by 
               
                  Grace 
                  Margan 
               



            , that a Fellow had brought several Quilts to her Mistress, and Mrs Thomas, and that the Gentleman who owned them liv'd in Guildhall Yard. I went to the Prosecutor, and he got a Warrant against the 3 Persons. We charged Miles first: then we took Morgan, and she confessed 3 Quilts, and I went with her to the Places where they had been disposed of. Then he went to Mrs Thomas's; and she own'd she had had 2 Quilts from Miles, and Miles confessed he had carried 2 to her. These are the 2 Quilts: They are sealed, that we might know them again. When my Lord-Mayor committed them, Thomas made a great Outcry, upon which Mr Watson desired they might only be committed to the Counter, because it would be easier for him to have Access to them there, than in Newgate. While we were going from my Lord-Mayor's, Thomas desired Mr Watson would be easy, and she would send for the 2 Quilts. Accordingly, we went into the Golden Fleece, and she sent a Man for them, and I saw them delivered to Mr Watson
Mr Watson . Thomas keeps a Gin shop, and sells Greens.

             . I have seen Miles come to Grace Morgan, and deliver Quilts to her several Times , but on what Account, I can't tell .

             confirmed Mr Cripple's Evidence ; adding, that Miles declared when he and Thomas were carried before my Lord-Mayor, that he had but 9 s . in Money from Thomas for the 2 Quilts , the rest he had in Liquors; but this was not said in Thomas's hearing .
Prisoner Miles . As far as I know,- this Woman here, and the other (Morgan) did induce me to do it. They both keep a Dram-Shop , and I was drinking there, and happened to do this .
Prisoner Thomas. Grace Morgan brought this young Man,(Miles) to my House, with 2 Quilts in her Lap, and desired my Servant to pawn them for her. She took them and pawned them , and gave him the Money: what it was, I cannot tell.

            . Grace Morgan brought Miles to

             and desired her to let me pawn 2 Quilts; she gave me the Quilts out of her Apron: I pawned them, and gave Miles the Money, and then they went away together. Mrs Thomas sells Gin, but Miles spent none of that Money there then.

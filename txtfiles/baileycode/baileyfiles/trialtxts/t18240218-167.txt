            . I am servant to Stanger Fisher, a saddler
, who lives in Little Ryder-street, St. James's


. On Thursday, about half-past one o'clock, my master went out. I left two saddles on the step of the door, on a stool, and went down to dinner, and in half an hour Haydon knocked at the door. I missed the saddles - went in pursuit, and saw the prisoner coming out of Jermyn-street with one of them in a basket, and the other on his arm - he told me that a woman was to give him 1 s. to take them to a house.

            . I was coming down the street, and saw the prisoner turn the corner, with two saddles - he put the stool down, and went off with the saddles. I gave an alarm, and took the stool to Fisher's. I am sure of his person, he was a very little way from Fisher's.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I overtook a groom in Ryder-street with them - he asked me to take them to Sackville-street, and he would give 1 s.

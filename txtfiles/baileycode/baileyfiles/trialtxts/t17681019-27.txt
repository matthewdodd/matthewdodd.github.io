            . I am apprentice to Mr. Hamilton, a printer
, in Falcon-court, Fleet-street



; he having lost a large quantity of paper at different times, I was set to watch on the 3d of August up one pair of stairs, to look down over the stair-case, the paper stood in the passage below near the door; about a quarter after six in the morning the prisoner Lane came in and took away a bundle; I followed her, and took it from under her cloak at the end of the court, and brought her back.

            . Sarah Lane was a washer woman several years at Mr. Hamilton's; betwixt March and July my master lost large quantities of paper; after she was carried before Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            , and committed, I went with her in the coach, she acknowledged she had taken five or six bundles in the whole, which is eight or ten reams, and had sold it to Mrs. Wright, who keeps a chandler's-shop in Shoe-lane; she acknowledged she had taken a bundle of blue, and a large bundle of demy, which we had missed but a little before; she said we should find them, with some odd quires, in a closet at Wright's, up one pair of stairs; I got a search-warrant, and in that closet found the large quantity of demy, it was the Gardeners Kalendar printed, and the bundle of blue, that is a particular sort which Mr. Hamilton had from Scotland, and an odd quire; a bundle contains two reams; in all we found six reams, and some odd quires; Wright said at our going in, and telling her what we came about, she had none, and we were welcome to search the house; the large demy is worth about 27 s. the blue about 11 s. and the Scotch paper about 25 s. a bundle; there were eighteen quire of copy-paper, and about seven or eight odd quires; I know all this paper to be the property of Mr. Hamilton; Wright acknowledged she had it of Lane, and that she gave her 5 s. 3 d. a bundle for it, and that she did not know the value of it; the next morning our warehouse-man told me he heard 
               
                  John 
                  Fishbourn 
               



             had been employed by Wright to sell paper, he is here, and will give an account.

            . I am warehouse-man to Mr. Hamilton, the prisoner had washed for him three or four years; we missed paper several times, the first was eighteen quire of copy-paper in a bundle; about a month after we missed a bundle of large demy, about a month after that another bundle of the same; after that we set a watch, we missed a bundle of blue; after that, when a watch happened not to be set, the men watched by turns; the prisoner Lane was taken after she had taken a bundle of white about six in the morning; she was taken before a Magistrate, and committed; in going to Newgate she confessed the several bundles she had taken, and said we should find them in a closet up one pair of stairs in Wright's house; we went and found as she had said (he gave the same account of the quantity as the former evidence, and that he knew the paper to be the same which was taken from his master's house by the package of it, it having not been opened, but as it was when he received it.

            . I am a constable, I went with a search warrant to Mrs. Wright's house; I told her I had a search-warrant for paper that was stolen, she made no dispute; when up stairs I said, open that closet; she did, I believe there was no lock to it, there we found some bundles of paper; she said she gave 5 s. 3 d. a bundle for it, but to whom I know not; then we took her before my Lord Mayor, she was sent to the Compter for farther examination; the warehouse-man swore to the paper as Mr. Hamilton's property (the paper found in the closet, produced and deposed to by Blundel)

            . I am a journey man printer, Mrs. Wright applied to me to sell some paper for her about the 28th of last June; I sold five reams to Mr. Brown for her, I had them of her from out of a one pair of stairs room; I received 45 s. and returned half a crown to the man that bought it, and gave her 30 s. and 6 d. and kept the rest myself; the next morning she desired me to take more, he gave me 20 s. for it; I returned him a shilling, and gave Mrs. Wright 15 s. out of it; she said she came honestly by it, but did not say who she had it of; about three weeks and three days after she applied to me, and asked whether we did not use blue paper in our business; I said, yes, for wrappers and covers of books; she said she believed she should have some in a few days; after that, she said in the room of blue, she had a bundle of white; I said this can never be right; she then said she had it of a person that belonged to a public office, and it was their perquisite; then she said if she thought the person stole it, she would have no more of her, but she had lent her a cloak, and she has pawned it for 5 s. 3 d. and she owed a chandler's-shop score, and as soon as she could get it she would have done with her.
Q. How came you to keep so much money to yourself?
Fishbourn. That is customary in our trade.

            ; I went to Mrs. Wright, and asked her how she could be so wicked to ask a man that she had known from his cradle to sell paper for her that she knew to be stolen; she said, if my husband had not mentioned the selling of it, no body would have known it to have been stolen; she desired me to come to her the next morning, I did; she said, if there are any wrappers on the paper, for God's sake go and take them off, for they can swear to none but the wrappers; I sent my little girl to Mr. Fellows, who helped my husband to the customer, and he sent word there were no wrappers on it.
Blundel. I went to Mr. Brown's, and saw some paper, the Gardeners Kalendar, and Scotch paper, I knew it to be Mr. Hamilton's property.

            , I have been acquainted with Mrs. 
               
                  Wright
               


             a great while; when I have been in a little distress, she has trusted me six-pence or a shilling; I said I worked at Mr. Hamilton's, and we light the fine with waste paper; she asked me to bring her some, she gave me 3 s. for the first bundle; after that she told me, if I would bring her some more, she would get a customer for it; I did; she coniced me to go again; I told her I was afraid, she told me she would lend me her cloak to go in; I said I could not do it; I carried it, and pawned it for 5 s. 3 d. after that I fatched it out, and gave it her again; and the fourth time I went for paper I was detected; I never was guilty of any such thing before.
She called

             to her character, who said they had known her some years, and knew no harm of her.

Wright's defence.
This woman brought paper to me, and said she came honestly by it; that she worked at a public office, and it was her perquisite; at first she brought little quantities, seven or eight pounds, I allowed her 2 d. a pound for it; when she brought these large bundles, I much disputed it; she said I might be assured she came honestly by it, for she had worked many years in that house; I asked what it would come to; she said 5 s. 3 d. I gave it her, and when I opened it I would weigh it, and allow her 2 d. a pound; from time to time she repeated it, and always declared she came honestly by it; I never distrusted her, but took her to be an honest woman.

            . I am a headborough. I saw the prisoner take the ham out of the prosecutor's window, between eight and nine o'clock at night - He reached round the door-post, and took it-two others were with him. I pursued, he dropped it, and ran off-the others also ran; I knew him before. Next morning I met him and secured him. I had seen him lurking about the shop.

             thus depos'd: Mr.Radbourn kept a Compting-House
 at Mr. Lucas's, a Packer. I left the Money in a Bag in the Desk when I went to 'Change; and returning in Half an Hour, I found that it was broke open, and that the Money was gone. I enquired of Mr. Lucas it any body had been there. He told me no body but Mr. Radbourn's Footman
, (the Prisoner) who was just then gone up into the Press-Room. We followed, and found him bid behind one of the Presses, I pulled him out, and he dropt the Bag from him. This was corroborated by the Deposition of Mr. Lucas.

            . 'Tis my Business to visit the King's Watchmen: I was going that night over the Key, and saw the Prisoner loitering about some Hogsheads of Tobacco; I went to look at him; he ran; I cry'd, stop him; one of the Evidences stopt him, and the other saw him drop the Tobacco. I am positive to the Prisoner; and upon searching the Hogsheads, we found one broke open, and about the same Quantity taken out, that he had dropt. 


               Guilty 10d.

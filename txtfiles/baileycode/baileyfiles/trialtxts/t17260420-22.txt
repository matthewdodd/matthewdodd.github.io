             thus depos'd. Sir Charles kept several tame Conies, and one Morning I mist 4 Does and a Buck, and afterwards I found the Does at the Prisoner's House. The Prisoner Confess'd the Fact before Sir Charles. In this Defence at the Bar, he pretended that he bought the Rabbits, and he never did an ill Thing in his life. Sir Charles hearing this, inform'd the Court that the Prisoner had already been burnt in the Hand. The Court order'd that his Hand should be look'd on, and thereupon one of the Keepers call'd to the Executioner, Come hither Jack, says he, and see if you know your own Hand-writing. The Executioner came, and the Mark was visible.

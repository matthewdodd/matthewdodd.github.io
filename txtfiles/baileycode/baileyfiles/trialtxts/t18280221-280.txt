            . I am a constable, and live in Eight Feathers-court - the prosecutor's shop is in Holywell-street


. On the 22d of February, at eight o'clock at night, I saw the prisoner and another person there; I passed them, and heard them say, "It is all right, go it;" I watched: they waited some time, and crossed - I saw the prisoner go in at the door, and take this piece of toilinett; I crossed over, and seized him with it - he struck me a violent blow; my hat and his own fell off - he ran; I pursued him into Angel-inn-yard, and lost sight of him there, as he got under the coaches; I had his hat - he asked me for it when he was taken, and I gave it to him.

            . I keep this shop - this toilinett is mine.

            . I was standing at my shop door, and saw Edwards seize the prisoner; I am certain he is the man.
The prisoner pleaded intoxication, and ignorance of the offence.

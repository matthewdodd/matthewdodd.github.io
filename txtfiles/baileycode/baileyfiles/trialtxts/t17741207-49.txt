            . I lost my handkerchief, at the foot of Black-Fryars Bridge


, on Lord Mayor's Day; just as my Lord Mayor landed. I had pin'd it in my pocket, with a very large pin; I felt a hard pull at my pocket: I turned round and saw the prisoner run away: I pursued and took him; he threw the handkerchief away: (the handkerchief was produced in court, and deposed to by the prosecutor.)

            , confirmed the prosecutors evidence.
The prisoner in his defence, said, he picked up the handkerchief in the crowd.

WILLIAM HAZLE PAIN TWYFORD. I was in Piccadilly


 about twenty minutes after three o'clock, on the 8th of March; a gentleman tapped me on the shoulder, and said the prisoner had taken my handkerchief from me; he had him at that time by the collar; I took hold of him likewise, and he immediately gave me my handkerchief from his pocket - I took him to the watch-house.
Prisoner I picked it up, and put it into my pocket, the gentleman came, and took me. Witness. He did not say he picked it up.

            . I am the watch-house-keeper. The prisoner was brought to me there; he was beggingof Mr. Twyford not to prosecute him. There was another gentleman who said, in his presence, he saw him take it from the prosecutor's pocket - but he was obliged to leave town on business - a duplicate of another handkerchief was found on him.

             . On the 1st of February I saw three men about the prosecutrix's door; they staid looking about there for a minute ; at last I observed one of them bounced in, and took something off the line; I cannot say in particular what; the other two stood watching at the gate; he came out to them, and I called out stop thief, and they all three ran away together; I went a little way after them, and in about half an hour two men brought the two prisoners back; the other man made his escape. I am certain the prisoners are two of the men.
The prisoners said nothing in their defence.
Both 

               guilty

Charles Orchard. On Tuesday the 9th of November, betwixt one and two o'clock, I was at dinner backwards. Hearing something fall in the shop, I went and found three or four pieces of cloth on the ground, but saw nobody. Soon after I was informed there was a man gone up into a coach-maker's yard, where was no thorough-fair. I went and there was the prisoner, who shoved this piece of shalloon into my hand, and said, '' If it is '' your's, take it.'' (Produced in court.) After that he got away, but was soon secured, and brought to me. This is my shalloon, and was taken out of my shop.

            . The prisoner came into my passage with this shalloon in his hand. I asked him where he was going. He said to ease himself. I said, you have stole that shalloon, and shall give an account of it; how did you come by it? He said, '' Ask my a - se,'' and gave me a great deal of ill language. Then he push'd up the yard. The prosecutor came, and I saw him take the shalloon of the prisoner.

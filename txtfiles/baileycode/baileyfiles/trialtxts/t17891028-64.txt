: I lost the things in the indictment; they were taken out of our back room window, on the 14th of October; I saw them about ten minutes before they were lost; they hung on a line in the room; I saw them at the constable's.
- STROTHERS sworn.
I live next house to the prosecutor; on the alarm, I followed this lad, and caught him, and took up the bundle which I saw him drop in the ditch; that was about two hundred yards from the prosecutor's; he never was out of our sight; there were more of them; I went after them; I left the lad in care of another person.

I picked up the bundle; the prisoner shewed me where it was, when I stopped him; he told me if I would forgive him, he would tell me where the bundle was: I delivered it to Cooper the constable.
(The things produced and deposed to.)

ANDREW WILLIAM ANGUS. I am a cheesemonger
, and live in Charlton-street, Somer's-town


. On the 22d of November I lost two pieces of cheese; I did not see them taken, but I was told they were taken by a sweep - they were on the stall-board, and the window was up.

            . I saw the prisoner take the cheese from the stall-board in front of the window - he put it under his arm, and walked gently down the street: I sent my sister to tell Mr. Angus - I am sure he is the person; I had not known him before: I was putting up our shutters at the time.

            . I am an officer. The prosecutor brought the prisoner to me, with the cheese - he said he bought it at 3d. per lb., at a shop in Tottenham-court-road, and that it came to 2s. 3d.

.
Q. Did you lose any money?
Marley. Yes; I'll tell you the whole story.
Q. What reason have you to charge the prisoner at the bar with them?
Marley. We lodged in one house, I lost the money out of my breeches-pocket, and my pumps with the buckles in them were under the bed.
Q. Did any body lye with you?
Marley. There was the prisoner and I and one 
               
                  Anthony 
                  Murphy 
               



             lay together?
Q. Did you all three go to bed at the same time?
Marley . Yes.
Q. What time did you go to bed?
Marley . Between ten and eleven o'clock.
Q. What time did you awake in the morning?
Marley. Between one and two; and I miss'd my buckles then, and I ask'd my comrade Mumford where he was; and he said he was a long-side of me; and I ask'd him where Downing the prisoner was, and he said he was along-side of me; but I found he was gone; and I met with the prisoner again the same morning, about half an hour after six, when I was going to advertise him; and I charged him with robbing me.
Q. What did he say when you charged him with robbing you?
Marley. He said he found the 3 l. 12 s. piece in the bed.
Q. And did you get it again?
Marley. It was found between his stocking and his foot, and he said the 36 s. piece was changed; and he had my shoes upon his feet, but I could not find my buckles upon him.
Q. How long have you known the prisoner? was he a brother sailor
?
Marley. He was in one ship with me 5 months.
Q. to the Prisoner. What have you to say?
Prisoner . I can't express myself in English. Ask him whether he can swear to the 3 l. 12 s.
Marley No, my lord, I can't ; but I lost such a piece that night.
Prisoner . When I went to bed, I was in liquor.
Q. to Marley. Was he in liquor?
Marley. I don't know; I did not observe that he was.
Prisoner. He says he saw his shoes upon my feet; why did he not challenge them?
Marley. I said they were my property.
Q. What were the prisoner's buckles?
Marley. They were brass.
Prisoner. They were the same fashion as your own.
Marley. They were not a quarter so large.

            . On the 22d of July I lay with the prisoner and the prosecutor , at

Q. Had the prosecutor any silver buckles when he went to bed?
Mumford . Yes.
Q. What money had he?
Mumford. He did not tell me what money he had.
Q. What buckles had the prisoner ?
Mumford. They were either copper, or brass. These are the buckles that the prosecutor had; there's W M upon them . The prosecutor ask'd for the prisoner, and I said he was a long-side of him. He said he was gone; I jump'd out of bed to piss , and he said the money was all gone too, and I came down, and found the window-shutters and the casement open; and I said, bear a hand, as fast as you can, and after him, and we met with him in Leadenhall-street. He was searched, and he had the 3 l. 12 s. piece between his stocking and his foot.
Q. Was he carried before a magistrate?
Mumford. Yes; and he said the 36 s. piece was changed at one Mr. Haynes's in Darkhouse-lane .
Prisoner. He said the other night, in Newgate, that he would hang me.




               Guilty, 39 s.

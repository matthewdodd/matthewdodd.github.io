            . I live in Shorter's-court, Throgmorton-street. On the 14th of September I was in London-wall


, and felt something at my pocket - I turned round, and saw the prisoner with my silk handkerchief in his hand; he immediately dropped it - I followed him for a quarter of a mile, then secured, and gave him in charge - he had another boy
 with him; I felt the handkerchief go from me, and saw him throw it down; I took it up, but have left it at home - I am sure it is mine.

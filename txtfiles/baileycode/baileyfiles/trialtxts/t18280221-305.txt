            . I am a constable. On the 14th of February, about a quarter-past seven o'clock at night, I saw the prisoner on Tower-hill, with two others; they conversed about five minutes, and then separated; the prisoner and another went into a dark corner, and took a truck - they took it up the Minories; I went and asked the other man if he knew what they were going to do with it; he said No; I then followed the prisoner and his companion - they took it on to the corner of Goodman's-yard, where I stopped them, and asked what they were going to do with it; they both ran off - I pursued, and took the prisoner, without losing sight of him; Ellis claimed the truck.

            . I live with Mr. George Durant and his partner, of Winchester-street; Roberts showed me the truck - I had missed it about half-past six o'clock in the evening of the 14th, from the door; I know nothing of the prisoner.

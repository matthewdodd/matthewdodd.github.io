            . On the 18th of September, as I was passing through Houndsditch


, I saw the prisoner take my handkerchief out of my pocket; I pursued him, and a Jew stopped him, but he delivered the handkerchief to another man; some bad people got about and used me ill, that I was glad to get away; the next day a Jew came to me and told me the man was taken, and lodged in the Compter; I went to the Compter and knew him to be the same man; he was taken before my Lord Mayor, and committed; I saw the handkerchief going out of my pocket, and I saw it in the prisoner's hand.
Prisoner's Defence.
I have nobody to appear for me; I did not know I should be tried so soon.

            . I am a tailor
, and live in Bedford-street, Bedford-row


. The prisoner was my journeyman
, and had been so for five weeks. On the 1st of June, I found him sitting on a board under which was a piece of cloth, which certainly should not have been there - I then sent for an officer, and missed the articles stated; the next day some of it was found at the pawnbroker's, and some at his lodging.
WILLIAM BAKER ASHTON. I searched the prisoner's lodging, in a court near Tottenham-court-road; I found this piece of silk, this cloth, these materials for a pair of trousers, this body of a coat, and these duplicates.
JOHN BRICKELL. I am a pawnbroker. I have four remnants of cloth, and some kerseymere, pawned by the prisoner, on the 31st of May - I gave him this duplicate.
JOHN HUGHES. I am a pawnbroker. I have two yards of black cloth, pawned by the prisoner - I gave this duplicate.
JOSIAH PEARCE. I am a pawnbroker. I have three yards of black cloth pawned with me - I do not know by whom; I gave the person this duplicate.(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. He found a piece of cloth in the rags, which I knew nothing of - I brought part of these things from Portsmouth.

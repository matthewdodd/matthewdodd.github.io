. On the 6th of January, between three and four o'clock, while I was in the parlour, the prisoner came into the shop - I went in, and he said he came from Captain Cross - a lady named Cross lodged with me; I told him to go to the private door, and immediately he left the shop door I missed these shoes; I opened the door, and saw he was going away without knocking at the private door; I called to him to come back, but he did not - I ran and took hold of him, with this pair of shoes under his jacket.

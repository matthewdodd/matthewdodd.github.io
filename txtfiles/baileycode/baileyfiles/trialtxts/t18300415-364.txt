ROBERT PENFOLD. On the 15th of April, about ten minutes past seven in the morning, I was unloading a coal-waggon in Tower-street


; I took off my hat, and my handkerchief was in it - I put it on the premises while I went down with a sack of coals; when I came up a gentleman's son said, "Either you, or your mate, have lost a handkerchief;" and he showed me the prisoner in Mark-lane - there were four persons in company; he was the stoutest of them - I took him, and found my handkerchief in his bosom; this is it - I know it by a darn, and by the pattern: I gave it to the officer - it was as I had pulled it off my neck; I suppose I found it on him in about twenty minutes after I first put it down - we had unloaded one waggon; the prisoner's companions had parted from him, before I got up to him.
Prisoner's Defence. It was given me by the three men, who told me to put it round my neck; I put it in my bosom, and gave it to the gentleman.

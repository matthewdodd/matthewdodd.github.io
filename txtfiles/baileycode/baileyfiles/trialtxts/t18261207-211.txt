            . I live with Margaret Franklin, who lodges at Mr. Taylor's. On the 1st of December, about three o'clock, I met the prisoner on the third flight of stairs, coming down with her apron full of clothes; I inquired who she wanted, being a stranger - she said Mrs. Taylor; I said they lived on the first-floor, not so high as that, and asked what she had got in her apron - she said only her arm; I found these articles in it, and detained her till an officer came.
MARGARET FRANKLIN. I am a widow, and lodge on the third-floor. Lawson called me; I found the prisoner on the landing, with this property, which is mine.

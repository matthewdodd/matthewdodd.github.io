CHARLES SELLS
. I am a salesman, of Tooley-street. About half-past four in the afternoon of 26th Feb. I came from my parlour into my shop—I saw the prisoner Retty had hold of a pair of trowsers which were hanging on a bar under the window outside—I watched and saw her take them off the line—I ran out and laid hold of her—she had not got them then, but I saw Young walking away—I sent my young man to bring her back, and when she got into my shop she threw the trowsers from under her shawl on the counter—these are them—they are mine.





WILLIAM CONNELLY
 (policeman, M 228). I went to the shop—Sells gave me the prisoners and the trowsers—Retty escaped, but I caught her again.





GEORGE WARREN
 (policeman, M 94). I produce a certificate of Retty's conviction—(read—Convicted September; 1847, having been before convicted, confined one year)—she is the person.




GUILTY
.* Aged 20.—


Transported for Seven Years.

BENJAMIN PEDIGREE
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
18th of August, 1 pair of boots, value 4s., the goods of 



Charles Wright, from the person of 



James Wright; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






JAMES WRIGHT
. I live with my father Charles Wright, in Essex-street, Hackney. On the 13th of August, I was playing in Bishop Bonner's field—the prisoner came to me, laid me on my back on a bank, and took my boots off.





ALFRED COPE
. I am nine years old. I was playing in the field—I saw the prisoner running down the bank with a pair of boots in his hand—I am sure he is the person.





JAMES FREDERICK TROVELL
. I am a pawnbroker. I have the boots—they were pawned with me by a boy, on the 14th—I cannot say who it was.

(Property produced and sworn to.)





THOMAS COOK
 (police-constable K 174.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 17.—


Transported for Ten Years.

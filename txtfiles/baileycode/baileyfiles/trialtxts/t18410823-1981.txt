GEORGE FINCHLEY
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
15th of August, 1 handkerchief, value 5s., the goods of 




William Adams, from his person; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






WILLIAM ADAMS
. I am a surgeon, and live in Finsbury-square. At a quarter-past ten o'clock in the evening of the 15th of August I was coming by St. Paul's—I felt a jerk at my pocket—I turned round, and instantly seized the prisoner, who was behind me, almost touching me—he then produced my handkerchief from behind him, saving he had picked it up; that he saw a person pick my pocket, and throw it down—no one but the prisoner was within ten yards—no one but him could take it—he pretended to see some one running, but there was no one.


Prisoner. I saw a boy pick the gentleman's pocket, and take the handkerchief and chuck it down; he ran directly he threw it down; if the gentleman had not turned round I should have given it him.





CHARLES CHAMBERS
 (City police-constable, No. 523.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 18.—


Transported for Ten Years.

            ; this Boy
 I employed in turning the Stick, in beating this Thread. Upon the 5th of December I had given out a Draught of Thread; I had weighed out some white Thread; I was obliged to go out about Business ; I give out 70 or 80 at a Time. When I came Home at Night, my Wife said I would not have you be frightned, but we have found out the Thief; I have paid many Pounds to these Gentlemen for the Loss of Goods; there was found in his Breeches, one Pound and six Ounces of sewing Thread, he owned it to me that Pound and six Ounces that was in his Breeches, and he was to carry it to the Person that he had carried the other two. I goes to the Compter to him, and says, Darby, how could you take that Thread away? you have often heard me say that I had better work for nothing, &c. he told me he sold it to a Woman in Flower and Dcan-street , Spital fields, he described her to be a lusty Woman, that keeps an Old-Cloaths-Shop; there was a small Quantity of Thread not salable; I could not pretend to swear it was my Thread; he said sometimes he had sold it for 9 d. and sometimes for 6 d. and three Hanks he had sold her for 3 d. he owned he took three Hanks out of one Colour, and three out of another, he has sold for 6 d. a Pound, that that was worth 2 s. and 2 s. 8 d. a Pound.

            . I am Servant to Mr Hunt. I was at work at the String, and this Darby's Shirt hung out of his Breeches (as I thought), but I found instead of it's being his Shirt, it was Thread, and he owned he was to carry it to this Place in Flower and Dean-Street .

Q. What Day of the Month did you find this upon him?
Ascroft . The 5th of December. 


               Guilty 10 d.
            

The Prisoner. Darby, is but thirteen Years of Age; by this wicked Practice, Mr Hunt declared he was like to be ruined, both as to his Character and Substance.

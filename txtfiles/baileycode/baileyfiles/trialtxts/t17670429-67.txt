            . I live in Chandler's-street by Grosvenor-square. On the 9th of February I missed my crape gown, and found it again on the 10th, at Mrs. Platt's, at the Cock in Monmouth-street. I did not know the prisoner before.

            . I live in Monmouth-street; the prisoner sold this gown to me on the 9th of February; (produced and deposed to by prosecutrix) the prosecutrix found it at my house the 10th. About ten days after he came to sell two more gowns, and I had him taken up.
Prisoner's defence.
They were my wife's gowns. I am a Smith, and live in Tyburn-road; the last place I work'd at was in Westminster; I have worked for three or four masters, but they are all dead.

            . The gowns were not all of a length, they did not appear to be made for one woman.

            . I live with Mr. 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Sowerby
               



            , who is a pawnbroker
. On the 6th of April, about half-past six o'clock in the evening, the handkerchiefs were safe in the shop window; I was watching the prisoner from an upper window. I saw him put his hand in at the window, take a handkerchief, and go away with it. I ran down stairs, pursued him, and caught sight of him about fifty yards off; I am positive he is the person - I had seen him lurking about for some time previous - another boy was with him - he was stopped before I came up. I myself took the handkerchief out of either his hand or bosom - we lost two handkerchiefs; the window was cut to get them out.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

1922. 




JOHN GIRDLER
 was indicted

 for stealing 1 truck, value 2l., the goods of 



Charles Austin; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






CHARLOTTE AUSTIN
. I am the wife of Charles Austin; we live at Lambeth; we let out trucks. About the 23rd of Jan., 1844, the prisoner came and had a truck of me—I am sure he is the man—he said it was for his master, Mr. Mouncey—he had had it for his master from me before—he ought to have brought it back in an hour and a half—he did not bring it back at all.





JAMES MOUNCEY
. I was the prisoner's master. He left me on the 20th of Jan. last Year—I did not authorise him to hire a truck after that day, and he did not bring one to my house.

Prisoner's Defence. It was to carry some goods; I went into a public-house, and sat drinking with a man; when I came out the truck was gone; I went to get it in Mr. Mouncey's name, as I had worked for him.





WILLIAM SIER
 (police-sergeant G 29.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction—(read—Convicted the 8th of April, 1844, by the name of 


John Smith, and Confined one Year)—the prisoner is the same person.




GUILTY
. Aged 34.—


Transported for Seven Years.

(There was another indictment against the prisoner.)

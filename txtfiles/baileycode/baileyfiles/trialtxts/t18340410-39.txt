             (police-constable G 175). On the 3rd of March I was called to take the prisoner, who was then in a pawnbroker's shop - she said, "How foolish it is for you to take me into custody, when, if you will give me time, I will get the things out" - I went to her lodgings, and found the two duplicates, which led me to the pawnbroker's where these things were - I was laid up at the time, or I could have produced several other charges against her - I have a handkerchief in my pocket now, belonging to a gentleman, who discharged a servant in consequence of it.

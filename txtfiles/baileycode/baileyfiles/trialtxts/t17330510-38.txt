            . The Prisoner is a Tyre-Woman
; she came to cut my Child's Hair, and so I invited her to Dinner. - My Snuff-Box, (which Mr. Vanderess had pawn'd to me) lay upon the Table, and when she was gone it was missing. She was afterwards taken up for going into a House at Charing-Cross, with a Design to steal the Goods, and being carry'd before Justice De Veil, Word was sent to me, and I went. I tax'd her with it, and she deny'd it stiffly, but being search'd it was found in her Bosom.
Prisoner. It is a Shame for a Woman to own it, but he gave me the Box for Body Corporation, when his Sister went out after Dinner.
Court. You hear what she says.
Mat. Cusworth. I never touch'd her Garment.

            . When I went out I left only my Brother and Mr. Upton there.

                  Upton 
               



            . I saw the Box in the Prisoner's Hand, and in no Body else's, and I think she went out first.
The Jury found her 


               guilty to the value of 10 d.

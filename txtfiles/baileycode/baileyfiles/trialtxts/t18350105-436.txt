JOHN SIMMONDS EAGLE
 was indicted

 for feloniously breaking and entering the shop of 



John Roberts, on the 
16th of December, and stealing 5 hearth-rugs, value 6l., his goods.






JOHN ROBERTS
. I live in Pearson-street, Kingsland-road, Shoreditch. I keep a hearth-rug manufactory—my shop is not connected with my house—it is at the bottom of my garden—no one sleeps there—on the 16th of December, I left it about nine o'clock—every thing was then right—next morning I found the door had been forced open—a square of glass had been broken, and an iron bar taken away, which had been propped against the door, and the door had been opened with a key—I missed six hearth-rugs—there had been twelve, and six were gone—here are five of them, which I had in my shop the night before—I know them by the pattern, and the manner of work—I have employed the prisoner occasionally.





WILLIAM THOMAS COURTNEY
. I am a journeyman to the prosecutor. These rugs are his property—this one I made myself, and I drew the patterns for these others.





GABRIEL BURROWS
. I am shopman to a pawnbroker in Shoreditch. I have three hearth-rugs pawned by the prisoner, on the evening of the 17th of December, for 1l.





ELIZABETH SEABROOK
. I saw the prisoner's son bring a box into the house where the prisoner lodges.





JAMES TILT
. I went with another officer to the prisoner's lodgings—I found one rug, and this key, which opens the prosecutor's shop door.






WILLIAM HOLLAND
. I am a pawnbroker. I have a rug which was pawned by the prisoner, I believe.




GUILTY
. Aged 48.—


Transported for Seven Years.

That he came into the House, pretending that a Neighbour was coming to him, and going up Stairs, no sooner had a Tankard brought him, and left alone, but he, by a Cord, slipped out at the Window; within some days after being Apprehended and Committed, he by Letter acknowledged the Felony, and was found 

               Guilty
            .

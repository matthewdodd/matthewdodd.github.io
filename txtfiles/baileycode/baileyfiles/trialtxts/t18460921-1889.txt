1889. 




GEORGE BROWN
 was indicted

 for stealing 1 flag, value 15s.; and 1 knife, 1s.; the goods of 



William Henry Goddard, in a vessel in the port of London.—2nd COUNT, stating them to be the goods of 




Philip Palot; and that the prisoner had been before convicted of felony.






GEORGE WILSON
. I am a police—constable employed at the East and West India Dock. On the 10th of Sept., at a quarter before five o'clock, I was on duty at Limehouse-basin entrance—I stopped the prisoner coming out—I asked if he had anything about him—he said he had not, but on lifting up his smock, I found this knife sticking in his belt, and this flag wrapped round his person—he said he had been employed on board the Sam Slick, and got them from there—he said the knife was his rigging-knife.





JOHN PALOT
. I am the son of Philip Palot—I belong to the Sam Slick I—Philip Palot is the master—the owner is William Henry Goddard—I know this flag and knife—they belong to him—the prisoner had no business with either of them—he was a rigger on board the vessel—he did not sail with it.

Cross-examined by
MR. HORRY. Q. Is it a knife that may be used in rigging? A. No; it is a common table-knife—this flag is a Union Jack—I know it by this knot, which I put in it myself on the Queen's birth-day—it is my father's.





THOMAS WATKINS
 (police-constable K 310.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction at this Court—(read—Convicted 3rd of February, 1845, and confined four months)—the prisoner is the person—he was in custody seven years ago, and was sentenced for seven years, but the officer who had him then has left the force—since he has been home he has been a regular associate with thieves.




GUILTY
. Aged 29.—


Transported for Seven Years.

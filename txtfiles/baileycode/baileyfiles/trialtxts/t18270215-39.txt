            . I am an officer. On the 16th of January, about eight o'clock in the evening, I was employed to watch Messrs. Taylor's premises, in Cross-street, Finsbury; I saw the prisoner come from the house - I followed him above three hundred yards, into Sun-street, which is in the City - Herdsfield stopped him; I felt outside his pocket, and asked what he had got there - he said, potatoes; I said I must see what it was - he then said it was a little opium, which a friend had given him. I took it out of his pocket.
Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. You were directed to watch? A. Yes.

            . I was with Forrester, and stopped the prisoner in the City; Forrester's account is correct.
MR. 
               
                  JOHN 
                  TAYLOR
               



            . I am in partnership with David and John Taylor. The prisoner was in our service, and had no authority to take this opium - it is worth 12s.
Cross-examined. Q. How long has he lived with you? A. Fourteen years. We have missed 15lbs. since the 1st of January; he bore a good character.

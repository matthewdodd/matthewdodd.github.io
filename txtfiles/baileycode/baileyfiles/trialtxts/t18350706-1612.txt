CHARLES CREASEY
. I am a policeman. On the 15th of June about a quarter to eleven o'clock, I was in Gunnesbury-lane, Ealing and heard a very heavy fall—I listened and heard some voices, apparently of two men, in conversation—on going further I heard one of them say, "There is somebody coming"—I proceeded on and saw two men go from the ditch into the road—I went to the ditch and found a quantity of lead concealed in it—I crossed the road and saw them a-head of me—they turned back passed me, and bid me good night—I turned back and went to wards where the lead was—they passed it and went on about twenty yards into a field; and as I was under the hedge I heard one of them fall—I called out clambered up the bank, and found the prisoner lying down, pretending to be asleep I shook him I am certain he was one of the two men I knew him well before he had come back and got over behind the hedge I saw nobody near the spot but him and the other—I took him into custody—there were marks on his jacket and waistcost of lead dirt—Mr. Farmer's house is about thirty yards from and waistcoat of lead dirt—I found a mark on his gates where they had got over and a print in the ground where the lead had been pitched.





THOMAS FARMER
. I live at Ealing. I examined my premises when the officer gave me information, and found lead removed—I have not a doubt that this lead came from my premises I had seen it two or three days before.




GUILTY

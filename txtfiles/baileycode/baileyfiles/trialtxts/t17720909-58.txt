            . I hired the prisoner on the 1st of June to wind quills
 for me; on the 4th of June she stole the things mentioned in the indictment. She was taken in Shoreditch on the 6th of August; she said she was fuddled when she took them, and that she had pledged the shift with Mr. Brown; I went to Mr. Brown's, and there found the shift.
- Brown produced a shift pledged by the prisoner on the 6th of June, which was deposed to by the prosecutor's wife.
The prisoner, in her defence, said she was innocent of the charge: she called three witnesses who gave her a good character.

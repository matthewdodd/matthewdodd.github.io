             M'Kernon; I lost the things mentioned in the indictment, eight weeks ago last Friday, out of my apartment in Poppin's-alley, near Fleet-market


: I trusted the prisoner in my room; I went out to get a bit of bread, by crying things in the street, and when I came home, she was gone, and the things: the constable took her the next day in Church-street, St. Giles's, and all the goods upon her; (produced and deposed to.) I had seen them that very day they were missing.

            . I am constable; the woman came to me to take up the prisoner; I took her in Church-street, St. Giles's, in a lodging; she had the things with her; she owned before the Justice she did take them.
The prisoner said nothing in her defence.

The prosecutor had some cheeses that stood on the plat-form at New-bear Key


, in order to be put on board a vessel for Margate; the prisoner was observed to take one under his jacket, and, in running up Harp-lane, was taken with it. (Produced and deposed to.)
The prisoner, in his defence, said, it was delivered to him, by a man, to carry to the end of the lane, and he was to have two-pence for his trouble.

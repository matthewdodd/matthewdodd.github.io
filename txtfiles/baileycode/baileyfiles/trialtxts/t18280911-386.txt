WILLIAM SIMMONS. I am a servant
. On the 7th of of September I was in St. James-street


. near the door of No. 50; my hat had been in the inner hall; I saw the prisoner come with it down the steps; he ran up the street; I pursued and took him with it in his hand - he said "Is this it."

            . I am an officer - I took the prisoner and bring the hat.(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. A person ran by me and dropped the hat, and when the prosecutor came up to me I told him so; on the way to the watch-house; he said, "I think I have made a mistake, and I wish to let him go," but I said"I will not be let go, I am given in charge, and let the officer do his duty." At the watch-house he had his doubts, but he was persuaded to press the charge.

WILLIAM SIMMONS. He never told me that a person had dropped the hat; I never expressed any doubt about his person and - I it would cause me a good deal of trouble had I not better let him go; but the watchman said"You have given him in charge and he must go:" he said he did not wish to be let go; he had a companion with him.

            . I did not hear the prosecutor express a wish to let him go; he said it would cost him a great deal of trouble, might he not as well let him go; he never expressed any doubt about his person.

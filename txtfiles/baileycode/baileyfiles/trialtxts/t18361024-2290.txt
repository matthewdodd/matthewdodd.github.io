HENRY MILLS
. I am barman to Charles Henry Clifford, who keeps the Coach and Horse, High-street, Shadwell. On Saturday night, the 24th of September, the prisoner was there about ten o'clock, with a little girl, whom she not the bar for half a pint of ale—I served it in a pint put, I gave it the little girl—she took it over to the prisoner, who drank it,

went out, and then I missed the pot—I went and found her with it in her lap—I took it out of her, and gave it to the policeman—it was my master's.

Prisoner. I had been drinking there all the evening, and did not know what I had got.

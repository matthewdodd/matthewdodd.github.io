EDWARD CLARK
. I live in Punderson-place, Bethnal-green. The prisoner Hodges lives next door to me, his mother keeps a green-grocer's shop—I had my watch safe on the 19th of November, I did not miss it till the 26th—it had been in the drawer in my parlour—Hodges bad access to my house—I did not see him after I lost the watch till he was before the Magistrate—I found part of the watch at the station-house.





JOHN MIDDLEDITCH
. I am a watch-maker. On the 19th of November, Pettigree came and offered the broken plate and case of this watch for sale, he gave his name, "John Pettigree, 5, Rhode-alley, Brick-lane"—he said he had found it—I said the plate of it was battered—he said he had bitten it to ascertain if it was gold—I detained him.





THOMAS COOK
. I am a policeman. I was called in by Mr. Middleditch, who produced this case of the watch and part of the plate—I took

Pettigree to the station-house, and found on him part of the works of the watch—he said that Mike Hodges gave it to him and he was outside—I went out and he pointed Hodges out to me, Hodges ran away—I went and took him, and brought him back—Pettigree said in his presence that he gave it him—Hodges did not deny it, but said he picked it up in Bethnal-green-road.

ELEANOR STRAFEN
. I live in York-square, Commercial-road. I was walking with Mr. Robert Daniell, on Monday night, the 18th of January—I know he had a red handkerchief with him—I cannot swear to it—it was taken from him by somebody.





SARAH HAGUE
. I am the wife of David Hague, and live in Church-row On the 18th of January, I was passing along the Commercial-road, and saw the prisoner and another boy walking behind the gentleman and lady—I saw the other boy hold up the pocket while the prisoner put his hand in, and drew the handkerchief out, all but the corner—the gentleman walked on—the wind blew it of, and it dropped—the prisoner picked it up—he said to the other, "Jack, take it, and run away with it"—the other ran, and I saw no more of him—I hid hold of the prisoner, and tapped the gentleman on the shoulder, and told him his pocket was picked—he turned round, and took hold of the prisoner—this is the handkerchief.

Prisoner. This young woman was coming along—the handkerchief blew on the ground—I picked it up—she said it is the man's handkerchief—I said I knew it was—I was going to take it to him—I gave it to her—she ran up, and I after her—when I came up to the gentleman he said, "Who picked my pocket?—"I found it, Sir, but I have not picked your pocked." Witness. Yes, he said, "I have picked up your handkerchief"—I told him I had seen him draw it out, all but the end.

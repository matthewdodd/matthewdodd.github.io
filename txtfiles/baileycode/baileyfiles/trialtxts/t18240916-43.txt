            , of Battle-bridge. On the 28th of July I saw the two prisoners by the door of the shop - they asked the price of a flute, and said they would call again which they did and Walker said,
"I am come about the flute;" I saw something move about Watts, and a young lady here gave me some information. Watts was taken by me, and the handkerchief found upon him.

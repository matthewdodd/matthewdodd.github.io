                  John 
                  Holiday
               



             of St. Andrews Holbourn


, was Indicted for 


               Felony and Burglary, in breaking the House of Sir


                        Edward 
                        Abney
                     




                   on the 22th of May
, and taking 2 silver Candlesticks value 40 l. and other Goods to a great value
            . It appeared, that one 
               Tho. Chance
             and 
               Will. Eaton
            , were in the same Robbery; that they opened the Prosecutor's window, and entering the rooms where the goods were, carry'd them away; and one of the Evidence deposed, that the goods were brought to her by the Prisoner, and the other two Confederates to be sold, who told her they took them out of a House in Bedford-Row. She also deposed, that she sold the Goods for them at 3 s. an ounce, which is the most can be had for such Goods. The Evidence being very plain as to the Felony, but not as to the Burglary, and the Prisoner having little to say, the Jury brought him in 


               guilty of Felony only
            .

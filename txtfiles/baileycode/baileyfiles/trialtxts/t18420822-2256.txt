ELIZABETH JONES
. I am the wife of James William Jones, of Goswell-street—I came into the shop on the 23rd of July, about ten minutes past one in the day, and saw the prisoner—I had had a chain on the counter, and an opera glass in a glass case—I saw the prisoner putting his hand in his pocket—I thought he had taken something—I went to close the door—he rushed to get out—I took hold of him, and kept him, with the assistance of a witness, till I sent for A policeman—he scuffled a great deal—I found the chain and opera glass on the mat, a considerable distance from where

they had been ten minutes or a quarter of an hour before—I had walked over the mat before and there was nothing there then.

Prisoner. Q. Did I not ask you to search me? A. Yes.





JAMES FOOT
. I am errand boy to the prosecutor—I saw the prisoner in the shop—I saw him rush out—my mistress asked what he wanted—he asked the way to the Angel—I saw my mistress pick up the chain and glass from the floor.

Prisoner's Defence. I heard of a place at Islington, and did not know my way; I went to the shop and asked; I understood she did not know; I was coming out and she stopped me.





ROBERT M'KENZIE
 (police-constable B 44.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 16.—


Transported for Seven Years—Convict Ship.

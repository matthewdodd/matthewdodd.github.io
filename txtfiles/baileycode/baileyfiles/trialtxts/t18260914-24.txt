            . I am a boot-closer. On the 11th of August, about nine o'clock in the evening, I was about ten yards from the prosecutor's shop, in Crawford-street, Mary-le-bone


, and saw the prisoner catch hold of a piece of flannel, which was in the shop, but projected a little out of the door - she was close to the door; she examined it with her fingers, then lifted up her shawl, took the flannel in her arms, and got about twelve yards from the house with it, when I secured her - she dropped it. I took her back, and then fetched the property.
Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was she drunk? A. I think she was rather in liquor, but not much; when I first saw her a woman stood at her back - the prisoner is the woman who took it.
THOMAS ROBINSON. I am in partnership with John Harris - we are linen-drapers

. Birbeck brought the prisoner in, and then fetched the flannel, which is ours; I should sell it for 45s.

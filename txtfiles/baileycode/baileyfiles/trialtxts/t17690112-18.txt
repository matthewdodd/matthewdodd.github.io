             came to my house the next day, about 10 o'clock, and said he would shew me the person that had the coat. I went with him to the Running Horse, in St. Giles's, where Richard Row had the prisoner in custody. The prisoner had my coat on his back. As we were taking him to the Round-house, he made his escape. We took him again, I think it was at the Golden Boot, in Newtoner's Lane, the same night, about an hour and a half or two hours after. When we went to the house, the constable stood at the door, and I went in. As soon as the prisoner saw me, he ran away; the constable laid hold of his clothes, but he got away, and a person unknown pursued and took him. We had him not long, before he ran away again. I had taken the two coats he had on from him; he was in his shirt. The constable pursued and took him again in about ten minutes. We brought him into the house. He insisted upon having my coat on again: we let him put it on, and the other coat too. Then we took him to the Round-house, from thence to Justice Welch, and he was committed.
Q. from Prisoner. Whether the evidence Terrin did not say he stole the coats, and said I was not with him?
Ince. Terrin said the prisoner was not guilty in taking my clothes, he not being with him at the time. He said they were together in taking Dignam's clothes, and that they carried them to Terrin's lodging; and then he (Terrin) came to my house, and Ward was not in company with him then.
Jos. Terrin. Ward went out with me on the Friday night to Dignam's house. I shoved up the sash, and put back the blind, and Ward went in and brought out two coats: but when I went to Mr. Ince's, I was alone. I went in, and brought out two coats, and a pair of shoes. I put them up in my room. I saw the prisoner in about half an hour after at the King's Arms. I took him home, and shewed him the coats I had got; and on the Saturday morning he wanted to buy one coat of me. I would not fell it him. Then he broke open my door, and took all the clothes away. I had locked the room, and had the key in my pocket, while I went down Holborn for a man to buy them. When I asked him for them, he called me dog, and said they were none of mine, they were Pidgeon's.
Q. from Prisoner. What is the reason you did not indict Tiney Roach, a prisoner now in Newgate? He has been concerned with you in all your robberies.
Terrin. I did not know he was taken, till after this bill was found.
Richard Row. I was the officer. The prisoner made his escape when I was going to put Terrin in the Round-house. Terrin came and told me they had stole coats. Mr. Ince, I, and 
               
                  James 
                  Pomeroy 
               



            , went to the Golden Boot, in Cross-Lane. I ordered them to go into the house first, and I stayed at the door. Presently I saw the prisoner running out of the house in his shirt; I overtook him in about two hundred yards running. Assistance came up: then the prisoner said, Row, do not use me ill, I'll go along with you. Then we went to the Golden Boot again. There he would have the clothes on again. We let him. He swore he would wear Mr. Ince's great coat. Then we took him to St. Giles's Round-house, from thence to the Justice's, and he was committed.
Prisoner's Defence.
This evidence, Terrin, came into Mr. Porter's, where he offered to sell a coat to one Mr. Fletcher: he would not give the money he asked for it, which was half a guinea. I seeing three or four more coats, said this cannot be your property. He said he would wear it. I said it does not fit you; I will take it, and keep it till such time it is advertised. He said, Give me money to buy a pair of breeches, and you shall have it. I put it on. After that he went to Mr. Row, and brought him to me. Mr. Row told him, if he would stand to what he had told him, he would be a friend to him.

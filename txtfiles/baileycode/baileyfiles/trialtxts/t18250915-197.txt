            . My husband's name is Charles - we live at No. 8, Gardener's-lane, Westminster


. The prisoner lodged at my house four nights - about half an hour after she was gone I missed two gowns and a spencer, which had been in a trunk under her bed. I went after her, and overtook her - I asked her to come back - she was loath, but I said if she did not I would get assistance to make her; when she came back I looked her all over, but I could not find any thing. I then got an officer, and looked over her again, and then I found some scissars, which were mine - she was then taken to the watch-house, and the officer found some duplicates upon her.

            . The prisoner was brought to me at the watch-house. I searched her, and found this ticket in her boot.

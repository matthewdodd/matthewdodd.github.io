            . I had information that the prisoner was a common pot stealer, and on Saturday, the 3rd, we lost seven bar pints. The prisoner was in my house on the 3rd, as late as we kept the house open, as late as eleven. He came again on Sunday the 4th, and called for a pint of porter in a spouted pot; after he was gone, the pot was missing. He returned again in about three quarters of an hour, and I then watched him. I told my people to go, and have an officer at hand. I suspected he had something about him, and I collared him, and took him and found this property on him.

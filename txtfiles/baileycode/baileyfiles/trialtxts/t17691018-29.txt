            . I live in King-street, Westminster


. The prisoner lodged with me five weeks. She left me the 12th of September. I had given her warning to go away, and I mist the things laid in the indictment, the Saturday after she was gone, out of my drawers; some in one room, and some in another. I went and found her in Swallow-street, at Mrs. Barber's. There I found all my things in a box in her room.

            . On the 3d of August, I left my house in Cross-street, Soho


, about six o'clock in the evening, and left some linen on the floor of the back parlour, which is at the end of a long passage leading to the yard - my husband was up stairs - the street door is always open. I did not stay out more than five minutes, and when I came back, my landlady gave me a bundle which contained the things I had left in my apartment.

            . I am the landlady of the house. I saw the prisoner go out at the street-door, with a bundle under his arm, I followed and came up with him - he went into a stable-yard, which opens with folding gates. I took it from him and let him go. I brought the things back and gave them to the owner. I am certain he is the man. I looked in his face, and let him go in consequence of his age. I did not speak to him.

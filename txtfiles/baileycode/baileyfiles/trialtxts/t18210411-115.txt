. On the 15th of March, between eleven and twelve o'clock at night. I was called up - they said thieves were in the house; the watchman searched my yard, and we saw the print of a man's shoe. Next morning, I missed the lead from the roof of my coal shed - it joins the dwelling house. I saw it afterwards fitted, it corresponded.
RANDAL BAZILL. I am a watchman. I was on duty near Mr. Brown's house, and saw a large piece of lead laying in the gutter. I saw somebody creeping along the gutter, he got into the privy of the next house, and the prisoner was taken there. I fitted the lead on the premises.

            . I am a watchman. I searched the privy of the next house, and found the prisoner there with the door shut, standing up. I said, you are the person I am looking for; he said he had no accomplice in it, that he meant to take all the lead away himself.

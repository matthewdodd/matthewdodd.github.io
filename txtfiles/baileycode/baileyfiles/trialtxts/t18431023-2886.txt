2886. 




EDWARD WALKER
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
17th of Oct., 4 pairs of boots, value 34s.; the goods of 



Catherine Hennessey, his mistress.






CATHERINE HENNESSEY
. I am a widow, and keep a shoe shop in Old-street-road. The prisoner is a shoemaker, and works at my shop—I was constantly missing shoes—on the 17th of Oct, I gave him in charge—the policeman produced these four pairs of boots—they are mine.

Prisoner. Q. Are you able to swear they were never sold? A. Never, I am certain.





JAMES BRANNAN
 (police-sergeant.) I told the prisoner he was suspected of robbing his mistress—he said he knew nothing about it—I asked if he had any duplicates—he said he had not—I put my hand into his pocket, and found the duplicate of these boots, and found one pair on his feet, which the prosecutrix identified.





PHILIP POILE
. I am a pawnbroker. I produce one pair of boots pawned by the prisoner.





FREDERICK FOR
. I am a pawnbroker. I have two pairs of boots, pawned by the prisoner.




GUILTY.†
 Aged 19.—


Transported for Seven Years.

JOHN JACKSON
 was indicted

 for stealing 1 shawl, value 2s., the goods of 



Charles Jarvis James, from his person; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






CHARLES JARVIS JAMES
. I live in Portland-place, New Kent-road. On the 16th of Jan., between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, I missed a shawl from my coat-pocket—I was then at Elthara, where there was a steeple-chase—there was a crowd of people throwing at oranges, and boys scrambling after them—this is my shawl.





JOHN CARPENTER
 (police-constable R 84.) I was at Eltham, and I saw the prisoner in the crowd, trying several gentlemen's pockets—he then went to another gentleman, and took a handkerchief half-way out of his pocket, then went to the prosecutor, took this shawl from his pocket, and put it into his own pocket—I put my hand on his pocket, and asked the prosecutor if the shawl was his—he recognised it.

Prisoner. It is false about my going to other people's pockets.

Witness. I saw him go to at least eight people's pockets.





JOHN EVANS
 (police-constable R 190.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got at Mr. Clark's office—I know the prisoner—I was at the trial—he is the person—(read—"Convicted Sept. 18th, 7th Vict, and imprisoned one year.)




GUILTY
. Aged 21.—


Transported for Ten Years.

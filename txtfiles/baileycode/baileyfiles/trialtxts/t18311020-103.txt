            . I am a porter at the Bull and Mouth. On the 23rd of September, about eight o'clock in the morning, I was at the end of Holborn-hill, and saw the prisoner trying to pick a gentleman's pocket; he did not get any thing at first, but when he got to the King's Arms-yard


, he put his hand in, and abstracted a handkerchief from the gentleman's pocket - I seized his two arms, and took the handkerchief from him; I called to the gentleman, who turned, nodded his head, and said,"That is my handkerchief;" I said, "You follow me," and I took the prisoner on till I saw the street-keeper -I gave him in charge, but the gentleman did not come.

            . I received the prisoner and the handkerchief; the gentleman could not be found - the handkerchief is marked J.S.
Prisoner's Defence. I was going towards Smithfield, and in crossing I saw the handkerchief on the ground -I took it and put it into my side-pocket; several persons saw me pick it up - that man accused me of taking it from the gentleman, but I did not.

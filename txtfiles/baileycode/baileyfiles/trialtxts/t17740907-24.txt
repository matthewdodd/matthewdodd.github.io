: all the things mentioned in the indictment were my own except the shirt and stockings; they were in a one-pair-of-stairs room; some were upon the chamber horse in the room; there was an alaram of my chimney being on fire; I went out and staid about half an hour; they were all safe in my apartment when I went out, and gone when I returned.

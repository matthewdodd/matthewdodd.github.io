            . I live in Devonshire-street, Bishopsgate-street. On Sunday, the 18th of December, between one and two o'clock, I was returning home; I had been out about an hour and a half, and put my handkerchief from my breast pocket, into my outside coat pocket, on the Pavement, in Moorfields, and as I walked through Allhallows' church-yard


 two charity-boys came up, and gave me information; they pointed to the prisoner, who had two boys with him; one about seven years old, in a pinafore, and the other rather taller than the prisoner - I ran after the prisoner; an officer came up, and he gave him the handkerchief.

            . I am a constable. I observed people running in London-wall - I pursued, came up with them in Broad-street, and found the prisoner in custody; he pulled the handkerchief from his breeches, and said if the prosecutor would forgive him he would give it up.(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I met a boy, who asked if I wanted to buy a handkerchief; I said, "Let me look at it;" and when I looked at it, he said, "Tuck it up, here comes my father," and I put it into my breeches - he told me to run, which I did, and directly the gentleman came I gave him the handkerchief; I did not know the boy in a pinafore.

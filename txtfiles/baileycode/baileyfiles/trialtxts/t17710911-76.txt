            , I am a coachman
. My wife had a silk gown she bought of a poor woman out of pawn for two shillings and ten pence; she had it but a few days; I had an accident, and my wife was in the hospital. I left the prisoner to take care of the house. Three weeks she lay there; I missed the gown on the first of August; she went out the preceding evening and never came again. I saw the gown on her back the next day, the second of August, in the evening, in a cellar, in Pall Mall, almost facing the Duke of Marlborough's.
Q. What did she say about the gown?
Elsley. She said 
               
                  Rebecca
                   Tunk
               



            , a woman that used to carry things to my wife, opened the box and gave it to her; she said she knew nothing about it; she came every morning to carry necessaries to my wife. The prisoner was recommended to me as a lodger three weeks before my wife had the accident.
Prisoner's Defence.
I never saw the gown. The woman he took in is a servant; her husband is a hard working man. The prosecutor is not a married man. I went to his wife, as he calls her; she says they are not married; he came several mornings, and tried to break into my room, and because I would not be connected with him he brought this prosecution against me.
Prosecutor. She is my wife; we have been married four years.




               Guilty, 10 d.

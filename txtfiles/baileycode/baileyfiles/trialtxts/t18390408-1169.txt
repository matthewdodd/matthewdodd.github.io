JOHN JONES
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
3rd of April, 1 order for the payment of 153l. 4s. 4d.; and 1 order for 2l. 8s. 1d.; the property of 



William Gillmore Bolton and others, his masters.






CHARLES GREENWOOD
. I am clerk to William Gillmore Bolton and others—the prisoner was also a clerk of theirs. On the 3rd of April I left the office about three o'clock in the afternoon, leaving two cheques in my desk, one for 153l. 4s. 4d. on the Bank of England, and the other on Gosling and Sharp for 2l. 8s. 1d.—I left the prisoner and another clerk in the office—I returned in about an hour, and missed the cheques—the prisoner had then left the office—the desk had not been locked—I went, and

found him at his mother's in a state of intoxication—I searched his pocket, and took from it a bag containing ninety-nine sovereigns, and from a pocket-book five £5 notes and this small cheque, which was one of those we had lost—I went to the Bank, and found the other cheque there.

Prisoner. Q. What did you recover in all? A. Upwards of 150l.—you were not prohibited from going to my desk.





THOMAS SIMPSON
. I was in the office on this day—there was no one there but me and the prisoner—about three quarters of an hour after Mr. Greenwood went out I saw the prisoner at the desk—I said if Mr. Greenwood was to come in he would not like to see, him at his desk—he went out shortly after, taking his cloak with him.





ROBERT CURTIS
. I am a clerk in the Bank. I paid this cheque to the prisoner between four and five o'clock on Wednesday, the 3rd of April, in a £100. note and ten £5 notes.

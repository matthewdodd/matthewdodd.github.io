CHARLES DAMMERY. I am a brick-maker
, and live in a cottage in Mr. Sunter's field, at Pentonville


 - I and my servants live there - I pay 1s. a week for it. On the 24th of February, about ten minutes past eleven o'clock in the morning, I was in the field; my mother gave an alarm - I pursued the prisoner, who was running as hard as he could from the cottage; I saw him throw two pairs of shoes away. Allen stopped him.

            . I am the prosecutor's mother - he left me in his house - I came out about a quarter past eleven o'clock, and latched the door, leaving nobody inside; I had not gone away five minutes when the prisoner passed me, and said it was bad weather; I am sure he is the man. As I turned to come back I saw him coming out of my son's door, with my son's clothes on his arm. I gave an alarm, and saw him throw the shoes down.

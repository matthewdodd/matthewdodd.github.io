            . I am servant to Mr. Bolland, who lives in South-street, Grosvenor-square. I was going through Ball's-pond gate


, with a chaise and pair, towards Enfield


 - the coat was tied on the front of the chaise. The prisoner and another followed me about half a mile - I kept my eye on them. I took my eye off for a moment, and then saw the prisoner run off with the coat. I rode after him, lost sight of him for a moment, and he threw it away.

            . I am a gardener. I saw the prosecutor riding very fast after the prisoner. I followed, secured him, and picked the coat up in the way he ran - it was thrown over the hedge.

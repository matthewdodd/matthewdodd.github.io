                  , from his person
            .
JOHN READY. About six o'clock in the evening of the day of the indictment, I was at the Black Lion public-house, at Kelburn


. I had some beer, and fell asleep there. When I was awakened, I missed my money; it was eight shillings and sixpence, consisting of two three shillings pieces, a one and six-penny piece, and a shilling. I have seen one three shilling piece, to which I can swear. I know it, because there is a hole close to the edge of it. I saw it the next day at Hatton Garden.

            . I saw the prisoner fidling at the prossecutor's pocket, and when I saw the prisoner do so, I suspected him. He then went out, leaving his hat on the seat, and came back and sat down in about five minutes.
JAMES BROWN. I was sent for to the Black Lion. I took the prisoner into custody, and on searching him, I found three eighteen-penny pieces, and a few halfpence. As I was going along, my man tread upon the heel of his shoe, which accidentally came off, and I found two three shilling pieces, one of which had a hole in it near the edge.

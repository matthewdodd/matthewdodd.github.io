. The prisoner came to live servant
 with me last Sunday. My watch was taken from my bed's head on Wednesday in the afternoon. He asked me leave to go to setch some of his things, as he pretended, but did not return. I went to the person I hired him from, and asked if he had seen any thing of him: he said he had seen him, and saw he had a watch in his pocket. I went to Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



             and got a warrant, but before I got home the prisoner was come back. I sent for a constable and charged him. He owned he had taken and pawned my watch by the New Church in the Strand. I went and found it there; and the duplicate was found in the prisoner's pocket.

            . I am servant to Mr. Brooks, a pawnbroker. The prisoner pledged this watch with me the 28th instant for a guinea. (Produced and deposed to by the Prosecutor.)

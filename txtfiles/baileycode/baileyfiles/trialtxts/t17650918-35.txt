            . The prisoner came to me when I was loading cotton at Galley-Key


, about a fortnight ago or better; he said he was full of liquor; he said he would help me; he went to sleep upon a bag, as I did not let him help me. I went to get me a pennyworth of beer, and found 
               
                  Henry 
                  Barrat 
               



             pulling the goat's hair out of his breeches: he is not here. Barrat took care of him, and I went to my work (the hair produced in court): this is the same; here is six or seven ounces of it; I found there was a bag had been opened by this man, or two others that were taken before him.

I was in liquor; these men ask'd me to help them to load the carts; I saw some hair on the ground; I trod upon it, and took it up, but do not know that I put it in my breeches.

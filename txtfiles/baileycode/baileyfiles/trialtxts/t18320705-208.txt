            . I am in the service of Mr. Charles Christian, a land-surveyor
, who lives in Lisson-grove


; I was in his office on the 18th of June, about half-past twelve o'clock, when these coats were taken from his passage - the door was open, and I saw the prisoner go out with them; I followed, and brought him back - I had never seen him before; he had got over the garden gate, which was locked.

Prisoner's Defence. A well dressed man asked me to earn 1s. - he went and got the coats, and put them on my arm; soon after this gentleman came and took me - as soon as I recovered myself I saw the man who gave them to me, running off.

                  Frederick 
                  Neyen 
               



            . On the 7th of this instant I was called into a house of ill fame at Saltpetre-bank



, there was Sukey Atherley: this was about three o'clock in the afternoon.
Q. Who called you in?
Neyen. It was 
               
                  Mary 
                  Hicks 
               



             called me in.
Q. Was you sober?
Neyen. I was as sober as I am now, I treated them, we went up stairs together afterwards.
Q. Did you know them before?

Neyen. Yes, I did, 
               
                  Mary 
                  Hicks 
               



             is the landlady of the house; when we had drank the drams she went down for a pint of beer, I had my money in my pocket then; after that Atherley went down; then I felt in my pocket, and my money was gone; the moment Hicks came up Atherley flew down.
Q. Where had you put your money?
Neyen. It was in my waistcoat pocket, and my coat was unbuttoned.
Q. Did you feel your money go out of your pocket?
Neyen. She was pretty free in playing with me, and I felt something rustle towards my pocket; there was no body in the room but she, she took my money.
Q. Did you perceive her hand in your pocket?
Neyen. I felt something, she flew down, and I felt immediately and found my money was gone; I am certain sure she took it; 
               
                  Fanny 
                  Atherley 
               



             was not up stairs at that time.
Q. What money did you lose?
Neyen. There was fifty guineas, a moidore, a 36 s. piece, thirty-one half guineas, and 8 s. 6 d. in silver; when I got down stairs the Atherleys were gone, only Mary Hicks was in the house.
Q. What do you accuse Rimington of?
Neyen. She might be in the house, I cannot say any thing to that; I had been there before, but never lost any thing there before; I went directly and got a constable, and took up Mary Hicks; that was on the Saturday, and the other two prisoners were taken up on the Sunday.


                  Susanna 
                  Atherley 
               



            . I do not chuse to say any thing, unless the false witnesses are turned out of court.
The witnesses are sent out of court to be examined apart.


                  Mary 
                  Hicks 
               



            . I keep the house where these young woman lived; I went out for a dram, and in the mean time this money was lost.
Q. Do you know any thing of 
               
                  Frances 
                  Atherley 
               



             or Rimington being concerned with it?
M. Hicks. They were not in his company, there was only Susanna Atherley in his company.
Q. Was he sober?
M. Hicks. He was between one and the other.
Q. Did he use to come often to your house?
M. Hicks. He did.
Q. Had he been long acquainted with 
               
                  Susanna 
                  Atherley 
               



            ?
M. Hicks. He never saw her but once before.
Q. How long had she been at your house?
M. Hicks. About a week; I was taken into custody immediately.

            . I had a warrant to apprehend the prisoners; these new stays, clothes, handkerchiefs, and hats (producing them) were found upon the three prisoners; they were taken before the Justice at the Rotation-office; Rimington was asked how she came by these new clothes; she said she bought them in Monmouth-street with the money she got of the prosecutor.


                  John 
                  Ross 
               



            . I am deputy-keeper to the Poultry Compter; last Sunday se'nnight 
               
                  Frances 
                  Atherley 
               



             came to the Compter very much in liquor; when I came home, about half an hour past one, I was told she had been observed to put money in her stocking; she came by herself to see her sister; I went to her, and desired her to pull her stocking off; she pulled her left leg stocking off; when I insisted upon her pulling off the other, she hesitated very much about it; I still insisted upon it; she took it off, there were nineteen guineas and a half in the foot of it; another person that stood by took a guinea and a half out of her hand, and gave it me; there was a very remarkable half guinea among them.
Neyen. One of my half guineas had a little bit broke out of it; I could swear to that at first fight (produced and deposed to.)

                  Egan 
               



            . I heard the prosecutor had been robbed in the Back-lane; I went there, and searched, but could not find the prisoners; about ten o'clock a man came and told me they were at a public-house; I found 
               
                  Susanna 
                  Atherley 
               



             and Rimington at the Dolphin in Darkhouse-lane.


                  Susanna 
                  Atherley 
               



            's defence.
Two or three watchmen came round me, and gave me black eyes; they took two guineas out of my pocket, and used me very ill, and dragged me about all the same as if I was a dog; in the morning they took my handkerchief from my neck, after that they took my cloak, cap, and ribbons
Egan. We never used her ill at all.
Susanna 


               guilty of stealing, but not privately from his person

JAMES STRACHAN. I am a cabinet-maker
, and live in Gerrard-street, Soho. I employed the prisoner, on the 1st of August, to take a pair of drawers to Mr. Jackson, in Bedford-street, and he never took them: I never saw him again till I caught him about a fortnight afterwards asleep on the flap of a wine cellar in Hart-street, Covent-garden; he said he had put them down at a public-house door, and went to have a pint of beer, and when he came out they were gone - Mr. Jackson is not here, nor any one from him, but I know they were not delivered, because they sent for them.

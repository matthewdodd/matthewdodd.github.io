            . I live in Cleaveland-street, St. Pancras


. Matthews had a child's carriage for sale - it stood at my door. On the 10th of March, at eleven o'clock, as I came down stairs, I heard a cry of Stop thief! I ran out, and turned up Howland-street, where I saw the prisoner with part of the carriage in his hand; he was stopped at that time, and was speaking to a boy - I went up, and told him to take it back; he would not: I took it from him, and brought it back to my house - he was secured; it was the carriage without the body.

            . The carriage and wheels belong to me - they were within an iron railing, against the wall of the house, and tied by a string.
Prisoner's Defence. I was going after work - the manswore it was found on me, but it was a long way behind me; I was not stopped, but stopped myself.

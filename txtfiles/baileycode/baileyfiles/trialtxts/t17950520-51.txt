             sworn.
Q. I keep house in Mark-lane


. The articles mentioned in the indictment were missing the 15th of April, Wednesday, from the side board; and there is evidence in court that will tell you where they were.
Q. Was the prisoner a servant
 in the house? - He was. He came to me with a written character. I thought he was dull and heavy, not sufficiently alert, and I told him so; and I made some inquiry into his situation, which satisfied me about his character.
Q. This man from his situation in your house, had the opportunity of taking these things separately, if he had been so inclined? - I believe he did take them so, while they were in his charge.
- TRINDER sworn.
I am a pawbroker; I produce fourteen spoons, on which two guineas were lent, the fourteenth of April, Tuesday; on the 15th of April, Wednesday, I lent him three guineas on five table spoons, and three desert spoons, which he pledged in the name of 
               
                  John
                   Jackson
               



            .
Q. Were they all pledged in the same name? - Yes. On April the 16th, in the morning, about half after eight o'clock, he brought two more desert spoons, which he offered to pledged; by his appearance at that time of the morning, I thought every thing was not right; I interrogated him particularly; he told me that he lived at No. 12, Green-street, Liecester-square; I asked him if he should have any objection to my going to the house to know if he lived there, as he was an entire stranger to me?
Q. Where is your shop? - St. Martin's-lane, No. 32. He said, no, none in the least; I might go and make inquiries, and find that he did live there; he was a lodger in the house. I went and made inquiry, but there was no such person lived there, nor they did not know one of the name.
Q.He did not go with you? - No, he did not; he was kept in the house.
Q. What you left him in custody? - Yes. I came back and told him I had been where he told me to go, and that they told me there was no such person lived there; he said, you have been wrong, I will go with you and point out the house to you; and going up Clement's-row he walked slowly, which made me believe that he would run away, and in Remmings-row he said, to tell you the truth, I do not live there, but in Duke-street, Westminster; I asked him if he really did live there? - he said, yes; says I, then I will go with you. At the bottom of Castle-street, I then asked him again, if he really did live there? - he said, yes; and going down the passage that leads to Mr. Paine's, the bookseller, I again asked him; and he trembled very much, and attempted to run away. Iimmediately secured him, and by the assistance of some that were coming by, had him conveyed to the watch-house. In about an hour afterwards this here bill(produces a bill) was brought into my shop, which led to a discovery to whom they belonged.
Mr. Knowlys. There were three several pawnings of these? - No, he came three times, but two pawnings.

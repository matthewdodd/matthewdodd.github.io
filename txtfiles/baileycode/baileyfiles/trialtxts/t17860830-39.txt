I took the prisoner with the things in his apron. (Deposed to.) The officer asked him what he had in his apron, he said, a shirt and a pair of stockings, but when the things were discovered, he said, he found them.
Court to Prosecutrix. Was the door locked? - Yes; the window looks into Wapping church-yard; it is about eight or ten feet from the ground, but there was a rain spoo just by the door, and there are holdfasts in the wall, just like a step ladder that any person might very easily climb to that window; I cannot say whether the window was open.
Prisoner. I picked up this counterpane in a leather apron; I told the gentleman I was going to my mother for a shirt and a pair of stockings.

            . I live in St. Giles's. I have two houses at St. Pancrass


; my servant, 
               
                  Sarah
                   Symmonds
               



            , told me that one of my houses had been broke open the night before, and the things lost that are mentioned in the indictment. The next day, Thursday the 10th, I was sent for by Mr. Welch, and saw my things at his office. (repeating them.)

                   Symmonds
               



            . I am servant to Mrs. Jedear. I kept the house that she resided in. I found the parlour window of the other house open; Mrs. Jordan, Mrs. Jedear's mother, lies in that room sometimes.

            . On the Monday, preceding the Wednesday, I saw the things, mentioned in the indictment, in the parlour; on the Thursday following I saw them at justice Welch's; this glass is my property.

            . I am a constable. On the 9th of October, between twelve and one in the morning, two of our parroles brought the two prisoners to the watch house, together with the things mentioned in the indictment; Mitchel said they were his property; that he was removing them from his apartments, in St. John's Palace, Tottenham Court road, because there was a writ against him. Carter said he was his brother, and was assisting him, and said that he was going upon duty, and desired me to let him go, which I did; the justice believed what Mitchel said, and ordered me to keep the goods till the landlord was satisfied and so Mitchel was discharged. He came again the same day with a man that took upon, him the character of his landlord. I observed that the man appeared a good deal confused. I sent him and Mitchel, with the beadle, to the watch house, to look at the goods; I saw no more of that man, but Mitchel came back by himself. I went with him to go to his apartments, in St. John's palace; when we come to the fields he refused to go on; he desired me to wait for him, and he promised me he would return again, which he did. I took him to Mr. Welch's; I told him that I must detain him, for I had heard that he had broke open a house; then he said that his brother broke open the house, and that he assisted him. He went with me to take 
               
                  Carter
               


             the next morning, at his lodgings, in Westminster. As we came through St. James's I heard Carter say to Mitchel, if we / could get the things and hurt them over the garden wall again, it would be all very right.

                   Day
               



            . I am a patrole. I met the two prisoners, between twelve and one o'clock, in Ormond street, Queen square; Carter had the box and looking glass, Mitchel had the bed and the rest of the goods; we secured them; they offered me some beer to let them go; I refused it, and took them to the watch house.
- Murray. another of the patroles confirmed this evidence.

" Martha inurst deposed, that she went to the house of the prosecutrix on the 9th of October, and found the window open, and the room stript."

            , a carpenter, deposed that he fixed on the bolt of the window again, which appeared to have been forced off with violence."
"Mitchel, in his defence, said that he found the bundle, in Islington road, with the box and glass tied upon it, that he took them home; that afterwards expecting his goods to be seized, he was removing them when he was stopt by the patrole."
"Carter said in his defence, that his brother asked him to carry some of his goods for him, to prevent their being seized; that he agreed to assist him, but did not know how he came by the goods.
"Carter called 
               
                  John
                   Turner

            . The prisoner passed by me at ten o'clock at night; I missed my handkerchief, and followed him; I told him if he did not give it me I would take it out of his pocket; then he pulled it out; I took him to the watch-house.

I was walking along; I found something before me; I stooped and picked it up; I did not know what it was, and the gentleman laid hold of me; I am as innocent as the child unborn.

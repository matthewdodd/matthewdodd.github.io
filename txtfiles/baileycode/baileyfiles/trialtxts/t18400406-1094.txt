WILLIAM HENRY MILLS
. I am a pawnbroker, and live in the Edgeware-road. About eight o'clock in the evening, on the 14th of March, I observed the prisoner about my door—shortly after the policeman came and asked me something—I went to the door, and missed a pair of trowsers—he ran—I followed and overtook the prisoner about fifty yards off—he picked up one pair of trowsers near her, and the other were in a basket—these are mine—(examining them.)





GEORGE BISHOP
 (police-constable D 30.) I was going up the road, and saw the prisoner pulling the things about—I went past, turned, and she was gone off in a hurried manner—I went and asked if the prosecutor had lost any thing—he said, "Yes"—I pursued, overtook her, and put my hand on her shoulder—she turned, and said, "It is all right, they were given me"—she threw one pair away, and they fell into a basket of turnip tops—the other she dropped under her cloak—she then said she was in distress, and had taken them.

Prisoner. I never said they were given me.




GUILTY.* Aged 32.—


Transported for Seven Years.

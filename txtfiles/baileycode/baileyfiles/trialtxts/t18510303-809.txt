, stealing 1 handkerchief, value 1s.; the goods of a man unknown, from his person: having been before convicted.






BENJAMIN HOMER
 (policeman, M 169.) Last Sunday morning. between eleven and twelve o'clock, I was on duty in Blackfriars-road—I saw the prisoner with another, in Webber-street—I saw the prisoner take

this handkerchief from a gentleman's pocket—I stopped the prisoner, and took him to the gentleman, and showed the handkerchief to him—he said his time was more precious to him than his handkerchief, and he did not give his name—the prisoner said as the gentleman would not appear he might as well let him go—I took him to the station.





JOHN UNDERWOOD
 (policeman, L 66.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, at this Court—(read—Convicted Aug., 1845, and confined three months)—the prisoner is the person—he has been a regular associate of thieves, and been several times summarily convicted.

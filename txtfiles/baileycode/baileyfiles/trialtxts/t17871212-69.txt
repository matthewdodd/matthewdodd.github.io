            , Esq; in Queen-street, Westminster


; I went out of town the 22d of June; I left every thing safe to my knowledge; we returned to town the beginning of December, the things were in a very confused way; several things were lost out of the drawers and other places; the drawers had been opened, but how I cannot tell; some of the locks were not fast; my master's bureau seemed to be broke open; there was not much force used; I fancy, probably by keys; there were a great many things lost out of the house.
MARY FULFORD sworn.
I am servant to Mr. Wilcocks; I left the house in June; I returned with the rest of the servants; many things were lost out of the house; some of the drawers appeared to be forced.
HESTER SEYMOUR sworn.
I had the key of Mr. Wilcock's house; I went backwards and forwards; I never observed the door broke open; when I looked to see if the inside of the house was safe, I found the door opened hard; I went down stairs to see if every thing was safe, and found every thing safe; it was near about the time the robbery was done, as the Justice said, that was more than a week before the family came to town.
CHARLES JEALOUS sworn.
On the first of December, between eight and nine in the evening, I received an information, that a house had been robbed in Westminster; we were desired to go to the house of one Mrs. Burkitt, in Duck-lane; I went up stairs into the room where Higgins lodged; he was then in the room up one pair of stairs backwards; I broke open a box in the room; and in that box, I found a brace of pistols, and the coat was in that box, which the prisoner Higgins has on, and upon the bed in Higgins's room, I found two knives; I asked Higgins whose the two knives were? he said they were his own property; I searched Higgins, and in his box I found a bit of candle; I then came down stairs, and left another officer with him; I went into the back room, the apartment of Mrs. Burkitt; I searched there; and in a cupboard in the said back room, I found this black bag, with the things that are now in it; they were secured, and I set off with the rest of the officers; I left somebody in possession there; I went to the house of 
               
                  Grace
                   Maddox
               



            , in Duck-lane, where Grose and Maddox were sitting by the fire; Higgins and Burkitt were taken into custody; upon the bed in the same room, I found two table cloths; I asked whose property they were? and 
               
                  Grace
                   Maddox
               



             said herself they were her property; and Grose made no reply; I then searched the room, and in one of the drawers I found a small pick-lock key; (produced) upon a chimney piece, in the same room, behind a basket, I found a large street door pick-lock key, which since I have tried before the woman, and it opened the street door of Mr. Wilcocks; in the room I found an old chissel; upon the information of Mrs. Burkitt, Fleming was taken.
Did Mrs. Burkitt claim any property in the things? - She was asked, and she said they did not belong to her.
What did she say? - She said they were not her property.
Mr. Garrow, prisoner's counsel. Fleming then made no sort of information atBow-street, till he himself was in custody? - No.
He was informed at Bow-street, that unless he made a full disclosure of every thing in which he was concerned, he was in considerable danger? - Yes.
Was you present at the examination of Fleming? - I cannot say particularly.
Fleming, it seems now, has been a notorious and common receiver of stolen goods? - Why sir, I am sorry the man is in custody now; he has lived in good credit, and has come forward with me to give evidence.
How long have you known Mrs. Burkitt? - Ten or twelve years; she never was in custody, to my knowledge.
You know Mr. Sanders very well? - I cannot be off knowing him in my line of life.
He is a Walking Fence? - I cannot tell whether he is a walking or a riding one.
Have you, except in this business, ever known any thing against the boy Higgins? - I never had him in custody before; - I do not know that I ever saw him before; I know his father very well; he is a very honest man; the boy knows me; - I never saw Holden before to my knowledge.


                  ELIZABETH
                   BURKITT
               



             sworn.
I live in Duck-lane, Westminster, Higgins and Holden lodged in my house; I know the other two prisoners by living in Duck-lane; there was a bundle brought into my apartments; I did not see it brought in, nor I saw nothing brought in; I saw all the four prisoners in my house, and they went up stairs with Mr. Fleming; it was the same night that Mr. Jealous came about an hour after and found it; Fleming came in with them, they went up stairs together, into Higgins's room, and in about a quarter of an hour after, Fleming brought down this bag, and put it where Mr. Jealous found it, in a cupboard in the back-room.
Who brought down the bag? - Fleming.
Did the prisoners all come in together with Fleming? - Yes, I saw them come in, but I did not see them bring any thing in at that time.
Mr. Garrow. Mrs. Burkitt, did you know much of Fleming before that time? - I knew him when he was apprentice at Mr. Wright's.
Have you had much dealings with him lately? - Not much; I never dealt with him to buy any thing of him; he left these things in my possession till he called for them; he has left things about four times.
How long before? - It might be about a month.
How long have you lived in Duck-lane? - About a quarter of a year.
Where did you live before that? - In Fleet-lane; I kept a chandler's shop and sold greens.
Where does your husband live? - I have never a one; I buried him in Fleet-lane.
How long have you been called by the name of Burkitt? - Very nigh two years.
Your name was Lymes before? - Yes.
Was that your maiden name? - No.
So poor Mr. Burkitt is dead? - Yes; he was a boat builder, but he was in the Fleet for debt; he was one of the turnkeys of the Fleet prison.
You know you was examined at Bow-street? - Yes.
Have you told us all that passed at Bow-street; on your examination, did not you there say, that Higgins had not been out of your house that day, nor the day before, nor the day before that? - No, I did not say that; I said I believed he had not been out that day, but they all came into my room together.
Did not you say at Bow-street that you believed Higgins had not been out of your house that day? - I said I believed not.
Did not you say, you believed he had not been out the day before? - No, I did not, to the best of my knowledge.
Tell me whether you will venture to swear that you did not say to the magistrate at Bow-street, that Higgins was not out of your house either that day, or the day before, or the day after? - I did not sayso; I said I believed he had not been out on the Saturday.
Did you say the Saturday or the Friday? - I will not venture to swear that I did not say so.
Do not you believe that the young man was not out of your house on the Friday night; that is a dangerous question to such a witness as you? - To the best of my knowledge, I cannot say; but on Saturday I know he was not.
What time was you at home on the evening of Friday? - About six or seven.
Did you go out after seven? - No, I did not.
Upon your oath, was Higgins out after seven that night? - No, not on Friday night; but in the day time I cannot say; but after night, I am sure he was not out.
I take it for granted that you came today from Duck lane? - No.
Where did you come from to-day? - Why, from prison I came to-day.
You have been in a little trouble, as they call it about this business? - Yes, I have.
Therefore you are swearing to get yourself out of trouble? - I would not swear any thing wrong; if you was a widow with two children, you would be glad to do any thing in the world to maintain them.
Is it a furnished lodging? - Yes.


                  CHARLOTTE
                   COWPER
               



             sworn.
I am servant to Mrs. Burkitt; I remember Jealous came on the Saturday night; there was Holden, 
               
                  Grace
                   Maddox

                   Grose
               



             came in together to our house; Fleming came in afterwards; they went up stairs into Higgins's room; but I cannot tell what passed, and Fleming brought down stairs a black bag; I cannot tell what was in it; he desired it might be put away into the closet where Mr. Jealous found it.
Mr. Garrow. How long have you lived with Mrs. Burkitt? - About six or seven years.
You lived with her then, when she lived in Fleet-lane? - Yes.
You came from prison too? - Yes.
You knew her when her husband was alive, poor man? - Yes, I lived with her, and have been with her ever since.
You knew Fleming very well? - Yes.

How long has she lived in Duck-lane? - Abot three months.
You know she lived there by Fleming's desire? - Not that I know of.

But you saw him as soon as you got in? - He called in as he went by.
Was that the first day after you went to Duck-lane, or the next day? - I cannot say.
After that, how often did Fleming use to call? - He used to call as he went by.
He was a very intimate acquaintance of Mrs. Burkitt's; was not he? - Not as I know; he went about his business; he used to call in.
Did he use to leave things at your house? - I believe he did; really I cannot say.
Will you swear he did not leave things at your mistress's, till he called for them? - He has left things several times, till he fetched them away.
How soon after you went to live at Westminster, did he come with the first bundle of things? - I cannot tell.
Were the things always put into that cupboard? he put them in himself.
What part of the house was that cupboard in? - The back room; there was no lock upon it.
Court. You say that Higgins, and all the rest of the prisoners came in together on the Saturday evening? - Yes.
How long had Higgins been out? - He had not been out at all.
Grace Maddox, Holden and Grose, all came in, and went up stairs with Higgins? - I cannot tell you whether Higginswas out or not; they all four went up stairs.
Then it was not true that the four prisoners came in together; you have sworn both ways; which is the truth? - I cannot tell; Higgins came in with Grose and Holden, and Grace Maddox.
Do you mean that he came into the house or into the room; did the four prisoners all come into the house together? - Yes.
Are you sure of that? - Yes, I am sure of it.
Do I understand you right, that you are now, upon recollection, sure that Higgins; Holden, Grose and Maddox, all the four prisoners came into the house together? - Yes.
Then how long had Higgins been out? - That I cannot say, I was at home all the evening.

Did you see the prisoners come into the house, or did you? - Yes, I did see them come in.
Who did you see come into the house? - I saw Holden, 
               
                  Grace
                   Maddox
               



            , 
               
                  Thomas
                   Grose
               



            , and Higgins.
Do you know how long he had been out? - I cannot tell.
Did you or not see Higgins come into the house with the other prisoners? - Yes, I believe I did.
Are you doubtful whether Higgins came with the rest or not; did you see the prisoners come into the house any of them? - I did.
Who did you see come in? - Holden and Grose, and 
               
                  Grace

What time did they come in? - I cannot tell the time.
How long before the things were found? - about an hour after.
Was it before or after seven? - I cannot say.

                  FRANCIS
                   FLEMING
               



             sworn.
Between eight and nine in the evening of the first of December, Holden came to my house, and asked if anybody had been there to ask for him; I told him no: then he desired I would come down to Mrs. Burkitt's immediately. Being a single man, I locked my shop door, and went immediately; when I came to Mrs. Burkitt's, there was 
               
                  Joseph
                   Holden
               



            , 
               
                  William
                   Higgins
               



            , 
               
                  Thomas
                   Grose
               



             and 
               
                  Grace
                   Maddox
               



             in the room, there were other persons in the room; I went up stairs, Holden followed me; and there were Mrs. Burkitt and Charlotte: Higgins desired I would go up stairs; I went up with him and the other three prisoners; then, I believe it was Holden, but I will not say which, positively, told me there were some sheets and tablecloths to sell, I cannot tell which; I told Sir Sampson Wright so; but one of them said so in the presence of all, and asked me if I would buy them? I told him yes; they were in a black bag then; I do not know rightly which it was that gave me the bag to look at them, I looked at them, and I think I paid for seven sheets, eight table-cloths, four napkins and a white cotton counterpane; there were more in the bag than that, but the others I considered of no value, and I gave them to the prisoner Maddox; then after I had looked at them, I think it was Grose, but I am not sure, asked me five guineas for them, which I refused to give; I told him I could not afford to give more than three guineas for them, which if they would not take, it would not suit me; I then went down stairs to Mrs. Burkitt's, and while I was sitting in Mrs. Burkitt's front room, Higgins called to me; when I went back again, they agreed to take the threeguineas; I folded up the things separate, and put them on the table; after I had done that, I put them in the black Nags and paid three guineas for them; I carried them down stairs into Mrs. Burkitt's back room on the ground floor, and I put them there into a closet, and desired her to take care of them till I came for them; she told me she would; I paid the three guineas into the hands of Grose.
What became of the money? - I believe it was divided among them; Higgins said, we must give her something; I saw no other woman in the room besides 
               
                  Grace
                   Maddox
               



            ; Holden says, suppose we equally divide it; Higgins replied, I do not care how it is; then Holden said, there is a guinea and a half for you two, and a guinea and a half for us two.
Had you any further conversation with them about these things at any time? - No; not a syllable more than what I have told you.
You did not hear from them at all where they got those things? - No.
Court. You have used the house of Mrs. Burkitt from the time she came into Duck-lane, to leave things at occasionally? - I did.
You have told us; on a former occasion, that you have carried on this trade of receiving stolen goods for six months before you was discovered? - That was the only time I was in business for myself.
Mr. Garrow. And that was the only trade you carried on? - No Sir, it was not; I had not any promise of making a full discovery; I was not charged with any thing; when I came before Sir Sampson he asked me if I knew Higgins? I told him yes, and Grose; Townsend came to me, and said Sir Sampson wanted me.
That is the usual way? - I might have gone away if I had chose it, but it would not do for me to leave my country on such a thing as this.
Mr. Garrow. You added last, that you found it necessary to fix somebody with every article that was found in your possession? - That I found it necessary; yes, I certainly did.
That unless you could get rid of every article of stolen goods found in your possession, traced or to you, you would be in danger? - If I was the most the most vile person in the world, what punishment should I deserve to fix on an innocent person.
A punishment that the laws of this counttry do not impose on you; how long have you been connected with Saunders; - I have known him several years; I have sold him several articles.
Did you use to sell your plate to him to go to Holland? - No, certainly not.
Who is the person who took your plate to Holland, Davis? - I never sold any thing to Davis in my life.
How many times may you have sold articles to Saunders? - I cannot tell how many times.
Did Saunders know you was a common receiver of stolen goods? - He might know.
Did not he know it? - Well, he did know.
He knew it from you? - There is not the least doubt of it; I look upon it I know the value of these things as well as any man in England. I look upon the utmost value of them to be four guineas, or four guineas and a half.
Court. Giving the full value makes no difference.
Did you tell Saunders that those articles you sold to him were stolen? - From our connection he could not doubt of it; I did not tell, my Lord, last-night, that I sold plate to go to Holland.


                  EMANUEL
                   SAUNDERS
               



             sworn.
What are you? - A dealer and Chman; I know the three men but not the woman; on the 28th or 29th of November, as near as I can recollect, some things were brought to me; they brought me an enamelled ink stand, a pair of scissars, with silver bows and a silver sheath, and many other things, that was the three men prisoners; I sold the plate to a man that went abroad; I have no part of the property but the ink stand and the scissars; the ink stand I intended to keep for myself, and the scissarsI gave to my wife; but, by the orders of Sir Sampson, I now produce them.
What did the three prisoners say? - They told me they came out of an uninhabited house in Westminster, but they did not tell me where; they said they got in by way of a false key.
(The scissars and ink stand produced.)
What did you pay for the things? - I cannot rightly tell; they asked me twelve guineas, and I gave them six.
Mr. Garrow. How came they to tell you these things came from an uninhabited house? - I do not know.
Did not that surprise you? - No.
Where do you come from now? - I have not been in prison.
You have been here very often before? - I never was in this court before in my life, nor before any Justice; I never was examined before; there might have been another man of the name of Saunders, but it was not me.
How long have you been acquainted with Fleming? - About six months.
You and he have dealt together in stolen goods for six months? - I know nothing at all about it; I have been acquainted with him, and have had dealings with him.
In stolen goods? - Stolen goods! we never ask that question; Fleming never told me the things he brought to me were stolen, nor told me the places they were stolen from; he never told me any thing.
How came you to send the things abroad? - When I have a parcel of things, I always send them to people that send them abroad; I never was in any court, nor before any Justice; I am not in custody; I went voluntarily before the Justice, I came up on account of Fleming; I knew nothing of this affair at that time; Sir Sampson knew nothing at all about it.
Do you know the prisoner 
               
                  Grace
                   Maddox
               



            ? - I knew her, but I never had any dealings with her.
Do they live together? - I cannot rightly tell.
Court to Jealous. Do you understand so? - Grose is a married man, but I understand for some time he has cohabited with 
               
                  Grace
                   Maddox
               



            ; and Grace Maddox, at that time, said the table-cloth was her property.
(The napkins deposed to by

                   Brewer
               



            .)
And the table-cloths are the property of Mr. Wilcocks; these sheets are my master's; I know these scissars to be mine; and likewise that ink stand.
PRISONER MADDOX's DEFENCE.
I was going to market on Saturday night; I called at Fleming's house, and I said, I must buy me a new pair of shoes; and he asked me to take that bundle to Mrs. Burkitt's; I took it down and he followed me; he told me to take them up one pair of stairs backwards; he opened them before me; he gave me two old table-cloths to make a a pin-afore; then Grose came from his work; he came into the lower room; he never was up stairs near the rest of them; I went from Mrs. Burkitt's to my own house, and had supper; and Jealous came in about twelve o'clock; we were at supper, and the table-cloths lay on the bed.
PRISONER HIGGINS's DEFENCE.
I was sitting the whole day, and at night with Mrs. Burkitt at her fire side; I had drank Tea with her that evening; and on the Saturday night likewise.
PRISONER GROSE's DEFENCE.
I know nothing of the man.
(The prisoner Grose called eight witnesses who all gave him a good character.)
PRISONER HOLDEN's DEFENCE.
Being in such a predicament, I was ashamed to ask any friends; I never was before a Justice before.
Graace Maddox. I thought my trial would not come on till the afternoon, so I did not send for any body.

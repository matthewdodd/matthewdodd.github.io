            . I missed my handkerchief; I saw the prisoner standing against the wall; I laid hold of him, and said, you rascal, you have got my handkerchief; I searched him, and found it upon him; I delivered him to the constable. (The handkerchief produced and deposed to by the prosecutor).
The prisoner said nothing in his defence, but that he was between nine and ten years old.

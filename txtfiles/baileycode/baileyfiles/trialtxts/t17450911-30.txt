                  Smith 
               



            . I live at the hat and feather in Long Lane


, on the 9th of this month, about three quarters of an hour after four in the morning, I found my shop had been broke open; the iron bar of the window was broke.
Q. Can you say what day you saw it safe over night?
Smith. I cannot say that: I lost twenty one hats out of my shop; I missed them about a quarter of an hour after I got up. I went to some pawnbrokers to desire them to stop them if any were brought to them, and in about half an hour's time a messenger came from Mr. Edwards a pawnbroker, to let me know he had stopped a hat, and desired to know if it was mine. I went to Mr. Edwards's, and there was the Prisoner James; I said to him, young man, did you bring this hat to the pawnbroker's? he said, yes; I asked him, how he came by it? he said, he made a purchase of it; I asked him, where? he said, in Smithfield; I asked him, who he bought it of? he said, of a drover; that he held it upon a stick, and asked, who would buy a hat? and he bought it; I asked him if he wanted a hat this morning? he said, yes; then said I, how came you to pawn it? I told him, I did not like that way of proceeding, and that I would charge him, if he did not give a better account how he came by it. I went with him into Mr. Edwards's room, and he said, he would tell me the truth; he said he went to sleep in a hay loft, and a man came and pulled him by the arm, and desired he would pawn it for two shillings.


                  John 
                  Edwards 
               



            . Last Monday morning James and Edwards two of the Prisoners at the bar, came and offered this hat to pawn for two shillings; I had heard that Mr. Smith had been robbed of some hats, so I sent the hat to him, and he owned it.
Q. Did James own the hat, or did Edwards own the hat?
Edwards. James said the hat was his, they both had it in their hands, but I cannot say that Edwards claimed any right to it at all.


                  John 
                  Lester 
               



            . 
               
                  Edward 
                  Edwards 
               



             said that this 
               
                  Joseph 
                  James 
               



            , and he, and 
               
                  Nathaniel 
                  Peartree 
               



            , were in a hay-loft together, consulting what they should do for victuals; and he said, that he and Peartree and James went out together, and that they broke my father-in-law's shop open, and took twenty one hats out; and that they carried the hats to that 
               
                  Joseph 
                  James 
               



            , and that he put a ladder out at the hay loft window, for them to come in to him, and they hid them till it was time for them to carry them to pawn; then a Constable was charged with them, till they went in search of Peartree .


                  William 
                  Rugley 
               



            . I was sent for on Monday morning about eight o' clock to Mr. Edwards's, to take charge of James and Edwards; and it was said, if I would go to one Jones's in Long Lane I might find some. I found ten in Three Fox Court, and I found the others in a hay-loft, and Peartree was found in Smithfield.
They were all acquitted of the burglary; Peartree was 

               acquitted of the felony
            , and James and Edwards were found 


               guilty of the felony, each 39 s
            .

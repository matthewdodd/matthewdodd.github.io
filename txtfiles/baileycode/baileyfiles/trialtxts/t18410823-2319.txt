JOSEPH RICHARDSON
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
27th of August, 2 shirts, value 4s.; 1 jacket, value 1l.; 1 waistcoat, value 3s.; the goods of 



Robert Jones; 2 shirts, value 4s.; 1 hammock, value 5s.; and 2 clews, value 1s.; the goods of 



Henry Budd, in a vessel on the navigable river Thames.






ROBERT JONES
. I am a seaman, on board the schooner Fame, which is lying in the Thames. The prisoner was a seaman on board—he left it about three o'clock yesterday morning, without notice—we then all searched our chests—I missed a jacket, waistcoat, and two shirts.





HENRY BUDD
. I was on board the vessel—I missed a hammock, trowsers, and two clews, which had been at the head of my bed—the prisoner had left the things that he has on now on board, and he came for them yesterday evening—I had not missed my things at that time.





JAMBS FOGG
. I am a Thames Police-inspector. Jones brought the prisoner to our office, and charged him with having stolen his jacket, waist-coat, and two shirts—the prisoner said he had not taken them, and had not seen them, nor knew nothing about them—one of our men said to him, "I saw you before the Lord Mayor yesterday morning, with these things on"—I said, "Then lock him up"—he said, "The jacket is all safe"—I said, "Where is the waistcoat?" and he gave me the duplicate of it from inside his stocking.

Prisoner's Defence. I was going along the highway, and fell in with two shipmates. I did not feel myself satisfied with the schooner I was in, and they told me of a vessel going to Shields—I took the jacket and waistcoat in the room of my own.




GUILTY
.* Aged 26.—


Transported for Ten Years.

ADJOURNED TO MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 20TH, 1841.

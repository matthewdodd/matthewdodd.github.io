            . I live in Cranbourn-street


. On the 23d of March, about a quarter to twelve o'clock, at night I went home - I have the charge of some billiard rooms
. A gentleman went out, and I told the man to fasten the door. I went into the kitchen, and heard the door open, went up stairs, and found the prisoner sitting at the bottom of the stairs - I asked what he did there; he made no answer. I found this property under him; he had taken them off my bed in the attic.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

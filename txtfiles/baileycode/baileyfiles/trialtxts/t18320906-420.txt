            . I was passing Mr. Shearman's shop, in Chiswell-street


, on the 11th of August, about twelve o'clock, and saw the two prisoners looking at some prints at his door - I watched them, and saw Carbey put her hand under the print, and Hanagan walked round the shop- they then walked up to the print again; Carbey held up her apron, and Hanagan pulled this print down into her apron; Carbey walked off quick with it, and came towards me - the other prisoner was close behind her; I stopped Carbey, and when Hanagan came up I took her also - I took them to the shop.
WILLIAM SHEARMAN. I am a linen-draper
, in Chiswell-street. This is my print.
Hanagan's Defence. I was going past the shop, and the print fell down - she took it up to take it to the shop; this witness took her; I went to ask him what for, and he took me.

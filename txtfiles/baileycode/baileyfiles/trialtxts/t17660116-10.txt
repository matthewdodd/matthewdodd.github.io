            . The prisoner was my laundery-maid
, and had been about three weeks in my service. Another servant of mine came and told me the prisoner was missing, and she had lost her stays and other things. We looked to see what other things were gone, and missed the things mentioned in the indictment. We were forced to break the laundery-door open, she had taken the key with her. Then I went to Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



             and got hand-bills dispersed about, by which a discovery was made.

            . I am a pawnbroker, and live on Ludgate-hill: the prisoner pledged these two table cloths to me for 6 s. (produced in court and deposed to by the prosecutrix.)
There were other pawnbrokers with others of the things, but it was thought needless to call them.

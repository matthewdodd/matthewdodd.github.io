HENRY PENNY
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
7th of August, 1 till, value 3s.; 1 crown, 2 half-crowns, 1 shilling, 60 pence, 240 halfpence, and 140 farthings, the property of 



Eliza Jobson.






JOHN LUTMAN
. I am a sawyer. On the 7th of August, I was going to the prosecutor's beer-shop in Macclesfield-street, about three o'clock—when I was about three yards from the door, I saw the prisoner come out with a till—he spoke to some person and walked away—I gave an alarm, and then went after him, but he got away.





RICHARD PARVISOL
. I was going down Macclesfield-street, about seventy yards from the beer-shop, I met the prisoner running with the till, holding it out in his hand—there were some others behind him, calling "Stop thief"—they proceeded down City Garden-row.





WILLIAM GUDGEON
. Eliza Jobson is my daughter, I manage the beer-shop for her. On the 7th of August, Lutman came and asked me something, and I missed the till, which contained a five shilling-piece, two half-crowns, and the other money stated—it is lost altogether—I did not see the prisoner in the shop.





WILLIAM HORSNELL
 (police-constable G 172.) I apprehended the prisoner about six weeks after the robbery—I took him to the station-house—the witnesses came and said he was the man they saw come out with the till—when he first saw me he sat off running—I ran and caught him—he threw himself on the ground and said, "It was not I—it was not I"—I had said I wanted him for felony.

Prisoner. I did not run away—I said I would not go without he told me what it was for—I was in the country at the time of the robbery.




GUILTY.* Aged 19.—


Transported for Seven Years.

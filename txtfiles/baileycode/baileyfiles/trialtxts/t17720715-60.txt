; I lost eight bobbins of silk on the 19th of June. Acton and the prisoner Sheffield worked with me; Acton came up, and said a man came to call on Sheffield that he did not like, and begged I would take notice of him; they went out together. I then examined the silk and missed eight bobbins; Sheffield staid out all night; he came to work at six o'clock next morning. I got a warrant from Sir 
               
                  John
                   Fielding
               



            , and in consequence of some information of Sheffield, we found the silk at Manby's; seven of the bobbins were in a corner cupboard. Manby owned he bought the bobbins of the prisoner for 3 s. 6 d.

             confirmed the evidence.
Sheffield called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.
Manby said in his defence, that he bought the things of a loom broker.

ANN PILKINGTON
. I am eleven years of age, and am the daughter of Thomas Pilkington, of No. 28, Alfred-street, Stepney, a brewer. My mother sent me to Mr. Child's, at the Hay-field, for a pair of sheets to be washed—the bar-maid gave them to me—I had a cloak on to put them under—I know Hemmingway, in the Mile-end-road—I saw the prisoner there—she tapped me on the shoulder, and asked me what my name was—I said, Pilkington—she said she had known me ever since I was three years old, and when she was a little girl my mother bought her a great wax doll, and she would give it to me; she asked if I had a pinafore on—I said no—she said, "Come with me; I will give it you; my mother just now bought a clothes-basket, and I will put the sheets on the bottom, and the doll on the top of the sheets, and the cloak over them"—she took the sheets away from me, and the cloak off my back, and said she would run down to the woman's house, and I was to stay—she ran away, and I ran home and told my mother.





ANN PILKINOTON
, sen. I am the wife of Thomas Pilkington, and the mother of Ann Pilkington. I sent the child out about the middle of March—she came back, crying, without her cloak, and gave the account she has now. MARY ALLAN. I live with Thomas Child, at the Hayfield public-house, Mile-end. The little girl came to me in March—I gave her a pair of sheets—she came back afterwards with her mother without them—they belong to Mr. Child, and were sent to be washed.

Prisoner's Defence. I know nothing of that.

            . I am a coachman
, and live in Monmouth-street: I keep a stable in Brown's gardens


: we have a hole cut in the door for the pole of the coach to come through. I put my coach in the coach-house, and hung up my great coat. I went the next morning for my coat; a boy met me, and told me he had seen a boy come out of my stable with my coat. I took the prisoner the Tuesday following; he fell a crying: he told me, he went in at the hole, and took my coat, and sold it to an old clothes-man for 2 s. and offered me two guineas to make it up, which I would not do.

             on the outside of the hole draw the coat out and go away with it; he appeared in a great deal of confusion; he dragged it upon the ground after him.
Prisoner's Defence.
I never saw the coat; the prosecutor sent a woman he keeps company with, to offer to make it up for a guinea. I took the coat up at the door; another boy pulled it out; he would not carry it away, and so I took it.

JOHN MALYON
 was again indicted

 for stealing, on the 
10th of September, 4 handkerchiefs, value 4s.; 6 knives, value 3s.; 4 forks, value 2s.; 3 yards of printed calico, value 3s.; 1 shirt, value 1s., and 10 printed books, value 1l., the goods of 



William Morrice.






WILLIAM MORRICE
. The prisoner came into my service at the beginning of 1837. While he was in my service I lost several articles—I did not miss them, but I know this property (looking at it) to belong to me—these knives and forks are mine, and this piece of sofa cover—I never gave them to the prisoner—these books belong to a young lady named Wright, who had left them at my house.

Cross-examined. Q. Was the young lady living in your house at the time? A. No, she is one of my wards—she used to come to my house on a visit, but did not live with me—I do not know when the books were taken—she left in September, and left her things behind in ray care—when she returned it was discovered that her books were gone—her trunk was locked and sewn up—I know the knives and forks by using them so long, and by the maker's name—I selected them from others—I know the handkerchief—the marks have been taken out—there is no mark on the sofa-cover—I have no doubt it is my property.





HENRY GODDARD
. I found all the property produced at the prisoner's lodgings.





FRANCES ROBINA WRIGHT
. I was in the habit occasionally of visiting at Mr. Morrice's house. About September last I left some books in hit care—these are them.

Cross-examined. Q. How long have you had them? A. Since 1836, I think—my name was in some of them, but is not now—the first page has been taken out of this book—I do not see my name in the others—I thought it was there.




GUILTY

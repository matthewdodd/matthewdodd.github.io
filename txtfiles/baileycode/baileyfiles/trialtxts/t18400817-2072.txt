STEPHEN BRICKMAN
 I live in Goswell-mews, Goswell-road. On Saturday night, the 1st of August, between ten and eleven o'clock, I was near Mr. King's shop—I heard the prisoner say, "Strike me"—the other one said, "Go it, Dick"—the prisoner then went across the road to the next door to the prosecutor's, and lifted the carpet over the rails—he went across the road—I went and told Mr. King—I lost sight of them.

Cross-examined by
MR. PAYNE. Q. How old are you? A. Seventeen—I cannot read or write—I told the Justice about, "Go it, Dick," and "Strike me"—I work at Mr. Field's, a greengrocer, in Goswell-road—I had seen the other lad once before.





JEMIMA BRAMLEY
. I was in Charles-street that night, and saw the prisoner drop the carpet—I am sure it was him—I picked it up, and a gentleman told me to hold it till he came.

Cross-examined. Q. Do you know Brickman? A. No—I was going on an errand for my mother, and on coming out of Mason's-place, I saw the prisoner drop the carpet—he was half way down the street—I had never seen him before—I did not see him stopped—I watched him till he went down the City-road, where he was taken.





GEORGE KING
. I live in Goswell-street, and keep a carpet-warehouse.

Between ten and eleven o'clock that night, Brickman gave me information—I came out, and passed the prisoner, who was pointed out to me about twenty yards off—he was stopped—I brought him back, and gave him into custody—the carpet was brought back—it is mine.

Cross-examined. Q. Who brought it back? A. My young man—it was placed close to the door, inside, on my own premises—a person could take it without coming into the shop.

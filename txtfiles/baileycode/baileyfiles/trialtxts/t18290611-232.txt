             were indicted for 


               that they, on the 8th of June
, 49 handkerchiefs, value 5l., the goods of 
                     
                        William 
                        Venables
                     



                   and 
                     
                        Thomas

                  , feloniously did receive, of a certain evil-disposed person, which had been lately before stolen, they well knowing the same; against the Statute, &c.

            . I am brother to William and Thomas Venables, who are in partnership; Thomas Page, the prisoners' brother, was in their service - he pleaded guilty this morning to stealing these things. On the morning he was committed, I applied to Sir George Farrant for a warrant to search the prisoners' house, No. 2, Windsorplace, and in a hat-box, which 
               
                  John 
                  Page
               



             acknowledged to be his. I found twenty-six silk handkerchiefs, and seventeen in William Page's box; John said they had been given to him by Thomas, to keep and to sell - William was out at the time; when he came home we took him: he said he had bought them of his brother Thomas; he had given 1s. a piece for some, 1s. 6d. for others, and 2s. was the utmost price he had given; he said he had been in the silk business, and he considered he had given the utmost price - they have our marks on them.
Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. For ought you know, Thomas may have brought them there for them to sell? A.Certainly; I got all the handkerchiefs I could find.

            . I am an officer. I went to the prisoners' residence, and found John at home; I found the handkerchiefs in the boxes; some of them John said had been given to them to sell, and some they had bought: when William came home he said he gave 1s. 6d. or 2s. a piece for them - they live in Hoxton; Messrs. Venables' shop is in Oxford-street; William keeps a butcher's-shop, and I believe John is his servant.

            'S Defence. My brother brought the handkerchiefs to me, and said he bought them of Mr. Venables - that they were selling off a bankrupt's stock at one third of its value; he said he would bring a few more if I wished it: I said I had no objection, and he brought some more.

            . We were selling off cheap, but not at the price he speaks of.

. Last Friday evening, between nine and ten o'clock, I was in the back parlour, and heard a noise of money; I went into the shop, and saw the prisoner going out with the till in his hand - it had 5s. and some halfpence in it; I am quite sure he is the boy
.

            . I am a shoemaker. I heard the cry of Stop thief! I saw the prosecutrix picking up the till - she said the boy had run down the walk; I ran and caught the prisoner.

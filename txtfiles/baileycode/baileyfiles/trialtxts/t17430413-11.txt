            . The Prisoner and another Woman came into our House, and asked me to broil them some Steakes; and after they had eat them, she and the other Woman went into the Yard; the Sauce-pan stood in the Passage, and when they came in, I saw it was gone; I thought one of them had got the Sauce-pan; the Prisoner was got out at the Door, but I pull'd her in again and took it from her.
Prisoner. A Woman and I, and a Man, went into the Room, and asked for a Sauce-pan to boil a Scrag of Mutton; it is a House that my Husband uses.

            . You have no Husband.
Prisoner. I went in and had two or three Pints of Beer, and Mrs Woodward said, You shall not stay you drunken B - h, you never come here but you make a Noise; and the Woman said, We must stay till the Meat is ready: She would not let us have the Sauce-pan, so I laid the Meat on the Gridiron, and the Meat was eating when the Constable came in; she told the Beadle, at the Round-house, If I would pay her what I owed her, she would not prosecute me; I believe my Husband owed her a little Money, but I did not know he had left the House.

1470. 




HONORA HAYES
 was again indicted

 for stealing, on the 
4th of March, 1 gown, value 2s., and 1 pair of boots, value 3s; the goods of 



Mary Corbett.







MARY CORBKTT
. I am single, and live in St. John's-wood-grove. I did lodge in Kelso-place, Marylebone—the prisoner lodged there for two nights in the same room. On the Sunday morning I observed her getting up—when she was gone I missed my gown, boots and apron, with some halfpence, and a duplicate in it—I saw no more of her till I saw her at the station—she then had my boots on—I took them off—I am certain they are mine—there is a bit of tape by which I know them.





THOMAS MADIGAN
. I am a policeman. These boots were taken off the prisoner in my presence.





CHARLES BULL
. I produce a gown pawned for 1s., by a woman in the name of Ann Hayes, No. 13, Nightingale-street—I cannot swear to the prisoner.





MARY CORBETT

re-examined. This is my gown—I lost it at the same time as I lost the boots.

Prisoner's Defence. I know nothing about them.




GUILTY
. Aged 34.—


Transported for Seven Years.

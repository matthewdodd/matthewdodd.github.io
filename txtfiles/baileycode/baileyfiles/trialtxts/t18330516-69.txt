             (police-sergeant, G 3). On the 13th of April, about half-past eleven o'clock, I saw the prisoner at the Duke of York, in Gloucester-street - I had suspicion from seeing a suspicious character waiting outside - I went in and saw the prisoner sitting on this property; I asked him where he got it, he said it was not his - I took him, and found this purse and 2s. 4d. on him, and this piece of fur - I found the prosecutor on the Monday after.

            , a pawnbroker
. This property was in his shop; it was not sold - I had seen the prisoner in the shop, and a customer told me she thought he was up to no good; I had seen him in our shop a day or two before, playing with this squirrel's skin.
Prisoner's Defence. I had left my work and was going to my father's to sleep; I thought I should be too late; I went into this public-house, and the officer came in and found this property by my side - they offered to make it up for 35s.

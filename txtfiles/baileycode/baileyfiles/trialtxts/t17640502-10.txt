            . I received an anonymous letter, setting forth, that this Collins had behaved very ill, in concealing oil that I trusted him to light the lamps with; I went and searched his house, and found three gallons, a pint and a half of oil, in a large tin cannister. I took him before my Lord Mayor; there he owned he had taken oil at several times: we have had a general complaint, and I allowed him a shilling a week extraordinary, that he should take care to do the work well.
Q. Where did he say he had taken the oil from?
Sabe. He was served with oil every day at my cellar, and the oil must have been taken from my pots. My Lord asked him how he came by the oil; he said, he had saved a little at sundry times, out of the quantity that I allowed him to light the lamps. I had told him several times, if he had more oil than was wanted, to bring it to my house: he never brought any; only the empty pots next morning.

W. Hallowley. I am a millwright
, and live in Tottenham-court-road


. I went out on the morning of the 26th of March, and left my hammer and jack-plane with my other things. When I came home, between three and four, they were in the custody of Mr. Peak, who told me, they had been taken away. (Produced and deposed to)
W. Jones. We are both servants to Mr. Cooper. I can only say the adz is mine.


                  Tho.

            . I am servant to Mr. Cooper, a millwright. On the 26th of March, between eleven and twelve in the day, I went out of my master's shop. Coming in again, I met the prisoner at the bar coming out. I said, Do you want any body here? He answered, Yes; and named a name which I do not recollect.
Q. Did the prisoner work there?
Peak. No; he did not. He had this jack-plane in his hand. I said, My friend, did you bring that plane with you? He said, Yes. I took it and looked at it, and said, You have been robbing the shop. After that, I found the hammer and adz upon him; then I secured him, and took him before justice Welch. He said, he never had done such a thing before, and was very sorry for what he had done.
The prisoner said nothing in his defence.
To his Character.

            . The prisoner worked with me five years running. He was very honest and very sober.
Q. How long ago did he work with you?
Corder. He left me about four years and a half ago.

            . I live at Mr. Ozoris's. I lost a tea-chest on the 8th of May, the night the fire was, with two cannisters in it; one was full of tea, the other full of sugar; I was in Mr. Farrer's shop when the prisoner came to pawn it.

            . I lost a tea-chest and two silver tea-spoons; they stood on the pewter-shelf in the kitchen.

            . The prisoner brought this tea-chest (producing it) to my master's house to pledge it; I was going to examine him, but

             was in the shop, she clapped her hand on it, and said it was her's. I asked him how he came by it; he said it was his own; he said he bought it in Harp alley. I asked where the key was; he said his mother had it, on Saffron-hill. I got a constable, and he was taken up.

             fetched her fellow-servant

 to swear to the spoons, which are marked with her name on them.
Prisoner's Defence.
I carried them there to pawn, and that gentlewoman said it was her property; I said it was not; that young man jumped over the counter and held me; I told them I picked it up at Goldsmiths-hall, and a gentlewoman said there was another, but I did not see it; I went to pawn it; that gentlewoman said it was her's.

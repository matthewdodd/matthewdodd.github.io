            . This building belonged to me, and is in Stanhope-street, Clare-market


, in my back yard. On the 23rd of October, the prisoner, whom I did not know, came to my public-house alone - he was seen to go into the back yard, but no notice was taken of it; I then saw my lodger run out - I went to see what it was, he touched the prisoner on the shoulder, and brought him back; I saw this pipe on him, and said, "What have you got here?" he took some lead from each of his pockets - I said, "Is this all?" he then pulled some from under his small-clothes; I said, "Is this all?" he then took off his hat, and I found some more; I had seen it all safe at eleven o'clock - there are six pieces; I have fitted it, and it matches exactly.

John Bridge. I live with a woollen-draper without Aldgate. Coming from thence, on the 11th of this instant, at 9 at night, about four doors on this side of Aldgate


, I felt something at my pocket: I felt, and missed my handkerchief: I turned round immediately, and laid hold of the prisoner, and charged him with stealing it; he said he had it not. I held him by the collar, and in searching him, found my handkerchief rolled up under his waistcoat, upon his hip-bone.
Prisoner's Defence.
I found it on the ground, and was unwilling to let him have it, till I found it to be his. I came from Bristol, to receive some money due to me from on board a man of war, and have been in London but six weeks.

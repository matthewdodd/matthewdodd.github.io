             sworn.
I keep a shop opposite the prosecutor: and on the 27th of October I saw the prisoner go past his shop; seeing nobody in it, he turned back and went in; I saw him come out with the great coat on his arm. I went over to enquire if they had sold him the coat; and finding they had not, I went after the prisoner and brought him back. He told me that he was a coachman out of place: that it was his first offence, and begged me to let him go: I said the coat was not my property, and sent for Mr. Henderson, who came in about ten minutes after: he sent for a constable and took him before a justice.
PRISONER's DEFENCE.
I bought the great coat from a man in Oxford-road; I came down Swallow-street and this man followed me. I never was in his house.



               GUILTY
            .
Tried by the Middlesex Jury before Mr. Justice ASTON.

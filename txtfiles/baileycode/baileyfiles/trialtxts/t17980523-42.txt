            , No. 38, Duke-street, St. James's


; I went to lodge there on Thursday the 18th of January, and on Saturday morning I breakfasted with Mr. and Mrs. Ellington, then I went to work, at Mr. Thomas's, in St. James's-street; I am a breeches-maker; I stopped to finish some work before I went out, and Mr. Ellington came up and asked me to consent that the prisoner should sleep with me, and as they had been very civil to me, I consented; I finished my work, and took it to the shop; I left the shop about nine o'clock, and we had a pot of beer and some bread and cheese; I got home a little before or a little after eleven on the Saturday night; when I came home, the landlady told me he was gone up to bed, I soon went up after, and saw the door a little open; I was a little alarmed; the bed was facing the door; I looked, and saw nobody in bed; my box was at the bed's feet, and that was burst open with a screw-driver; the screw-driver is here that it was done with; I left the box locked when I went out, between eleven and twelve; I lifted the box lid up, and found my property mentioned in the indictment gone; (repeats them); I have found all the things again but the waistcoat; they were at different pawnbrokers; I should know them again; Bly the constable went with me; the coat and breeches were delivered to me at Queen-square, the other things were found to-day; when the prisoner was committed last from Bow-street, he told me where to find the things.
Q. And you found all this property by his direction? - A. Yes; all that I had not found before.

             lodged in our house; I had the key of the room in my pocket all day on the Saturday; the prisoner came in at ten o'clock; I asked him, whether he chose to go to bed then, or whether he would wait till Freer came in; he said, he chose to go then, and my little boy lighted him up into the prosecutor's room, and he asked particularly the way out, as he should have to get up soon in the morning; I shewed him the private door; I heard him run down in ten minutes after he had been lighted up, as I thought; I sat at work by the fire close to the staircase.
Q. But you cannot say, not seeing that person, who it was? - A. No, I cannot.
Q. Are you perfectly sure that the prisoner is the man you let in? - A. Yes.

             sworn. - I am a pawnbroker; I cannot swear to the prisoner. There was a blue great coat pledged on the 22d of January, in the name of 
               
                  William
                   Smith
               



            , it is a Bath beaver great coat, I cannot say whether it was the prisoner or not, the coat was delivered up at Queen-square by order of the Magistrate. (It was produced by Bly).

                  GEORGE
                   MOTTE
               



             sworn. - I am a soldier in the first regiment of Foot Guards; I have nothing to say, I do not know the man. Milligan, one of my comrades, told me he had got a duplicate of a coat, if I had a mind to buy it; and I went to the pawnbroker's, and tried the coat on, and it fitted me; it was in for eighteen shillings; I asked him what I must give him for the duplicate; he said, five shillings, and I gave him five shillings, and paid the interest; I wanted a coat at the time, or else I must have bought a new one; it was a blue coat; I have worn the coat, (produces it); I have had it ever since.


                  JOHN
                   MILLIGAN
               



             sworn. - I am a soldier in the first regiment of Guards: I got the duplicate of the coat that I sold to Motte from the prisoner; I could not raise the money to purchase it myself, and I sold it to him.


                  GEORGE
                   FLINT
               



             sworn. - I am a pawnbroker, in Paradise-row, Lambeth: There was a coat pledged at our shop, on the 22d of January, in the name of 
               
                  William
                   Smith
               



            , but whether it was the prisoner or not, I cannot tell; it was taken out and repledged by a soldier of the name of Motte, and redeemed by him on the 31st of January.
Prosecutor. This is my shirt, it is marked with my name; it is worth two shillings and sixpence or three shillings; the breeches I have not worn, but they have been worn since they were taken from me; I am a breeches maker by trade, if they had not been worn, they would have been sold for fourteen or fifteen shillings; this coat I believe to be mine, I have not wore it, it cost me two pounds nineteen shillings; it would fell now for two pounds.
Prisoner's defence, as read by Mr. Shelton. I have pleaded not guilty to this indictment, because I look upon it, when a man has once been discharged by the due course of Law, for an offence, he has no right to be apprehended again for it. In the latter end of January last, I was apprehended on suspicion of stealing a watch, and was taken before Serjeant Kirby, Esq. at the Police-office, Queen-square, and ordered for further examination; on Thursday, when I came there, there were all these people against me that are here now; and when I saw that, I told the Magistrate I should wish to speak to him in private; the Justice and I, and one of the officers, went up stairs into a room; I told the Justice if he would admit me an evidence for the Crown, and dismiss the business that I was there for then, together with the affair with which I am charged now, I would make a free confession of a great number of footpad robberies, and burglaries, and tell where they were to be found. Mr. Kirby told me if I really did that, and he should find that the account that I gave of burglaries and robberies done by myself, with two others, in Kent and Surry, was true, I should be admitted an evidence for the Crown. I was committed, andthe two men were taken, and one was fully committed to the Kingston Assizes for a highway robbery, and another for a burglary, and I was admitted evidence for the Crown; these people now against me were dismissed by Mr. Kirby, who told them I had turned evidence against two other men, upon condition of my being pardoned for this; I was concerned alone in this. I remained in jail till I was taken down to Kingston, I gave evidence against them, I was discharged, and was at home with my friend for three weeks, till having occasion to go to Westminster, the constable came into the room and apprehended me for this robbery; he then told me I must go before a Magistrate, and though it was close to the office at Westminster he would not take me there, because he knew Mr. Kirby could not commit me for it; he took me to Sir

            's, and I told him the same; and he said, if the Judge found it to be true I should be acquitted. I have nothing more to say, I confessed every thing I had done by myself, and particularly this affair that I am now here for. To prove what I say, I shall call

             sworn. - Q. Do you know whether this charge was a charge upon which he was to be pardoned? - A. Undoubtedly; and part of the property was given up.
Q. Do you know that he gave evidence at Kingston? - A. Yes; and the men were acquitted before Judge Buller, at Kingston.

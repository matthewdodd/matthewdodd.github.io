ELIZABETH DUNKS
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
5th of August, 1 shirt, value 3s.; 2 sheets, value 5s.; and 1 apron, value 1s.; the goods of 



John Constantine Lombardy; and that she had been before convicted of felony.






DOROTHY LOMBARDY
. I am the wife of John Constantine Lombardy—we live in Ray-street. I have known the prisoner some years—she acted as my servant off and on—I left home on the 4th of August, and returned on the 14th—the prisoner was in and out at my place during that time— when I returned I missed the articles stated—the prisoner was at her own lodging—I suspected her, and I gave notice to the officer—he found this shirt and two sheets of mine—this is all I have got.





WILLIAM ALEXANDER CHAPMAN
. I am a pawnbroker, and live in Clerkenwell. I have a shirt and two sheets—they were pawned with me, but not by the prisoner—this is the duplicate of them.





CHARLES ELLIOTT
 (police-constable G 132.) I beard of this, and saw the prisoner coming down Turnmill-street on the 18th of August—I told her I wanted her for a robbery in Ray-street—she said she did not do it—the next day she said she was induced by another girl to steal the property, and gave it to her to pledge—I found the duplicate on the prisoner, and the articles are pawned in her name.


Prisoner. I did not pawn them, nor take them; it was another person; the duplicate was not found on me.





WILLIAM GRAY
 (police-sergeant G 12.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 23.—


Transported for Ten Years.

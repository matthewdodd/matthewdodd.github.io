             On Sunday, the 25th of last month, I was going down Chick lane, this woman came out and said that that soldier had her shoes. I stopt him, and found one pair in his pockets; he had got another pair tucked under his coat between his shoulders.
(The shoes produced, and deposed to by the prosecutor.)

I bought those two pair of shoes, for three and sixpence; of a man in Chick lane.

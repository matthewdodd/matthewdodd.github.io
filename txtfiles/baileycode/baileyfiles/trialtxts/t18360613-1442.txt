ELIZA REAY
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
20th of May, 3 pairs of shoes, value 2s.6d., the goods of 




Ann Waugh, and that she had before been convicted of felony.






ANN WAUGH
. I keep a haberdasher's shop, in Whitechapel-road. On Friday, the 20th of May, the prisoner and another came to the shop to purchase stockings and some ribbon—they bought the things—the prisoner kept walking about the shop; and being confused, I asked her what she had under her shawl; and before she could answer me, I took three pairs of shoes from under her arm, under her shawl—she said nothing, but endeavoured to make off—I caught hold of her shawl—she left it behind her—the boy caught her on the curb-stone, and brought her back, and I gave her in charge.





CHARLES MULLATLY
. I am a policeman. The prisoner was given in my charge, with the shoes.

(Property produced and sworn to.)





WILLIAM DAVIS
. I am a policeman. I have a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office (read)—I was present at her trial—she is the person.

Prisoner. I am not guilty of this offence.




GUILTY
. Aged 19.—


Transported for Life.

Before Mr. Justice Patteson.

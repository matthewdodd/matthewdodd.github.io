THOMAS KIMBER. I am a commission agent
, and live in Edgware-road


; the prisoner was five or six weeks in my service. On the 14th of September in the morning, she came and asked for money to get tea and sugar for breakfast; I gave her 2s.; I then put my purse on the table; I breakfasted and dressed myself; I went to Oxford-street to pay 5l., and when I got there I missed my sovereign; I went home and told her I had lost a sovereign; she said, "I am sorry for that, for my aunt is going to make me a present of a new gown to-day, and, perhaps, you will suspect I had it;" I told the people of the houseto watch her - I am sure I put the sovereign on my table with the other money.

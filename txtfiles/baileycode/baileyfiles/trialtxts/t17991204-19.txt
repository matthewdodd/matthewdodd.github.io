, I am servant
 to Mr. Williams: I lost the articles, mentioned in the indictment, from the pantry, the first room in the house, on the 10th of November, about ten o'clock; I was coming home, and saw the prisoner coming up the area; I asked him what he had got, and he told me he had got some cloaths; I desired to see them; he had them under his great coat; and he then attempted to make his escape; I caught him by the collar, and brought him back; I examined them, and found them to be my property; I sent for a constable, and he was detained; I found ninepence in the waistcoat pocket, which I had left there.

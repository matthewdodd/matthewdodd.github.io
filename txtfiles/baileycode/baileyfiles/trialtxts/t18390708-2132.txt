JOHN REYMAN
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
3rd of June, 34lbs. weight of lead, value 3s., the goods of 



John Charles Stahlschmidt, being fixed to a building; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






ROBERT EISDELL
. I am clerk to Mr. John Charles Stahlschmidt, of Belvidere wharf, St. Mary, Lambeth. This lead was taken from the roof of his coach-house—I did not miss it till it was brought by the policeman—I then saw it applied to the roof, and it matched exactly.





JAMES PEPPER
 (police-constable L 51.) I stopped the prisoner in the York-road on the 3rd of June, at a quarter-past one o'clock in the morning, with a bag—I asked what he had got—he said he did not know—I put my hand in, and found it was lead—he threw it down at my feet, and ran, but I secured him, and held him till I got assistance—I found this 34lbs. of lead—I fitted it to the nail boles on the top of the prosecutor's building—I am quite sure it came from there.

Prisoner. You asked what I had got—I said I did not know—I walked three hundred yards before you collared me. Witness. No, you did not—I collared you before you threw it down at all, and you tried to get away—we had a scuffle for about twenty minutes.





JOHN COLLISON
 (police-sergeant L 12.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's conviction from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—I apprehended him on that occasion, and I know he is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 26.—


Transported for Ten Years.

ADJOURNED TO MONDAY, AUGUST 12TH, 1839.

WILLIAM JOHNSON
 was indicted

 for stealing 2 spoons, value 10s., the goods of 



Mary Ann Hubbard; and that he had been before convicted of felony.



MR. HORRY
conducted the Prosecution.






ANN HUBBARD
. I am a widow, and keep a confectioner's shop, in Queen's Head-row, Newington. On Wednesday, the 2nd of Oct., the prisoner came a little before four o'clock, and asked for a plate of soup—he went to take it into the parlour adjoining my shop—I took it to him—I had one silver spoon lying on the side-board, behind where he sat, and one I gave him—about a quarter of an hour after he came out of the parlour, he wished me good afternoon—he paid me when I took the soup—I did not go into the parlour—I was sitting in the shop—my son came and told me something—I then went and looked, and found the two silver spoons gone—in the soup-plate which I had handed to the prisoner, I found a metal spoon—these spoons are my property—they are worth 10s.

Cross-examined by
MR. CLARKSON
Q. How long have you carried on business? A. Twenty-five years—I had no conversation with the prisoner about the spoons—I had never seen him before.





HENRY DEIGHTON
. I am shopman to Charles and George Mullens, pawnbrokers in the Wai worth-road. On Wednesday afternoon, the 2nd of Oct., I saw the prisoner in my master's shop, between three and four o'clock—he offered me a pair of table-spoons in pledge—I believe these to be the same spoons—while I was weighing them with my back to the counter, I heard a noise—I turned, and the prisoner was gone—I heard a cry of "Police!"—my fellow-shopman ran round to the other door—I had not paid for the spoons.





GEORGE TOMPKINS
 (police-constable M 166.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 27.—


Transported for Ten Years

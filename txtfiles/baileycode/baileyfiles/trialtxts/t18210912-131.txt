            . On the 21st of August, about five minutes before six o'clock in the morning, I was in Red Lion-street, Clerkenwell


, and saw the prisoner Bridgeman, standing a few yards from Mr. Taylor's parlour window, which was open; Mobbs handed something out of the window, Bridgeman received it,and immediately flung a handkerchief over it, and ran off with it, Mobbs jumped out and ran after him - I gave an alarm, and pursued them, they were taken a very few minutes after; I know them to be the same persons, I took particular notice of them. The cruets were taken from them.

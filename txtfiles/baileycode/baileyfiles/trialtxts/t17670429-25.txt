            . I am Mr. Jourdan's foreman; last Monday we lost a deal board out of a new building in the Minories


, and it was found in Mr. South's yard in the Minories; it is a very remarkable board; I know it well to be my master's property.

            . I saw Parry take the board out of the house on a Monday, about a quarter past twelve at noon, and carry it into South's house; Parry had been paid off the Saturday night before; Maddox work'd for Mr. Jourdan at the same time.


                  William 
                  South 
               



            . I keep a public-house in the Minories. I cannot say I saw either of the prisoners bring any thing into my house, because I was about my business; I know Parry was in my house that day, and Maddox might for what I know. Parry was building up a little bit of a shed for me; I gave him the money to buy stuff.
Q. to Castle. How came Maddox to be charged?
Castle. I believe he was charged by Parry.
Parry's defence.
Maddox got the board for me, I thought he had bought it, I bought it of him.

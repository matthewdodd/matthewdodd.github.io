            . I am a cheese-factor
. These cheeses were in a warehouse over my stable, in President-street East, City-road


. I lost them on the 30th of December; but did not miss them till the 1st of January, when I found them at Guildhall. I know the sacks and six cheeses.

            . I am an officer. I stopped the prisoner in Golden-lane, on the evening of the 30th of December, with one of these sacks on his back; another person was with him, who had the other sack on his back; each sack contained three cheeses; the other man got away - I found out Mr. Woolley, who claimed them - I found a key on the prisoner, which opens the warehouse door.
Prisoner's Defence. I was merely engaged by two men to assist in carrying the property - and the two men, who engaged me, absconded the moment I was detained.

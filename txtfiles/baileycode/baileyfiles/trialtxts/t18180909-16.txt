THOMAS ARMSTRONG. I am servant to Mr. Henry Woolrich, who is a Scotch muslin manufacturer
, and lives in the Old Change. On the 22d of August, between eleven and twelve o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner, who was a stranger, go out of the warehouse, I had not seen him come in. I missed a piece of handkerchiefs. I ran out, Gimber brought him back, and found the handkerchiefs under his apron.

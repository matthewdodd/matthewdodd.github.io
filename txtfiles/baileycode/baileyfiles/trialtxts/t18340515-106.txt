            . I live in Essex-street. On the 23rd of April, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, I saw the two prisoners near the prosecutor's door, in Kingsland-road


 - I am sure they are the persons - I had known Goodge before - I saw him take the pistols which were hanging just inside the door - he gave them to Dupree, who put them into his apron and ran away.

            . I live in Essex-street. I was sitting about five yards from the prosecutor's shop, and saw the prisoners go by - in a moment or two I saw Dupree run by with the pistols in his lap - I did not see who took them.

            . On the 23rd of April, about twenty minutes to seven o'clock, a gentleman came and told me of this - I then missed the pistols which I had seen safe a quarter of an hour before - they have never been found.

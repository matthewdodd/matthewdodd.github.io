On the 27th of April, the prisoner, who was quite a stranger, came and I asked me to let her go backwards, which the did—I saw her take the flannel shirt from the line—she gave me a penny, and said if she came back that way again, would I let her go again—I said, "Yes"—I called my grandmother, who took her into custody—I saw her find the shirt on her.





JANE PERRY
. I am the wife of Jonas Perry. I found my flannel shirt under the prisoner's cloak—she was quite a stranger to me.

She had got a few yards off the premises.

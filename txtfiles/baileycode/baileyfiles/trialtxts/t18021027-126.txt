THOMAS WILSON sworn. - I am a watchmaker
, No. 10, Well-yard, Little Britain


: On Saturday, the 2d of October, between eleven and twelve o'clock at noon, I was sitting at work in the back part of my shop, which looks into a yard; the yard door was open, and it being very warm, the window was open; there were three watches lying before me at the window, I had them to regulate; a rap came to the front door; I went to the door, and a young lad asked me if I knew the name of Smith; I told him I did not; my mother immediately cried out, thief; I ran immediately, and followed the prisoner down Bartholomew-close, towards Smithfield; he then turned down a long arch-way, which leads to Queen-square, and I laid hold of him, and found the property upon him.(The watches were produced and identified by the prosecutor.)
Prisoner's defence. It is my first offence, I beg for mercy. GUILTY, aged 24.

 for stealing 1 mare, price 35l.; 1 set of harness, value 5l.; and 1 cabriolet, 10l.; the property of

WILLIAM WINCH
. I am a job-master, and live in White Horse-yard, Windmill-street, St. James's. On the 1st of Aug. the prisoner came to hire a horse and cab—I let them to him—they were worth about 50l.;—he said he was going to Chelsea, and should return between eight and nine o'clock the same evening—he did not come—he said he lived at the Chapter Coffee-house—I went there, and could not find him—I heard of the horse and cab ten days afterwards at Andover.





HENRY BUCKINGHAM
. I am a farmer, and live at Andover. On the 3rd of Aug. I was at the pig-market at Newbury with my horse at the New Inn—the prisoner came, and wanted to change a mare for my horse—I refused, and then he asked me to buy the mare and harness, which I did for 9l.;—the mare was very lame—Mr. Winch came and identified it, and I let him have it—the prisoner said he gave 17l.; for it at Mr. Dixon's, in Barbican.

Prisoner. Q. Have you any bill or paper to prove you gave me 9l.;? A. I have a witness to prove it—you gave me your address, Robert Augustus Jones, in some street in Euston-square.





ARTHUR NORTH
. I live at Newbury. I was present when the prisoner sold the mare to Mr. Buckingham for 9l.; 10s.—the cab was left in my possession to take care of.

Prisoner. I did not say I lived at the Chapter Coffee-house, but the people there knew me—I went to Cremorne-house, Chelsea, where I said I was going—I had no felonious intention.





JOSEPH BRADDICK
. I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY

Transported for Ten Years.

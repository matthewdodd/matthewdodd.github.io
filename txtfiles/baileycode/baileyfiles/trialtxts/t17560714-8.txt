            . The prisoner lived servant
 with me. I saw her in bed; then I went out, and shut the door after me, and when I came back I found her and the things mentioned were gone. I apprehended her; then she said she let a woman in that was her acquaintance, and she got up and took the things, and went away with them. She told me where they were, and I found one gown at the pawnbroker's by her direction. Produced in court and deposed to.
Q. Where does she live?
T. Hands. Her name is Pain: In Bow Street, Bloomsbury. The prisoner said she had fetch'd out some of the things and sold them.
Mr. Blake. I am constable. I was sent for to the prosecutrix's. I went with her to the pawnbroker; and found this gown there that is here produced.
Prisoner's defence.
Another person took the things away and pawn'd them, and I did all in my power to recover them.

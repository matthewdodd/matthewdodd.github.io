            . I am a coachman; I drove for Mr. Street, of No. 1, Adelphi-terrace, whilst his own coachman was ill from a kick of one of the horses. On the day mentioned in the indictment, I drove two gentlemen and two ladies to Bow-street


, where I sat them down at the office door. When I went to turn my carriage round, I observed the off side door open; ours is a landau. I got down immediately, and examined it, and found the glass gone.

            . I am an evening patrole of St. Martin's in the Fields. As I and my partner were coming along Craven-court, we saw the two prisoners coming along, carrying something; we ran after them, and cought them. I heard glass crash; we caught them in Northumberland-passage. The glass was laying on the ground.

            . I am Mr. Street's coachman. I was unable to drive for him at that time. I can swear to this frame, as being his property.

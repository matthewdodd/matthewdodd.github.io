            . I live on Holborn-hill


, four doors from Hatton-garden. I saw the lawn hanging at my door about six o'clock in the evening on the 3d of November, just after I had seen it, a person called out to me that it was taken away; I looked and missed it.

            . As I was coming down Holborn, I saw the prisoner come out of Mr. Allom's door way with this lawn under his arm; I went after him; he turned up Hatton-garden, I tried to catch hold of it but could not; he droped a corner of it; I trod on it and got it from him; he dropt his hat but would not stop for it; I cried stop thief! and still followed him; I struck him on the neck and knocked him down, and then he put up his legs and threw me (The lawn produced and deposed to by the prosecutor.)

He did not take it from me; there was a cry of stop thief, and because I was running he knocked me down.

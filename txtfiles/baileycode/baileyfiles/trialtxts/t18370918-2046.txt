ROBERT HICKS
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
28th of July, 11 yards of silk, value 2l.; and 2 pieces of linen cloth, containing together 52 yards, value 7l.; the goods of 




John Capper and another, his masters; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






JOHN CAPPER
. I live at No. 69, Gracechurch-street, and keep a linen draper's shop. The prisoner was my porter—I have one partner—I have lost 52 yards of linen cloth—I know this to be mine—(looking at it)—we have not sold it—my porter had no right to have property of that description, except on being instructed to take it out when sold.





WILLIAM ALEXANDER JONES
. I gave Woodhouse 2 pieces of Irish—the prisoner offered them in pledge at Mr. Walmsley's, and I stopped them.

Prisoner. I offered them to his master. Witness. It was in my presence.





JOHN WOODHOUSE
 (police-constable M 13.) I got these 2 places of Irish from Jones.

Prisoner, I leave it in your hands, and the mercy of the Jury.





ROBERT PATTISSON
 (City police-constable 84.) I produce this certificate of the prisoner's former conviction from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the man.




GUILTY
. Aged 22.—


Transported for Seven Years.

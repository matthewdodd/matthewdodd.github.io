JAMES ANDERSON
. I am carman to John Pearson Key, a grocer in Bishopsgate-street. About five o'clock in the afternoon of the 7th of March, I was driving my cart, containing casks, mats, and bags of sugar, and twelve lumps of sugar behind, in Kingsland-road—I heard somebody behind the cart—I turned, and saw the prisoner run from my cart with a loaf of sugar in his arms—I ran after him, and asked what he was going to do with it—he made no reply, but dropped the sugar, and ran across the road—I caught him immediately.

Cross-examined by
MR. WYLDE. Q. I suppose you had never seen him before? A. No—I am quite sure of him—I kept him in sight all the time.





ROBERT DEANE
 (police-constable N 297.) I took the prisoner, and have the sugar.

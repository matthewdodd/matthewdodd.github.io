            . I keep a coffee-shop, near Grosvenor-square


. On the 25th of May, at a quarter-past nine o'clock at night, I was shutting up my shop; I saw the prisoner come out of Mr. Richards' coach-house with this coat under his arm - he ran towards Oxford-street; I pursued, and took him back to the coachman, who owned the coat; I never had my eyes off him.

            . I am coachman to Mr. James Richards. Turner brought the prisoner and this coat back to me - it belongs to my master; I had seen it not three minutes before.(Property produced and sworn to.)

            . I am an officer, and took the prisoner.
Prisoner's Defence. I met a man, who asked me to take this coat to Green-street, Edgeware-road, and he would give me 1s.; the witness came and took me: what the witness states about my coming out of the coach-house is false; if he was at the bar himself, it would not be the first time.
WILLIAM TURNER. I never was at any bar in my life, but his mother has been to the livery-stable and said I was tried here.

            . Aged 22.

, the: 16th of this Instant May
.
It appear'd by the Evidence, that there had been a Fire in Wild Street


, and the Spoons being lost in the Confusion, the Prisoner was apprehended offering them to sale. The Prisoner pleaded, that he having assisted at the Fire, found them taking up a Floor in the Prosecutor's House, and took them for his Pains. The Jury not thinking it meet, if what he alledg'd was true, that he should thus be his own Pay Master, found him 

               guilty
             of the Indictment.

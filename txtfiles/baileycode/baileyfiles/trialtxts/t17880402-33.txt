            ; we lost some butter on the 8th of March, between five and six in the morning; I was informed of it by a watchman, who stopped the prisoner; I went with the watchman to the watch-house, where the prisoner was in custody; I found there, some casks of butter, with some cheese and pork; the prisoner had lived servant with us twice; he lived servant with us when he was ten years of age, when on account of his bad character, we sent him abroad, where he was seven years; he then returned and came into our service again.

             sworn.
I am a watchman; about a quarter after five in the morning, I saw in a dark alley, the property; I examined it, and found it to be butter; I went to the watch-house, and returned, and found that it was all gone; I then returned to the watch-house, and found another watchman, and upon going back to the place, saw the prisoner, and stopped him with butter and pork; examined him, and took him to the watch-house and detained him; we found it was Mr. Goodenough's by the mark; the prisoner confessed it, and wanted to be let go; I asked him where the rest of the goods were, he would not tell us; they then went out and found three more; he then acknowledged the robbery, and that it was his master's, that he got in by a ladder, and that one Rosaman, a watchman, of Bishopsgate-ward, assisted him, and that he brought it out at the back door; Rosaman was taken up and discharged.

EDWARD LAVER. I am a taylor
. On the 17th of January, I lost my property; I went into the Brown Bear, Covent Garden


, and slept there with the prisoner.
Q. Had you your property when you went to bed - A. Yes. The prisoner got up about five o'clock in the morning; he told me he was going down into the yard, and after he was gone, I missed my things off my bed; I missed a pair of small clothes, a great coat, seven shillings and sixpence in money in my pocket, a pair of gaiters, and a large silk handkerchief. I was quite sober when I went to bed; it was late when I got in town, so I took up a lodging there; I live at Woodford.

Prosecutor. They are my property; the breeches I made myself, I can swear to them.
Prisoner's Defence. I got up at two o'clock in the morning, in the dark, I made a mistake, and put his breeches on instead of my own.

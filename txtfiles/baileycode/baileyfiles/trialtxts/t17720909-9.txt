            . I am a surgeon
; I live in Prescot Street, Goodman's Fields


. I was called down between eight and nine o'clock in the morning on the 20th of July, and I found the prisoner and 
               
                  John
                   Todd
               



             in my room.


                  John
                   Todd
               



            . Between nine and ten in the morning of the 20th of July, I saw the prisoner talking to a woman in Prescot Street; they soon parted; she went away and the prisoner walked by the prosecutor's house, and then he went in. I said to a man that was near me, stay a little, and we shall see what the man is about. I soon perceived him in the parlour; I saw him take up the sugar dish and milk pot, and bring them towards the door; then he saw the other man and me standing in the passage, and returned them to the place again; the milk was spilt and the sugar was scattered about the table; I stept up to him, took him by the collar, and asked him what business he had with that plate; he said he had none.
Prisoner's Defence.
I went to the house with no bad intent. I had the foul disease and went for advice; they surprised me so, that I had no opportunity of telling my intent in going there.

             (City police-constable No. 90). On the 14th of May, I was on duty in Red Cross-street - I saw the prisoner with another person - I knew the prisoner by sight, and I followed him to the corner of Paul's-alley - he then took to his heels and ran away - I called, "Stop thief" - he put his hand to his breast, and pulled out these two books, wrapped in this handkerchief - he threw them down- I took them up, and still pursued him into Aldergate-street, where he was stopped - I am sure he is the person - I only lost sight of him for a minute or so - it was about ten o'clock in the morning.

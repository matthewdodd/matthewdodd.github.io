, and live in King-street, Seven Dials


. On the 5th of February, about half-past ten o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner come into the shop, and take the piece of bacon off thewindow; a man came in with her, under the pretence of buying some, and had a piece weighed, then said it was too dear. As the prisoner was going out she took a piece off the window, and put it under her apron. I secured her, and brought her back.

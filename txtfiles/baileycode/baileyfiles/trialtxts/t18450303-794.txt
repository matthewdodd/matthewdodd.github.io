ELIZABETH DONOVAN
 was again indicted

for stealing 1 neckerchief, value 6d., the property of 



George Jeal, from the person of 



Thomas Ralph Jeal; and that she had before been convicted of felony.






ELIZA JEAL
. I am the wife of George Jeal—we live in the London-road—about two o'clock in the afternoon, on the 26th of Feb., I sent my two children to walk on the pavement—the eldest, George John Jeal, is four years old, and the other, Thomas Ralph, is two—I told my servant to put on her bonnet, and follow the children, who had just gone outside the door—she did so, and returned without them—I did not see the children again till six in the evening, when the policeman brought them to me—I missed from the youngest child a neckerchief, which I am quite sure he had on when he went out; and from the eldest child I missed a pair of shoes and a pinafore—the next morning the prisoner came to our house, and asked if that was where the children were lost from—I told her it was—she said, "I am the person who took the clothes, and here is the duplicate"—she put it down, and my husband gave her into custody—these are my property.





CHARLES RUSSELL
. I am in the employ of Mr. Stevens, a pawnbroker—on the 26th of Feb. the prisoner pawned these children's shoes, this neckerchief, and this pinafore—I swear she is the person.





WILLIAM SOPP
 (police-constable, M 162.) I took the prisoner into custody—I went with the duplicate, and got the property—the prisoner was discharged and taken again.


Prisoner. I was taken up, and the Magistrate said if I was sorry for what I had done I might go.





JOHN HOLDAWAY
 (police-constable, P 169.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got at this court—(read—Convicted on the 19th of Aug., 1844, and confined six months)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 17.—


Transported for Ten Years.

SARAH STAPLES
. I am servant to Jean Francoise Isadore Caplin, a milliner. About ten o'clock in the morning of the 12th of March, I saw Madame Caplin put a half-sovereign and some silver on the counter—I do not know how much there was—I was minding the shop—I saw the prisoner

come in, take the money off the counter, and run out—I ran out after him, calling "Stop thief"—he was caught in Regent-street, by a gentleman, and half a sovereign, six shillings, and two sixpences were found on him.

Prisoner. I was in the shop about five minutes, and asked if you wanted wood—you said, "No"—I went into the next shop—there was nobody there, and you came and said to me, "Did you see any young man running by?"—I said, "Yes," I ran after him, and the gentleman took me. Witness. You are the boy that I saw take the money off the counter.





BENJAMIN HAWKINS
. I am a porter, and live in Carabridge-mews. At twenty minutes past ten o'clock I was in Regent-street, and saw the prisoner and this witness running, crying "Stop thief"—I took him back to the shop—I saw he had something in his mouth, and he put out half a sovereign, six shillings, and two sixpences into my hand, when I told him.

Prisoner's Defence. I had half a sovereign, eight shillings, and two sixpences in my pocket—they did not take that from me—I put this money into my mouth as I was running, because I had got holes in some of my pockets.
(Thomas Wright, paper-stainer, Stephen-street, Lisson-grove, gave the prisoner a good character.)




GUILTY

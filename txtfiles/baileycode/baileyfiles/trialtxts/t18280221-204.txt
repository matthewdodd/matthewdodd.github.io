THOMAS WALLIS. I live at Tottenham. I lent this fork to Deller about a week before it was lost - I know it to be mine.

            . I live at the Ship public-house, Wallis lent me this fork; I laid it on the rack, in the stable, on the 17th or 18th of November; I saw it safe on the evening of the 18th, and on the morning of the 19th it was gone; the prisoner used to sleep in the hay-loft - I know the ostler, and he allowed me to leave it there; I saw the prisoner there the night it was stolen.

            . I live at Tottenham. On Monday, the 19th of November, about half-past five o'clock, I saw the prisoner as I came out of my house to work - he had this fork under his arm, and asked me to buy it; I said No, but I bought it at last, and kept it till the officer came with a warrant to the farm I work at, and took it.

            . I am an officer, and took the prisoner.
Prisoner's Defence. I did not sleep there; on the morning I sold him the fork I found it under a hedge, in the field, and did not know it had been in the loft; a witness knows I was not there, but I could not afford to pay him to come.

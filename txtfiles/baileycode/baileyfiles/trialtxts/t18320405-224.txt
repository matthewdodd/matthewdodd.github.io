            . I am agent to Mr. Thomas Wade- he has three houses in Fox-court, St. Sepulchre


. On the 20th of March I met the prisoner carrying these eight sashes and two doors, which had been fixed in Mr. Wade's houses; I asked what he was going to do with them - he said to take them to Barbican, and two persons had employed him to carry them there, but he did not know who - I said I should detain the sashes; I found on him a chisel, which the officer compared with the marks on the frame, and it fitted them exactly; these are the articles.

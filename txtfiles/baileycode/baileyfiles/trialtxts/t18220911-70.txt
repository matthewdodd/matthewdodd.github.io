MACKWORTH GUSTAVUS YONGE. I am a warehouseman
. On the 22d of August, I was in Newgate-street


, going home. I had my handkerchief in my hand when I went out. I did not miss it. Abrahams laid hold of the prisoner, told me it was taken, and produced it. I cannot say it is mine.

            . I am a constable. I was returning from the counter, and saw the prisoner, in company with another, standing against a post in Newgate-street. I watched them, and saw Mr. Yonge pass with a lady; I did not see a handkerchief in his hand; the prisoner and his companion immediately followed them; he laid hold of the pocket with his right hand, and 
               drew
             the handkerchief out with his left. I took hold of his two arms - his companion escaped. I informed Mr. Yonge the prisoner had concealed it between his legs; he looked at it, and gave me his address; he had an apron on.
MR. YONGE. The handkerchief resembles mine, and has my wife's initials. I had one of her's in my hand, but do not remember putting it in my pocket; she misses one.
Prisoner's Defence. I saw it lying on the ground, and picked it up to offer the gentleman, when the officer seized me.

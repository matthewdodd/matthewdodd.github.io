WILLIAM JOHNSON
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
12th of March, 271bs. weight of leaden pipe, value 3s., the goods of 



Richard Edward Wicker: and fixed to a certain building: and that he had been previously convicted of felony.






JAMES SHIP
. I live on Cock-hill, Ratcliff. This pipe belonged to a water-butt, in Mr. Edward Wicker's stable and chaise-house—it was all safe on the 12th of March—next morning I found part of it ripped off and taken away—I saw a policeman cut a piece off the end which remained—the prisoner is a stranger.





JOSEPH HARROD
. I am a policeman. At half-past ten o'clock, on the night of the 12th of March, I was in Love-lane, Shadwell, and saw the prisoner in company with two others—I crossed over the corner of Charles-place—one stood at the comer, and two went down the place—in a few minutes I heard one say, "What are you hesitating about?"—I crossed over towards him, and he walked away—the prisoner crossed the comer of Charles-place—I stopped him and asked what he had in his breast—he said, "Nothing"—I unbuttoned his coat and this lead dropped from under it—I then saw another one come along—he saw I had the prisoner, and threw some lead down, and escaped—I took the prisoner to the station-house, and found four more pieces of lead about his person—I have compared the lead with what remained on the prosecutor's premises, and have not a doubt it came from there.





GEORGE BARHAM
. I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—I was at his trial—he is the man.




GUILTY
. Aged 19.—


Transported for Fourteen Years.

, and am a furniture-dealer
. I lost this mattress from my front door on the 10th of October, about a quarter before nine o'clock in the evening; I saw the prisoner with it on his shoulder, and suspected it was mine; I looked at the place where it had been, and it was gone - I pursued, and took him about six yards from my door - this is it.

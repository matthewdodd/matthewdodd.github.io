            . I am principal waiter at the London Tavern


. The prisoner came into the coffee-room, about four o'clock, and called for half a pint of sherry. I did not like his appearance, and watched him. He called in about five minutes to know what he had to pay - it was 1 s. 9 d. He gave me a half-crown, and said,
"Never mind the change." Four spoons were on the table. I left the room - he came out, and as he passed me, I saw a spoon in his pocket. I immediately followed, and collared him; four spoons were found on him.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

            . I am a hatter
, and live in Little Chapel-street. On Sunday, the 4th of October, between eleven and twelve o'clock, I was at Spring-gardens


- I felt a tug at my pocket, and missed a silk handkerchief- I turned, and the prisoner crossed close by me; I followed him into the road, and stopped him - I charged him with the robbery: he forced himself from me, and ran into the King's-mews - he was pursued by same persons, and made several attempts to knock them down; as he was coming back the constable took him, and pulled my handkerchief from his trousers pocket.

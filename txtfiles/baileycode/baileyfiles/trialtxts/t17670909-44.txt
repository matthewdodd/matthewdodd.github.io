; I put up three pounds weight of tea in a parcel, on the 7th of August, and left it on the counter; it had laid on the counter two or three hours; I did not miss it till it was brought into the shop, and the prisoner along with it.

            . I am apprentice to Mess Robinson and Todd; I was in the shop; I did not see the prisoner come in, but I saw him going out; I followed him out, and asked him what he wanted; turning him round, I saw this parcel of tea in his hand; I brought him and that into the shop, (produced and deposed to;) here is the direction upon it who it was for.
Prisoner's defence.
Coming along, there stood three or four men in a cluster; I picked it up by them by a bulk.

THOMAS LONG
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
19th of October, 1 handkerchief, value 2s., the good of 



Richard Price Nicholas, from his person.






RICHARD PRICE NICHOLAS
. On the 19th October, between eight and nine o'clock in the evening, I was looking in at a shop window in Longacre—the prisoner was standing at my left-hand side—I thought I felt something at my pocket, and missed my pocket handkerchief—I turned round, and saw it in his hand—I gave him in charge immediately—he dropped it—there were several persons behind him—I am quite sure it dropped from his hand—this is it.

Prisoner. I was looking through the window, two men passed me and chucked the handkerchief down—I picked it up, and seeing it did not belong to me, I chucked it down again—the gentleman laid hold of me, and asked it I took it—I said, "No" Witness. There were other persons behind—he made no resistance—he was not half a yard from me—he was the nearest to me—there was not time for any body to take it and throw it to him





MALCOLM M'LENNAN
. I am an officer, I received him in charge, and took him to the station-house—he said he knew nothing about the handkerchief at all—he denied having had it—he did not say how it came into hands.

Prisoner. I spoke to the gentleman at the time, and told him the boy had thrown it down.

MR. NICHOLAS. I did not hear him say any thing of the sort—I did not listen to any thing he said—I do not thing he could have stooped down he was so close to me.




GUILTY
. Aged 16.—


Transported for Seven Years.

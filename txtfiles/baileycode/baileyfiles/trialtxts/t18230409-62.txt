            . I am an officer. I and Brown went to a clothes shop, in Cable-street, Whitechapel, on Monday, the 3d of March, in consequence of information, and found the prisoner in the shop, with a bundle. I asked what he had. He said, a pair of boots and a waistcoat. We took him to the office, searched, and found on him a pair of breeches under his own trowsers. He said he bought them at Romford a few days before. We advertized them, and Carpenter claimed them.

JAMES MAGILL
. I am a constable at the West India Docks. I live on the premises—the prisoner has been employed by me for about ten months, to look after my three children—I am a window—I paid her 3s. a week—I observed lately, when I came home at night, that she has been rather intemperate, and her tongue went very freely—I thought something was wrong, and made a search through my house—I missed some linen and other things—I had but an imperfect inventory of my things—the property which is here produced is mine.





ROBERT PENSER
, I am a pawnbroker, I produce these sugar-tongs, these spoons, a necklace, and a great variety of things pawned by the prisoner in the name of Elizabeth Brennan, at different times—she said they belonged to her children—I had reason to believe she was married.

Prisoner. I leave it to your mercy.




GUILTY

Transported for Seven Years.

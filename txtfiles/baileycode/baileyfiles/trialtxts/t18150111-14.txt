            . I lost these skins off Woolkey


; we had a stack of skins and hydes laying for shipping. On the 15th of December, I was standing about three or four yards off the place were these hides and skins lay, I saw the prisoner come across the quay, with a bundle of skins suspended on his shoulder by a string, it being an unusual way of carrying wet skins. I considered he had not come honestly by them. I stopped him, and on examination, it turned out to be three calf skins; they were given over to the constable.

            . I am one of the workman at the prosecutor's. I saw the prisoner take up one of the bundles of skins. There was a whole lot of skins and hides laying together on the quay three in a parcel; he took one of the parcels up and walked off with it.

HENRY CLARK
. I am a shoemaker, and live in Pitt's-row, Bethnal-green. On Tuesday, the 9th of March, the prisoner applied to me for a job—I employed him—at night he asked me if he could go down stairs to the yard—I told him, of course, he could—I heard him open the door, and

thought he was gone to the yard, but I saw the street-door open—I went to the yard, found the prisoner gone, and the coat and waistcoat gone also—this is his jacket, which he left behind him—no one else had been in the house between the time of his leaving and my missing the coat and waist-coat—he went away without notice.





JOHN SAYER
 (police-constable N 225.) I took the prisoner.





WILLIAM BARROW
. I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
.* Aged 21.—


Transported for Fourteen Years.

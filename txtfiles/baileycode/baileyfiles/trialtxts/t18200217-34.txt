. On the 29th of January, in the morning, I missed a pair of hind quarters of mutton. I afterwards saw it at the watch-house; it was mine, and was at my shop the night before, hanging outside.

            . I am a watchman. On the 29th of January, about two o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner coming along Paternoster-row with the mutton on his shoulder, in a direction from Newgate-market. I crossed over to him, and said,
"You have a nice piece of meat there, where did you get it?" He said two men gave it to him to carry to Fleet-market - he was not going the way to Fleet-market. I said he must go to the watch-house, but he said he would not; he threw the meat on the ground, and escaped. The patrol stopped him before I lost sight of him.
WILLIAM RANDALL. I am a patrol. I stopped the prisoner.

            . I took the prisoner with the gown on his back; he wanted to leave his bundle behind him at the lodge at Mr. Bottomly's; but as we were coming back I met some gentlemen, who asked me if he had a bundle. I went back and got the bundle, which the prisoner afterwards opened - the gown was in it - he said he had swapped away a jacket for it.

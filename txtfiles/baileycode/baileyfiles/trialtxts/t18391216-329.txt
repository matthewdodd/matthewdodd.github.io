JOSEPH PIER
. I am a seaman on board the ship Virginia, in the London Docks. On the 8th of December, about eight o'clock, the prisoner came on board, while I was washing decks—after he was gone, I went down to the forecastle, and missed my waistcoat, shirt, and pantaloons—these are hem—(looking at them)—I went on shore after the prisoner—I found him in the street with these things on—I said to him, "You have been on board this morning"—he said, "No"—I wanted to talk to him—he wanted to fight me—the policeman came and took him.





JOHN CULSO
. I am a seaman on board the Virginia. I saw the prisoner come up from the forecastle—he had got something under his jacket, but I did not see what it was.





JOHN DROVER
 (City police-constable, No. 23.) I saw the prosecutor and the prisoner—the prisoner had these things on him—the prosecutor said they were his—I took the prisoner to the station-house and then to the Computer—they provided him with other things, and took these things from him—he said he had bought them at Liverpool, and denied having

been on board the ship—the prosecutor described the marks on the clothes before he saw them.

Prisoner's Defence. I bought them at Liverpool.

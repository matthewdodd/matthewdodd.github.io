             sworn.
I have the care of the prosecutor's shop in great Wild-street


; he is a pawnbroker
: on Monday, the 16th of October, about seven in the evening, the three prisoners came into the shop together; I did not hear any conversation between them; they wanted to pledge this little whip and cane; I cannot swear whether 
               
                  Albert
                   Wells
               



             brought in the whip in his hand, but I believe he did; I received the whip and the cane from Woodman; he brought in the cane I am certain; there is an eye wanting to the cane, a little hook fixed to the cane, to which a string is tied; Woodman thought it was gold, and he asked 
               
                  Thomas
                   Wells
               



             for it, and 
               
                  Thomas
                   Wells
               



             pulled it out of his pocket wrapped up in a bit of paper; I do not recollect what answer he made, but he gave it to me; I did not try it with the stick, but I gave it him again, as it was only metal: I offered them four shillings on the cane and whip; they said they could not take it, and they all three went out together.
Did Albert say any thing about it then? - No; they all went to the door together, and 
               
                  Thomas
                   Wells
               



             got on the outside of the door, 
               
                  Albert
                   Wells
               



             and Woodman were within; as they got to the door Woodman says to me, will you lend me a crown? no, says I, four shillings is the most; with that Woodman turned round and said to Albert, we may as well take it, it will do.
Jury. Did you know any of the prisoners before? - I have known 
               
                  Albert
                   Wells
               



             five or six months, and 
               
                  Thomas
               


             I did not know was his son, he is lately returned from sea; Woodman I have known some years; they all returned to the counter to take my money, and at that instant there came another man into the shop; 
               
                  Thomas
                   Wells
               



            , Woodman, and the man that came in just filled the counter a-breast; 
               
                  Albert
                   Wells
               



             stood behind the rest, and did not come near the counter; I had two lads in the shop at the time; they are neither of them here; I told one of the lads to make out a duplicate in the name of Woodman; I heard the shop door go, I looked over those men's heads to see who it was come in, and instead of any body coming in I missed 
               
                  Albert
                   Wells
               



             out of the shop; then I looked round my shop and missed a set of half tester blue morine furniture; it was all tied up together; there was also a head cloth, tester, and vallens; it laid upon a table in the shop close to the counter, there were five bundles; Albert Wells stood behind the other men close to where those things lay; I said nothing to either of the others, but I whipped out at the private door after him; I could not see him, then Thomas Wells came out and ran away; I returned and stopped Woodman, I sent for a constable; he had no objection to going with me; 
               
                  Albert
                   Wells
               



             used our shop in the name of 
               
                  Thomas
                   Wells
               



            ; I have seen Thomas in Albert's company before, but never to know his name; we took Mr. Woodman to St. Giles's round-house; he told us Albert Wells lived No. 7, Castle-court, Fulwood's Rents, Holborn; I understood that Thomas Wells and Albert lived together; I went there about nine with the constable, he stood at a distance; I knocked at the door, a person opened the door; I asked it Mr. Wells was at home; she said, old Mr. Wells or young Mr. Wells; we went up two pair of stairs and found the two Wells's; I gave charge of them; I said where are the curtains you took out of the shop to-night? says he, I know nothing of the curtains, where is Woodman? says I, in the watch-house, and unless you produce the curtains you will go there too; says he, no, sure, the curtains are not here by God; then we searched the room, and under the head of the bed, upon the floor, we found the curtains as they were taken out of the shop never untied; there is a private mark on the corner in my own hand-writing, the mark is S. X. S. A I swear positively to the curtains, and that I saw them in the shop the time they were there; the constable took the curtains and the old man, and I took the young man; and they went down stairs first, and I came down after; I laid hold of 
               
                  Thomas
                   Wells
               



            's collar, says he, I will not go with you if you collar me, let me go and I will go quietly; as we were taking them to the Justice's, going on Holborn, 
               
                  Thomas
                   Wells
               



             attempted to run away, not knowing I had hold of him, I had hold of his pocket, and I tore a slap off his pocket; when we came to the corner of some steps, I saw old Wells run and Brooks pursuing after him, and Brooks dropped the curtains, and I picked them up, and held 
               
                  Thomas
                   Wells
               



             till Brooks overtook the old man; Brooks has had the curtains ever since.
Mr. Knowlys, Counsel for the Prisoner Woodman. You have known Woodman a considerable number of years? - I have.
Before you only knew Wells by the name of West? - No, I learned his real name at his lodgings from Woodman; we never should have found either the curtains or him but for Woodman.
Woodman had the same opportunity of escaping, yet he remained? - Yes.
I believe Woodman knew that you knew very well about him and his connections? - I believe he did; and had any body else told me that this circumstance would have happened to Mr. Woodman I would not have believed them.
Woodman did not live where Wells lived? - No.

                   BROOKS
               



             sworn.
I am a constable; I apprehended the prisoners; I was fetched by the boy, and Woodman was standing by the counter, when I went into the shop; I took Woodman to the round-house, and I went with Jordan to No. 7, in Castle-court, Fullwoods-rents, to seek for Wells, I found him up two pair of stairs; Jordan knocked at the door, and Wells opened the door, and immediately I rushed in after Jordan, and he gave charge of them both; old Wells seemed quite alarmed; says Jordan, you are to search, to see whether they are here; I looked about the bed, and different places; there was a great chest stood in the room; the old man said, they were not there; and if we went with him, it should be all right; he was only playing the rogue; and looking about under the head of the bed I pulled out these curtains, which I took care of; as soon as we got out they seemed very resolute; I threatened to cleave their sculls; they said, they would walk quietly; at Bloomsbury steps the old man gave me a push, and he said, d - n you, you dog, I will not go with you, and away he ran up the steps, I pursued after him, and took him and carried him to the round house, and I threw down the curtains; I suppose he hit me ten times and said, d - n you, you dog, I will not go with you, you have robbed me of my watch, and all that I have; there came past a gentleman and a lady, and I charged them in the name of the King, to aid and assist me; and I got him to the watch-house with difficulty; and in his pocket I found his watch, and a knife and a pick-lock key; it was only the top and the bottom of a key; and I gave it him again by order of the Justice.
Mr. Knowlys. When you got to the shop you found Woodman perfectly at his ease? - Yes, he resigned himself to every thing I requested of him.
Jordan. Before I discovered to Woodman the loss of my curtains, he very readily told me his name, and where he lived.

            'S DEFENCE.
I understood one counsel was to do for us all, it is untrue what the constable says; I never struck him, and he used me very ill, and tore a new silk waistcoat all to smash, and a new neckcloth.
Brooks. It was torn in the scuffle.

            'S DEFENCE
I know nothing at all of it; it is wanted to be laid upon me.

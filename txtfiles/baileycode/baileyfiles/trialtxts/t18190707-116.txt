THOMAS BILL. I am a patrol. I was coming on duty, heard the cry of Stop thief! ran out, and saw the prisoner running - she was stopped and dropped part of the linen, the other part was picked up. I found a towel on her, with a wet waistcoat wrapped in it, as if it had just come out of the washing-tub.

 for stealing, on the

JOHN MARCH
. I am beadle of Farringdon-without. On Saturday, the 30th of December, I saw the prisoner, with two others, in Fleet-street—I was on one side, and he on the other—I saw him pick a gentleman's pocket of a handkerchief, and turn to give it to his companions, but they saw me run across the way, and would not take it—he threw it down—I picked it up—he turned up Fetter-lane, and I lost sight of him for a second, but I am positive he is the person, I had known him before.

Prisoner. Q. You say I turned the corner of Fetter-lane? A. Yes, it was seven o'clock at night.

Prisoner. There were twenty or thirty persons and a mob ran up Fetter-lane, a gentleman laid hold of me. Witness. Yes, as I called, "Stop thief," I saw you take this handkerchief from a gentleman—I did not know who he was, he went on.





THOMAS LIGHTFOOT
. I am an officer. I was there, and saw every thing that has been stated—I gave chase, and never lost sight of the prisoner at all—he was stopped by a gentleman almost within my grasp.

Prisoner. He was not near me at all. Witness. Yes, I was close to you—my hand was not six inches from you at the time you turned—you were just by the coffee-house—you saw me, threw down the handkerchief and ran up Fetter-lane, and I after you—you were within six inches of my grasp when you turned.

Prisoner. It is a great mistake—they have not got the right person—I have a wife, and two small children,

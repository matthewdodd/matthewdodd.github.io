            . I am a constable. I and Jordan were at the corner of Hatton-garden, and saw the prisoner with something in his apron - we secured him, and found it was twenty-eight yards of cotton - he said he was taking it to his mother's on Saffron-hill.

            . I live at the Coach and Horses, public-house, Eyre-street-hill. I was by Mr. Benstead's shop, and saw the prisoner and another, as I was delivering my beer, about one o'clock - I saw them walking up and down by the shop - I returned in about five minutes, found them still there, and saw the other, who was about twelve years old, snatch the print, which was piled up on the step - they got into Warner-street, and then the boy said
"You take it," and the prisoner put it in his apron - I went and told Benstead; I saw him at the office, and am certain of him - I noticed him very much.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I saw two chaps running down Leather-lane; one of them dropped this stuff, and I put it in my apron.

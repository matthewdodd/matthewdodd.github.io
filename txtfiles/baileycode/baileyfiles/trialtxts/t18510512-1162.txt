JOHN HICKSON
 was indicted

for a robbery on

AARON LEMON
 (through an interpreter). I am a printer. On 9th May I was walking with a friend in the neighbourhood of Spitalfields, about noon—I had a silver watch in my right waistcoat-pocket, with a guard to it—I saw the prisoner with five or six others—they came close to me—one of them threw a potato, which went through a window—they took hold of my friend, and it appeared as if they wanted him to pay for the broken window—they said he had broken it—I went towards him, and they let him go and took hold of me, and the prisoner drew my watch out of my pocket and ran away with it—he was taken by a policeman and brought back in less than ten minutes—this is my watch (produced).





GEORGE KING
 (policeman. H 27). On 9th May I was on duty in Lower Keate-street, and met the prisoner running—I received information directly after he had passed me, and pursued him—I lost sight of him for about two or three minutes—I ran through a house, and found bin. in the yard, in the act of putting this watch under some vegetable leaves—I took him into custody—he said, "I did not take it, I picked it up, and run away with it;" the guard is broken, and part of it was hanging round the prosecutor's neck.

Prisoner's Defence. I saw the watch lying on the ground, and picked it up.

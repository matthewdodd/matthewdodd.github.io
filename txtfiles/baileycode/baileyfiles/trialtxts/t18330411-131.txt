JOSHUA HARCOMB (Police-constable H 51.) On the 6th of March I was in Red Lion-street, Spitalfields


, about twenty minutes before five o'clock: Webber called to me - we stood talking some minutes - I saw his cart stand at the corner of the street; I said to him, "Have you any body with you?" he said No - I saw the prisoner on the shafts, taking the leather out of the cart; he moved it over the footboard, and jumped off the shafts - I went and took him as he was coming back towards the cart, as if to take the leather quite away after he had jumped down.
CHARLES WEBBER. I am carman to Mr. 
               
                  William 
                  Eastland
               



            . This was his leather - these pieces had been moved about four feet from the inside of the cart to over the footboard, ready to be taken; I saw the prisoner get down, and the officer took him as he was coming to the cart again.
WILLIAM PERRY (Police-constable G 25.) I have a certificate (which I got at Mr. Clark's office) of the former conviction of the prisoner, for stealing two umbrellas; he was whipped and confined three months - I am the officer who took him, and know he is the man.

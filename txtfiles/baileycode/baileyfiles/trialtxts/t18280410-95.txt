 on the 5th of April; it was brought back in about two minutes after I missed it; the prisoner was brought back with another person - I had seen him about the market.

            . I stand in the market. On Saturday morning, between eleven and twelve o'clock, I saw the prisoner, and a person named Stone, near the prosecutrix's stand - Stone put his hand between two women, and drew out the scarf, which he gave the prisoner, who put it into his side pocket; they came up towards me, and I caught them both; the prisoner said he had nothing - I said, "You have." and I took it from his pocket - I gave them both to Mr. Gregory.

JOHN BARRS. I produce the scarf, which I took from Mr. Gregory, the treasurer of the parish; I took the prisoner and the other person, but he got over the wall of the lock-up place.(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I saw a number of women looking into the basket, and this shawl laid down - I took it up and put it into my pocket.

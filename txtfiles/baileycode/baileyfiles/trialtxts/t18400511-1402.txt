THOMAS WILLIAM BROWN
. I am in the employ of William Joseph Stevens, a linen-draper in Ratcliff-highway. On the 26th of April, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, I received information from Pullen, went out, and followed the prisoners about sixty yards off—I went up and told them I wanted them—they had a boy with them at the time, and I told him I wanted him as well—he immediately ran away—I turned to pursue him—he fell down in the road—I turned round to the prisoners, and just as they were going to start off I saw the stockings drop between them—I took them up and pursued them—I caught Davis first—I held her by the arm, and pursued Smith into Lander's-place, and there missed her—I made inquiry, and was told she had not come in there, but a respectable woman pointed to a door—I looked inside, and saw Smith, and took her—the stockings had hung inside my door—these are them.





WILLIAM PULLEN
. I was passing the prosecutor's shop, and saw Davis with a shawl in her hand, which hung at the door before the stockings—it was not taken down, but she held it while Smith took the stockings? from the door—I am certain of them both—they went away, and I told Mr. Stevens directly—I saw no boy with them at that time.

Davis's Defence. I was going to boy some candles; the man came and took hold of me, and said, "Where are the stockings?" but I had seen none.

Smith's Defence. The stockings were out at the window; the boy took them from the door, and dropped them.

DAVIS—

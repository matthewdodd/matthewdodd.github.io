            . I am a Bow-street patrol. I took the prisoner in Surrey, about half past nine o'clock, on the morning of the 3rd of September, with this writing-desk; I asked him how he got it; he said a friend gave it him to sell - I asked where he lived; he said in some back street in Westminster - I took him to the watch-house, and found a bunch of keys and a brush in his pockets, and in his hat a number of papers and receipts.

            . I live in St. James's-place, St. James's-street


. This is my property; I presume it was taken from my parlour; I had seen it the day before, to the best of my knowledge - the door is not open, except when the servant is cleaning the passage.
Prisoner's Defence. It was given me to sell.

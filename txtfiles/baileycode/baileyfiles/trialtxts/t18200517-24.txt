            . I live in Northumberland-street, Marylebone


. On Monday evening last, I was sitting in my parlour, and saw the prisoner behind the counter with the till in his hand. He went out with his hat over it, and as he jumped over a basket he threw the till down. I followed him - the people stopped him and gave him to me without my losing sight of him. The till contained 13 s. in silver, and 5 s. in copper - he threw it down and some of the money fell out.
(Till produced and sworn to.)

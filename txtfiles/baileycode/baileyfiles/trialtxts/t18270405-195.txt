MARY RICHARDSON. I am single, and live in Parsley-court, Islington


; these things were in my box in a room on the first floor - I had locked the box on the morning of the 21st of February, and four days afterwards missed them; the prisoner lodged in the house, and I accused him of it, and told him I should find it out if he did nottell me - he then threw the duplicate at me; I shewed my box to the officer.

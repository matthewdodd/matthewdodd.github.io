Robert Johnston. My Moather-in-Law is an and Woman, and lik your Loardship, and I went with her tull Bellinsgat to see her tack Water for Datford. I drank a Mug of Ale at Bellinsgat, and saw came back tull Wastminster, and then it was 11 a Clock at Night. I caud in at 
               
                  William 
                  Taylor 
               



            's Hoose at Charing-Cross




 for a hauporth of Snuff. Will ye tack a Dram, Sir, says Taylor? I donna care an I do, Sir, says I, for I am a lattle out of Oarder. And what shall it be, Sir? says he; Why e'en what ye will your sell, Sir, says I, and so he fell'd me out a Glass of Rum. And what is to pay now, Sir? says I; Not a Farthing, Sir, says he, for I taud ye I wad give ye a Dram. Then it shanna go bare-ars'd, Sir, says I, Let us have a Quartern of something that you like best; I think, Sir, says he, that a Dram of Anniseed is as bealing as any thing; then let it be Anniseed, sir, says I. And so I went into a lattle back Place where the Soldiers leave the Arms, and 
               
                  Hannah 
                  Wallis 
               



            , the Prasoner at the Bare, came and sat on the Table by me. Now, Sir, says she, Wanno ye give me a Drom? No, says I, I have just now tacken one. Well, Sir, says she, if you canno drink your sell, I can. And then Taylor came with the Anuiseed, he fill'd a Glass and drank to me, and sat the rest upon the Table, and went away again to some Customers in the Shop. Then I tuck out my Box to tack a pickle of snuff, and put it intull my Pocket again, and she see where it was; and while I reach'd over the Table to fell a Glass, she packt it out of my Pocket.
Court. Did you see her take it?
Johnston. No, my Loard, I donna see her tack it, but she want awa prasently, and I mist it the Minute she was gone. And I caw'd out to Taylor, and he run after her, but when he came back, she said, I cou no catch her, but I know her well enuh, and that Soldier 
               
                  Stephen 
                  Guy 
               



             (the other Prasoner) belongs to her, he goes for her Husband. Then says Guy to me, If you'll give me a Shilling, I'll get it you again to Morrow. That I will, Sir, says I, and I will leave the Money with Mr. Taylor, for I wou no lose the Box, because it is none of my own, and I will give you a Dram now; so I call'd for a Dram, and then says Guy, if you will go with me now, I will carry ye to her, for I ken where she is. As I was going out, Mr. Taylor said, Hauve a care of your Sword, Mr. Joanston. Donna you fear that, Sir, says I, my Sword is sause anab, and the Deel shanna get it from me. Guy carried me to a lattle place where she was, and there was an aud Woman a-Bed in the same Room; Guy can'd for a Dram, what thinks I, do they fall Drams here? Then I demanded my Box of 
               
                  Hannah 
                  Wallis 
               



            , but Guy desired me to lat it alone till to Morrow, and the aud Woman a-Bed had us not mack a Noise. I tuck her for an aud Woman, but I kenna whether she was a Woman or no, for I did no search her. While I was talking with Guy, Wallis got out of Door, but I prasantly tuck haud of her, and caud oot for the Watch, but no Body came. I carried her along the Street, and Guy follow'd us. I anks'd him what he wanted, and he sad, Sir, I donna want her from ye. Then we came to a wide place, I think ye can it Broken Cross. Aboot 3 a Clock in the Mourning, and there Guy run up against me, laid hand of my Sword, and tore it awa, so that he brock the Belt, and then he tuck to his Heels. The Woman wad a gone awa too, but I wad ne lat her ; says I, You will gang along with me, or I will trail ye by the Leg, and he daum'd to ye. And so I got her back again to Mr. Taylor's Shop, and caud him out of Bed. What is the Matter with you now, Sir? says Mr. Taylor 
               
                  Eloard
               


            , Sir, I have been roab'd of my Sword, says I; and wha has taken it from ye, sir, says he; why, that Fallow, Sir, says I, that pratanded to get my Box for me, kenye what his Name is? O give me a Pan and Ink, and I'll sat ye doon his Name, and what he may find him. So she tuck a Pan and Ink, and sat down a Name. Why, says Taylor, that's the wrong Name, his Name is Stephen Guy, and he belongs to Major Guy's Regiment, he'll mount Kensington Guard to Morrow. But hand your Peace, Maister Joanston, donna ye speak a Word of this Maiter, for an ye do, he'll gang awa, and the Deel canno catch him; he has been in Newgate already, and he wonna like to come here again; but an ye mack no Noise it is tan to one an ye donna see him come strauling this way by and bye. Then I auks'd this 
               
                  Hannah 
                  Wallis 
               



             for my Box, and she taud me an I wad give her a Shilling I wad have it again. Let me see it then, said I; No, says she, I will have the Money first. So I ding'd the Money doon upon the Goonter, and then she put her Hond intull her Bosom, and tuck out the Box. About 4 a Clock 
               
                  Stephen 
                  Guy 
               



             came by the Door, and Taylor punch'd me, and said, There's your Man! And upon that Guy tuck to his Heels, but I run after him, and tuck him hand by the Collar, and punch'd him in the Gullet, and so brote him back intull Taylor's Shop; while he was there he went a whisper'd with 
               
                  Hannah 
                  Wallis 
               



            , and by and by he pack'd a Quarrel with another Soldier, and in the mean time the Woman got off; but she was afterwards tacken up again, and the same Day she pawn'd the Sword to 
               
                  Ann 
                  Skelton 
               



            .


                  Ann 
                  Skelton 
               



            . The Prisoner, 
               
                  Hannah 
                  Guy 
               



            , pawned this S word to me.
The Prosecutor's Evidence, as far as it related to what past in Taylor's Shop, was confirmed by Taylor himself.


                  Stephen 
                  Guy 
               



            . While I was drinking a Quartern of Gin at Taylor's Shop, 
               
                  Hannah 
                  Wallis 
               



             came in; her Name is Wallis, and not Guy, for she's none of my Wife; the Prosecutor came in soon after, and took her by the Hand, and went into the back Room. When she went out of Door, and the Prosecutor said he had lost his Box, Mr. Taylor asked me if I knew her? I said, Yes; and that if the Prosecutor would go with me, I believ'd I could find her, and so I did. He took her as far as Broken-Cross, and I following them, he bid me go back, and back I went, without meddling with him.


                  Hannah 
                  Wallis 
               



            . The Prosecutor brought me to a wide Place, Angel-Court, at the End of Thieving-Lane ; Come, says he, let me have my Bargain here, since you would not let me have it in Taylor's House; and then he laid his Sword down by me in the dark, and staid with me half a Quarter of an Hour; and then I took the Sword, and putting it under the Steps of the Court, I went back with him to Taylor's Shop, and that was the first time that ever I spoke with him in Taylor's Shop, and he told me then, that he should have 140 l. for hanging 
               
                  Stephen 
                  Guy 
               



            , and then he would put a new Suit of Cloaths on my Back. Guy is none of my Husband, though I have a Husband, but Taylor has seduced me from him, and been the Ruin of me: He keeps a notorious Bandy-house. The Jury found Stephen Guy 


               guilty of Felony only
            , and 

               acquitted Hannah Wallis 'on the first Indictment, but found her guilty on the 2 d to the Val. of 10 d.

RICHARD WELLS
. I am servant to Mr. Barlow, who keeps the livery stables at Hackney lodged at the Cock public-house—the prisoner was in the tap-room, on the 20th of December, when I went to bed—my coat and boots were on a chair in my bed-room—about a quarter past seven o'clock n I got up; I doubled my coat up, and put it on my hat-box—I went up stairs again about nine o'clock, and they were gone—these are them.





THOMAS TRACEY
. I am a policeman. I met the prisoner in Cambridge heath-road on the 21st, about a quarter past nine o'clock in the morning, with the coat under his arm—I asked where he was going to take it—he said to his brother, who was a foreman in the City—I put him into the station-house, and went to his brother, and asked him whether he had a coat at his father's, whom the prisoner said he had brought it from—from what the brother said, I went back and took the prisoner before the Magistrate—he said he slept at the Cock the night before, and I found the prosecutor out.

            . I am in the employ of James Findon, he lives in High Holborn


, and is an axletree-maker
; his premises were burnt down. The men used then to come into the kitchen to put their tools - we had some suspicion of the prisoner; and on the 4th of November we had a person in the kitchen cupboard to watch him - he saw him stoop down and take five caps; I went after him and told him to come back - he said he could not come just now; I took hold of him - he dragged me about, and four or five of his fellow-labourers came up and asked what it was about; they tried to get him away - he then pulled off his hat, and said to them,
"Take this away;" but I got the hat with this property in it; he was kept - this is the property.

            . I am an officer. I have had the brass ever since; I took one man, but the prisoner got away that time.
The prisoner put in a written Defence, stating that Jones, a carpenter, had given him the brass to take to Museum-street.

            . I heard the latch of the door go, and was told somebody wanted me; I saw the prisoner at the door, and asked her if she wanted any thing; she said, she wanted a farthing's worth of small beer; but you don't think it worth your while to serve me, and was going away. I said come back, but she run away; when I came in, I missed the things; and about two hours after I took her with the things upon her.
Prisoner. She delivered them to me, I am upon my oath, and I would not speak any thing but the truth. 

               Guilty

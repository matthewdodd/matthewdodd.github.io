            . I was in Oxford-street


 about four o'clock in the evening of the 13th of December, and saw the prisoner opposite Mr. D'Oyly's shop, near the Pantheon; she put her hand inside the door-way, and put something under her shawl - went to the next door, and then came back by the shop again - I crossed over and met her - I asked her what she had got, she said nothing; I turned back her shawl and found the cotton, which I took back to the shop, where they owned it.

            . I live in Marybone, and am a lamp-lighter. On the 14th of last Month, between one and two in the day, I heard the cry of Stop thief! and saw a mob running. There was Mrs. Jones pursuing the prisoner. A gentleman catched the prisoner by the collar and held him. He was brought to Mr. Jones's house. I saw the prisoner take this watch out of his right-hand pocket and put it behind the door in a chair. (Produced in court.)

            . This is my watch. I was at work at the time when this happened: I did not know of it till the Saturday night. My wife, that could have given an account how the boy took it from where it hung, was here last night, and after she got home she miscarried, so she cannot attend.

I never had the watch, nor never saw it.

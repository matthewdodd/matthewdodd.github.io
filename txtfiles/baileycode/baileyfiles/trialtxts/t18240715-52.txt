            . I live on Ludgate-hill. On Saturday night, the 27th of June I was in St. John-street, going to Islington


, and heard somebody say,
"You are robbed;" I found my handkerchief had been taken from my pocket, and laid within a yard of me, on the pavement - I think I picked it up myself, and an officer secured the prisoner; he begged to be let off, and said he hoped I would not send him to prison for a handkerchief.

            . I saw the prisoner in St. John-street on the night of the 27th of June. I saw him put his hand into Mr. Soames's pocket; I collared him, and called Mr. Soames, who came back, and said it was his handkerchief. I took him to the office, and in going along he was nearly rescued from me.

Prisoner's Defence. I saw a man with a heavy load upon his head; he asked me to give him a lift down with it, and while I was doing so a man came up, and said I had a handkerchief, which I had not.

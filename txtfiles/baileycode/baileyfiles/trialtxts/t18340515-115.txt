            . I live with a young woman in Three Compass-court, Shadwell: several young men used to come there. On the 30th of April, in the evening, the prisoners and two other young men came there together; and these towels were brought in by some of them, but I cannot say by whom - one of them told me to pawn them, but I cannot recollect who - I pawned them the next morning for 3s. 6d. - I bought some things with part of the money - there was about 2s. 1d. left, which I gave to Flint.

Sarah Bayley. I go about the streets for my livelihood, and so does

            . She followed me, and I could not get rid of her. On the 25th of October she came into my room, and saw where I put my things. I left my window and door fast, and when I came home I found my window broke, and my door open. I went to her, and charged her with doing it. She denied it at first. At last she owned the did it, and took my gown, shift, caps and handkerchief. She gave me my gown and shift again, and said she drop'd my caps as she was carrying them away.
Charle Crowson. I heard the prisoner own she took the things mention'd, and she delivered the gown and shift to 
               
                  Sarah 
                  Bayley 
               



             in my sight, and said she had lost the four caps, and promised to pay two-shillings for them.
Q. Did she say she took the things?
Crowson. She said she had got the things, but did not say she took them.

             brought these things to my house, and Sarah Bayley came and desired to know whether she had brought these things. I said she had brought them; but I did not know she had stole them.

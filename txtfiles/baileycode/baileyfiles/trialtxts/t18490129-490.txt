Governor and company of the Bank of England.


MESSRS. CLARKSON
and
SIR J. BAYLEY
conducted the Prosecution.






RICHARD RIDLER
. I keep the Duke of York, in Regent-street, Westminster. On 14th Dec., about three o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner, who

I knew by sight, came to my house with another man, who I did not know—the prisoner called for a glass of rum and water, I served him—he handed to me this 5l.-note (produced)—I looked at it, and brought him a pen and ink, and requested him to indorse it—he wrote on it, "Wm. Jones, No. 10, Regent-gardens, Westminster"—he said, "You know me, I am a neighbour of yours"—I then gave him the change, 4l. 19s.6d.—he returned the note to me, and I put it into my cash-box—in two days I paid it away to Mr. Gamble, who brought it back to me on the following Wednesday, 20th Dec, in the state it is now, stamped "Forged"—I then went to Jones's house—I saw him, and asked him if I did not change a note for him the week before—he said, "Yes"—I asked if he was aware it was a forgery—he seemed agitated, and said he was not—I told him it was, and he must come with me to my house, which he did—I showed him the note, and he acknowledged that it was his writing on the back of it—I asked him if he knew who he had taken it of—he said at first that he took it at Chester—he afterwards said he took it in Westminster; he did not say from whom—I told him he must be aware who he took it from—he said he could bring the person, but did not know his name—I said I dare say he was not in possession of so much money but what he knew who he took it of—he said he would find the person, and I allowed him to leave me for that purpose—he said if he had the note it would facilitate his bringing the party to me—I told him I did not think it was necessary—he seemed very much agitated—he was to return to me in the evening, about five—he did not return, and I went to his house, and found he had not been home—I went again, about seven, and did not find him then—I went again about mid-day next day, and found he had not been home all night—I then gave information to the police, and he was arrested on Saturday, the 23d.

Cross-examined by
MR. BALLANTINE. Q. He appeared agitated when you told him it was a forgery? A, Yes—his sister opened the door to me—he came down to me immediately—he told me he had been working at Chester—I do not recollect that he said he took the note from a man with whom he had been working at Chester: I did not understand him to say so—it was after he said he had taken it at Westminster that he said he would find the man—I only knew him by sight—when he left I said, "Either bring me the money or the man."

MR. CLARKSON. Q. Are you sure he said he had taken it at Chester first? A. Yes—the name of "John Jones, Esq., May Fair," is on the top of the note—I put "14th Dec, 1848," on the face of it, before I parted with it.





THOMAS HOLMMAN
. I am potman at the Princess Royal, Warwick-street, Piccadilly, which is about a quarter of a mile from the Duke of York. I know the prisoner by sight—he and his companions have frequently been in the habit of using our house—I remember a day on which there was a row at an eating-house, and the prisoner and some others were taken into custody—I had seen the prisoners at the tap of our bouse about six o'clock in the evening, before that row took place—they all got talking together—I heard the prisoner make an observation that he had either been and done or copped a fiver—I did not know what that meant—his companions asked him if he was going to stand anything to drink—he did not, but went away—I afterwards saw an account in the newspaper of the prisoner's examination, in conesquence of which I went to the police-office.

Cross-examined. Q. When did you give information of this to anybody? A. Last Sunday night three weeks—that was after the prisoner was committed—I first communicated it to some young men who were in the tap-room when I read the paper—the name of one of them was Thomas Ivers—I did not tell

any one in particular—I spoke it openly in the room whilst we were talking about it—I did not know the prisoner's name before I saw it in the paper—when I read it in the paper I asked those present if that was the person, and they said "Yes"—they knew that was the person—they were not the persons to whom he said he had copped, or done, a fiver—Ryley and Brooker were present when he said that—Brooker, for one, asked him to stand something to drink—he is a young man living in the neighbourhood, a grainer by trade, and a customer at times—Ryley is a customer now and then; the others have not been lately—I did not understand the meaning of copping a fiver—I am quite certain that was the word he used—I never heard it before, to my knowledge—the words were, "I have copped, or done, a fiver"—he used both words, "copped or done"—I have not since ascertained or inquired of anybody what that meant; I have no notion now—I have never before had anything to do with a case of a fiver, or a tenner, or anything of the kind—the prisoner said it publicly, so that anybody might hear him—I did not go to any person or constable to give information—Inspector Cummings came to me, and I told him what I have told to-day—I merely told him what the words were—I saw him again on the following Monday—he subpœnaed me—I did not see Rodwell till I came here.





HENRY WRIGHT
 (policeman). I know the prisoner—I took him and his brother on the night of 14th Dec., for creating a disturbance and breaking a basin at a soup-shop—they were discharged next day—in consequence of information, on Wednesday, the 20th, I went to the prisoner's house, and waited about there all night in plain clothes—he did not come home all night—on Saturday morning, the 23d, about half-past eleven, I met him in the New Cut, Lambeth—I apprehended him, and told him I took him for Mr. Ridler's case—he said he did not know it was a bad one—I asked him, who the man was who was with him when be passed the note—he said, "Oh, that does not matter who he is; he is off into the country, and he did not know anything about it"—he afterwards told me he had taken the note of a man he used to work with; he did not know his name, or where be lived—I searched him, and found 13s. 11 1/2 d. on him.

Cross-examined. Q. Were you examined before the Magistrate? A. Yes, twice—I was examined on the first occasion, and then requested to be examined again, to add something to my deposition—this is my signature to the deposition—(The witness's deposition being read did not contain the statement that the man had gone off into the country, and knew nothing about it)—I had no reason for withholding that—I might have forgotten it at the time.





WILLIAM CUMMING
 (police-inspector, B.) On the evening of 20th Dec. I was sent for by Mr. Ridler, and accompanied him to No. 10, Regent-gardens—I remained near the door—in consequence of what I learned, I put Wright to watch the house—I had been to several public-houses in the neighbourhood to look after him—he was not apprehended till Saturday, the 23d—Mr. Ridler gave me the 5l.-note—I went to May Fair, and made strict inquiries after a person named John Jones—I could not find any such person—I know Ryley, he is a bricklayer, be is very seldom in employment—I do not know Iver or Brooker.

Cross-examined. Q. Did you go to Holman's? A. Yes, from information from Mr. Ridler—I understand copped is a slang word, which meant passing a note, shilling, or any article.





GEORGE RODWELL
 (policeman, B 205). On 11th Jan., I was at the Westminster police-station, on what is called the reserve duty—I was placed in the passage of the cells—there are five cells belonging to the station, and two

belonging to the police-court—I was attending on the five—the others belonged to the gaoler of the Court—the five cells are joined one to another, with open tops, with bars and wires—the prisoner was in No. 6 cell, and two females in No. 7—there were two male prisoners in No. 4, and no one in No. 5—the prisoners can hear one another talk from one cell to another, particularly when the outer door is shut, which it was on this occasion, so that all was quiet inside—they are obliged to talk rather loud to be heard—I can hear what they say if they talk loud—the females began talking, and asking what one another were in for—the prisoner said he was in for a fib—one of the females asked him what he meant by a fib—he said it was a 5l.-note in Regent-street; he had had the money and melted it—he likewise said he had been remanded three times, and he expected either to be turned up or fully'd on that day—those are cant expressions, meaning either to be discharged, or committed for trial—a man in No. 4, named Wilkie, said he was in for a bad sixpence, and he expected another one to be brought against him, but he would take a sixer for it—the prisoner said he should not mind if he got off with a sixer—that means six months' imprisonment—Wilkie asked him if he knew different parties, mentioning their names, and among them mentioned the name of Chitty—the prisoner said he knew him, and Wilkie told him he had had three months' imprisonment from Bow-street, on suspicion of being about to commit a felony—the prisoner said he was surprised, and said, "We must not talk too loud, in case we might be beard;" the females were talking rather loud—the outer door was then open.

Cross-examined. Q. What has become of Wilkie? A. He was discharged—I did not give evidence against him—I was attending to my regular duty at this time, to be there in case any of the prisoners wanted anything—they might have seen me if they had looked down the passage—I stood at the end of the passage, when the prisoner and the women were brought in—they could have seen me—I do not know that they did—I cannot say what has become of the two women—there was a good deal of talking going on—the prisoner was in a cell by himself—I had heard him speak before that some time ago, when he was brought in charged with breaking a soup-plate.

SIR J. BAYLEY. Q. When you overheard this conversation, did you know what the prisoner was charged with? A. No, not till he began the conversation.





THOMAS POYNTER
. I am a meat-salesman, at 62, Aldgate. On Saturday, 9th Dec., between eight and nine in the morning, the prisoner came and asked me the price of three legs of pork which I had for sale—I told him 4s. a stone—he left, went away a little, returned immediately, and said, "I will have those three legs of pork"—he took two, and my boy took one into the shop, to have them weighed—he appeared to be a cook's shopman—I took particular notice of him, being a stranger in the neighbourhood—he appeared to be in a great hurry—I saw no more of him—in consequence of what I afterwards heard, I went to the Westminster police-court on 4th Jan. and saw the prisoner there—he was not pointed out to me by anybody—he was along with five or six others—I recognized him immediately, but I had my doubts then—he had much more moustachios then than he has now—I did not receive the payment of the pork—the only three legs of pork sold that day were to the prisoner—my son keeps the books, and sits in the counting-house, where the people have to pay.

Cross-examined. Q. Were you examined before the Magistrate? A. Yes, and my son also—he is here—the prisoner was discharged on my case.






ROBERT WILSON
. On 9th Dec. I was in the employ of Mr. Pointer. I saw the prisoner outside the shop on that day talking with my master, who told me to take three legs of pork into the shop to the scale—I carried one leg in, and the prisoner two, to Davis the scalesman—I then went out again to the door, and did not see the pork weighed or taken away—I next saw the prisoner at the Guildhall, Westminster, when I went with Mr. Pointer—he was along with four or five more—I recognised him, and pointed him out as soon as I saw him.

Cross-examined. Q. What did you know him by? A. By his features and his under coat, which was a sort of darkish green—I have no doubt about him.





WILLIAM AUSTIN POINTER
. I am the son of Thomas Pointer, and act as clerk and cashier in his shop—I sit in a room at the side of the shop, with a window that opens into the shop—I keep the books there, and take the money or the meat after it has been weighed through the window—I have looked at my book, and on that day there is only one lot of three legs of pork—there are several lots of two, but none but that of three—the name of Scott is entered here—that is the name of the party sending the meat for sale—the scaleman calls the name out to me, and then the purchaser comes and pays me—the person gave me this 10l. note (produced) in payment—I know it by my own handwriting on it—I did not take particular notice of his dress—he had a lightish coat on—I gave him the difference, 9l. 0s. 9d.—I afterwards went to the police-station, and found the prisoner in custody—there were four or five others with him—I selected the prisoner from among them—I have a strong belief he is the person—the note was paid into the London and West-minster Bank, and afterwards was returned as a forged one.





JAMS BARTON
. I am an inspector of Bank of England notes. This 5l.-note, No. 56046, is a forged note in every respect, and this 10l.-note is also—the water-mark is forged—they are not from the same plate.

Cross-examined. Q. Are they of the same character of paper? A. Yes: only one is a little cleaner than the other—the only difference is, one is a 10l. and the other is a 5l.-note.

Witnesses for the Defence.






WILLIAM JONES
. I am the prisoner's father, and have been in the service of Claridge's Asphalte Company for ten years. The prisoner was employed under me for eleven weeks, at the Marquis of Westminster's and at Mr. Tollemache's, Peckforton-castle, in Cheshire—he went down there with me and my wife, on 19th Sept.—we left there on 9th Dec., about half-past eight in the morning, by the Parliamentary-train, and arrived at Euston-square a few minutes past seven the same night—we went home from there, and the prisoner with us—my wife was with me in the carriage, and a man named Solari, a labourer to me, and his wife.

Cross-examined by
MR. CLARKSON. Q. When did you leave the Marquis of Westminster's? A. I worked there six weeks—I left on 8th Dec., by the mail-train, at nine o'clock in the evening, and went to Beeston, which is about ten miles off—I went to my lodging at Peckforton, near the Castle, where I was at work—I lodged with a man named Hodgkinson—it is a lodging-house—my son lodged with me—there were several masons and others lodging there—I got to Beeston that evening, about ten—we had some supper there, with my wife and two little children that were there—we quitted there next morning, at half-past eight—that train did not go through to London; it changed at Crewe—I superintend the work of the Asphalte Company, and am accountable for the work when we are sent into the country on a job—I keep a list of the names of the persons I employ for the

Company—I have not got that book here—my son was dismissed by the Company, about ten months ago—I did not put him on again in a false name—I put his name "Jones Williams" on the time-bill, because I did not wish our foreman to know—I asked my employer if I should take him down to the country, and he said I could name it to the foreman, and I did not like to ask him, as he had discharged him, and I took him with me—I entered his name, "Jones Williams," as working eleven weeks in Cheshire—the agent in the country, who paid me the money, knew he was employed—I did not acquaint the Company of it, as he had been dismissed for about ten months—during that time he had been working in different employments; plastering, and so on—I am a plasterer myself—he worked at that, and white-washing, or anything he could get, in different places; I cannot state where, because I was in the country, and he was in London—he had been working in the Bastenne Company five or six years—I have not an account of where he was employed, but he worked for a gentleman at Staines some time—I offered Mr. Ridler 1l. to give up the 5l.-note; then 2l.; and then 2l. 10s.—he would not take it; he said the prisoner was taken—I am not always at home; my work lies away from home, in different parts of London—I cannot tell where I was working from the 9th to 23d Dec.—I had a job on the railroad at Vauxhall somewhere about that time, and at the Queen's Palace—those were the only two jobs I had since I returned to town—I was at work on the railroad the week before Christmas—my son was at home on 20th Dec.—the police-officer and Mr. Ridler did not come to inquire for him in the evening—they never came while I was at home—I slept at home every night—I cannot say whether my son slept at home on the nights of the 20th, 21st, and 22nd—he was away from home, but I do not recollect what nights—he might have been away two nights—I do not know where he was—he received a guinea a-week wages at Cheshire—I am certain of that—I have never said it was 12s.—I never saw him with a 5l.-note in his possesion—he did not live with me at Chester, but his mother washed and did for him—he did lodge with me at the other job, at Beeston—that job is not yet finished, but I left on the Friday, with Mr. Lawrence, the superintendent of the work—I went to Chester with him, to receive my money, and he paid me on the Friday night—I was paid up to the Saturday night, and my son too—I never told Mr. Ridler my son could not have so much money as a 5l-note; I said nothing at all about it.

MR. BALLANTINE. Q. When you offered Ridler the money, was your son in custody? A. Not when I first offered it him—I found the note had been changed by my son, and I said I would pay Mr. Ridler the money—I said I would pay him 1l. a month, and he said he was very sorry he did not keep him when he had got him—the foreman said he discharged my son for being idle; there was no charge affecting his honesty—he was twenty last June.





MARIA JONES
. I am the prisoner's mother. I accompanied him and my husband to Cheshire—we left London to go there on 19th Sept.—we left Beeston on 9th Dec.—Mr. and Mrs. Solari, my husband, and son, were with me—we came up to town together, and arrived a little after seven o'clock—we came by the ld. a mile train—my two children, one seven and the other ten, came with us.





LOUIS SOLARI
. I am an Italian. I went into Cheshire with Jones on 19th Sept.—I came back on 9th Dec., the Saturday fortnight before Christmas, with Jones, his wife, my wife, and the prisoner—I have known Jones nearly eight years—his little boy and girl were with us.

Cross-examined. Q. When did you leave Chester? A. About three

months ago—I did not come from there to London—I left Beeston with Jones, his wife, son, and children.

MR. BALLANTINE. Q. How many jobs had you? A. Three—on 8th Dec. I was at Peckforton-castle—Jones went to Chester to finish a little job—I was at Beeston on the Friday evening; that is a mile, or a mile and a half, from Peckforton.





SARAH SOLARI
. I am the wife of last witness—I was down in Cheshire. We left Beeston-station at half-past eight o'clock, on the morning of 9th Dec.—my husband, Mr. Jones, his wife, son, and the little boy and girl, were with us—we got to town about seven, or a little after.

Cross-examined by
SIR J. BAYLEY. Q. What makes you recollect it was 9th Dec. you came to town? A. Because it was the Saturday fortnight before Christmas—I believe that was 9th Dec.—we had been five weeks at Beeston, and five weeks in Chester—we left Chester five weeks before 9th Dec.
(James Duke, a journeyman-plasterer; Henry Coleman, a plasterer; Thomas Burt, a tailor; and Edward Gould, a chandler, of Douglas-street, Westminster, gave the prisoner a good character.)

Transported for Seven Years.

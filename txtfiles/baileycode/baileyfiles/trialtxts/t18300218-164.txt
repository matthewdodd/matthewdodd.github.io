               stealing, on the 8th of February
, 1 handkerchief, value 3s., the goods of a person unknown, from his person
            .
DANIEL FORRESTER. I am a City officer. On the 8th of February I saw the two prisoners in the Poultry


, about twelve o'clock - they crossed and followed a gentleman towards St. Paul's; they then returned, and followed another gentleman. who had a handkerchief partly out of his pocket - when they came near Mr. Debatt's shop they closed upon him; I seized them, and found this handkerchief on Helston - I took the gentleman to the Mansion-house; he gave the name of Mayer, No. 13, Birchin-lane -I asked him to come, but he did not; I went to that address, but the gentleman had gone away - the prisoners were close together; one must have seen what the other did - Helston had it in his apron.
Thomas put in a written defence, stating that he met Helston in a crowd, caused by a coach having broken down - that they walked together, when two men passed them and threw the handkerchief at their feet.
DANIEL FORRESTER. No one could have done it but them - there was no broken down coach there.

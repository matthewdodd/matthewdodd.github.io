            . I am single
, and live in Lower Bedford-place, Bloomsbury. On the Sunday, 12th of May, at half-past ten o'clock in the morning, I was going down Hanway-street


, towards Oxford-street, on my way to church - I saw the prisoner on the opposite side of the way; he ran over as if to run against me; I thought I should prevent it by stepping forward, but he made a sudden spring at me, and I received a violent blow, I could hardly speak; as soon as I recovered myself, I saw the prisoner running from me - he was caught by a young woman who held him till I came up to him; I then saw him throw my watch from him; the glass was broken and the watch stopped - it had been suspended to my neck by a chain, which had been broken by a sudden snatch - this is the watch.

            . I was in Hanway-street. I saw the prisoner running, he had got a good way from the lady, and I stopped him; he had this watch in his hand, and threw it down as the lady was coming up - she picked the watch up, and I held the prisoner till the officer came and took him.

Prisoner. Have mercy upon me this time.

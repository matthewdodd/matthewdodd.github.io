            . I live two doors form Mr. Bowyer's shop. On the 15th of August I saw the prisoner and another person come to the shop, and take out a sieve of apples - I told Mr. Bowyers, and he followed; I had lost sight of the prisoner, but he was brought back within ten minutes - I know he is the person.

            . I live in Ratcliffe-row, Bath-street


, and am a green-grocer
. I was informed of this circumstance, and the prisoner was pointed out to me - he ran up Bath-street, and I took him; he had nothing then - this basket was given to me in two or three minutes; I had not seen it thrown away - I saw it safe about twenty mintues before; the prisoner was a stranger to me.

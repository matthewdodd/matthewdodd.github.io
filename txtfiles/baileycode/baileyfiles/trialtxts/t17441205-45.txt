             is my apprentice
 she is about fourteen years of age. On the 31st of October I came down sooner than ordinary; she was up before me, and gone out: I saw the shutters down, (which are very heavy;) I was very much surprised; I called her, and went out, but could not see her. I spoke to my housekeeper, and told her, I had missed some candlesticks, which I put in my self at night, and which were chained to some others upon a table; she said, it was no strange thing. Some time after my apprentice came in; I asked her what became of such things, she said, if I would not hurt her, she would tell me what she had taken; I told her, I would not hurt her, and she told me: I asked her, who was concerned with her, she said, Black Moll, [the other Prisoner: she belongs to a person who sells fruit in the market.] The person she sold the things to one 
               
                  Frances 
                  Nevit 
               



            , facing White-Lion yard in Bishopsgate street : she said, she sold the copper drinking pot for a shilling; the copper coffee pot for eight pence, and three candlesticks for a shilling. Another time she sold some old brass for six-pence, (Black Moll went with her to sell the things,) and she gave another person they call Good Sense three pence of the money. I got a search warrant, and found some of the brass candlesticks in Nevil's shop; I took up Mary Williams in Duke's place, and she confessed she went with my girl to Nevil's to sell the things, and had part of the money; and that she waited in the alley, and bid my girl take the things: she said she had 8 d. out of the first shilling, that the pot was sold for, and six-pence out of the next 8 d. the remainder my girl had.

                  White 
               



             made a voluntary confession before the Justice; which was reduced into writing, wherein she acknowledged the stealingthese things, and that they were sold to 
               
                  Frances 
                  Nevil 
               



            , next door to the King and Queen in Bishopsgate street for 2 s. 8 d.
The Constable said, that Williams owned she was with

            . The Prosecutor used all the means he could to make me confess, and said, if I was afraid of taking a false oath, I was very strict; for I had better hang an hundred persons than myself, and desired I would confess; and because I would not turn evidence, he said I should be tried for it myself.

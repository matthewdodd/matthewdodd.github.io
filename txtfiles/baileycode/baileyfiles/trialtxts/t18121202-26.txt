            . Q. You are the wife of the last witness - A. Yes. On Friday evening, the 20th of November, the prisoner came between the hours of six and seven. I was not then in the shop, but I was presently after. I saw my sister in conversation with the prisoner. My sister asked me if I had a pounds worth of change. The prisoner, at the same time, said, he should be exceedingly obliged to me if I had got change. I looked, and I had only two-three shilling bank tokens, and four shillings, in silver, and one of the shillings I can swear to. The prisoner then tendered a ten-pound note. I could not give him change for the note, but said if he would leave the note with me, I would send the remainder of the change, by the man, in the morning. He rather hesitated, and said, he would send the servant girl with a one-pound note, saying, he should want a half quartern loaf. He afterwards seemed as though he recollected himself, and said, I will take a quartern loaf with me. He also took ten shillings in copper, to make up the money one pound. I then asked him again for the ten-pound note. The prisoner replied, I am very well known to Mr. Stacey, and was he at home he would not doubt a moment. He also said, he lived in Godliman-street, and should be a great customer to my husband. He was then retiring from the shop; I again asked for the ten-pound note, not knowing the prisoner. He hesitated a few seconds, and said, I will leave this parcel with you, Mrs.Stacey, which is more than double the value of what I have taken away. The prisoner then quitted the shop, having laid the parcel on the desk. He quitted the shop in an instant. I immediately went to a neighbour.
Q. Did you open the parcel - A. No, I did not. I informed the neighbour what had transpired, and begged he would trace out the offender.
Q. You desired he would take him into custody - A. Yes. He had not proceeded more than fifty yards, when we saw the prisoner coming out of another shop. Me and my neighbour were both together. When we got near, he got close up to the side of the wall, as though wishing not to be seen. We were on the dark side of the way. I then said, that is the man, and the prisoner ran away. He had not run above a dozen, or ten yards, before he was overtaken by my friend. He had then a quartern loaf in his hand. A constable was called, and he was given in charge. That is all I know.
Mr. Alley. The prisoner was a stranger to you, I understand - A. Yes, a perfect stranger.
Q. He wanted change of this ten-pound note, you were not willing to give it - A. I had it not to give.
Q. He wanted a loaf; he took a loaf, and he was to send you a one pound note - A. He had both the change and the loaf.
Q. He told you a lie, and said, that he lived in Godliman-street - A. Yes, he did.

Q. 
            Relying upon that statement you gave him the loaf - A. Yes.
Q. You expected that he would act as an honest man, and send you the one-pound note - A. He promised to do so. I wished him to leave the ten-pound with me, and the moment he went out of my shop I went to my friend. I went to the door to pursue him. He shut the door after him, and went away. I desired him not to leave the shop with my money. I gave him credit for the loaf, not for the money. He left the shop without my consent.
Q. I ask you upon your oath, did you or your sister make any effort to stop him - A. He was nearest the door. I had no opportunity.

            . I live at No. 1, Old Fish-street-hill, Doctors Commons, within two doors of Mr. Stacey. On Friday evening, the 20th of November, between the hours of six and seven, Mrs. Stacey came to my door, and called out. I was at that time writing in my accompting-house. I came forward. She acquainted me that she suspected that she had been robbed, and that the person had left the house. She requested me to assist her in finding the man. She described his person, a short man, with a bundle. I immediately accompanied her, she directed me the way the man went. I went up the Old Change; there I observed a man coming out of the house of Mr. Russell, a stationer. From the description I had received I suspected him to be the person. I immediately turned to Mrs. Stacey, and asked her the question. She replied, that she had no doubt of it. She had asked the moment before a passenger whether he had met a person of that description. Levy was at that time in hearing, and immediately upon the words having passed, he then gained a few paces of us. He throw the coppers on the ground, in the street, he threw the best part of the copper in the street, and ran away. I was then convinced he was the prisoner. I pursued him and gave the cry of, stop thief. After running some small distance I came up to the prisoner, and collared him. He immediately asked me what I wanted with him. I told him he was the person I wanted; I would tell him presently. He seemed inclined to make some little resistance. I told him it was of no use to do that with me; he had got into the wrong hands for that fun. He then again wished to know what I wanted with him. I told he should go back with me; and as I took him back, I met Mrs. Stacey coming after me. I then turned his face to the light, and asked her if that really was the person. She said it was; she would swear to him. I told her it was all right, I would take care of him; and after stepping a few paces the constable met us, and assisted me. We then took him back to the house of Mr. Russell, and after getting him in. I picked up some of the copper, about seven shillings or eight shillings and ten-pence. The constable picked up some in the street. I was present when he was searched: from his person was taken to the amount of twenty-four pound in notes, two-three shilling tokens, and four shillings, and three pieces of course muslin, bearing similitude to that parcel left with Mrs. Stacey. There was also taken from his person a pedlar's license, a gold seal and chain, but no watch, that having been sowed to the waistband of his breeches. One of the shillings taken from his person is a remarkable shilling.
ELIZABETH DEER. I am sister to Mrs. Stacey. On Friday, the 20th of November, between the hours of six and seven, the prisoner came in, and desired the man to call the next day, No. 21, Godliman-street, to leave some bread. I asked him, what bread he should want. He said two quarterns and a half; desiring me at the same sime to inform the man that he was never to leave the bread without having the money. I asked him his name. The prisoner gave me the name of Simpson. I asked him if we should send any that evening. He answered, that he was not certain that he wanted any; if he did he would send the girl for it. I took down his address. Nothing more transpired. He then left the shop, and shut the door. I only was present. He presently returned, to ask if I could oblige him with some change. Mrs. Stacey was then entering the shop. This is the first of her seeing the prisoner. I asked her, if she had a pounds worth of change, or silver, or something to that effect,
Q. Did he ask for change of a ten-pound note - A. I believe he asked if we could oblige him with some change. I put the question, supposing it to be a one-pound note, understanding that he wanted silver for it. I asked Mrs. Stacey. Mrs. Stacey said she did not know that she had so much silver. Mrs. Stacey came into the parlour, and he followed her. On looking, she had only ten shillings. He opened rather to hesitate. He afterwards took copper to make up the amount of one pound. I assisted in counting the penny-pieces, and gave the prisoner at least twelve penny-pieces. He put them in his handkerchief. On recollection, he said he would take a quarternloaf. Mrs. Stacey then went into the shop, and he followed her. He took the quartern loaf.
Q. Did he give you the one-pound note - A. No. I asked Mrs. Stacey if he had left the one pound note. I saw him lay the ten-pound note in the parlour on the table, but he held the corner. I was not near enough to see whether it was a ten-pound note, or no. I heard him ask the question, if she could change a ten-pound note, and saw more notes in his hand. I know nothing about the parcel. I remained in the parlour. I did not follow them into the shop. I was engaged with a little girl of Mrs. Stacey's. After the prisoner was gone my sister suspected she had been defrauded. She said, she would endeavour to take him. She went out after him, and did not return until he was taken in custody.
- . I am constable. I produce the halfpence that were picked up about the street, and the handkerchief which contained the loaf. This is the property that I found upon his person; twenty-four pound in notes; one ten, one two, twelve ones, thirty shillings in silver, and two shillings and four-pence farthing in copper. This was found on his person, independant of what he had in the handkerchief. There was eight shillings and ten-pence picked up in the street, besides what was in the handkerchief. The handkerchief was torn, and this is the piece of muslin I had of Mrs. Stacey; it is about three yards; and this the remarkable shilling found on the prisoner.
Prosecutor. That shilling is my property.
The prisoner left his defence to his counsel.

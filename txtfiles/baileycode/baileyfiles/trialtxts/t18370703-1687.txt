JOSEPH SMITH
. I am in the employ of Francis Rochford, of Brewer-street, Golden-square, a pawnbroker. About ten o'clock in the evening of the 17th of June, I was in the shop, and heard a pane of glass crack—I went to the door, and found the prisoner in custody of the policeman, and saw the watch taken from him—this is Mr. Rochford's—I do not know that I had noticed tit hat day—it was opposite the pane that was broken, and the book was torn.





THOMAS SCOTT
 (police-constable C 176.) On Saturday last, about ten o'clock I was on duty in Brewer-street, and the prisoner strike his right foot against the square of glass, and with his hand take something from the window—I took him, and found this watch in his right hand—in going along to the station-house he asked where I was—I said I did not know—he said if he had seen me near the place, he should not have been such a d—d fool as to have done it.

Prisoner. The persecutor has seen the watch, and cannot swear to it. Witness. I know it by own mark inside of it.




GUILTY
. Aged 20—


Transported for Seven Years.

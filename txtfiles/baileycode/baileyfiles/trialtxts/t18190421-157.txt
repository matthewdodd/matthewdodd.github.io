            . My father is office-keeper of Shadwell. On the 13th of March, about a quarter after six o'clock in the morning, I met the prisoner in the Commercial-road, heavily loaded, and asked him what he had got? he said he was moving, and the things were his own. I said I must see what they were - he put them down; the first bundle contained these hats - another had canvas, andthe other had meat in it. He said the hats belonged to his lodger's children - I secured him.

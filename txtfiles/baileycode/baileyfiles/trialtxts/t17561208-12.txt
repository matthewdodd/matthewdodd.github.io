            . On the 30th of Oct. last, between 1 and 2 o'clock, I was at Guildhall


; I felt a hand in my pocket, turn'd about and saw it was the woman at the bar, I felt and missed my handkerchief, and charg'd her with it, she said she had not got it; at last I perceiv'd it under her arm. I took her before my Lord mayor, who examin'd her, and sent her to the Poultry Compter.
Prisoner's Defence.
I never was near that man, I pick'd the handkerchief from off the ground.

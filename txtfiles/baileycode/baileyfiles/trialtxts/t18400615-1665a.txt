SOPHIA GOUTHIER.
I am single. On the 5th of June, I was in Regent-street—about a quarter before four o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came up to me and took this bag from my arm—it contained this handkerchief—the policeman saw the prisoner take it.





BENJAMIN ROUND
(police-constable C149.) I saw the prisoner take this bag from the prosecutrix's arm—he had come to me before and told me he meant to do something to have himself taken into custody—I cautioned him against it, and told him he would find imprisonment or transportation different to what he expected—he went on before me and took this.

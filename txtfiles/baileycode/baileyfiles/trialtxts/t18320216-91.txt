            . I live at Richmond, in Surrey, and am a carrier. On the 20th of January I was with my cart at the White Horse cellar, Piccadilly


; I had three hundred eggs in a flat on the foot-board of the cart - I saw the prisoner take them off the foot-board, and pursued him to the corner of Berkeley-street; I did not lose sight of him for a moment - I came up to him with the Policeman, and we took the flat from him; I had the eggs again, by order of the Magistrate - here is the flat; I can swear to it.

            . I am a Police-officer. I was at the corner of the Gloucester coffee-house - I saw the prosecutor come up and collar the prisoner with the basket of eggs on his shoulder; I took him into custody, and have had the flat ever since - the eggs were given to the prosecutor.
Prisoner. I leave it to the mercy of the Court.

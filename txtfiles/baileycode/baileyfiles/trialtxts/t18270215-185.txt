             was indicted for 


               stealing, on the 24th of January
, 1 till, value 6d.; 13 shillings, 7 sixpences, and 1 half-crown
            , the property of

            .
JOHN CARNEY. I live in Denmark-street. On the 24th of January I saw the prisoner (whom I knew before) at the top of Denmark-street


 - he kept looking at me, and walking to and fro; he then went into Evens' shop, and came out in two or three minutes; he stood at the top of Denmark-street again, then crossed, and went into the shop again, and came out with something under his coat - he went up Cannon-street-road; I went and told Evens, pointed him out, and he was taken in three or four minutes - I am positive he is the man.
FRANCIS EVENS. I am a grocer
, and live in Back-road, St. George's East. Carney pointed the prisoner out to me, between one and two o'clock; I pursued, and gave an alarm, but lost sight of him; I found him in Fogg's possession in a few minutes, with my till, which contained 19s. in all; there were some shillings among it; it was within another till in the middle of my counter.

            . I heard the cry of Stop thief! I turned round, and saw the prisoner running; I took him, and held him till Evens and Carney came, and said he was the man; as I took him back he said, "I have thrown away the till - here is all the silver - I am sorry I did it - I was in great distress."

            . I saw him throw the till away, and took it up.

             . I am a grocer
 in Gracechurch-street


. The prisoner came to my shop on the 2d of Dec. and asked for a pound of green tea for Mr. Colebrook's house-keeper. I weigh'd it, he felt in his pocket, and said he had not money enough about him, that he'd call and pay me another time, and went away.
Q. Did he take the tea with him?
Dance. He did.

Q. Does Mr. Colebrook deal with you?
Dance. No, he does not.
Q. What is the value of the tea?
Dance. It is worth 8 s. Mr. Ireland happen'd to be in my shop at the time. He went home, and in about a quarter of an hour sent his servant for me she had detected the prisoner there on such an offence. I went, had my tea delivered to me again, and the prisoner was secured.
Prisoner's Defence.
I intended to have paid for it the Tuesday following.

            . I am a coachman
; I live in Broad-yard, Brunswick-street


. I let lodgings. On the 13th of August, I lost the property mentioned in the indictment. The woman prisoner slept one night in the room on a mattress that I had in the room. She gave my wife four-pence for that night; the next night she was there again. I told her I was not agreeable to let her sleep there for the money my wife had agreed on. She stopped there that night, and brought her husband; who afterwards agreed to have the lodgings at half-a-crown a-week: in the course of half an hour I heard them both come down. I met them at the foot of the stairs. I said to them, you told me that you were going to stop all night. They made answer, they were going to fetch their bedding; they should not be long. They never returned; I lost a pair of sheets, two gowns, two shirts, two shifts, and two shawls. They took the things away on the Thursday night. We missed the things on the Saturday morning. I have never seen them since.

            . I am the wife of the last witness. The woman prisoner took the lodgings on the 13th, for two shillings a-week; and when my husband came to find that she had a husband and a child, he would not let her sleep there under half-a-crown a-week. I lost these things on the 13th of August; they were in a closet in the room that she was to take. They were locked up in the closet. This robbery was done on Thursday night, the 13th. There were no person up in the room besides them. They were both there.

            . I lodge in this house, in the middle apartment. I went home about eight o'clock. I heard somebody over head. I sent my little boy to see who it was; he came down, and the woman prisoner followed him. I told her to stop. The landlady came up. She gave the landlady a shilling earnest for the room. I heard a man up in the room.


                  MARGARET 
                  LAMBERT
               



            . I was the person that helped Mrs. Clarke to put these things in the cupboard, on the 13th of August, at night. I wanted to go up stairs to see who was in the room; my husband would not let me. I saw the man prisoner come down stairs with a bundle. I saw both the prisoners go dow stairs; and I am sure I saw the man with a bundle. The things were not missed till Saturday morning.
- I am an officer. I apprehended the man prisoner. I searched him; I found a duplicate on him, and this knife. I went and took the woman prisoner. I knew her of old. The man said, it was not him, it was his wife. The woman said, her husband did not do it, it was her.

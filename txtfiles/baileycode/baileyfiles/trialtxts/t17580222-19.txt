Andrew Seymore. I keep an oil shop at Ratcliff-cross. On the 14th of January the prisoner came and asked me if I would buy some Stockholm tar, which he said he would sell at 18 s. per barrel. I told him I would give him 18 s. per barrel. He brought three barrels in a cart. It appeared to be what they call plantation tar. I offered him 9 s. a barrel for it, in order to try him, suspecting he had stole it. I asked him how he came by it. He said a young man desired him to sell it for him. I stop'd it, and advertised it, by which means the right owner came to the knowledge of it, but I not having paid for it, the prisoner sued me for the money.
Captain Robson. There was a quantity of tar that lay in a lighter at Iron-Gate, the property of 
               
                  Christopher 
                  Kirby 
               



             and Co. Some of it being missing, upon its being advertised I went to Seymore's house and saw it; it was the same that was missing from the lighter. The prisoner was secured, and taken before justice Berry, where he confessed his taking it out of the lighter.
Q. Was the confession taken in writing?
Robson. It was [ Produced in court, and the hand-writing of the justice and prisoner proved. It was then read, in which the prisoner acknowledged he did steal it, and carry it to the house of Seymore, &c.]
Prisoner's Defence.
I bought that tar at the sign of the City of Bristol, near Iron-Gate.

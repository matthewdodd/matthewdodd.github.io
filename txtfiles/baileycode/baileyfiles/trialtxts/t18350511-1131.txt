SAMUEL POPE
. On the 5th of May, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, I was on Ludgate-hill—I felt somebody touch my pocket—I turned round, and saw the prisoner and another youth—the other ran away—I collared the prisoner, and took him into a print-shop, and said to him, "You have my handkerchief—he said, "I have not"—I said, "You have, I insist on having it"—he then took it out of his pocket, and gave it to me—I gave him into custody.
(Property produced and sworn to.)





PATRICK THOMPSON
. I am a policeman. I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office (read)—the prisoner is the boy.

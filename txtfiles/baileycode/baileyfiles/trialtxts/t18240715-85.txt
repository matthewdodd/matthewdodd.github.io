            . I am a boot-closer, and lodged in the house - on the 29th of June I saw the prisoner come out of the house with a bundle, which he took out of the bureau bedstead - he was detected by another man, who had the care of the house - he said if I told he would give me a good hiding.
GLOVER PEARSON. I am servant to Mr. Seales. I met the prisoner on the 29th of June with the bundle, and told him it was not his property, and he must go back - he said he was going to pledge it. I thought it was Mr. Seale's, because he had no property of his own - I stopped him, and gave the property to the officer.

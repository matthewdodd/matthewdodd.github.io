JOHN FINLEARN
. I saw the prisoner near Mr. Dunn's shop in Ratcliife-highway, about seven o'clock on the 4th of October—he took the hoots off tie nail at the door, and placed them under his jacket—when be got two or three doors off he took his handkerchief off his neck and wrapped them up in it—I went and gave information—he was taken the next night—I know he is the same person—I had seen him the night before.





WILLIAM WHITING
. I was going down Ratclifife-highway, and saw the prisoner standing at Mr. Dunn's door—I walked to the corner of Love-lane, and saw him take the boots from the left side of the door, and put them under his jacket—he took off his handkerchief from his neck and wrapped them in that, and went on—I had seen him the night before.





TIMOTHY CASEY

On the night of the 5th of October I was on duty in High-street, Shad well—I saw the prisoner go to several shops—I followed him to the prosecutor's door—I went up and asked where he lived—he said, "In Whitechapel," and he was a sweep—Whiting and Finlearn happened to be near, and they identified him—took him.





JOHN JOSEPH REARDON

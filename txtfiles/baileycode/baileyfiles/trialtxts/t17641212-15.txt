: the prisoner came and call'd for a pint of beer on the 23d of last month, betwixt one and two o'clock: he sat and drank till about six; there were people in the same box had been drinking out of a silver pint mug: after the prisoner was gone out, Mr. Worster told me he had carried off a silver mug, he believed: I then missed it: I went out at the door, and saw the prisoner standing still, about thirty yards from the door; I went and laid hold of him, and desired him to walk back: he made a sort of a scuffle to get off, and the mug dropt from under his coat. (Produced and deposed to).

I went to this house to meet a friend, and was intoxicated in liquor; I did not think of defrauding the gentleman, no more than the farthest man in the world. I am a jeweller, and came from Birmingham.

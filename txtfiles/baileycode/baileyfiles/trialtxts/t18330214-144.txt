JOSEPH WINNEY GULL. I live in Old Broad-street. About seven o'clock in the evening, on the 4th of February, I was in Aldgate


; I felt a pull at my pocket - I turned instantly, and saw the prisoner, and a boy about seven or eight years old - the prisoner threw my handkerchief to the younger boy, but it fell down - I took them both; I called my friend back, who took the prisoner - the younger one cried very much, and I let him go; I am sure the prisoner had the handkerchief.

DANIEL RUTTER
 was again indicted

 for embezzlement.






THOMAS MANSELL
. I am a general salesman, and live in New-row, St. Giles's. I knew the prisoner as the prosecutor's town traveller—I paid him 10s. 6d. on the 13th of July on their account—it was the balance of an account of 1l. 10s. 6d.—I had paid the rest previously in two other sums—I have the invoice—he signed the receipt—(read.)





JAMES JOHN RICHARDS
. I am a dealer in china and glass, and live in East-street, Greenwich. On the 13th of June I paid the prisoner 1l. 15s. 6d. on account of the prosecutors—I have the bill—he signed it, as having received the money—(read.)

Cross-examined by
MR. BODKIN. Q. You paid it yourself did you? A. Yes—it was the balance of a larger account.





ISAAC PLATTS
. I am a pawnbroker, and live in Upper York-street, New-road. I produce an invoice of the prosecutor's—I paid 1l. 3s. to the prisoner on the 15th of June on their account, and took an acknowledgment on the invoice—I also paid him 9s., but I understood the prosecutor knew nothing of that sum—(receipt read.)





LOUIS BECK
. The prisoner has never accounted to me for Mansell's 10s. 6d., or Richards's 1l. 15s. 6d., nor 1l. 3s. from Platts—I am in partnership with my mother, Sarah Beck—the prisoner was employed as a traveller, to receive money for us—I have his book here.

Cross-examined. Q. Here are a good many entries of cash received in your book after these dates, are any of them of money paid by the prisoner after the 21st of July? A. Not by the prisoner—the 21st of July is the last time he paid me any money—he had 1l. a-week—I always paid him

on Saturday night—he deducted his commission as he received the money—he was in the habit of doing that—he might let it run for a week, but never longer.




GUILTY
.—Aged 23.—


Transported for Fourteen Years.

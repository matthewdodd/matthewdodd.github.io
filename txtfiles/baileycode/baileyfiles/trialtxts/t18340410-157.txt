             (police-constable G 200). I saw the prisoner on the morning of the 27th of March, near Merlin's-place, with these two sashes - I stopped him and asked where he was going with them - he said to Laystall-street - that he was a carpenter, and they were his own property - he was half a mile from Mr. Newman's.
THOMAS NEWMAN. I live at No. 18, Elizabeth-terrace Islington. I have a house at No. 4, Russell-place, Sermon-lane


, in the parish of St. James, Clerkenwell


 - I let it out in separate tenements - the prisoner hired a room there on the 25th of March - these sashes belonged to that house - I swear to them - I went down on the Friday morning and missed them.

            . I live in Russell-place, Sermon-lane. I had the key of the room - I let it to the prisoner on the evening of the 26th of March - the sashes were then all safe.(The prisoner pleaded poverty.)

WILLIAM WEBB
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the l
7th of May, 1 pair of shoes, value 5s.; 1 handkerchief, value 1s.; 2 watchguards, value 6d.; 2 shillings, and 2 pence; the property of 



William Merritt.






WILLIAM MERRITT
. I live at Deptford, the prisoner lodged in the same house for a few days, and slept in the same room with me. On Whit Tuesday morning I missed the things and money stated, from my pocket in the bed-room—they were my own—I have no father—the prisoner was the first that went out that morning—he knew I had some money, for he had seen me give change with it—this watch-chain now produced is mine—I know it by a join in the middle—I kept it in my pocket in the bed-room.


Prisoner. He bought that chain on Whit Sunday for a halfpenny, and a thrush-bird for 4d.; he gave me the chain to look at; while I was looking at it the parlour bell rang, and he went away, leaving the chain with me. Witness. I did not, for I had it in my pocket next morning.





ROBERT HORNSBY
. I am a constable at Seen, near Newbury, in Berkshire. On the 25th of May I apprehended the prisoner at Newbury, on another charge—in searching him I found in his pocket, among other things, this chain—I said, "Halloo! what do you call this?"—he said, "Oh, it is nothing but an old chain that I found on the road"—he said nothing about Merritt having given it to him.

Prisoner's Defence. I forgot that at the time. Three men lodged in the third floor besides me. I got up in the morning, and the landlady let me out. I had no bundle, or anything in my hand.




GUILTY
. Aged 25.—



Transported for Seven Years.

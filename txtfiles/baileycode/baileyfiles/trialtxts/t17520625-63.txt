            . I live in Bishopsgate-street




, and am a hosier
. On Wednesday the 17th of this instant I lost seven pair of white silk stockings, out of my shop; I had been out for about half an hour, and about two o'clock, when I returned, I missed them. I enquired for them. My wife described a woman and a girl that had been in the shop so well, that I thought I could find them; I went to Billingsgate, and from thence to Rag-Fair, and applied to all the pawn-brokers I could think think of; the next day a pawn-broker from Hounsditch sent for me, there I found one pair of stockings and Margaret Bush. I sent for a constable and took her into custody, and had her before my lord mayor ; I knew she was neither of the persons that my wife described, so I let her go about her business, and sent my girl to see-which way she went, she followed her and returned and said she saw her over the bridge, and go into Ax and Bottle-yard in the Borough. I went over and sat in a publick house over-against that house, where she went into, but could not meet with her; the next morning. I went again and got intelligence where to find 
               
                  Sarah 
                  Stear 
               



            ; and the next morning I took the three prisoners, the evidence Stear, old and young Bush, and the two husbands in King-street.
Q. Did you find any more of your stockings?
Lunn. No, I did not.

                  Lunn 
               



            . I am wife to the prosecutor; on the 17th instant 
               
                  Martha 
                  Bush 
               



             and a girl with her, came into my shop for a pair of men's worsted stockings; I shewed her a pair, and told her the price was 2 s. 6 d. she bid me 2 s. after that she bid me a halfpenny more; I bated a penny; she went out of the shop. After that my husband came in and asked for these stockings, and they were gone; there had been nobody there in the time but those two persons.
Q. Where did they lie?
M. Lunn. They lay in the window, and when I came into the shop to her she was just near them.
Q. from the prisoner. How was I dressed?
M. Lunn. The prisoner had a brown gown on, and a hat and cloak.
Q. How long was she in the shop?

M. Lunn. She was in the shop about a quarter of an hour.
Q. When did you see the prisoner again ?
M. Lunn. I saw her on the Tuesday following.

             brought me these stockings ( holding a pair in his hand) the 18th of this month; I stopped her and them too; she told me she brought them from a prisoner in the King's-Bench.

             now live together in White-street; the father and mother in Kent-street Surry. One day Elizabeth said to Martha and me, in the presence of her husband, there is a great hosier's shop facing Great St. Helen's; there is a great number of stockings by the side of the door; then Martha agreed to go; about ten in the morning we 3 set out. I don't know the day of the month, it was on a Wednesday ; we lost Elizabeth before we got there, but Martha and I went to the shop; she said to me I should stay at the door; she went in and asked for a pair of men's stockings; there was a little girl in the shop, who went up stairs to call the gentlewoman, in which time 
               
                  Martha 
                  Bush 
               



             took up these seven pair of silk stockings from off the compter near the window, and put them under her cloak, and kept them under her arm till she came out; after which she went into an alehouse at the end of Bishopsgate-street and called for a pint of beer; then she said, I have got some stockings, and took them from under her cloak, they were all tied together, and the feet of them were dirty; she untied them and said they would fetch us two or three guineas; then she said, we'll go and look for Bett; she tied them all round her under her gown to her petticoat-strings, and coming along Fenchurch-street we met Elizabeth, and told her of them; then we went home to White-street, there was 
               
                  James 
                  Bush 
               



            , to whom she shewed them; he said we must keep them for fear they should be advertised; she met her father and told him of them, who came to see them, and said, keep them up, I and your husband will go and see if they are advertised ; we found for two or three days they were not advertised; said James, give the girl something for her own part; said Martha, suppose they should be advertised and stopped, I shall not get my money again; then she gave me 1 s. 6 d. I went out and bought this old gown that I have got on. The next day the father and mother came; said the mother, I know a good many gentlemen in the city that will buy them; she took two pair to sell. Margaret, Elizabeth, and James came on this side the water to see if they could sell them; they brought them home again ; the next day the father came; they agreed to give the father and brother something to sell them all together in the city Margaret brought one pair home again. Thomas and 
               
                  James 
                  Bush 
               



             brought eleven shillings and gave to Martha in Newington Road, which they had sold some for. Martha and Elizabeth divided it ; then Martha went to skittles and spent every farthing of it. They gave me nine-pence, I was to have had a shilling, but I owed them three-pence.

            , who offered to sell them in Fishmonger-alley last Thursday was a week. She sold them to a woman that buys and sells in Rag-Fair, I had them in my hand.

            's Defence.
That day that he says he lost the stockings I was out with a dozen and half of colliflowers; I met that girl, she said she had got a parcel of stockings; said I, did you come honestly by them? said she, will you take them and see if you can pawn them; I went to the gentleman's shop, who asked me how I came by the stockings; I said I had them of a girl by the King's-Bench. They carried me before my lord mayor; they asked me where the girl lived; I said I believed I could find her, but could not that night.

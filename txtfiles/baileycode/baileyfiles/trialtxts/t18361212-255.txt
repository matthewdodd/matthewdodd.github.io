CHARLES WAYLIN
 and 




THOMAS WILSON
 were indicted for

stealing, on the 
7th of December, 6 pair of shoes, value 7s., 4d., the goods of 



Stephen Greiner.






STEPHEN GREINER
. I live in Broad-street, Ratcliffe, and am a shoe-maker. On Wednesday evening I was in my parlour—Mary Fox came and told me something—I came out and missed six or seven pairs of list

shoes—I went out in the direction that Fox told me, but did not overtake any body—I came back, and a policeman was at my door—I told him what I had lost.





MARY ANN FOX
. I live in Queen's-court, Ratcliffe. I was going home form an errand, and saw Wilson cut the shoes down from the prosecutor's door, Waylin was looking into the cap-window at the time—when Wilson had cut the shoes, he said, "Come on"—he put them under his arm, and went down towards Butcher-row—I informed the prosecutor directly, and went after him to see if he could catch them, but he could not—the shoes were inside the door.





JAMES HENRY ANDREWS
 (police-constable K 104.) I received information, and went to a house where these boys and several others live—I found both the prisoners there—this pair of shoes were on the floor quite wet at the time, and Wilson's feet were quite wet—this other pair I took of Waylin's feet—I asked where they got them—they made no answer all—they afterwards said they found them.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

Waylin. We were coming home from work, and picked them up in Three-compass-court.

WAYLIN—


GUILTY
. Aged 18.

WILSON—


GUILTY
. Aged 19.

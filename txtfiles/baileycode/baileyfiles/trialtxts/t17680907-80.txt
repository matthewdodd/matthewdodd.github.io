            . I am a dyer
, and live in Old-street. On the 24th of August the prisoner was brought to my house by five of my men in the morning, with a piece of green tammy my property, taken from the drying-ground belonging to me in Islington fields; I had had a suspicion of the prisoner before; on the 23d of August I ordered my men to look out, to see if they could see any thing put in the same place where some had been secreted before; they came and informed me there was a piece put there; I ordered five of them to go and watch it, and see who took it; the next morning the 24th, they came and told me the prisoner was the person that came and took it away; the prisoner worked for me.

            . On the 23d of August I was in the field; the prisoner came and fetched the piece away from out of a hog-stie, where it lay hid; we pursued and took him, and found in his bag a piece of green tammy.
Prisoner's defence.
I saw it lie there, I thought it belonged to my master; I took it, and thought of taking it to my master again.

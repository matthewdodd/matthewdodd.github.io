            . I keep a publick-house
 on Turnham green


, on the tenth of December I missed a coat and waistcoat, I was informed a man had been in my house, that it was probable had taken it away in a sack, but I did not see him: the other evidence will give a farther account.


                  George 
                  Edwards 
               



            . My master's cloaths were hanging by the fire when the prisoner went into the house, and when he came out I observed he had a larger parcel with him than when he went in. When they were missing I pursued the prisoner, and found him in a return'd post-chaise, with the cloaths on, I took him and made him pull them off.
Q. Where did you take him?
Edwards. By Hyde-park Corner. [The cloaths produced and deposed to.]
Prisoner's Defence. I was very much in liquor, 

               Guilty

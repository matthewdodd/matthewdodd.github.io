2956. 




JOHN JONES
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
7th of October, one coat, value 5l., the goods of 



Peter Smith; and that he had been before convicted of felony.







WILLIAM DAWSON
. I am groom to Peter Smith, of North-bank. On the 7th of October I put a coat into the housekeeper's room—I saw it safe at ten o'clock in the morning, it was missed in the evening—this is it—it is my master's.





CHARLES ANDERSON
. I was on the coach-rank—the prisoner came and asked me what I charged to go to Westminster Abbey—I said half-a-crown—I took him in—he had this coat on—I went on a little further—I could see no policeman—I turned round in a short time, and the coat was off him—I then stopped, and said I did not like my job, I would not take him—he opened the door and jumped out—I got off and took him.

Prisoner's Defence. I met a young man with a bundle and this coat; he said, "If you will take this to Westminster Abbey I will give you 1s." I did not intend to thieve the coat, I had not a farthing.





WILLIAM LUCK
 (police-sergeant B 10.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 17.—


Transported for Seven Years.

Eliz. Hammond. I live in Kirby-street


, and keep a public house
. When I lost this money, there was no other person in the house besides the prisoner at the bar. My money was in my pocket-apron. I can swear to 20 s. at least; I had took it off, and laid it in the bar. I went backwards to get a pail of water, and when I returned, he, my apron, and money were all gone. He was taken up the same night at the George, on Saffron-hill. There were 26 s. found upon him. He confessed to me, it was my money, all but 6 d. and 3 d. in halfpence, which he said were his own.

                  Charles 
                  White 
               



             confirmed that of his confession.
Prisoner. I have nothing to say, I leave it to this honourable court.



               Guilty

            . I am foreman to Henry Peto and another, builders
, of Little Britian


. On the 6th of February I saw the prisoner going out at the gate with three deal boards on his shoulder - he had got outside the gate; he was a stranger, and had no business there. I asked where he was going with them - he said, "I am going to a job in Smithfield; "I said we had no job there; he said Mr. Bingley, who is our foreman, sent him for them, and said,"If you won't believe me, go and ask him - he has just gone into the counting-house;" I went, and Mr. Bingley had not been there; I saw the prisoner walking away - I ran and brought him back.

            . I am Mr. Peto's foreman. I do not know the prisoner, and never sent him for any boards.

            . I received him in charge with the boards.
The prisoner put in a written defence, pleading distress.

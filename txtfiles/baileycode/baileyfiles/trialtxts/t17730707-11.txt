            . I lost two sides of bacon and a sack. I met the prisoner between three and four o'clock at Shepherd's Bush; he got out of my waggon between Colnbrook


 and Newgate-market


; I missed it there; he seemed to be sweating; then he said he had been carrying a heavy bundle; he shewed us where he had left the bundle; it turned out to be a sack with two stitches of bacon, and then I secured him.
The waggoner deposed that the prisoner rode in his waggon to Hammersmith; that there he got out and had nothing with him then; that he supposed he threw it out of the tale of the waggon; and so when he got out he carried it off; he rode in the waggon and sat on the sack.

             I am a peace officer; I was sent for to the Plough; I found the prisoner with a sack and the bacon. (The bacon and the sack produced).
Prosecutor. That is the sack; there is the name of 
               
                  Edward
                   Bartholomew
               



             upon it; I borrowed the sack to bring the bacon in; I can swear to that.
Prisoner's Defence.
I got into the waggon at Colnbrook; then I got out to ease nature; I wanted the waggoner to stop; he would not stop. I was following him in order to overtake it; in my way I found this sack with two stitches of bacon.

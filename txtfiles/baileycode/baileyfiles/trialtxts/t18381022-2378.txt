JAMES DEAN
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
15th of October, 8lbs. weight of beef value 6s., the goods of 



Joseph Weston; and that he tad been before convicted of felony.






WILLIAM LARNER
. On the 15th of October, about ten minutes before eight o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner by the door of Mr. Weston, who keeps a cook-shop next door to me, with a piece of boiled beef under hit arm—suspecting he did not come honestly by it, I went and asked Mrs. Weston if she had sold him a piece of beef—she said she had not—the prisoner walked away with it—Mrs. Weston came to the door and I pointed the prisoner out to her—he threw the beef down and ran away—I hallooed "Stop thief"—my son ran after him and stopped him—he was brought back directly by the policeman—he is the man I saw throw down the beef.

Prisoner. I picked it up and was brushing the dirt off when he saw me. Witness. No, he was not.





ANN WESTON
. I am the wife of Joseph Weston—we keep a cook-shop at Chelsea. I saw the prisoner with the beef, and saw him throw it away—it weighed 8 1/2 lbs.—it was taken out of the window, where it had been on a dish—I saw it there two minutes before—I never saw the prisoner before—it was quite clean.





GEORGE HOLMES
. I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction at the Sessions House, Clerkenwell—(read)—I was a witness against him on the trial—he is the person who was tried and convicted last July—he came out of prison three weeks ago last Tuesday.




GUILTY
. Aged 20.—


Transported for Seven Years.

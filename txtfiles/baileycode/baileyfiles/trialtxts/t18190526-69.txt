            . I am a costermonger
, and live in Old Pye-street, Westminster. On Thursday, the 29th of April, about six o'clock, I turned my ass out in Lord Grosvenor's orchard, Milbank-row


 - next morning, about seven o'clock, I missed it, and saw it again on the 3d of May at White's; I am sure it is mine. The prisoners lived near me - they knew the ass was mine; Merriman has often seen me at work with it.
JAMES WHITE. I live in Kent-street, Borough, my father is a horse-boiler. On Thursday evening, between seven and eight o'clock, the prisoners brought the ass to my father, and asked him to buy it. Jones spoke - he asked 1 l. for it; my father offered him 14 s. They went away, returned in about three minutes, and both said they must have 16 s., and that he should have it; they took the money, and both said they would bring one or two more on Friday - they said they lived in Fox-buildings, Kent-street. I afterwards found it was false.
MERRIMAN'S Defence. A man on Westminster-bridge gave me 2 s. to sell it.
JONES - 

               GUILTY
            . Aged 14.
MERRIMAN - 

               GUILTY
            . Aged 14.

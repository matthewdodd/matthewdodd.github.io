            . I was sitting in a back room, and saw the shop door open. I thought there might be a child come in, and told my servant. She said, she believed she saw a butcher's dog behind the counter; and going into the shop, squalled out so, that I thought the batcher's dog had get hold of her. I saw the drawer upon the shop floor (I did not see it fall) and the Prisoner in the shop. There were 17 s. and 4 d. taken off the floor.

            . My mistress said, There is some body in the shop. I looked and saw, a little above the edge of the counter, somebody behind it. I said, I believe there is a dog in the shop. I went behind the counter, and saw the Prisoner there: I was very much frightened, and squalled out. I heard the drawer fall upon the floor, but I cannot say I saw it in the Prisoner's hand.

            . I was going upon my watch, between eight and nine o'clock, and went into Mrs. King's for a dram. As I went in, the Prisoner fell down with the drawer upon the floor; there was a great deal of money upon the floor: so I secured the Prisoner. 


               Guilty 4 s. 10 d
            .

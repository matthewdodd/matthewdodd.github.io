             was indicted for 


               breaking and entering the dwelling-house of 
                     
                        
                           George
                            Pryer
                        




                     
                  , about the hour of one in the night, on the 14th of March
, and stealing thirteen watches, in silver boxes, value 40 l. and one watch, in silver box and case, value 40 s. the property of the said George, in his dwelling-house
            . *


                  George
                   Pryer
               



            . I live in Whitechapel parish


. On the 15th of March my servant, 
               
                  John
                   Jennings
               



            , came to me about six in the morning, and told me my house had been broke open. I got up, and came down, and found my bureau and show glass, in which I left many watches when I went to bed, were open, and every thing taken away.
Q. How did they get into your house?
Pryer. They got in over the door. They had struck in a large pane of glass; some of it flew four or five yards into the passage; it seemed to have been done by one blow: there was blood upon it. I missed about forty watches. My servant told me he found the door unbolted. About a week, or ten days after, Mr. Brebrook and another man, came to my house, and told me the prisoner was taken at Rochester. I found fourteen of my watches in the prisoner's house. They are only in the inside cases. (Produced in court ). They have all my name and numbers upon them, and the Arabick characters for figures. I have the outside cases here to them. (Produced in court). The prisoner told me, if I would get him the King's pardon, he would discover the whole of what I had lost. I did not promise him that I would. I took him before Sir 
               
                  John
                   Fielding
               



            ; there he desired to be admitted evidence; Sir John made him no promise; but gave him to understand, if he would tell who was concerned in breaking the house, probably he might admit him. After we had been with Sir John, we went and searched his house, and found these watches.

            . I live with Mr. Pryer. I got up at six o'clock that morning; the maid was down before me. I went up immediately, and awaked my master.
Q. Who fastened the door over night?
Jennings. I did.
Q. Was at day-light when you came down?
Jennings. It was.

            . I am servant to the prosecutor. I came down stairs between six and seven that morning, and found the house broke open, and my master's bureau was broke open; there was a candle left in the parlour almost burnt down to the socket: that same candle I left on the dresser; it was a mould candle: I left about half of it when I went to bed (not burning).
Q. How much was left of it when you found it burning?
R. Farrel. About the length of my finger. I know the house was fast when we went to bed.

            . When the prisoner was before Justice Fielding, he wanted to be admitted evidence. The Justice said he would promise nothing. He was an old offender. He told the Justice he could produce 14 watches. Mr. Keys, Mr. Bond, and I, went with him to his house; he shewed us the drawers where they were. Soon after we were there, came Mr. Pryer and Mr Turner: we found the fourteen watches in the lower part of the chest of drawers.

            . I took the prisoner at Rochester on another occasion. I brought and lodged him in the Poultry-compter. The next morning I applied to my lord-mayor; he gave me an order, as the fact was in Middlesex, to carry the prisoner before Sir 
               
                  John
                   Fielding
               



            . He begged of Sir John to be admitted evidence; and said he would make a discovery of the watches. Sir John said, if he did discover the whole tot of Mr. Pryer's watches, (as there were about forty of them, and some of them gold ones) and the rest of the offenders, he would admit him.
Q. Did Sir John make use of the words whole tot?
Keys. I think it was to discover the whole of Mr. Pryer's watches.
Q. Has the prisoner made any discovery?
Keys. No, none at all, neither of the rest of the watches, or offenders.
Q. from prisoner. Did I not say that 
               
                  Peter
                   Graham
               



             bought them?
Keys. I do not recollect any such thing. I remember he said he had them of somebody; but I don't know he said he had them of 
               
                  Peter
                   Graham
               



            . I know Peter was in custody at that time. (See him cast for fourteen years transportation last session, No. 225.)
Q. to prosecutor. Have you any evidence here of the time of night your house was broke?
Prosecutor. I am sure it could not be broke at or after five that morning, for I lay awake from that time, and if it had been done then I must have heard it; my room comes over the passage. We found drops of blood about the passage, and they had taken an apron of the maid's to wipe the blood; it was found bloody. I suppose they cut their hands with breaking the glass.

            . I left an apron in the kitchen, and in the morning I found it very bloody.

                   Graham
               



             brought them watches to my house; and as soon as I saw the prosecutor I told him so; and that I would help him whatever lay in my power. Solomon-

             bought them of 
               
                  Peter
                   Graham
               



            . I was then very bad in bed. That Sunday I went away, I let every body know where I was going: this was the 15th of March, and I went out on the 18th.

             I went to the watchmaker, the prosecutor, to know if he would not prosecute him: he said he would have 50 l. not to find the bill.
Q. What kin is the prisoner to you?
Jacob. He is my brother-in-law.
Prosecutor. This evidence came, with two others, and desired me to make it up: I said I would make it up on no other terms that what Sir 
               
                  John
                   Fielding
               



             proposed, which I mentioned to him. My loss is near 400 l.
Mr. Turner. I was told they had taken Lyon on board a ship. I was at the finding these fourteen watches in the prisoner's house. There was one Lazarus Jacob, tried here three sessions ago. He is brother to this last evidence. The prisoner's house joins this Jacob's house in the upper part of it: you may go from out one house into the other.

            . The prosecutor wanted to have fifty guineas to make up the affair.
Prosecutor. What this man says is false.




               Guilty of stealing the watches
            . 


               T
            .
See Lazarus Jacob tried for stealing watches, to the amount of 200 l. the property of Mr. Turner, No. 55, in this Mayoralty.

RUTH BASS. I am the wife
 of James Martin Bass. On the 11th of April, a little after eleven o'clock in the evening, I was with my husband going along Ratcliff-highway


, my foot slipped, and I fell; a strange woman came up and offered to assist me, but she took my shawl off and ran away; I cannot say that it was the prisoner.
JAMES MARTIN BASS. I was behind my wife with the umbrella; she fell down, and I saw a woman come up to her - I cannot say it was the prisoner.

            . I am a watchman. I was coming along Shadwell; I saw several persons in the middle of the road; the prosecutor said "My wife has lost her shawl;" and some person said "There runs the woman" I took hold of the prisoner who was running with the shawl; I said "Give me that shawl;" I took her to the watch-house - she said "There is the shawl;" that was all that passed.(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I was not running; I was standing at the corner of Bluegate-field - a man came up and gave me the shawl, and asked me to take a walk with him - the watchman came up and I gave it to him.

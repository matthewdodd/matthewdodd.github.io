            . I am a carpenter
. I have known the prisoner twelve or fourteen years - he has occasionally worked for me. I left the articles stated in a work-shop, at No. 23, Duck-lane


 - the prisoner had been out of work a long time; he came to me, and asked for a job - as soon as he was gone I missed the rules; I went and accused him of it, and he gave me up the duplicates - I knew he was in great distress, or I do not think he would have been guilty of it.

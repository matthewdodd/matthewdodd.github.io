            . I have a house in St. Ann's lane


 that I let out in ready furnished lodgings. The prisoner had a lodging there; and the goods mentioned in the indictment were part of the furniture of that lodging: I saw her at her lodgings about a fortnight before christmas; I went there again two days after, then I found the room stripped, and the prisoner was gone. Some days after, I found her at another lodging with all the goods I lost, in her possession.
(They were produced in court, and deposed to by the prosecutor.
Prisoner's Defence.
I did not steal the goods, another of the prosecutors lodgers brought them to me, and he desired me to let them stand in my lodgings, I did not know what they were.

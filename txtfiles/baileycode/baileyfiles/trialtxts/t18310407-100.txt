            . I live in Aldersgate-street


, and have two partners - we are worsted-stuff manufacturers
. On the 23rd of March, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I was writing at a desk in the warehouse, and saw the prisoner come into the shop - a person might come into the shop and not see me: I am certain the door was shut, because it will not keep shut unless it is fastened with the latch - it is the dwelling-house of myself and partners; the prisoner took a piece of lustring off a pile, and was walking away with it - I came from the desk, and came to him; the piece was then laid against the house-loor - he stood before it and asked me for some name in the street; I took hold of him, turned him round, and the piece was behind him - I asked him about it; he denied all knowledge of it - he had removed it about a yard from the place he took it from; I took him, and sent for an officer - this is the stuff; it is mixture lustring.
Prisoner. I throw myself on the mercy of the court - my late employer has left town; he called on my prosecutors, and gave me a character.

. Charlotte Ashton came to my shop on the 14th of November, about three o'clock, and pointed out the prisoner as having taken a pair of boots from my door. I followed, and found them on him- I had seen them safe on the story post of my door, about half an hour before - he asked me to forgive him.

            . I saw the prisoner cut the boots away from the door, and put them under his arm - he walked away, in company with another boy. I went, and told Mr. Burgar, who took him with them.

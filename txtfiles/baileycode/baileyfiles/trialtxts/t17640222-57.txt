                  Culver 
               



            . On the 24th of January, coming along Ludgate-street


, I felt something at my pocket; turned about, and collar'd the prisoner, and said, you rogue, you have taken my handkerchief; he had my handkerchief in his hand, and dropped it down. I took him to a friend's house, and got a constable; he was sitting by the stairs, and by him lay all these handkerchiefs, (producing eight) which he had conveyed out of his pockets.
The prisoner said nothing in his defence; he called Mrs. Mead, a watch-spring-maker, with whom he was an apprentice, and had served between five and six years of his time; 
               
                  John 
                  Halsey 
               



            , her foreman; Jos. Fox, a perriwig-maker, and Robert Lee, a taylor, who all gave him the character of a sober lad.

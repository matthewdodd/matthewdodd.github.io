                  , from his person

JOSEPH DELL. I am clerk
 to a solicitor in Spring-gardens. On the evening of the 21st of November I was in Holborn


, near Drury-lane, about a quarter-past six o'clock; the prisoner was coming towards me - he snatched my watch, and ran off towards Drury-lane; I pursued, calling Stop thief! Mr. Gilbert followed him and collared him - the prisoner threw my watch into the road, and broke the face and the glass; some person took it up and gave it to me.


                  WILLIAM 
                  GILBERT
               



            . I am a diamond setter, and live at Knightsbridge. I heard the alarm, saw the prisoner running and stopped him; he said, I was a b-y fool; I heard something fall, and saw the watch delivered to the prosecutor.

            . I am a Police-constable. I met the prosecutor with the prisoner in custody - I took charge of him; I asked how he came to do it - he said through distress.(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner. The prosecutor said at the office, that he asked me for the watch, and now he says he had it given him.

MR. DELL. I did not ask him for it, and I did not say so at the office; I saw him throw it into the road.
Prisoner's Defence. I had been out of work three months, and was in distress.

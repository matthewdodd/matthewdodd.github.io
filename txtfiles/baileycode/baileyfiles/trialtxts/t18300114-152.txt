DANIEL GRADY. I am waiter at Mr. Want's, the Crown and Thistle, in Chandos-street


. On the 14th of December, about eight o'clock, I went out for about twenty minutes; when I returned, the bar-maid said there was some rum wanted - I took a candle and the key, and went down to the cellar: I found the hasp had been forced off the door; I went in the first cellar, but saw no one, but in the vault under the street I saw the prisoner doubled up in a corner; I put my hand on him, and said, "You d-d blackguard, I know you well," which I did, from his having been at work opposite; I saw a bottle of wine in his trousers, and said,"You are very bulky" - he then took out two more bottles of wine from his pockets; I told him to go before me out of the cellar, and when he got up, I pushed him into the yard, and called the Police-men; they searched, and said he was gone - I said, he could not get away, he must be in the next yard; the officer got over the wall and found him - I found eight more bottles in the yard, which he had put the e before.
WILLIAM LILLY WHITE. I am a Police-constable. I was sent for, and took the prisoner - he was rescued from me by some persons outside, but I took him again and he is the man.
Prisoner's Defence. I had been there, and had three or four half pints of gin; I went home to my tea, and then went back to bid my friends good night - I was running home, and the officer took me.

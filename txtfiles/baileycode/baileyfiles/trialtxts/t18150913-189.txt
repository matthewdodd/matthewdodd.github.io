            . I am shopman to Mr. Gaylor, linen-draper
, at 111, Fleet-street


. Mr. Gaylor told me to watch. This piece of cotton was on the inside of the door. The prisoner came and tried to take it off; he went away without taking it. He returned in two or three minutes, and put a black apron over the print, and carried it off. Mr. Gaylor went after him, and brought him back.

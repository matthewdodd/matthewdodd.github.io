            , of Ball's-pond


. On the 8th of March my father killed a pig, and hung it in the front yard; I and my father sat up that night in the shed, and three other persons sat up in the stable, as we had lost three pigs before; at two o'clock in the morning the two prisoners came together - they got over two high sences into the back yard, and I saw no more of them till they were bringing this dead pig back, which had been in a new shed in the front yard; they were both carrying it - it weighed eighteen stone - we took them, and this time we saved the pig; I have seen Gazeley before.
WILLIAM SHEPPARD. I am a groom. I was in the front yard, and saw the prisoners come to the pork; Munn untied the rope, and Gazeley took it on his back - they then both carried it.

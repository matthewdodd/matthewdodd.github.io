            . I am a Coach Tire Maker
. The Prisoner has often robbed me of nails and iron; the last I know of, is, half an hundred of old coach streak nails; he took them away tub and all; but I could not light of him till last night.

            . I saw the Prisoner take half a hundred of stubs, which were in a tub; I asked him, what he was going to do with them? He made me no answer, but went away with them. He came last night to his master, and abused him very much, and he said, I am come to surrender myself to clear myself. His master took hold of him, but he got from him and run away, and we took him in New Broad Street; he kicked me over the shins, and pulled out a knife and fork, and threatened to kill us.

            . I was at a publick house last night over-against my own house; the Prisoner came and said, G - d d - n you for an old rogue, I am come to surrender myself to clear myself. Said I, I am glad of that, and though I am very lame, I got hold of him, but he dragged me out into the street, and had like to have thrown me into the channel; he got from me, and run away. 


               Guilty, 10 d.

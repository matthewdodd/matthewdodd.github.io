                  , from his person
            .
MR. HENRY PATRICK. I live in East-street, Red-lion-square. On the 2d of June, about three o'clock in the afternoon, I was in St. Paul's church-yard


; the charity children were coming along - I was near the gates, by the Chapter-house, and felt something at my pocket, turned round, and saw the prisoner immediately behind me, with my handkerchief in his hand: a constable had seized him - he cried but said nothing to the charge.

            . I am a constable. I saw Mr. Patrick by the North gate of St. Paul's; I had seen the prisoner a quarter of an hour before, in company with two others, rather taller than himself, but quite young: I watched them - they parted at the end of Cannon-alley; the prisoner remained at the end of the alley; I saw him put his hand into a gentleman's pocket, draw a handkerchief a little way out, and put it back again; he then went to Mr. Patrick, put his hand into his pocket, and drew his handkerchief out - I seized his arm with it in his hand: he said he was never in custody before.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

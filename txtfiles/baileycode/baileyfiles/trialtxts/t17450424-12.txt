 . I was called up by these two neighbours, on the 4th of March at twelve o'clock at night, and they had got the prisoner lying upon his back in the yard. There were seven hens killed, one cock, and four ducks; they were lying in a bag a little way from the road. The prisoner said he would have killed them all, if he had not been disturbed; he said there was another with him, and owned he held the bag while the fowls were killing.

            . My wife saw two men go by, and each of them had a bag; she told me of it: I got up and followed them with a gun. I called my neighbour Paulin up to go with me. I saw the prisoner and another man come out of Mr. Smith's hen-house. I took hold of the prisoner with one hand, and had my gun in the other. He pulled at it several times, but could not get it out of my hand. One got away, and I threw the prisoner upon his back in the snow. He is a lamp lighter; he said he was trimming of lamps at eight o'clock that night in Smithfield .

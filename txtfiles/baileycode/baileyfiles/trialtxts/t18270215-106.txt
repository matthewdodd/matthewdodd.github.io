WILLIAM GELWEY. I lodge in Oxford-buildings, Oxford-street


. On the night of the 25th of January the prisoner came to lodge in the same room with me, and another young man. On the morning of the 27th that young man found the room door open, and as I was getting up I missed my clothes, and two sovereigns off a chair by my bed side; I have seen the purse since, but nothing else; the prisoner had slept there that night, but he was gone; the master and mistress of the house were in the room at the time.

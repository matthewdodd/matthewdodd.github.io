             the property of

                  CHARLES 
                  ROBINSON
               



            . I live at 48, Red-lion-street


. I am a haberdasher, hosier, and glover
. On the 11th of January, about eleven o'clock in the day, 
               
                  Hannah 
                  Brown
               



            , a stranger, and 
               
                  Mary 
                  Coombe
               



             came to my shop; they asked to look at some ribbons; I shewed them some. The woman that came with 
               
                  Hannah 
                  Brown
               



             and 
               
                  Mary 
                  Coombe
               



             covered the ribbons over in the ribbon drawer with a bonnet; seeing that, I suspected they were going to take ribbon; one of their hands was under her bonnet, and with the other hand drawing the ribbon over the bonnet, seeing how the ribbon would look upon the bonnet, and in about a quarter of an hour they fixed on a ribbon. I cut the ribbon off, and gave it her, and they offered me a dollar; I refused the dollar, not thinking it good.
Q. What was the ribbon to come to - A. About ten-pence halfpenny. Then Hannah Brown went out of the shop, and said she would get change. She returned, and gave me a shilling. I took for the ribbon, and they went out of the shop; and after folding up the ribbon and placing the drawer, then appeared two vacancies in the drawer, as if two pieces of ribbon had been taken out. It struck me that they had taken them. The two prisoners came about one o'clock again, and asked to look at some ribbons again. I asked them, what sort; they said, it is not material. I shewed them a different drawer to what they had out the first time. They covered the second drawer with the bonnet, the same as they did the first. I cut them off the quantity they wished; they paid for it, and left the shop. I told Elizabeth Dimes if they came the third time to keep a sharp look out, and if she saw them take any ribbon to give me a nod, and say, yes, as I had suspected them twice; then between four and five o'clock, just at dusk, the two prisoners came again; then after they had been looking at the ribbons a quarter of an hour, 
               
                  Elizabeth 
                  Dimes
               



             nodded, and said, yes. I then went across the shop, and asked 
               
                  Hannah 
                  Brown
               



             to give me the ribbon that belonged to me that she had taken. She said she had not taken any. I moved her a little further, and picked up on the shop floor one piece of ribbon, and suspecting they had more about them I sent the boy to Hatton Garden office for an officer. Wood came; he searched them, and, I believe, did not find any thing on them. I gave him the ribbon, and he took them into custody.


                  ELIZABETH 
                  DIMES
               



            . I am shopwoman to Mr. Robinson. The two prisoners came in between four and five, and asked to look at some ribbons; I shewed them some. 
               
                  Mary 
                  Coombe
               



             took her bonnet off, and put it on the ribbon drawer. I saw her put two pieces of ribbon into the crown of her bonnet; one piece she gave to 
               
                  Hannah 
                  Brown
               



            , and when she took her bonnet off the other piece fell to the ground. I saw her give one piece to 
               
                  Hannah 
                  Brown
               



            , and I saw it in 
               
                  Hannah 
                  Brown
               



            's hand afterwards. 
               
                  Hannah 
                  Brown
               



             seemed confused afterwards, and let it fall to the ground. Then they had a yard and a half of ribbon cut off, which came to eleven pence farthing; they gave me a shilling; I gave them the change. Brown dropped the halfpence; she went to pick them up; I said, yes, yes. Mr. Robinson understood me; he came and picked up one piece of ribbon.
Q. You are sure that you saw 
               
                  Mary 
                  Coombe
               



             put two pieces into her bonnet - A. Yes, and give one of them to Brown.

            . I am an officer. I was sent for to take the prisoner into custody. The ribbon was delivered to me; I produce it.
Prosecutor. I am certain it is my ribbon; it has my mark to it.
Coombe's Defence. I bought a yard a half of ribbon; I gave the lady eighteen pence. She picked the ribbon off the floor; the gentleman accused me of taking it.
Brown's Defence. I never saw the other prisoner before.

SAMUEL BUGLER. I live in Shoreditch

. On the 1st of September an officer produced two pairs of new shoes to me, which were mine, and have my initials on them; they were in the interior of my shop.

            . I am a pawnbroker, and live at Hoxton. On the 30th of August, about one o'clock, Endersby brought this pair of shoes to me - Church was with him. I asked who they belonged to, he said to his father - I asked him for a better account; he said he would fetch his sister, who could tell me more about them - they then both ran away, leaving them with me.

            . I apprehended the prisoners in consequence of information. I had seen them together - I asked where they got the shoes; Endersby said they were his father's.
ENDERSBY's Defence. I met Church in William-street; he asked me to pawn a pair of shoes for his aunt, and said he would give me half the money; he told me to say they were his father's, and that he lived in Willow-walk.

. On the 22d of May the prisoner came to my shop alone; I saw her standing against the counter, at the further end of the shop, near to a lady, who was buying a shawl; I asked what she wanted - she showed me a very ancient pattern of print, and asked if I could match it; I saw she had something under her arm; I kept the pattern some time, and moved about, and then said I had not got the pattern; she left the shop - I followed, and brought her back - she dropped this shawl, and I detained her.(Property produced and sworn to.)

            . I am ten years old. On the 21st of October I was standing by my father's workshop in Shoreditch


, and saw a man take a coat off Lowe's cart and give it to the prisoner. I pointed out both the men to my father; he ran and brought the coat back but not the prisoner. I am sure he is the man.

            . I heard the alarm, and pursued the prisoner down Sanders's-gardens, he was stopped and liberated again - I followed him. His companions struck me several times; I caught him in Hoxton-square - he said I was not an officer, and had no right to detain him, I said I should.

THOMAS BROWN
. I am nearly eighteen years of age—I live with my mother, Mary Ann Brown, who keeps an oil-shop in Bethnal green-road—I

know Henry Flowerday—he is between twenty-two and twenty-three years of age—he was in the service of my uncle, Mr. Carey, who is in the same business as my mother—I know the prisoner—he lives in Collingwood-street, Bethnal-green-road—he keeps a chandler's shop, and sells soap, and candles, and soda, and starch, and pickles, and other things—I know him by being recommended to him by Henry Flowerday—as near as I can recollect, the first time I went to the prisoner's was on a Sunday, about four months before I was taken into custody—Henry Flowerday took me there—he told the prisoner in my presence that I had got a pound of tobacco to sell—he told him my name was Thomas Brown, and that I lived in Bethnal-green-road, which is not far from the prisoner—he told him that my mother kept an oil-shop in Bethnal-green-road—she has lived there twenty-five years—when I went to the prisoner, I had a pound of tobacco, which I had stolen from my mother—I produced it to the prisoner, and he said he would give me half-a-crown a pound for it—my mother gave 3s. 8d. a pound for it—I do not rightly know what it would have been sold for across the counter, as I never serve in the shop—the prisoner gave me half-a-crown for it—it was called the best returns—he said if I could get anything, he would buy it of me, if I could get soap or candles, he would give me 3d. a pound for candles, and 2 1/2 d. a pound for soap—I know candles are 5s. a dozen, and the soap is sold at 4 1/2 d. or 5d. a pound—I sold nothing else to him that day, that I know of—I went to him again the next week—I cannot rightly say on what day—I then went by myself, and sold him three cakes of bees'-wax, which weighed between 4lbs. and 5lbs. each—he gave me 5d. or 6d. a pound for it—I cannot rightly say whether the bees'-wax was all I took on that occasion—I took candles many times—I sometimes took two dozen—I cannot say up to what period I was in the habit of taking candles there—I was taken into custody on a Saturday night, six or seven weeks ago—I had frequently visited the prisoner's shop, and taken things there, and had been there about a week before I was taken, and had taken two dozen pounds of candles—he gave me 3d. a pound for them—they were selling in my mother's shop at 5 1/2 d. a pound—I cannot rightly say whether there were any pickles taken on the day that I took the two dozen pounds of candles.

Cross-examined by
MR. PARRY. Q. Where is flowerday now? A. I am sure I cannot rightly tell—I have confessed to stealing articles out of my mother's shop—I stole a watch from my mother, and I robbed her of some money—I robbed my sister of 1s. 6d., and I robbed her of a gold chain, but she got it back—I never robbed anybody in the street—I have not been in the habit of robbing the houses of friends or their tills—I never robbed anybody but my mother and sister—I have never been charged by a landlord of a public-house with robbing him—my uncle Carey is here—I do not rightly know whether he told me it would be better for me if I would confess—I am telling all I know—they said they would not hurt me if I told all the truth, and in consequence of that I have stated what I have done to-day.





MARY FLOWERDAY
. My husband is a plumber—we live in Collingwood-street, very near the prisoner—I have a son named Henry Flowerday—my son was in the service of Mr. Carey—I have seen my son and Thomas Brown together—I cannot say where—I have seen my son at the prisoner's, and have seen Brown there—I do not know that I have seen my son and him there together—Brown has come to my house to see my son, who has been at the prisoner's, and I have sent Brown there after him.





ROBERT PRINGLK
. I keep the Lord Collingwood public-house—I know the prisoner as a neighbour—I saw him and Thomas Brown once at my house, drinking together—they were drinking at the bar when I saw them.






GEORGE TEAKLE
 (police-sergeat H 8.) On the 20th of Feb. I went with Mr. Carey to the prisoner's house—the prisoner was in the in the shop—I asked if he knew a person named Brown—he said, "No, I do not, that I am aware of"—I said, "I think you do; you had better recollect yourself, for according to my information, you bought candles of him"—he said, "No, I did not, that I am aware of: I have not bought any candles of any person of the name of Brown"—Mr. Carey, the uncle of Brown, was there with me—I turned round to him, and said, "Well, Mr. Carey, you know the information you have received from Brown, it is now for you to judge what step you will take"—Mr. Carey said, "Well then, I certainly shall give him into custody"—at that time I had not seen Mrs. Brown—I judged it was necessary to go and consult with her—the prisoner then said, "Oh! you mean the tall young man?"—I said, "Yes, he is a tall young man"—he said, "He was introduced to me by a man named Flowerday; Mr. Carey, pray don't take any step of that kind, to take me away from my home, and I will let you know everything I know about it, or any goods that I have bought"—I said, "My information is, that you have bought candles at 2d. a pound of Brown"—he said, "I have bought a few candles on one or two occasions, but I gave him 3d. a pound"—I said, "Where is the tobacco you bought?"—he said, "I certainly have bought tobacco on two or three occasions, small quantities, and he had cigars for it, but he always told me it was his own"—I then said, "Where is the jar of capers you bought of him?"—he said, "well, he did bring a small jar of capers, and I gave him 10d. for it; I emptied them, and he took the jar away again"—he begged very particularly to be allowed to go and have an interview with Mrs. Brown—he said he would gladly pay double and treble the amount of her loss, if the uncle would not take any step towards him—I desired the uncle, while I remained there with the prisoner, to go and see Mrs. Brown—he went away and returned, but not bringing any decisive answer, I went and saw Mrs. Brown myself, and afterwards took the prisoner—I found some candles in this shop, which he could not satisfactorily account for—I found they resembled two dozen of flat candles which I had, which had been found in the possession of Thomas Brown when I took him—I asked the prisoner where he bought them—he said he did not know, he bought some of one and some of another—I took possession of them, and took the prisoner to the station—he there particularly requested to speak to Mrs. Brown—he was cautioned by the inspector to be cautions what he said, as what he said might be used as evidence againt him.

Cross-examined. Q. You did not caution him? A. He was not in custody at that time—I was on private in quiry, in consequence of Brown being in custody—I had no authority to take him till I had seen Mrs. Brown—Mr. carey said, "As you deny all knowledge of it, I will give you into custody"—I believe there was one or two questions put to him after that about the capers—the prisoner's is a chandler's shop—candles are sold there—there were two dozen of candles found upon Thomas Brown—he was carrying them off Mrs. Brown's premises—they were the same shape as those found upon Thomas Brown—I have measured them since, and they do not agree with Mrs. Brown's.





MARY ANN BROWN
. I am a widow, and carry on business in Bethnal, Green-road—Thomas Brown is my son—he had access to my property—I have been missing a quantity of candles, bees'-wax, capers, starch, and soap from Nov. till the 14th of Feb.

COURT. Q. Have you traced any property of yours taken anywhere but

to the prisoner's, by your son? A. No—the watch was taken to another party—it was not gold—it was my husband's—my son took it to a young man, who took it to another person—I cannot tell where.

MR. DOANE. Q. What do you give for your candles? A. Five shillings per dozen—I sell them retail at 5 1/2 d. per pound.

Cross-examined. Q. It depends upon the quality of them, does not it? A. I buy but one sort—my son has not been a good boy.

GUILTY
. Aged 35.—


Transported for Seven Years.*
*THOMAS CAREY. I firmly believe the prisoner was the means of my servant Flowerday absconding—he had been a very good servant till the last six months—I have two witnesses to prove that the prisoner has tried to seduce them to rob their employers to a very serious amount.

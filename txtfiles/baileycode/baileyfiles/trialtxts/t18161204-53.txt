            ; he is a butcher and green-grocer
, and lives at No. 45, Gray's-Inn-lane


. I was in the shop on the 9th of November; there were two loins of mutton there; I missed one; I saw it the next morning at Mr. Johnston's; I knew it to be the same, because I fitted it with the other joint; it was ten pounds and a half; I weighed it myself.
WILLIAM JOHNSTON. I am a butcher. On the 9th of November, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I was in New-street; I saw the prisoner and another boy with him; the prisoner had a bundle under his arm, in his blue apron; I looked at him, and the other boy ran away. I followed the prisoner, he ran up a court, and I secured him; he said it was meat that he had got, and that he bought it for 6s., at the White Horse. It weighed ten pounds and a half; I took him to Hatton-garden; I afterwards found that it belonged to the prosecutor. It could not be bought for less than 6d. per pound.
Cross-examined by MR. CURWOOD. I saw the other boy run away. I did not go to the White Horse.
Q. Did you compare the meat - A. I did; and it exactly fitted.
GUILTY. Aged 14.

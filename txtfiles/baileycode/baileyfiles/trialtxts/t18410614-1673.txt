SUSAN DBNHAM
. I am the wife of James Banham, a policeman, and live at Pimlico. On the 1st of June, about one o'clock, my attention was called to somebody walking in the passage—I went out, and saw the prisoner walking out at the door—I followed him and asked what business he had in my house—he could make no answer, but knocked me down, and then put the boots out of his apron on to the ground and escaped—I am sure he is the man—a constable came to my assistance—I missed the boots from the back parlour.





ALEXANDER M'CULLOCH
. I am a policeman. I heard a cry of "Po-lice" —Iimmediately looked back, crossed the road, and took the prisoner into custody, seeing the prosecutrix on the ground—I looked behind and saw these boots on the ground, close behind where the prosecutrix laid—she said he had been into her house and stolen the boots, and in searching him, I found a pair of spectacles and case, and 1s. 8d.





THOMAS KELLY
 (police-constable F 40.) I have a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—I was present at his trial—he is the person there described—(read.)

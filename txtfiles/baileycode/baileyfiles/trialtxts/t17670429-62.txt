             ordered the cloth to be removed from Mr. Frich's, to Mr. Ellington's; I delivered twenty-seven pieces of this bays to a carman; after delivered, the carman and the prisoner would have faced me down there were but twenty-six pieces; I went a foot-way, waiting at a print-shop for their coming; they were lying but very loose upon the cart; I saw one of the pieces of bays fall down, and the prisoner pick it up; I thought he would have brought it to Mr. Ellington's; he went down Bartholomew-lane with it, and when I came to unload the pieces there were but twenty-six of them; we waited a good while, he never came; then I went to him in Leadenhall-market, and charged him with it; he began to be very impudent, and a set of fellows of the same business he is, [a porter
] took his part against me, and advised him to drub me; then I went for a warrant and he was committed.
Prisoner's defence.
The carman would have made affidavit there were but 26 pieces, but he is not here.

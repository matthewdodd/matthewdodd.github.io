            . I am a Police-constable. On the 11th of March I was on duty, and met the prisoner in the Bow-road, about three miles from Hackney, at five o'clock in the morning - he had a bag with six fowls, and a rabbit - I asked him what he had got there; he said he did not know - I said, "Let me look;" he then pulled out the rabbit - I asked where he got them; he said he found them at Stratford - the fowls were quite warm.
Prisoner. Q. Did I say I picked them up at Stratford? A. Yes, you did.

            . I keep the White Hart inn, Temple-mills, in the parish of St. John, Hackney




 - I kept fowls and a rabbit. On the evening of the 11th of March they were all locked up in a range of buildings, which surround my yard - the whole yard is paled in to keep all secure; my wife fastened them up, but I saw them after they were fastened - my lad got up first in the morning, and called me; I found the coal-house staple broken off, and the hen-house had all the fowls, which were six, taken away - the rabbit was taken from another place; I could swear to the fowls and to the rabbit, but they would not keep.

JOHN HENDERSON. I am a clerk out of employ
. On Tuesday, the 15th of December, I was in the Old Bailey


, with a young man at the execution, a few minutes after eight o'clock in the morning - we were in the crowd. I felt a hand come out of my pocket, turned round, and saw the prisoner immediately behind me, and charged him with attempting to pick my pocket - he denied it. I saw him concealing something in his hands. I laid hold of one arm, pulled his hands asunder, and found my handkerchief in his hand. I collared him, called for an officer, and gave him in charge.

            . I am an officer. I was attending the execution - the prosecutor called for an officer, I went up, and he gave the prisoner in charge, with the handkerchief.

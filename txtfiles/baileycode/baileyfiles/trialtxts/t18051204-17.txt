Q. Had you seen him about the shop before? - A. Yes, I had moved them away four different times, as he had tried to get them four different times; they were about a yard and a quarter within side of the door; when he took them, I pursued him, I overtook him in about twenty yards, and took him with the cheese; I produce the cheese; they are worth 12 s. He was a servant in livery when I took him.

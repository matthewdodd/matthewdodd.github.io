            . I was returning from the theatre, about half-past twelve o'clock at night, and saw Mr. Miles driving his gig; three men were in the street; the prisoner, who was one of them, drew this coat from the gig, and was walking off with it; I ran and collared him with it on his arm; I gave him in charge - his two companions got away.

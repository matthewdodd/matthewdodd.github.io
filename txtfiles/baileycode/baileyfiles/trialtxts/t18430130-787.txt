 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
31st of Jan., 1 handkerchief, value 2s., the goods of 



Thomas Hitchcock, from his person.






THOMAS HITCHCOCK
. I live in Frith-street, Soho. About three o'clock on the 31st of Jan., I was in Titchfield-street, and had occasion to stop at a dead wall—I felt a twitch at my pocket—I turned my head and saw the prisoner with my handkerchief in his hand-he started off—I followed him, crying, "Stop thief"—he was stopped sixty or seventy yards up the street, and he threw the handkerchief down—I am sure he is the person-there are no marks on it—I had it not a minute before—it corresponds with mine in every respect.

Prisoner. Q. Did I have it in my hand? A. Yes, in your hand.

Prisoner. I was coming to Crown-street with a message; I was past the time, ran fast, and struck the gentleman with my left hand; the handkerchief was never found on me; I never touched it; there was nobody in the street, but there were two lads who followed the prosecutor.





THOMAS HITCHCOCK
. No such thing, there was no one in the street.




GUILTY
. * Aged 18.—


Transported for Ten Years.

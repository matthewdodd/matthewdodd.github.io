CATHERINE LURCHEN. I am a widow. The prisoner is my grandson; he has lived with me some years - I found a number of duplicates one Sunday morning; but I did not miss these articles till I saw them before the Magistrate.
GEORGE WILLIAMS. I am a pawnbroker. I have a book, pawned by the prisoner, and a tea-kettle, pawned by Richard Avent.
RICHARD AVENT. I have known the prisoner three months; we used to go to school together - he asked me to pawn this tea-kettle for his grandmother, and I did for 3s.: I gave the prisoner the money - he went in doors with it, then came out and gave me a halfpenny.

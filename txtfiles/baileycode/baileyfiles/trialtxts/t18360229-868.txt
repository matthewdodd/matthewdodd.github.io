MARY MAIDMENT
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
16th of January, 1 sheet, value 4s.; the goods of 



Joshua Graves, her master; and that she had been before convicted of felony.






JOSHUA GRAVES
. I live in Burdett-street, Walworth-common. The prisoner worked for my wife, who is a laundress, for about eight months—on

the 16th of January a sheet was missed, and then a table-cloth—we then spoke to the prisoner, and asked her where the sheet was—she said she knew nothing at all about it—she was away for three or four days—I went and took two officers to her house—she was hid in the cupboard, under the stairs—we were obliged to break the door—I asked her for the duplicates—she denied it, but she was taken; and on the Monday following she told me the sheet was in the Walworth-road, pawned at Mr. Barber's, for 2s.—I went and found it there—this is the sheet.





JOSEPH BARBER
. I am a pawnbroker, and live at Walworth. I produce this cotton sheet—I could not sufficiently swear to the prisoner—it was pawned by a female, and a little boy with her, in the name of Ann Jones.





THOMAS HODGES
. I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction for felony, which I got from the clerk of the peace at Lambeth (read)—she is the woman.

Prisoner's Defence. Distress drove me to it.




GUILTY
. Aged 35.—


Transported for Seven Years.

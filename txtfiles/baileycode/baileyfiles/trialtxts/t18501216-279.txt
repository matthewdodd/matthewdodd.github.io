MARGARET AIRBURG
. I am a widow, and keep a house, 12, Mill-yard, Leman-street. The prisoner was in my service—I had a sovereign and a shilling in a small china box in a chest when I went to bed on 22nd Nov., I placed the keys in my pocket and under my pillow, where I always keep them—the prisoner knew my habits, and where the box was—in the morning the prisoner was gone, and I missed a shawl from behind the door, saw the padlock of the box lying on the floor, and then missed the 1l. 1s.—the prisoner was away three weeks, and I then found her at the station.

Prisoner. An old woman slept with her that night. Witness. No, no one but the prisoner.





THOMAS KELLY
 (policeman, H 2). I took the prisoner on 13th Dec., and told her she was charged with stealing three sovereigns, which I then understood was the charge—she said, "The old b—is a liar, I only took 21s., a sovereign, and one shilling, and I smashed it all in drink the first night"—I then said she was charged with stealing a shawl—the said, "I did, I pawned it and sold the ticket for sixpence"—I took her to the station.





EDWARD WIGLEY
 (policeman, H 141). I produce a certificate—(read—Julia Murphy, convicted at Clerkenwell, June, 1846, of stealing from the person; Confined six months)—she is the person named.




GUILTY

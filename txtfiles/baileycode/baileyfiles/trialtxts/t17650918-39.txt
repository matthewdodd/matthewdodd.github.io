             are partners; we live on Snow-Hill: I am a watch-maker
, and sell the various materials that compose a watch, and tools that watch-makers use. Langham was my errand-boy
, and lived in the house; Moring was apprentice
 to a customer that used to come for things to our shop, by which means they contracted an acquaintance. On the 30th of August, his master sent me word he had reason to suspect they had both been concerned in robbing me; that he had seen them both with a considerable sum of money, buying trifles, and some nights before they had spent seven shillings in punch and negus, and Moring had been seen with a movement, which he had made up into a watch for his brother. Upon that I sent for a constable, and charg'd Langham: he immediately confessed he had taken the things mentioned in the indictment, through the persuasion of Moring, and delivered them to him: he was sent to the Compter: the constable that took him there came back and told me he had confess'd to more things than he had to me, going along. After that I took up Moring in Smithfield, and charg'd him with those things; he immediately acknowledged he had taken the movement, and all the other articles mentioned in the indictment, as the other prisoner had done before. We took them before my Lord Mayor; they there confessed the same. Moringsaid the movement was made up into a watch, and his brother had it in his pocket in Long-Lane, and the oil-stone was at his father's: we went there, and found them accordingly (the watch and oil-stone produced in court). I can swear to the oil-stone as my property: the movement goes through so many alterations in finishing, I cannot take upon me to swear to that. Moring confess'd the main spring and chain were put in the watch (they are no part of the movement).
The constable produced the watch and oil-stone, and deposed he found them as the prosecutor had related.
Langham's Defence.
This lad came to our shop before my master was up, and persuaded me to give him a movement.

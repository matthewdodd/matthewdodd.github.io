WILLIAMS STRAFORD VAIL
. I am a laceman, and live in Oxford-street. The prisoner was my errand-boy, and lived in my house for about six weeks—I suspected him, and had his box searched on the 10th of June, and all these articles were found in it—he did not say any thing—I gave him into custody.





GEORGE AVIS
. I was sent for, and searched the prisoner's box, and I found this property.

Prisoner. What the young woman said is false—she knew the things were stolen when she received them.




GUILTY
. Aged 15—Recommended to mercy by the prosecutor.

            .
ANN WETTON. I live near Brentford, in the parish of Ealing



. I had two boxes containing some china. I saw them safe at the beginning of February; and on the 19th of February my man servant fetched me to the lodge where they had been kept, and said the boxes had been opened - he had found the door a-jar; I went and found the boxes open, and missed twenty-one plates, worth 28s. - they are Dresden china.
Johnson. She first said twenty-eight. Witness. I lost more than twenty-eight in all - these are part of what I lost.
JOHN BURFORD. I live at Old Brentford. Allen came to my shop on the evening of the 15th of February - she wanted to pawn about half a dozen of these plates - I asked her how she came by them - she said her father brought them with him from Ireland; I told her I would have nothing to do with them - these are the plates she brought.
Allen. I was at Richmond that Friday with a few oranges; I never came by his shop at all. Witness. Idistinctly swear that she did, because two or three days before she had bought an article at my shop, and I had seen her repeatedly
JOSEPH DICKENSON. I live in Old Brentford. On Saturday night, the 16th of February, I turned up a little alley, and saw Gibbs and Gaskins; Gaskins gave Gibbs some plates or dishes, and said "Bill, it is all right, do not say any thing" - he said, with an oath, "No, I will not," and he put them under his coat - she then said "It is of no use to go to Mr. Tollens', you had better go to Isleworth" - I came out of the alley, and saw Gaskins go into a shop, and Gibbs went further on - I had seen all the four prisoners together the same night - I went on, intending to go to the bridge and stop them, but they did not come there - I then came down the town, and saw three of the prisoners against the Drum public-house - I waited and saw Gibbs come out of the Drum, and they went up the town together; I saw' no plates or dishes then- I heard that Gibbs was taken on the Monday. and I gave information that Gaskins had been in company with him on the Saturday night.
ANN WARD. I live at Brentford. Johnson came to my shop on Saturday, the 16th of February, late in the evening, and asked for my husband - he said his father had sent him with some plates; I looked at them, and asked what he wanted for them - he said 4s., that they were his father's, who was out of work, and he had sent him to sell them to buy some bread; I asked where he lived - he said in Drum-street; I said "You cannot have been there long, or you would know the difference between Drum-street and Drum-lane" - he said he had not been there long; I then gave him 2s. for twenty-one of them - I did not know their value; I could not see what colour they were; I had to take ashes from under the grate to clean them - I saw the prisoners in custody in a day or two, and my husband went and told of it - they were brought about eight o'clock at night.

            . My trunks were in the lodge, close by the gate, in an inner room; the lodge had not been broken; there were a great many more ready to be carried off - it was on Tuesday, the 19th of February, I missed them, but they must have been taken some days before.
Gibbs' Defence. I never saw Gaskins that night.
JOSEPH DICKENSON. I positively swear I saw her give him some plates or dishes.
Johnson's Defence. I met a man with a bundle - he asked if I knew where he could sell some plates; I said I did not - he asked me to go to Ward's, and I went and asked 4s. - he said I was not to turn any money away.
Gaskin's Defence. I went with Allen to sell some things; I went to a lady's house, and when I came back I saw Allen with half a dozen plates in her hand against the lodge - I said, "Don't take them:" I put them back, and said I would have nothing to do with them - she then took and wiped them, and took them into a shop, but the people would not have them - she then gave them to me to hold, and as she did not come, I gave them to Gibbs to hold - I am quite innocent.
Allen. I am quite innocent.

            . I live at Old Brentford



. On the 19th of February, about nine o'clock, or a few minutes past, my little girl went down to the shop - we have a bell to the door-post, that no one could come in without a noise; I went down, the door was opened, and my little girl told me that the prisoner had been and gone away, and shut the door - I found the cheese was gone; from what my daughter said to me, I went and gave information of it at the station; I described the prisoner to them, whom they knew - we then went in search of him; we found him at a lodging-house, sitting at a table with a piece of my cheese before him, and

             sitting with him, eating bread and cheese - this was the night of the 19th of February; this is the cheese - I had seen it twenty minutes before.
Prisoner's Defence. I had just been in the shop for a few things; I was standing in the shop, smoking my pipe; a young man came and gave me the cheese, and ran away; I do not know his name.

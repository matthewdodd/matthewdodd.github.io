Joseph Tucker, fixed to a building; having been before convicted.






WILLIAM WILSON
. On 15th March, I received information, and saw the prisoner forty or fifty yards from Miss Arundel's house at Woodford, with these iron bars in his hand—he put them into a truck which he had got in the lane, and covered them over with a bag—I found them there, and another bar in another bag—I compared the irons with the stone fronting Miss Sarah Arundel's house, they exactly fitted the holes where some bars were missing—the house belongs to Joseph Tucker.





JAMES WHITE
 (policeman, K 13). On 15th March, I received information, and missed the bars from the stone—I saw a truck with three iron bars in it, partly covered over—I found in it these irons, and one in another bag—I compared them with the stone, they exactly fit—I saw the prisoner in George-lane, and took him—he said the truck was his.

Prisoner's Defence.I picked them up.

WILLIAM COLEMAN. I am a sailor
. On the 12th of February I slept at the Refuge for the Houseless, at Wapping


; the prisoner slept next to me. I had two shillings, a sixpence, and 21/2d. in my right-hand waistcoat pocket - it was safe when I went to sleep; I awoke between twelve and one o'clock, and it was gone - I spoke to the prisoner about it - I thought he had it, because he had asked me to lend him 1d. before he went to sleep; he denied having it, but the officer came in and found it on him.

            . I am the officer of that establishment. I heard Coleman say he had lost his money; I took the prisoner into the next room, and asked if he had any money about him - he said not a farthing; he was searched, and 2s. 81/2d. was found in his pockets; he was taken to the watch-house, and there he said he had found it among the straw.

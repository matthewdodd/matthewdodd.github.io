HENRY LEWIS
. I am a cab-driver, living in Cobham-row. I met the prisoner in Gray's-inn-lane on the 26th of August—I gave her 1s., and went to a room with her—I had three half-crowns, one shilling, and one sixpence—I missed it, and told the prisoner so—she said she had not got it, she knew nothing about it—I then had a scuffle with her, and saw her throw one half-crown, one shilling, and a sixpence on the bed—I asked her to give me the others—she would not—I sent for a policeman—when he came to the top of the stairs, she gave me the other two half-crowns.





SAMUEL DOTLE
 (police-constable G 197.) I took the prisoner—the prosecutor said she gave him this money—I saw her give him something—I do not know what it was.

Prisoner's Defence. He said, "If you do not give me half-a-crown of your own money, I will serve you out," and he struck me shamefully; I said I could not; he went down, and got a policeman; he had not given me any thing; he said he was in the habit of serving every girl so that he went with: I found two half-crowns under the foot of the bed; I do not know whether they were his or not; I never saw anything of the halfcrown, the shilling, and the sixpence.





SAMUEL DOYLE
 (police-constable G 197.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—she is the person.




GUILTY

Transported for Ten Years.

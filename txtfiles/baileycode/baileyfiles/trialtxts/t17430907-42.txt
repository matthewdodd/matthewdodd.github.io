Josias Taylor. Last Saturday Evening, about eight o'Clock, I was going with a Friend to drink a Tankard of Beer, and just by my own Door, in Bishopsgate street, I found something lightly touch my Pocket; I put my Hand into my Pocket, and found that my Handkerchief was gone; I saw the Prisoner about the same Distance from me that he is now; I immediately run after him, and seized him, and said, Sirrah, you have got my Handkerchief; he took the Handkerchief out of his Pocket and threw it down directly; I took up the Handkerchief, and carried the Prisoner into a back Room; said I, Sirrah, this Practice will bring you to the Gallows; he begged that I would let him go, and said, his Father and Mother would beat him; there was a Gentleman came and said, he had picked his Pocket within these five Minutes, but he would not prosecute him; says one who had been a Constable, this is the third or fourth Time that he has been sent to Newgate: I searched his Pockets, and found these five Handkerchiefs about him. The People very well knew him.
Q. to the Prisoner. How old are you?
Prisoner. I am Eleven Years old. 


               Guilty 10 d.

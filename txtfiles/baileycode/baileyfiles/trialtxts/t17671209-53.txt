            . I am wife to

                  Skelton 
               



            , we live in Widegate-alley, Bishopsgate-street


; the woman at the bar took a ready-furnished lodging of me the 2d or 3d of October; she said she had parted from her husband two years; I said I must see him; she said I should do her a great deal of harm then, for his master and mistress do not know that he is married; I went to him with her, and said, is this your wife; he said she was his lawful wife; I never saw him in my house in my life; she came to the lodging, and behaved very quiet till the 7th of November; in the evening I saw her go out with a bundle; I suspected she was robbing her lodgings; when she came in again, I made an excuse to borrow her gridiron; when in her room I missed all the things mentioned in the indictment; I sent my nephew to the man at the bar; he came back and said, the man said he was not her husband; I never got my things again.

            . On the 7th of November I was at my aunt's, 
               
                  Sarah 
                  Skeleton 
               



            ; I went into the lodging-room, and saw the things mentioned in the indictment missing; I went to the man's master in the Buckle-street; the master said this woman was not the man's wife, and 
               
                  Lawrence
               


             the prisoner said the same.
Woman's defence.
The man by the side of me has been the occasion of all this; he agreed for me to take a room to live with me as man and wife, all I did was by his direction.

JOHN WILLIAMS
 and 




CHARLES BLAKE
 were indicted for

 stealing, on the 
16th of September, 38 yards of printed cotton, value 1l., the goods of 



James Cook and another.






JAMES COOK
. I am in partnership with John Maple, a linen-draper, in Tottenham-court-road. On the 16th of September this printed cotton was at the door—that now produced is it—it was safe about five o'clock.

Cross-examined by
MR. PAYNE. Q. Have you made inquiries about Blake? A. I have, and find he has been a very good boy till the last few months—he has been misled by bad associates.





JOSEPH POOR
. I live in Old Pancras-road. About seven o'clock, on the evening of the 16th of September, I was going into No. 146, Tottenham-court-road, and saw the prisoner Blake looking at a window, and Williams go to the prosecutor's, which was next door—I went on a little way, suspecting them, and saw Williams take up two pieces of print off the board under the window, and put them into an apron, which Blake had on at the time—they both went off together—I came up and seized them both, but Williams broke away from me—I am certain he is the man—he was taken next morning—I took Blake and the print into the shop.

Cross-examined. Q. How far was Blake from the shop when he received this? A. About ten yards, on the same side of the way—he could see what Williams was doing.

Williams's Defence. I am a poor fatherless lad; I was out of work, and without victuals for twenty-four hours; a man came to us and said, if I would take a piece of cotton, and give it to Blake, he would give us 1s. a-piece.

WILLIAMS*—


GUILTY
. Aged 18.—


Transported for Seven Years.

BLAKE—


GUILTY
. Aged 10.—Recommended to mercy.





Confined Six Days, and 


whipped.

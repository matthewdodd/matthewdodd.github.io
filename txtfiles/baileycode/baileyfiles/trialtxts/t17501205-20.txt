Row Rotheram. I am a frame work knitter
, and live in Cary street, St. Clement's parish. On Tuesday November 13 a neighbour knocked at my door between six and seven in the morning, and told me my shop in Lincoln's Inn


 was on fire; I made what haste I could thither; I found a great many people at the door; I opened it and went in; I found a great smother but no flame; I saw some stockings about the floor, and some holes empty; I saw I had been robbed. The prisoner is a taylor, and has a shop next door but one to mine, which had been shut up some weeks; I saw that open and a pannel broke from his shop into a pamphlet shop, and from that into mine, made me immediately suspect him; he married my daughter, but she is dead.

            . I was going through Lincoln's Inn, they told me there had been a fire, and a hosier had been robbed; after this, near Hide Park corner, at the sign of the Faulcon, I saw the prisoner at the bar selling stockings this 13th of Nov. he sold them cheap, and I suspected he did not come honestly by them; so I came back again, and told Mr. Rotheram about him; in the mean time came in Mr. Turner, so he and I went to take him, which we did with some of the stockings under his arm. They were produced in court, and deposed to by the prosecutor.
Prisoner. I have no defence to make.




               Guilty 4 s. 10 d

            . I am a chemist, and live in High-street, Mary-le-bone. On Sunday, the 21st of January, about seven o'clock, I was in Store-street, and saw the prisoner come out of Mr. Hyatt's, with a pair of scales partly concealed under his arm - I asked what he had there; he threw them into the middle of the road, and ran off - I followed, and took him thirty yards off, and took him into the shop.

            . I am errand-boy to Mr. Hyatt. I went out, and found these scales in the road - I brought them in, then went out again, and found the powder-machine about the same spot.

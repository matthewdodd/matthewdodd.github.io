1602. 




EDMUND HARRISON
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
9th of May, 10 pairs of trowsers, value 3s., the goods of 



William Sumshon Hayes; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






JAMES LLOYD
. On the 9th of May, about seven o'clock at night, I saw the prisoner near Mr. Hayes's window, in Farringdon-street, with the trowsers on his arm—I went in and inquired there, came out and followed the prisoner—he dropped the trowsers, and went into Shoe-lane, where the policeman met him—the prosecutor took up the trowsers.





ADAM SPRAY
 (City police-constable. No. 38) I heard an alarm, and saw the prisoner running—I followed him to New-street—he ran into a cellar, I secured him, and brought him back.





WILLIAM SUMSHON HAYES
. These are my ten pairs of trowsers—they had been on a chair near the door.





WILLIAM DARBY
 (City police-constable, No. 9.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office (read)—the prisoner is the person who was convicted.




GUILTY
.* Aged 21.—


Transported for Seven Years.

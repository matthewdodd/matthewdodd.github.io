As I was going into Mr. Pope's door, in the Fleet-market


, somebody snatched a bundle from me, and ran away, I ran after him, and never lost sight of him, he was taken: I never found the clothes; it was Saturday night, after ten o'clock, there was a great crowd when he was taken.

I saw the prosecutor running after the prisoner, I took him, he had no bundle upon him; he said he had done no harm.

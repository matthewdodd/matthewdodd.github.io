CHARLES COTTER
 and 




ELLEN CALEY
 were indicted for

stealing, on the 
21st of May, 1 handkerchief, value 4s., the goods of 



Robert Norman, from his person.






ROBERT NORMAN
. I live in Salisbury-square. On the evening of the 21st of May, I was in St. James's-park, and lost my handkerchief—it was produced to me by the officer—I saw the prisoners standing a short way behind me—they were together—I am sure they are the persons.





WILLIAM RUSSELL
 (police-constable C 113.) At a quarter past three o'clock that day, I was in the Park in plain clothes—I saw the prisoner, Caley, put her hand into the prosecutor's pocket, take out this handkerchief, and give it to Cotter—Caley put her right hand in the pocket I rather think, and held up the pocket with her left—I took Cotter into custody, and he threw the handkerchief on the ground—Eaton took Caley.





JOHN EATON
 (police-constable S 193.) I was on duty and saw the prisoners together—I saw the girl take the handkerchief out of the prose-cutor's pocket and give it to Cotter—he dropped it—I secured Caley.

GEORGE BAGLEY. I am a chimney-sweeper
. I lost this machine from my warehouse at Uxbridge


, on the 15th of November; the prisoner worked for me a little before, and he knew where it was - I saw it safe about half-past five o'clock the evening before; I took the prisoner, and he told me where he had sold it - this is it: it was given to me by the Society; I should think it worth 30s.
GEORGE CASTLE. I am a chimney-sweeper, and live at Shepherd's-bush. I bought this machine of the prisoner on the 16th of November, I think - I gave him 1ls. for it - he said it was his own.

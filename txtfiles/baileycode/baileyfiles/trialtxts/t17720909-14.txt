             deposed,
"That they saw the prisoner about the house, and suspecting him, they watched him; that they found him in a stable near the house, with a large piece of lead covered with some hay; that upon their charging him with stealing the lead he first said he was ill, and could not carry such a weight, and that afterwards he told them they could not hurt him, as he had not taken it off. They also deposed, that they compared the lead and it sitted exactly the place from whence the lead had been stolen."
The prisoner, in his defence, said,
"he knew nothing of the lead." He called no witnesses to his character.

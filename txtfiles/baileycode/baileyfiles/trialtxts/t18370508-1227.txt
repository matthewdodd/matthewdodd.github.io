1227. 




JOHN BROKIN
 was again indicted

for stealing, on the 
2nd of March, 1 goblet, value 1s.; and 1 ale glass, value 6d.; the goods of 



Samuel Benjamin Biss, his master.






SAMUEL BENJAMIN BISS
. The prisoner was in my service in March, 1835—he absconded on the 11th—in consequence of information from Cobb, I went over to his lodging in Upper Ground-street, and found, among other things of mine, this goblet and glass—I never sold or gave them to the prisoner—I had two dozen of these glasses made on purpose for a tavern—it is an unusual size—I supplied one dozen, and kept the other in stock, and on examination I found I had only eleven remaining—I am quite sure I had twelve before—I compared this with the eleven—I have not a doubt of it—I had such an ale glass as this in my stock.





FRANCES COBB
. I lived with the prisoner—I remember his bringing some glasses to the lodging, which Mr. Biss claimed when he came—the prisoner said he had bought them of his master.

MR. BISS. I am quite sure I never sold, nor gave him any thing of the kind.

Prisoner. I do not know any thing about the glasses.




GUILTY
. Aged 23.—


Transported for Fourteen Years.

Before Mr. Justice Littledale.

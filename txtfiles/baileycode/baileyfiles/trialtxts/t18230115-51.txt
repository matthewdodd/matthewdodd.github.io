            . I am shopman to Mr. H. Floyd, hosier
, of the Minories


. On the 30th of December, about twelve o'clock, I was serving a customer, the prisoner came in with a boy about eighteen years old, who had a pair of skates, and asked for a cravat - he wished to have it out of a particular corner of the window, and while I was getting it, I saw the prisoner helping himself out of the other window. I saw a handkerchief on a line move; the boy did not buy the cravat; the prisoner ran out - I pursued, and took hold of him six doors off, and took a silk and a cotton handkerchief out of his hat; he said his mother gave him one of them. I can swear to one.

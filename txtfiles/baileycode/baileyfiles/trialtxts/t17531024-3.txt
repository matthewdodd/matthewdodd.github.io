             informed me there were three men stealing Mr. Shakespear's sowls in a field next to ours, I took a gun and we pursued and took the two prisoners, Holt had two ducks and a turkey in his pocket, which Mr. Shakespear own'd.

                  Levit 
               



            . I work under the last witness at the duke of Rutland's; on the 17th of Sept. about noon, I heard a turkey cry out in the prosecutor's grounds, I went to see, and heard some people whisper, I imagined it to be some of Mr. Shakespear's people, so I went to my work again; then I saw a man stand upon a mount in that field, I looked hard at him, and he seem'd in a surprize; then I saw Holt look up at me, but the other man gave him a signal not to come in sight yet. Then I went and call'd the other witness, and we pursued, there were three men of them, they all ran together, he that stood on the watch got away, I saw something hang from him like a turkey. The prosecutor lost two turkeys, but did not lay the other in the indictment. We took Holt in a ditch, and Evans surrendered. Holt had the two ducks and turkey about him.
Evan's Defence.
I was only walking along the fields, and did not know what the men were upon, nor was in their company, I had no hand in it, the people call'd to me and I surrendered.
Holt's Defence.
I did not take the fowls, they were given to me by the other man that ran away, whose name is

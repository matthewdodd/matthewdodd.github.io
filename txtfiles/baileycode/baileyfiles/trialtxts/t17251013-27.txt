It appeared that Edward Wilks was Servant
 to the Prosecutor; that he stole the Goods, and carry'd them to the Lodgings of his Brother Thomas Wilks, in Shadwell where they were found. There being no Evidence against Thomas, the Jury 

               acquitted
             him; and found Edward 

               Guilty
            .

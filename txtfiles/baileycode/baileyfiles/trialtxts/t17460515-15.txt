            (to 
               
                  Elizabeth 
                  Goodson 
               



            ) Do you know the Prisoner at the Bar?



                  Elizabeth 
                  Goodson 
               



            . I happen'd to be out one Afternoon, the 15 th of April, the Duke's Birth-Day. When I came home I found my Door wide open: When I came home it was almost Ten o'Clock at Night: I found the Street-Door wide open.
Q. The Shop Door ?


                  Elizabeth 
                  Goodson 
               



            . Yes. When I came into the Shop I saw the Prisoner taking the Fowl off the Shelf.
Q. Had he taken it off the Shelf?


                  Elizabeth 
                  Goodson 
               



            . I ask'd him whether he was a Customer; he turn'd himself about and said nothing; I ask'd him what Business he had there; and he made me no Answer: He had the Fowl in his Hand, and two more wrapp'd up in a 
               
                  Brown Linnen 
                  Apron 
               



            . He kept the Fowl in his Hand, and endeavour'd to come by me with the one Fowl in his Hand and two in his Apron.
Q. Did he go off with them?


                  Elizabeth 
                  Goodson 
               



            . He said let me come by. I got him hold by the Arm, and I told him he should not stir any further; and I desir'd my Friend to hold him 'till my Husband came; and my Husband came out, and we then secur'd him. My Husband got the Beadel of the Parish, and two Constables to carry him off.
Q. Did you get the Fowls from him?


                  Elizabeth 
                  Goodson 
               



            . Yes, my Lord. He dropp'd them upon the Floor, the one in his Hand and the two in his Apron.
Q. Was he carried before the Magistrate?


                  Elizabeth 
                  Goodson 
               



            . Yes, my Lord.
Q. Have you any Thing more to say?


                  Elizabeth 
                  Goodson 
               



            . I have no more to say.


                  Q. 
               


            (to 
               
                  Henry 
                  Humphrys 
               



            ) Do you know any Thing of this Fact?
Humphrys. My Lord I am Constable. When he (the Prisoner) came to the Watch-House, he had an Apron tied up like a Haberdasher's, a newish Apron. I ask'd him what Trade he was; he said he sold Whips and made Whip-cord: Then I ask'd him about taking Gr. Goodson's Fowls, and he did not at all deny it.
Q. Did he say any Thing?
Humphrys. He said nothing but what he had the Fowls. In his Side Pocket he had this very Thing in my Hand when he was carried to the Watch-House. [This Instrument was produced in Court; it had a long Handle, and about seven or eight Inches of Wire set in it, and hook'd at the End. A fit Instrument to lift up Sashes, and draw any Thing out of Shops or Windows.]
- Green. I am Beadle. Mr. Goodson came to me to the Watch-House; I went with him to his House. When I was bringing the Man from his House, I ask'd him how he could go into the Man's Shop to take the Fowls away, you know it was not your Property: Whereof I examin'd him, and he could not deny but he had two Fowls in his Apron. My Lord he own'd that he had taken the Fowls, to me.


                  Q. 
               


            (to the Prisoner) What have you to say to this Charge, sworn upon you by these three Witnesses?
Prisoner. My Lord I went out the Duke's Birth-Day at Night, and I drank a little Drop, and I went to buy a Fowl; and going to take one down the Gentlewoman came in. I knock'd, the Door was open.
Q. Have you any Witnesses to prove it? Who was to eat the Fowl? How many did you go to buy?
Prisoner. My Lord, only one.


                  Q. 
               


            (to 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Pearse 
               



            ) What are you by Trade ?
Pearse. I am a Sadler by Company, and a Whipmaker by Trade: The Prisoner lives by Cold-Bath-Fields. I have known him almost five Years.
Q. Do you know what Way of Life he follows?
Pearse. He trades about the Town and Country.
Q. What, is he a Hawker?
Pearse. Yes.
Q. And has he paid for what he has bought?
Pearse. I know several of my Acquaintance have entrusted him, I never knew any Thing of this, 'till Five o'Clock in the Afternoon.


                  Q. 
               


            (to 
               
                  Peter 
                  Runbo 
               



            ) How long have you known the Prisoner at the Bar?
Runbo. He has sold Goods for me.
Q. Where do you live?
Runbo. In Gray's-Inn-Lane.
Q. What does the Prisoner follow? It seems he understands some Part of the making. Have you seen the Instrument produced, that is not made Use of in your Trade of Whipmaking?
Runbo. No, my Lord.


                  Q. 
               


            (to 
               
                  Frances 
                  Pearse 
               



            ) Are you any Kin to the first Witness?
Pearse. No, my Lord. My Husband was here at Four o'Clock, but was obliged to go home. Sir he (the Prisoner) lodged at my House, but he never wronged me, which he might have done many a Time.
Q. Did he lie at your House the Night before he was taken up?
Pearse. I did not know of it 'till the next Morning; he ne'er was out 'till Ten o'Clock all the Time he was at our House.

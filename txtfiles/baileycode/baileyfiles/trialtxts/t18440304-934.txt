SUSAN LAWS
. I am the wife of James Laws—we live on Saffron-hill. Charles Laws is my son-in-law—on the morning of the 26th of Feb. I found my box broken open, and three sovereigns gone—I found Charles Laws at Corfieid's house, in Goswell-street—my husband charged him with it, and he said he had lost one, and given Corfield the other two; and then he said he had given her 1l. 16s.—she said he was a naughty boy, and he did not—then she said he gave her a sovereign and 16s.—she said she had bought a pair of boots and some other things.





WILLIAM STEVENS
. I am shopman to a linen draper in Goswell-street. On the 26th of Feb. Corfield came, and bought a pair of boots—she gave me a sovereign—I gave her change, and she bought a smaller pair for a little child.





HENRY THOMAS JACKSON
 (police-constable C 192.) I took Laws—I told him he was charged with stealing three sovereigns—he said, "I took the money, and gave Corfield 2l. all but 4s."—I took this parse from Corfield, and found 11s. 4d. in it.

Corfield's Defence. This boy came, and said his father was dead, and his mother had drowned herself; he said he had plenty of money; I had a bad pair of shoes: he told me to go and buy a pair; he gave me sixteen shillings and a half-crown; I said was it honestly come by; he said, "Yes;" I had my five children there, and he gave my youngest child a sovereign; I went to the linen draper's, and bought him a blue print for a pinafore, and some calico to make him a shirt.

CORFIELD—


NOT GUILTY

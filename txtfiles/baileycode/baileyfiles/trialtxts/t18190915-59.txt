THOMAS JOHNSON. I am a butcher
. On the 10th of July, I bought two lambs of Mr. Chandler, paid for them, took one away, and desired him to give an eye to the other. When I returned, I found the prisoner in custody.

            . I am servant to Mr. Chandler, who is a salesman, in Newgate-market. Johnson bought two lambs, took one away, and left the other in my care; the prisoner came soon after, and took it off the hook. I asked him where he was going with it? He said, down to the cart. I said,
"What cart?" He said,
"That man's cart, that has just taken the sheep away." Two people immediately stopped him with it. He threw it on the ground.
ROBERT EVANS. I am a porter. I was sitting on the board where the lambs hung; the prisoner was walking backwards and forwards - he took the lamb of the hook. I asked him what he was going to do with it? He said,
"That man told him to follow him with it." I told him to hang it where he took it from, instead of which, he threw it on the stones. We secured him.

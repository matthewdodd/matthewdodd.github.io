MARY ANN BAILEY
. I am the wife of James Bailey, of Sarah's-place, Bricklane,

Whitechapel. The prisoners took a furnished room at my house three weeks before they were taken. On Sunday, the 6th of Oct., the constable came to my house, and took them—I went up to the room, and missed a feather-bed, and several other articles, which were let with the room.





WILLIAM BEDDLE
. I am shopman to Mr. Soames, pawnbrober, Spital-fields. I produce a bed pawned on the 12th of Oct., by the prisoners—they came together.

MRS. BAILEY. This is my bed—I made the tick, and I know my sewing.

Charlotte Adland Distress was the cause of our doing it. BEAL—

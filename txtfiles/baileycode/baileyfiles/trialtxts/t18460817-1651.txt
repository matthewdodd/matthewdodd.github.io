1651. 




GEORGE KEAN
 was again indicted

 for unlawfully obtaining 2 shillings, and 1 sixpence, from 



Thomas Banbury, by false pretences.






THOMAS BANBURY
. I live in Whitmore-street, Hoxton. On the 20th or 21st of May, the prisoner came to my house in company with a young lad—he said he had come from the brewhouse where I dealt, to look at my house—I said I had some thoughts of letting it—he said he was fatigued, he must come in and sit down, and have a glass or two of ale, for he had walked, having no money, as he had left his purse on the table at home—I showed him over the house—he said he liked it wonderfully—I told him the price was 120l.—he said it was just what my brewer told him it would be—he gave me a draft for 20l. on Jones and Loyd, and I was to come down in the afternoon and settle when he was to come into the house—I gave him 2s. 6d. to pay his carriage back—there was one shilling and three sixpences—I should not have given it him if he had not given me the check—this is the check-in fifteen minutes after he was gone away I saw through the whole case.

Prisoner. Q. Did not I have drink to the amount of 2s. 7 1/2 d. and bread and cheese also? A. No, you had no bread and cheese.





ALFRED WILLIAM BARBER
. I am clerk to Jones, Loyd, and Co., of Lothbury. I know nothing about this check—the prisoner has no account with us, and never had, to my knowledge—(check ready" May 21, 1846,—Please pay the bearer, at Jones, Loyd, and Co., the sum of 20l. on demand.)

Prisoner's Defence. The landlord lent me the half-crown to pay for the beer; I was prepared in the course of three weeks or a month to sell a house and some stables, and to pay the money into the hands of Jones and Loyd, when I should take possession of the house; these two houses are both toge-ther; I went to one because it was better than the other.




GUILTY

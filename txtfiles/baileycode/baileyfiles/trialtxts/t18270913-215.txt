            . I am shopman to David Farrow, a salesman
, of High Holborn


. On the 1st of September the prisoner came, and my boy showed him some things, and called me into the shop; another person came in, and then a third; two of them went into the counting-house, and tried on several pairs of trousers - I had my suspicions. I went and saw the prisoner putting a pair into his hat - the others then went away. I attended to the prisoner - he was there about half an hour; he tried on a pair of drab trousers, and said they would not fit him - he then put on his own. I understood he was going. I walked to the door before him, and accused him of it - he said he had nothing; he took off his hat, and there was nothing in it. I detained him; he unbuttoned his own trousers, and produced this pair from the seat of them.(Property produced and sworn to.)

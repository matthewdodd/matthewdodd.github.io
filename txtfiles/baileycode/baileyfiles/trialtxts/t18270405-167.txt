            . I was going up Dagger-street on the 16th of March, and noticed the prisoner standing at the corner of Margaret-street - I saw two pots on the window of No. 7, with the name of Nunn on them; the prisoner passed me, and took up these two; I pursued her, and when I got near her she put one into her pocket and one into her basket; she threw the one she had in her pocket at my head; I caught it, and then took her to Mr. Nunn's - the other two were found on her.
Prisoner's Defence. I saw the pots - my shoe came untied, and I stooped, but did not take them up.

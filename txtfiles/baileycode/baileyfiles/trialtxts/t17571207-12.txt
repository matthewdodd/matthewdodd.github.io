            . I am an apprentice to Mr. Wiseham, a linen draper
, at the Three Nuns, in the Poultry


. The prisoner came into our shop, and wanted some clear lawn; I cut her off a quarter of a yard.
Q. When was this?
Higgens. I believe it was the 23d or 24th of last month. She wanted some cheque. I went to go to the other end of the shop, and she was going to the other side of the counter. Seeing a ticket, belonging to a lawn, hang below her cloak I ask'd her what she had there. She said, she had nothing. I put my hand under her cloak, and took the lawn from under her arm; there were ten yards of it. I got a constable, and she was put into the compter. The next morning she was taken before my Lord-mayor. ( Produced in court, and deposed to as his master's property.)
Prisoner's Defence.
I bought a quarter of a yard of lawn. Then I wanted to look at some cheque. He said, what have you got under your cloak. I never saw the lawn, till I was before my Lord mayor.




               Guilty, 4 s. 10 d.

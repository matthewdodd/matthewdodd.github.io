             sworn.
I live in Curzon-street, May-fair; I am repairing a large house in Arlington-street


; on the 18th of December, the masons having finished putting up a stone staircase, we had six hundred pounds and a half weight, or thereabouts, of these bannisters brought in by the smiths, in order to be put up, the smiths began and fixed one flight of stairs; but had not time to run the lead in them, therefore fixed them all as they were to be, and rivetted here and there a bar; at five in the evening, when the workmen left work, I saw them in this state; I have two carpenters who sleep in this house with fire arms; one of them is

                   Groome
               



            , a witness; I went home leaving Groome and the other carpenter in the house; about nine the other carpenter came to me, and I went and found the flight of rails with about a dozen taken from the places, and set against the wall; this bar being the last was broke, it hung as it were by a thread; I took it out myself; I knew the bars had been fixed into the stone by their white ends.
Mr. Knowlys, Prisoners Counsel. These were not run with lead? - No, they were finished the next morning.

             sworn.
I heard a noise and called for assistance; and found Price underneath the stairs; these bars were taken out and laid at the corner of the stairs; they were put into the holes that were made for them in the stone; the stone was fixed, and there was a hand rail fixed, that they were fixed to; the other men were found in Thrale's house; the bars were fastened to the top rail, but not to the stone steps; they could not get them out unless they unrivetted those, which must be done by wrenching the top rail.
Court. Could they have taken the wholebody together? - No, because the standard was fixed to the stone.

I took Price from under the stairs; and I helped to secure the other two men; the prisoner Rich said, if he had a pistol he would look as big as me.

, and lives in Baldwin's-gardens

             was in her employ, to assist mostly in the warehouse. In consequence of some suspicion, I charged him on the 18th of March, with stealing some copper money from the cupboard; he hesitated at first, and then denied it, but after some time he said it was of no use to deny it - he turned his pockets out at my desire, and I found on him thirteen duplicates for watches; I gave him into custody - these are the watches; I had not missed them.

            , Esq; sworn.
I have the direction of the works carrying on for the Earl of Uxbridge in Burlington-gardens, Vigo-lane


; my Lord Uxbridge has a house in Burlington-gardens, we had missed several pieces of lead, and other things, and I happened to be there, I think, on the 4th of August, at four in the afternoon, I was informed a man was carrying a grate, and while I was talking about it, the people said he was coming back, I desired him to be brought into the house; while I was talking, I on a sudden missed the man, he had got into the back-yard, and was walking away, not running; I called him, but he did not stop; I went out and seized him by the collar, and brought him in.
Was that the prisoner? - To the best of my recollection, and to the best of my belief he is, I will not swear positively that he is the man, the man was committed; the prisoner took us to a man that lived in Carnaby-street, one Crook, where he had sold it at a penny a pound.
Mr. James, Prisoner's Council. Then the prisoner went voluntarily and shewed you where the grate was? - Yes.
Did you happen to observe, Sir, whether the prisoner was intoxicated or not? - He did not appear to be much intoxicated, there was a sort of stupidity about him; it was an old grate, and had been mended.
Court. Describe the situation of this grate? - There is a plate under the grate, it is under the street.
Mr. Justice Gould. Do you know who was at the expence of putting this grate there? - A person that belonged to the Duke of Queensborough.

             sworn.
I am a smith, I live in Carnaby-street, my wife bought the grate, I was not at home.

                   CROOKE
               



             sworn.
The prisoner brought a grate, and an iron bar to our house, the 4th or 5th of August; he said, here is a bit of old iron for you mistress; I put it into the scales and weighed it, we buy old iron, it weighed thirty-seven pounds, I gave him three shillings and one penny for it.

Is that the used price for old iron? - Yes.
Did he say how he came by it? - No, nor I had not the presence of mind to ask him, because he brought it in open daylight on his head.
(The grate produced by 
               
                  John

            .)
This is the grate, I always buy every thing in open day-light.
Court. But then you see, from this instance, how necessary it is to distrust a little.

                   ROBJOHN
               



             sworn.
I fixed this iron at the front of Queensborough-house about May last, by the orders of the Duke of Queensborough's servants, I know it to be the same iron.

             sworn.
I saw the prisoner go down Cork-street with this grate on his head, on Thursday, which was the day on which it was missed; it wanted about ten minutes of six; I cannot say he was sober, he was rather in liquor.


                  JAMES
                   THOMPSON
               



             sworn.
When we went before Justice Hyde, he desired me to take the dimensions of this grate, I measured it, and it tallies with the hole.
Mr. James. My Lord, I am instructed that this was not fixed, but was found, if so, it will do away the indictment.

                   COWPER
               



             sworn.
Were you in company with the prisoner on the 4th of August in the afternoon? - I was going past there accidentally in the course of my business, I observed the prisoner pick up a grate, I was very high Cork-street, by Burlington-buildings, and I saw a grate lay there, and the prisoner came up to me, and asked me, if it belonged to me; I told him no, I knew nothing about it, then says he, I will take it up, and make some beer of it.
Were these the particular expressions he made use of? - Yes.
Are you positive of that? - Yes.
What part of Cork-street was it? - Near Burlington-buildings.
Vardy. After you have passed Cork-street before you come to Vigo-lane, the outside of the house is pallisaded in the coach-way.
Court to Cowper. What part of the street was it in? - In the road-way, quite from the kirb, it was detached from any buildings, it was laying by itself.
Was it in the street that communicates into Saville-street? - It was laying upside down, quite in the middle of the coachway, not on the pavement.

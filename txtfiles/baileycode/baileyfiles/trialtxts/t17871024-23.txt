             sworn.
I am a labourer
; I hired a lodging of the prisoner in Goldsmith's-alley


 for a night; I did not sleep with them; I had a bed of them, and after I was in bed, they robbed me of my clothes; I was to pay them a shilling for the lodging; I went to bed and fell in sleep, and when I awoke, I found my things were gone at half after five in the morning; when I got up, I was informed the prisoners were in custody.

             sworn.
I was the officer of the night; about half after five, the watchman brought in the prisoners at the bar; one of them had a coat in her lap; I asked her how she come by it; she said, it was her brother's, and she was going to carry it to the tailor's to be mended, that was the prisoner Ayres; I looked at the coat and saw it did not want mending; says I, this coat is stolen somewhere, I shall stop you; I searched Wood, and under her petticoats, I found this pair of breeches.

             sworn.
I am a watchman in Plubtree-street, St. Giles's; I asked the prisoner Ayres, what she had in her lap; she made me no answer; Wood said, it was a coat belonging to her husband, it was going to the tailor's, and I asked her what her husband was; she said, a hackney coachman; says I, this is not a hackney coachman's coat; it does not belong to him; Ayres said, her husband was a tailor, it was going to him to be mended; I took them into custody.
(The coat deposed to.)
PRISONER AYRES's DEFENCE.
I was going home between eleven andtwelve, this man had a very elderly woman; he asked us to shew him a lodging; we shewed him to one; we came out and left him, and there is a woman that laid very ill in the house where he lodged; she desired us to get up and get something to drink, and she gave us these things; I never took any notice of the man's clothes, or saw what colour they were.
The prisoner Wood, said the same.

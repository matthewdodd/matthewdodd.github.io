ELIZABETH COOK
. I am the wife of William Cook, who is a shipmaster, and lives in Myddleton-square. On the 4th of May the policeman called at five o'clock in the morning—I got up and went into the area—the area door is generally kept locked, but it was not so that night—on looking at the safe I missed the property stated, which I had seen safe the afternoon before—the safe was not locked that night—I know nothing of the prisoner—I know this sack by a direction card which is on it.





THOMAS MARTIN
. I am a policeman. On the 4tb of May, at half-past four o'clock in the morning, I met the prisoner, carrying a sack—he turned out of the square, down Arlington-street, and got over a wall adjoining Sadler's Wells Theatre—he handed the sack to a man who was with him when he was on the top of the wall—I secured the prisoner, and the other escaped.

Prisoner's Defence. I was going down Chad well-street, and met two men, who asked me to carry the sack, which I did—I was not getting over the wall.




GUILTY
. Aged 18.—


Transported for Seven Years.

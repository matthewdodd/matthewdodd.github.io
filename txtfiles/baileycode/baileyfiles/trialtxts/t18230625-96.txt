            . I live in the Strand. On the 17th of May, about three o'clock in the afternoon, I was between Arundel-street, and Norfolk-street, in the Strand


, and felt something at my pocket, which made me turn round. I saw the prisoner close behind me, and another behind him. I seized and charged him with picking my pocket; he denied it, but I saw my handkerchief in his left hand, while I was turning round; he was passing it to his companion, but dropped it. I picked it up, and recognized him, as having attempted my pocket a few hours before - the other went off.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner Defence. I never saw it.

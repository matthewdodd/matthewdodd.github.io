, stealing 1 quadrant, value 2l. 10s., and 1 waistcoat, 10s.; the goods of 



John Malcolm Scott; having been before convicted.






JOHN MALCOLM SCOTT
. I am a mariner. I got acquainted with the prisoner about 7th Nov.—I went to a public-house and talked and drank with him—he was going to put me on board a ship—I gave him a quadrant and waistcoat—he told me he had a ship—he went away with my quadrant—this is it (produced).





WILLIAM CHARLES POTTER
 (policeman, K 212). I took the prisoner—I asked him where the quadrant was—he said he knew not—I found it at the Whit by coffee-shop—his wife brought it there in Scott's presence, and left it there, when the prisoner was remanded—this is it—the waistcoat has not been found.

Prisoner. I told you I had the quadrant, and put it on the seat in the public-house. Witness. No, you said you knew nothing of it; you believed the other man stole it.

Prisoner's Defence. I knew nothing of it from the time I put it on the seat of the public-house.





CHARLES PILCHER
 (policeman, K 190). I produce a certificate of the prisoner's conviction—(read—Convicted May, 1847, confined one year)—he is the man.




GUILTY
. Aged 29. 


Transported for Seven Tears.

FREDERICK JOHN FRANCIS GEORGE ROBERT DE SEIG-NEUX. I lodge at the house of Mrs. 
               
                  Clara 
                  Simpson
               



            , the prisoner's mother, in 
               Henrietta-street, Covent-garden
             - she is a widow. I missed a good many things at different times, and among the rest, a shirt and five handkerchiefs were taken out of my bed-room drawers, which is on the second floor - I occupy all the second floor; I charged the prisoner with taking my shirt; he denied it - I found it on his back, and when he found there was an officer in the next room, and that I had marks on the shirt, he said, "It is your's," and took it off; I never gave him authority to take it - he slept on the fourth floor, and had no business in my room; some of the marks had been cut off the shirt, but I knew it by a peculiar seam; the handkerchiefs were also produced to me.

            . I keep the Globe tavern in Fleet-street




. On the 16th of this instant I saw the prisoner in my kitchen, a little before three o'clock. I thought he was acquainted with some of my servants, and took but little notice of him. Some little time after I was going into the kitchen, I saw the cook talking to my little girl. He told me, she was telling him a man was gone out with something under his coat. I went into the kitchen, and said, I saw nothing but two boats; the maid said, she had just brought three there. I followed the cook, and saw him stop the prisoner in the passage before he got out into the street; he brought him back; the cook clapt his hand on his coat, and said, Sir, here is the sauce-boat; then he took it out of his pocket. (Produced and deposed to.)

             the cook confirmed the prosecutor's evidence.

I was very much in liquor; I knew no more about it than the child unborn. I have lived in credit many years.

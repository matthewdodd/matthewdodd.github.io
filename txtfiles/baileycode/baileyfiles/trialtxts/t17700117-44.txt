            . I am a stationer
, and live in the Minories


. On the 5th of this instant, between six and seven in the evening, I and my man were looking over my book. The maid gave an alarm. She said she saw a man take a bundle of paper away. I ran out and detected the prisoner with it, about three or four doors from my house. ( Produced and deposed to). He dropt it, and ran; but I called stop thief, and he was taken, and brought back; I followed him very close.
Prisoner's Defence.
I picked up that bundle as I was running along the Minories. I have a witness here will make an affidavit he saw me pick it up.

            . I never knew the prisoner till a fortnight ago last night. I met him in the Minories. I saw him pick up a bundle. He described it to be above as big again as the bundle produced. He could not tell the colour of it. He never spoke to the prisoner till he went to him in Newgate, he said, to tell him what he saw, and that he know where to find him by the news-paper, but could neither write nor read.

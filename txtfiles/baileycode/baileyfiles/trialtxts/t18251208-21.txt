FRANCES ALEXANDER. I am a widow, and live in Thames-street


 - this cloak was up three pair of stairs - I missed it about half-past eleven o'clock on the morning of the 5th of December; it was safe an hour before. The prisoner is a stranger. I saw it again in an hour, when the officer called me down.

            . I am a constable. On the 5th of December, about half-past eleven o'clock in the morning, I was in Great Bush-lane, and saw the prisoner and another coming towards the prosecutrix's house - I watched them, and saw the prisoner enter this house - the other waited outside; I walked by, but he was not in the passage - in about five minutes he came out with this cloak in a wrapper; he went up Little Bush-lane; I went up Great Bush-lane, and stopped him - his companion was gone. I took him to the house; he said he had picked it up in the passage; I rung the bell, and the prosecutrix claimed it.(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I went to see if one of the postboy's mothers lived there, and found the cloak in the passage.

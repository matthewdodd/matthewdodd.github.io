FREDERICK BUCKINGHAM
. I am the son of Robert Buckingham, a linen-draper in Shoreditch. On the 22nd of October I saw the prisoner near the door of our shop with some others—the prisoner stole this calico from outside the door—I went after her, and four or five doors from the shop I laid hold of her—she asked what I wanted of her—I said she had a piece of calico—she denied it—I took it from her, and my brother came up and took her back. I had only put this out ten minutes before—there are 63 yards of it.





HENRY COLTON
. I am a policeman. I took the prisoner.

Prisoner's Defence. I was going down Shoreditch, and two girls threw it on my arm.




GUILTY

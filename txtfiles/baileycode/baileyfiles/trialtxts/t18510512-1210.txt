MR. METCALFE
conducted the Prosecution






WILLIAM MEADS
 I am a farmer, and live at Bowditch. I bought a horse and a mare—the prisoner was with the man I bought them of—on 25th April, about the middle of the day, he passed by my house—I saw the hone and mare safe that evening in the yard; the gate was shut—on the following morning, between five and six o'clock, the horse and mare were missing—they were brought back to me by a policeman—I am certain they are mine.

Cross-examined by
MR. HORRY
Q. Where did you buy them? A. At Bowditch—the man was travelling about the country.





JOHN BRADDICK
 (police-sergeant, R 46). My beat is at Shooter's-hill. On Saturday, 26th April, I saw the prisoner leading two horses along the road, about ten o'clock—I asked him whose they were—he said his own; and he had bought them that morning at Dartford-heath, of Jack Smith—I asked who he was—he said he did not know; he gave him 50s. for them—I took him, and afterwards heard of this robbery.

Cross-examined. Q. How far is it from Dartford to where you met the prisoner? A. About seven miles: Bowditch is about twenty-five miles from Dartford. (The prisoner received a good character.)

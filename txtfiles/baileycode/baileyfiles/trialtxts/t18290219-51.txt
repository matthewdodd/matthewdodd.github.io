, of Mount-street


. On the 23d of January, I missed three books, which I had seen immediately before; I ran out and saw the prisoner turning the corner of Charles-street - I saw her, so as to know her again; I had not known her before - I went back and called a person down to mind the shop; I then pursued and took her in Thomas'-street - I told her to deliver up the books which she had got; she gave them me from under her shawl, these are them.
Prisoner. I went to buy a sheet of paper, a memorandum-book, and two wafers. Witness. Yes, she did, and while I was stooping to get the wafers, she must have taken the books from the counter.

            . I am an officer. I took the prisoner.
Prisoner's Defence. My husband will not allow me any thing to live on. On the 18th of September, I was indicted for a nuisance, and the officers took 4l. worth of strawberries; they were kept in the watch-house till they were all spoiled, but I got the cause at Guildhall, and since then they have been trying to injure me.

            . On the 14th of November, about eight o'clock in the evening, I was in Queen-street, Soho


 - a man came up behind me, took off my hat, and ran off with it; I gave an alarm. I did not see who it was. He was followed and secured, but not in my sight.

            . I was in Queen-street, heard the cry, and met the prisoner running with the hat in his hand at the corner of Frith-street - I collared him; he struggled, and got from me, turned the corner, and in Soho-square I saw him stopped again.

            . I heard the cry; the prisoner ran up Frith-street very hard, and had something which he flung away. I stopped him; he said he was innocent. The last witness came up, and assisted in taking him back. A gentleman brought back the hat.

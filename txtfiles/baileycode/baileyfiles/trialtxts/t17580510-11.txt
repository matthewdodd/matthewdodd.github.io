            , the prisoner used to come begging to my door about two years ago. I once about that time let her come into my house, after which I missed a silver spoon. My servant found her in the street, and brought her to my house, we charged her with taking the silver spoon; she confessed she did take it away.
Prisoner's defence.
I hope the court will forgive me: I will never do so again.

MARY ANN WOOD
. I am single, and live in Market-street, Edgeware-road. I met the prisoner in the street, on the morning of the 10th of Oct.—I went home to sleep with him—when I awoke at seven o'clock in the morning he was gone, and had taken my shawl, gown, and the other things.

Cross-examined by
MR. PAYNE. Q. What time did he go with you? A. One in the morning—I think he was with me an hour before I went to sleep—he did not give me any thing—he left his watch with me, and I put itintoa drawer in a chest of drawers in my room—he took it out afterwards—I have not got we watch—he did not appear to have been drinking—I had no quarrel with him—these are my things—I lodge in my own room—I had never seen him before—he was to have staid all night with me—he dropped a card in my place—I went to the place mentioned on it the next morning, and heard of him—he first spoke to me, and asked to go home with me—he was sober.






MARY ANN HATSWELL
. I am unfortunate—I lost a candlestick, and a razor that night—these are them.

Cross-examined. Q. What do you do with the razor? A. I am troubled with corns.





ANDREW NELSON
 (police-constable D 150.) I met the prisoner about half-past three o'clock that morning, with this bundle of things under his arm—he told me a great many falsehoods, and I took him.
(Richard Tozer, a master chimney sweeper, in Adam's-mews, and John Addis, gave the prisoner a good character.)




GUILTY
. Aged 34.—


Transported for Seven Years.

ELIZA GOODWIN
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
8th of April, 2 sheets, value 2s., the goods of 



Honora Foley.






HONORA FOLEY, JUN
. I am the daughter of Honora Foley; she is a widow, and lives in Tindal's-buildings, Gray's-inn-lane. Between seven and eight o'clock in the morning, on the 8th of April, I was in Pheasant-court, and saw the prisoner by Fox-court, with the sheets in her apron-directly she saw me she ran into a rag-shop—I ran after her, up some stairs, and asked her for the sheets—she would not give them to me—a policeman came by, and I gave her in charge—I missed the sheets from Spread Eagle-court—the door was shut—she must have come through the cellar to get them, as she used to visit a woman up stairs—one of the sheets is torn all to pieces.





JOHN BULLOCK
 (police-constable G 116.) I was standing at the station-house door, and saw Foley with the prisoner—I took the sheets from her.
(Property produced and sworn to.)




GUILTY
.* Aged 17.—


Transported for Seven Years.—Recommended to the Penitentiary.

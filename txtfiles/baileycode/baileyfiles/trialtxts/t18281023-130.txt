            . I am a pawnbroker, and live in Broad-street, Ratcliff. These pictures were pawned with me, on the 6th of September, in the afternoon, by a man, in the name of William Hardy; I believe the prisoner to have been the man: I remember seeing him in the shop - I gave him a duplicate; I live about a mile and a half from the prosecutor's.

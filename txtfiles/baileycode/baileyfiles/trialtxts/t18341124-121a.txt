Two other Counts, varying the manner of stating the charge.





WILLIAM PARKER
. I live at No. 19, North-bank, Regent's-park. The prisoner, Ann Coates the younger, lived servant with me about eleven months—about five or six months ago, we missed a great number of articles—we had missed some before, but we missed more then—we continually missed things, up to the day she ran away, which was the 4th of November—on that day I went into the kitchen, with an intention of speaking to her—she went down on her knees, took hold of my hand,

and said she had taken one of my shirts, and six of my little boy's, and given them to her mother, who had pawned them, but she should receive money next day, and would get them—I said she had robbed me to a great extent, and I could not listen to her—I can swear to these eight spoons, and to all the property here—many of the articles have my name marked in full on them.





JOHN WARREN
. I am assistant to a pawnbroker, in John-street, Edgware-road. I produce a child's petticoat, pawned for 9d., some stockings, spoons, and a great variety of articles, pawned at different times by Ann Coates the elder—she had redeemed many of them and pawned them again—she has been a regular customer at our shop.





JAMES WALLIS
. I am a pawnbroker. I have a child's coat, a shirt, and a shift, pawned by Ann Coates the elder, at different times.





JOSEPH NOCK
. I am a pawnbroker. I have a shirt, a book, and some other articles, pawned by Ann Coates the elder.





GEORGE TAYLOR
. I am a pawnbroker. I have five shirts, two waistcoats, three handkerchiefs, a pincloth, and a variety of other articles, pawned by Ann Coates the elder.





HENRY MATTHEW BAYFIELD
. I am a pawnbroker. I have a shift, a petticoat, and some other things, pawned by the elder Coates.





JAMES REARDON
. I am a pawnbroker. I have a pillow, a pair of stockings, a pinafore, a child's belt, and some other things, pawned at our shop, but the person who took them in has left us—these are the duplicates given for them.





JOHN TAYLOR
 (police-serjeant S 71.) I went to the elder Coates's house with Mr. Parker—I found her and Thompson there—I found in a mug ninety-seven duplicates, some of which relate to the property produced—seventeen of them, she said, were her own property—I found there two plates, two basins, one cup, one knife, and a mug, which are Mr. Parker's, but Thompson said they were hers.

Ann Coates, the younger. I should wish the goods to be sorted—some of them are our own—Miss Parker gave me a great many things—it was done through distress, and Miss Parker knew it a month or six weeks before.

MR. PARKER. These are all my things—my daughter gave the prisoner a variety of things—but my daughter went with me, and every thing that there was the slightest doubt about, was put on one side.

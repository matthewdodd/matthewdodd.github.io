GEORGE HAMILTON
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
21st of April, 1 pocket-book, value 3s., the goods of

BENJAMIN WEBSTER
. I live at No. 13, Old Brompton, On the 21st of April, about six o'clock in the evening, I was at the Hungerford steam-boat pier—as I was stepping from one steam-boat to another I felt a tug at my pocket—I turned round, and saw the prisoner close behind me—he immediately made away round the fannel of the steam-boat—I felt, and missed my pocketbook—I went round the funnel and called out, he ran to me in great agitation,

and handed me my pocket-book, and said, "I trust you will treat me like a gentleman"—he was going from the vessel towards land—he had not come out of any vessel—I have the pocket-book, and produce it.

Cross-examined by
MR. PAYNE. Q. What pocket was it in? A. My coat-pocket—I had some papers in the same pocket—my handkerchief was in Another pocket—I had not used my pocket-book for two or three hours—I was about a yard from the funnel when I felt something at my pocket—it was a Greenwich boat—he was not above a yard off when he produced the pocketbook—he had gone round the funnel, and I called to him, "Halloo, you sir, stop"—he then came to me, and handed it to me—he did not say he had picked it up—he said so at the office, not before.





JEAN KEPPLER
 (through an interpreter.) I was with the prosecutor, and saw the prisoner with the pocket-book in his hand—I did not see him do anything.

Cross-examined. Q. How was the prisoner standing in reference to the prosecutor? A. Back to back—when I first saw him he had the book in his hand.





CHARLES BURGESS GOFF
. I am a policeman. I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction—(read)—he is the person who was convicted.

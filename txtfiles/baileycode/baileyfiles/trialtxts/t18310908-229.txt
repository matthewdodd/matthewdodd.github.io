JOHN CORNELIOUS. I live with my parents, in Field-lane, Holborn. On Saturday, the 2nd of July, I was in Gray's Inn-lane


, selling water-cresses - I saw the prisoner go to Mr. Nichols' shop, and pull down a piece of print, tuck it under her clothes, and walk away - I told the shopman; he followed her, and took hold of her arm - she then dropped the cotton.

            . I was shopman to the prosecutor. In consequence of what I heard I went and stopped the prisoner in Fox-court, and the cotton fell from her clothes - she walked back with me a little way, then dragged herself from me; she got into a passion, and struck me several times, with such violence as to make me let her go - when she got into Gravel-lane the Police-officer came up, and took her.

            . I am an officer. I received charge of the prisoner; I saw her strike the witness very violently, and her hands were bleeding; I took her to the watch-house - she wanted to make it up, and said she knew what she had done, that she had been guilty of shoplifting, and she should be committed to Newgate - I did not perceive she was intoxicated.(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I picked up the cotton, but I was a little in liquor, or I should not have done so.

            . Aged 29. - 


               Transported for Seven Years

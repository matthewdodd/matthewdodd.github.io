            . I am an errand carrier
; I left my cart, in Lime-street


, for about twenty minutes; I came back and went on with it; about twenty minutes after Prichard's servant came to me, and asked what I had done with the hat-box. I went to look for it, and it was gone; it was put at the tail of the cart, and covered over with a cloth.

            . I saw the prisoner running down Rood-lane with the box in his hand; he held it under his apron; I asked him where he was going with it; he said he was employed to carry it to Newington. I said it was directed to Mr. Fielding, Haslemere. He then said he found it in Fenchurch-street; I took him to Dollman and Co., the place where it was bought, and he was taken into custody.
RICHARD KNAPP. I gave the hat to the carrier that morning.

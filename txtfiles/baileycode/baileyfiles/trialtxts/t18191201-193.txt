            . On the 8th of November, I was in Broad-street, Bloomsbury, at the corner of Dyot-street


. I saw the prisoner and two others following two gentlemen, who were arm-in-arm. I saw the prisoner take a handkerchief out of one of their pockets. I secured him, and he threw it away - the gentleman held him while I picked it up. The gentleman gave him to me - he fell down in the road - I took him up; he cut me, and knocked my hat off. I lost a silk handkerchief out of my hat. Twenty or thirty thieves came round - nobody would assist me; I, however, secured him. He said it was his birth-day.

            . I was in Broad-street, and saw two gentlemen leaving the crowd, saying,
"D - n it, let him go, he has stolen my handkerchief." I went up, and saw Furzeman on the ground, and the prisoner beating him. There were above one hundred people around, and nobody would help. I assisted to take him to the watch-house.

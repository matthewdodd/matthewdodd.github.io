LUCY ELDON
. I am cook to James Walkingham, Clarence-terrace, Regent's-park. At a quarter past ten o'clock, on the morning of the 18th of August, I was at the end of the passage leading to the area down below—I heard a person coming down the steps into the passage, on tiptoe—I listened, and heard them retreat—I went to the door, and saw a man a few steps up with a bundle—I ran up the area steps, and then I saw him running up the terrace with the bundle, accompanied by another man—I ran after them, and called, "Stop thief"—I ran till the gatekeeper took the prisoner—he threw the bundle down—I am sure he is the person—I did not lose sight of him.





JOHN BROWN
. I am gate-keeper at Clarence-gate. I took the prisoner, and saw him drop the bundle—he made his escape for a short time, but I took him again.





JOHN WISE
. I am a policeman. I took the prisoner.





CHARLES COTTAGE
. I am servant to James Walkingham. These are my property—they were in the pantry, hanging behind the door—I left home about five minutes before ten o'clock.

Prisoner's Defence. I saw the bundle on the ground, and nearly fell over it. I did not run away with it.

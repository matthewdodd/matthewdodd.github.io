THOMAS CRUMP
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
29th of September, 19 yards of flannel, value 15s., the goods of 



George Hinde Smith.






FRANCIS BENNET SWAN
. I am assistant to George Hinde Smith, who lives in Pleasant-place, Kingsland-road. On the 29th of September I missed a roll of nineteen yards of flannel, which had been just inside the sill of the door, tied by a string—I looked out, and saw the prisoner with something under his arm, covered with his great coat—I ran up—three or four persons ran, and when I got up, the flannel was on the ground, and the prisoner running away—the flannel was taken to my master's, and it was his property—it was dropped about fifty yards from the shop—I did not see him drop it.

Cross-examined by
MR. PAYNE. Q. Was it not a quarter of a mile off where the prisoner was taken? A. Yes—there was no necessity to come in-doors to take it—there is a mark on it—I had never seen the prisoner before—he was about thirty yards from me—he had his back towards me—he said it was not him.





JOHN TOUGE
. I am a warehouseman. I was going along the road, and the prisoner came running towards me with a roll of flannel under his left arm, under his coat—when he came within a yard of me, he dropped it—I stood by it till the shopman came—I am sure he is the person.

Cross-examined. Q. Were there not some ladies there? A. There were two, but I was not noticing them.





WILLIAM NEAL
. I heard a cry of "Stop thief"—the prisoner was running—I pursued, and took him about thirty yards down a street which he turned down—I brought him back to the shop, and gave him to the policeman.





WILLIAM HODGE
 (police-constable N 97.) I took the prisoner, and have the flannel.

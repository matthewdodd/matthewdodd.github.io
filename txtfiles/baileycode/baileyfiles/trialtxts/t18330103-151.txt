. On the 4th of December I let the prisoner a bed-room for the night; he paid for it, and went to bed about ten o'clock - on the next morning, he went away, and a few minutes after he was gone, I missed some pictures from the room he slept in; I went and found him in the Crown public-house, and gave him into custody - he said if I would not hurt him, he would show me where the pictures were; he took me to a broker's, where he had sold them.

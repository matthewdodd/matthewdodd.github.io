             sworn.
I can only say that the things were lost, and when they were missed we suspected the person that stole them, and took her up, she used to chare
 at our house to assist the maid.
When did you miss the things? - The 5th of July, I think, there was some money in a tea-chest, a guinea, two crown pieces, and five half crowns missed, then the maid began to imagine it must be this prisoner, then we went to see if every thing was safe; the things in the indictment were kept up stairs, we went up and missed them, on the Sunday we secured Mary Hardy and the evidence 
               
                  Rachel
                   Cloak
               



            , and we took them before Mr. Alderman Hart, he dismissed them till we could find 
               
                  Sarah
                   Pearson
               



            ; I know none of the parties but the person that committed the robbery; upon her examination she confessed taking the things, that confession was made freely of her own accord.
No promise? - None in the world, and 
               
                  Rachael
                   Cloak
               



             the evidence, confessed taking them to 
               
                  Sarah
                   Pearson
               



            , who said if she could get any thing and bring to her, she would maintain her if her father and mother turned her out.
Were any of the things found afterwards? - Yes, there are two rings, one of them I can swear to.
Where were they found? - At Mr. Davison's, pawnbroker, in Shoreditch, the hoop diamond ring was offered there, but they would not take it, we found a silver egg that she pawned at Mr. Townsend's in Hair-alley.
How came it to be so long after the robbery before they were tried? - Mr. Alderman Hart said we should let it alone till we could find 
               
                  Sarah
                   Pearson
               



            ; then they were all taken up again on the Sunday.

                   Pearson
               



             lodged there, and she asked me to go and meet 
               
                  Mary
                   Hardy
               



             coming from work, she said she would be there in the morning, and I might go with her, I went there, I was to meet her to take what she gave me to carry to 
               
                  Sarah
                   Pearson
               



            ; I believe this is almost seven months ago, I knew nothing more of it at that time, I went and met her at her master's door, and she gave me a plain gold ring, and several things at different times; she gave me nine rings in all, and a silver egg-box, a mother of pearl box set with silver, and one diamond hoop ring; when I met 
               
                  Mary

            's of a morning, the prisoner Hardy went to her father when she had given me the things.

            , I met her once by her master's door, and another time in Moorfields; Pearson said when I brought them to her she would make me a present.
What did she give you? - A linen gown, and when she run away she took the gown with her again.
She did not tell you before that what these things were that you were to bring to her? - No.
Did you ever hear any conversation before that pass between her and Hardy about taking any thing? - Never.
How long have you known Hardy? - I lived at a publick-house almost by her.

PRISONER HARDY'S DEFENCE.
Cloak was the person that persuaded me to do it; she begged and prayed, that if so be I would rob my master, she would take a room, and she would take care I should never be taken up; and she took a room.

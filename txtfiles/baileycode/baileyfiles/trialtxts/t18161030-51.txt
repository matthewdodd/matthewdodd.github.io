            , THE YOUNGER. On the 19th of October, between two and three o'clock, a man called at my warehouse, and asked me if I had any suspicion of any of my men robbing me; I told him no. He then told me that my porter was in the custody of Harrison, the city officer. Soon after, Harrison brought the prisoner to Cateaton-street, and produced the wire in question, which was our property.

            . In consequence of private information I received from the last witness, I watched a notorious receiving house, and I saw the prisoner come down Whitecross-street, and go into it. I followed him, and took him into custody, and on searching him, found the wire in question on him.

ANN NUTTER
. I live in Park-place, Islington. On the 19th of August, I was on my way home with Mrs. Gray, and was carrying her baby—I had my reticule on my left arm—it contained a frock body, a bag, a handkerchief, and comb—I saw some boys about about—the prisoner was one—I felt a pull at my arm, and the string of the reticule broke—I turned and saw the prisoner running away; with the reticule—this is it—the frock body was Mrs. Gray's—the rest of the things are mine.





MARTHA GRAY
. I am the wife of George Gray of Shepperton Cottages. Ann Nutter is my sister—I was going home that evening—two boys came up—I did not see either of them snatch the bag, but I saw the prisoner running away with it—I ran after him—he was stopped in my presence, and the reticule produced—this frock body is mine.





JOHN LAKE
. I am a solicitor, and live at Hackney. I was going home, and saw the prisoner running from the ladies—I pursed him—when I came up he dropped the reticule, which was handed to the policeman—the prisoner said he should not have done it himself, but the other boy put him up to it.





SAMUEL NORTH
 (police constable N 94.) The reticule was given to me with the prisoner.

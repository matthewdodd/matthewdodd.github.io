            . On the 29th of July, about half after six in the afternoon, coming down Devonshire-street


 from the square, I was told I had lost my handkerchief; I put my hand in my pocket and missed it directly; I had passed the prisoner just before. (The handkerchief produced and deposed to by the prosecutor).

            . I saw the prisoner take the handkerchief out of the prosecutor's pocket, and run away; I pursued him and cryed stop thief, and Cumberland stopped him.

            . I stopped the prisoner and pulled the handkerchief from under the flap of his waistcoat; it hung down as he ran along.
The prisoner said nothing in his defence.

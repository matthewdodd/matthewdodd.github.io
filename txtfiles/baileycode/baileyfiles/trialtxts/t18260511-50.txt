THOMAS WOOD. I keep a chandler's-shop
, and live in Worship-street


. On the evening of the 1st of May I saw the prisoner pass the window several times while I sat in the back parlour - he was a stranger to me; I heard someone in the shop, and run out - I pursued the prisoner, and asked him if he had stolen any thing of mine; he took these two shillings out of his mouth - they had been in my till. He said, "This is all I have got of your's."

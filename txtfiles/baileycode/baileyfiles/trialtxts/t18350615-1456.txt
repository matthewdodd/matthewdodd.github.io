THOMAS FISHER
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the

JAMES FRANCIS KITE
. I am a gardener, and live at Hackney. I have known the prisoner a long while—on the 20th of May I missed some garden-pots—I made inquiries—I ran out and saw the prisoner with then in his arms—he was a hundred yards a-head of me—when he saw me he ran to the hedge—I ran to him, and asked him for my own—he said, "You shan't have them; rather than you shall have them, I will smash them all to bits, and smash you afterwards"—he broke them all to pieces, but I saw they were mine.

Prisoner. I went into his garden, as be had owed me 6d. from the 17th when he came and called me up at three o'clock in the morning to go to market. Witness. I never owed him any thing in my life—I have heard the he slept in my shed, but not to my knowledge—I never hired him to work for me—he has worked without my asking him—I have always satisfied him afterwards—I have given him victuals, but he never boarded with me.

Prisoner. I went for my 6d.—he said he could not give me that, but he would give me ten pots, and he put them into my arms—I went out with them, and then be ran after me, and wanted them back again—he took hold of them, and they broke, being damaged.

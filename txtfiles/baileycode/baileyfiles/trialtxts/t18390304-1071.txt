1071. 




MICHAEL FLINN
 was indicted

for embezzlement.






WILLIAM COOK
. I am a glass grinder—the prisoner was my apprentice. On the 27th of February I sent him to Newington Butts, with some articles, to Mr. Brown—the bill was 7s. 6d.—he was to receive the money, but he only received 5s.—it was his duty to bring it home, and give it to me directly—he never returned at all.





JAMES CUNNINGHAM
. I am clerk to Mr. Brown, a window-glass cotter. The prisoner brought the goods to me—the bill was 7s. 6d.—I paid him only 5s., as I thought there was an over-charge—this is the receipt he wrote in my presence.





WILLIAM PRIMROSE
 (police-constable F 102.) I found the prisoner in Covent-garden market, and took him.

Prisoner. I was coming home, and lost the money out of my pocket.




GUILTY
.* Aged 18.—


Transported for Seven Years.

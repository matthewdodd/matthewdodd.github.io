            . I am a jeweller
, and live in Middle-row, Holborn. On the 4th of July I was in Covent Garden


; a man touched me on the shoulder, and asked if I had lost my handkerchief; I felt and missed it. The prisoner was about one hundred yards off with a companion - we secured him.

            . I am a broker, and live at Battle-bridge. On the day of the Westminster meeting I was at Covent Garden, and saw the prosecutor standing by a man who was selling a composition, and saw the prisoner with two more try several gentlemens' pockets. I saw him try Simpson's pocket, then go away and bring two more; then saw him take the handkerchief from the prosecutor's pocket. I asked him if he had lost anything - he said he had. When they saw me touch the prosecutor, two went one way, and the other another. I seized the prisoner, but did not find the handkerchief.

Q. Had you an order from Mr. Curtis, of Plymouth - A. I had.
Q. On the 27th of January, did you pack up any books to go to Mr. Curtis - A. There was a parcel packed up by my man to send to Mr. Curtis; they were examined prior to their being packed up, and by me. I saw the parcel after they were packed up. They were to go to the Cannon coffee-house, Charing Cross, to be forwarded by the Exeter coach. They were directed to Mr.

            . I am guard to the Exeter coach. I received the parcel of the last witness on the 27th of January, at six o'clock in the evening. It was directed to Mr. 
               
                  William 
                  Curtis
               



            , bookseller, Plymouth. I put it into the hind boot. It went with the coach from town to Kensington. At Kensington I had occasion to speak to the coachman about some tolls, I got on the roof of the coach; I was alarmed by some boys. I got down; I saw a parcel and a box was gone. They throwed the box into a ditch; I recovered the box, but not the parcel.

Q. Do you know the persons you pursued - A. No.
Q. You lost from your boot a box and a parcel - A. I did; the box I recovered again. I saw but one man.

                  WESTBROOK
               



            . I am a Bow-street patrol. I was on duty this evening at Kensington; I met the prisoner and two more men about two hundred yards this side of Kensington turnpike; the three men passed me. I thought I knew the prisoner; I said to my brother officer that was with me, there are three thieves going along the road; and before we crossed the road we saw a small cart walking by the side of a waggon. We followed the waggon. We saw the guard of the waggon; he said he had some suspicion they were going to rob the waggon. Just before they got into Kensington the cart stopped, and the waggon went on. I directly saw two of the men cross out of the foot-path; they went towards the cart; they had some little conversation. I said to Mills, there is something coming. I heard something coming through Kensington. He said he did; and as soon as ever the coach came by (it turned out to be the Exeter coach) the prisoner and the other man jumped from the cart when the coach past. The prisoner and the other man followed the coach as fast as they could run. They had not run far before one of the three men was up on the coach, in the boot; the other men were following. I heard something fall from the coach, where the men in the bottle-green coat was. I said to Miles, stop; he did. We board the parcel drop close to the wheel.
Q. What time of night was it - A. About ten minutes before seven o'clock. It was a wet night, dark, and not many people on the road. Directly I saw the prisoner pick up the parcel I jumped from the footpath and took him into custody. I said to him, I know you, none of your tricks, if you do I will cut your ear off. I directly drawed my cutlass. I took the prisoner into the Adam and Eve public-house; I searched him; he had a knife, one shilling, and a watch upon him. I left the prisoner in Miles's custody.
Q. What cart was it - A. A light jockey cart, with a very good horse indeed to it. I think we had some moon at the time.
Q. How long before you saw somebody following the coach had you seen these three men together - A. Not ten minutes.
Q. Did they get into the cart - A. No, they went and talked to the men in the cart. This is the parcel I took from the prisoner's shoulder.
Q. to Mr. Rees. Look at the parcel - A. This is the parcel I sent to Mr. Curtis, of Plymouth; they are my property.
Prisoner's Defence. I was returning from Brentford; that gentleman took me into custody. I was not in the coach, nor in the middle of the road, nor had I the parcel on my shoulder.

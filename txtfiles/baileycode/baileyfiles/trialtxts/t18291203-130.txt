WILLIAM JAMES. I am a servant
 out of place. On the 9th of November I was in Blackfriars


, among the crowd, looking at the Lord Mayor's show; I felt my handkerchief taken from my pocket, turned round, and saw the prisoner with it hanging out of his coat-pocket; I pulled it from him, and an officer took him.
Prisoner. Q. Can you look me in the face and say youtook it out of my coat-pocket? I had no pocket. A. It was inside his coat, in an inside pocket.
WILLIAM HICKS. I am a labourer. I saw the handkerchief inside the prisoner's coat-pocket, and took him into custody.
Prisoner. Q. Did you see it taken out of my pocket? A. Yes, it hung down from your side coat-pocket.
JOHN HARRISON. I was one of the new Police. I was at the corner of Bridge-street and heard a noise, looked round, and saw James taking this handkerchief from the prisoner's pocket; I took him in charge, and found this pair of scissars on him - they are very sharp pointed.(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. There was another Police-man there; I should like to know if he would say what this one does -I am a whitesmith, and use the scissars to cut wire for tobacco-stoppers; I was unable to walk ten yards, much more to do such a thing - I had no pocket.
JOHN HARRISON. He had an inside pocket on his left side - I shewed it before the Alderman.

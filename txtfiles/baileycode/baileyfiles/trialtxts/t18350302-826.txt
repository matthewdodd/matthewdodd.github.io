JAMES LEAVER
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
18th of February, 8 handkerchiefs, value 30s., the goods of 



Elizabeth Limebeer; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






ELIZABETH LIMEBEER
. I am a widow, and live in Praed-street, Paddington. On the afternoon of the 28th of February, I had some clothes hanging in my gardens. I saw them at three o'clock, and missed them at a quarter before four o'clock. I ran to the bottom of my gardens. the gate was open, and I saw five boys runnings. I gave an alarm, but they got aways. this is one of the handkerchiefs I lost that day.

Cross-examined by
MR. DOANE. Q. Have you washed for the owner of the handkerchief long? A. Not above two months. I have had the fellow-handkerchief to this to wash, for the same person, about three times. I can swear this is the one I washed that days. the mark was on it, and the number, but it was partly picked out when it was found on the prisoners. at seven o'clock in the evening, there was a person named Gomer, who came to say, he saw five boys running, and one of them had the handkerchief under his jacket, and the prisoner was one of the five.





ALFRED BLUNDELL
 (police-constable F 24.) I was on duty at seven o'clock that evening, and stopped the prisoner—I found this box in his possessions. I took him to the station-house, and found this handkerchief in his pocket.

Cross-examined. Q. Do you know he has a brother? A. Yes, I believe he has run aways. Gomer is not heres. he went before the Justice, but I did not hear him swear that the prisoner was not one of the boys.





ARTHUR MINTON
 (police-constable D 80.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got at Mr. Clark's office (read)—I know the prisoner is the person.
(Mr. King, master of the British School, Golden-lane, gave the prisoner a good character.)




GUILTY
. Aged 15. 


Transported for Seven Years.

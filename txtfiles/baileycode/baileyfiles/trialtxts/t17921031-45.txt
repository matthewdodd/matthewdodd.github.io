             sworn.
I lost the things in the indictment, on the 6th of October; they were hung out to dry; the yard is open to the fields, only walled in.

             sworn.
I am a brick-maker; on the 6th of October about one, going to dinner, I saw 
               
                  Job
                   Powell
               



             walk about near the yard, about twenty yards off; nobody was with him then; I saw 
               
                  George
                   Kelting
               



             come out of an unfinished yard next to the prosecutor's.

             sworn.
I am constable of the parish of St. Pancras; on the Monday after the robbery I went, in consequence of an information, and took the prisoners in custody; I searched them and found two duplicates, one upon each prisoner; this for a waistcoat on Kelting, and this for another waistcoat on Powell, pawned for 1 s.

             sworn.
I am a pawnbroker; I took in a waistcoat, but cannot swear to either of the prisoners; it answers to the duplicate found on Kelting. (Deposed to).
Another PAWNBROKER sworn.
I took this waistcoat of Powell. (Deposed to.)

               GUILTY
            .
Tried by the second Middlesex Jury before Lord KENYON.
Lord Kenyon. I wish those pawnbrokers would bear in mind that they go on extreme slippery ground; it is expected that they take in nothing to pawn but from personswhom they know, or who come recommended; I do not know how a jury would deal with such pawnbrokers if they were to be indicted for receiving stolen goods; it would be for the good sense and discretion of a jury; I should be very much inclined to think they would be convicted; it would be better for the public if the whole trade was abolished; it is high time for the legislature to bestir themselves, and do something in it.

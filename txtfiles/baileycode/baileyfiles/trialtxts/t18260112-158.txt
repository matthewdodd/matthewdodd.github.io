            . I am foreman to William Smith and Matthew Ferris; the prisoner came into their service on the 2d of January, and in consequence of some suspicion, I brought him into the counting-house, about seven o'clock in the evening of the 11th of January, just as he was leaving work, and in his hat there were eight yards of cotton-print - he said he was very sorry, and would make recompense in the best manner he could; he was given into custody.

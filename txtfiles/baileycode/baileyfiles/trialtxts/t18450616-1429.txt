1429. 




CHARLES PERKINS
 was indicted

for stealing 1 pair of shoes; value 5s. 6d., the goods of 



Charles Barnard; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






CHARLES BARNARD
. I keep a shop in Surrey-place, Old Kent-road. On the 13th of May I missed a pair of shoes—I heard a noise at the door, and saw some man running from my shop—the prisoner was brought back with my shoes, within ten minutes—these are them.





THOMAS SALLOWAY
. I live in the Kent-road. I was in Mr. Barnard's shop—he told me some one had stolen some shoes—I found the prisoner about 150 yards from the shop with one shoe under his coat, and the other under his arm.





THOMAS WEBB
 (police-constable M 174.) I took the prisoner, and asked where he got the shoes—he said his brother bought them—Mr. Barnard identified them—I took the prisoner to the station, and there he stated that they brought the shoes to him in the World Turned Upside Down.

Prisoner's Defence. I was in the World Turned Upside Down; a man brought them in; I bought them; I went out, and the man stopped me.





JAMES RATCLIFF
 (City police-constable, No. 375.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction—(read—Convicted on the 21st Oct., 1844, and confined six months)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 25.—


Transported for Seven Years.

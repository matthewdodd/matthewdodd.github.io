            . I keep the Waggon and Horses public-house at Ealing




. On February the 8th, I lost part of a rump of beef. I was in the kitchen very busy; a boy came in and said, you have lost your beef. I went and saw it was gone. It was hanging up in the house. I turned out of doors as fast as I could. I catched the prisoner with the beef about half way from there to Old Brentford. I brought him back, and charged a constable with him. He had the beef and the hook too. I believed it to be my beef.

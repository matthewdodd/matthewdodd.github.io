            . I keep the George Inn on Snow hill




; I had a parcel of indigo blue brought to my inn directed to 
               
                  Alice
                   Batsby
               



             at Alesbury; I put it into a room within the tap house; I found it wanting the next morning; I missed it immediately after the prisoner was gone.

            . I am a blue maker: the prisoner offered to sell me this blue (producing it,) and as Mess. Grace and Freeman had lost some some time before; I desired her to leave it; I found a bill of parcels of it in Mess. Grace and Freeman's name; I sent to them; they and Mr. Jaques came and claimed it next morning; I asked her why she did not sent according to the directions; she said she picked it up on Snow-hill, and desired I would give her what it was worth.
- Freeman deposed that he packed up the parcel and sent it to the George inn, that upon Mrs. Stringer's intelligence; he went there and staid till the prisoner came; that she told him she found it, and denied having been at the George inn the night before.
Prisoner's Defence.
I picked this parcel up on Snow Hill.

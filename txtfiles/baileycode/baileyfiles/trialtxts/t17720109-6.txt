            . I live in Porter-street, St. Ann's, Soho


; I am a hair-dresser
. I was out of town on Tuesday the 3d of December, at Kensington, all day; coming to town about six in the evening, I went into my parlour; there I saw the prisoner. I asked my maid, 
               
                  Susanna
                   Fowler
               



            , who that was; I saw she appeared confused. Then the prisoner said, boy flung his hat in at the window, and, said he, I have found my hat. I said, Yes, my lad, and I have found you. Then I perceived the sash of the window was flung up. I told my maid to observe the window was up, and that two coats and a waistcoat were bundled up and removed from where I left them. I searched him, but I found nothing on him. I left the cloaths in the morning for my maid to brush.
Q. You said your maid was confused; what do you attribute that to?
O'Brien. Finding the boy there, as she knew nothing of it.


                  Susanna
                   Fowler
               



            . I am servant to Mr. O'Brien. My master was out on the 3d of December; I brushed the cloaths, two coats and a waistcoat, and throw'd them on a chair, where they always hung; no person was in the parlour after I put them on the chair, till my master came in.
Q. Was the sash up or down at four o'clock?
Fowler. Shut down. The prisoner was standing between the chairs, and the two coats and the waistcoat were bundled up, and lay in the chair they had hung on before. He said a boy threw his hat in at the window, and that he knocked at the door; that he could make no body hear, so came in at the window.
Prisoner's Defence.
As I was coming by the prosecutor's house, I stopt to make water: two lads came up to me; they took my hat off my head, and threw it in at the window of this house. I went and knocked at the door; I could not make any body hear; I thought it was an empty house, so I got in at the window; I had not been in a minute before that gentleman came in, and said I was a thief, and he would take me before a justice. I had been at sea, and I was going to the Marine Society to go again on board a merchantman. I used to do things for my father, who is a porter. I used to go on errands for gentlemen.

                  Bouch 
               



            . I was employed by Mr Vanlute, to bring this Quantity of Salt-Petre from Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Thompson 
               



            's Warehouses to Old-ford; I gave Orders to 
               
                  John 
                  Campbell 
               



            , my Servant, to carry these Goods from Sir

            . I took into the Lighter, the 16th of April, twenty-five Bags of Salt-Petre, and laid them ten Bags in one Tier, and ten in another, and five Bags lay between them; I came down to Bow-Creek , there I lay at Anchor; when I had moored the Vessel, I went to the Orchard-house , in order to refresh myself; when I returned at first, I found the twenty-five Bags safe in the Vessel, thereupon I laid down to sleep; during the Time I was at Bow-Creek , Pain, the Prisoner, asked me what I had in this Vessel; I told him I had Salt-Petre; there were several others by; when I came back I found all safe, and I laid me down to sleep about four Hours, and my Feet was laid against this Bag that was lost; in getting to the Vessel from the Orchard-house , my Shoes were very dirty; and my Feet that were laid against the Bag, the Bag was daubed with Mud and Chalk that I had got upon my Feet; when I awaked, I went to the Orchard-house , there I told the Persons that were there, 
               
                  Joshua 
                  Williams 
               



            , and 
               
                  Charles 
                  Brown 
               



            , and Chantry, and Cockrum, I told them of my Loss; Williams did propose and declare that he would have his Vessel searched, for Fear the Bag should be lodged there; this was done, but nothing found there; but afterwards this Bag was found in the Vessel that belonged to Pain, the Prisoner at the Bar; and when the Bag was found, it was dirty with the Marks of my Feet; there were these Marks upon the Bag that was found in the Vessel of Pain's; this Bag that is now produced in Court, is the Bag which was in his Vessel.
This Witness was asked by the Prisoner at the Bar, if there were not some Fishermen that went by, while he was staying at the Creek ; and whether he had not declared to his Master, that he had a Suspicion those Fishermen got away this Bag, and he was afraid to say any thing to them, for fear they should throw him over Board; but Campbell's Answer was in the negative; and Mr Bouch said his Servant said no such thing.

                  Williams 
               



            . I belonged to the Craft that was in the Creek about this Vessel, this Pain, the Prisoner, and a Woman with him came into the Lighter, and I heard Pain ask Campbell what he had in his Lighter, and he told him Salt-petre; I was also at the Orchard-house at Supper, and Pain was at Supper with us, and he went out about eight o'Clock, and when he returned, he had some Dirt upon his Breast, and upon the Knees of his Breeches, which he brushed off his Cloaths. At that Time he seemed to be under some Fluster and Disorder. About eleven o'Clock the Company broke up, and Campbell before that came in and told them of the Loss of this Bag; upon this I searched my Craft, and there was nothing found there; afterwards, upon searching the Lighter that belonged to Pain, they found in it the Bag of Salt-petre, which is the Bag sworn to by Mr Bouch and Campbell. Pain desired us to take his Craft, and he walked away with the Woman that was with him; when we were going along with the Craft, there was a Boy came in a Skiff, and called to him by the Name of Doctor; we asked whether he wanted Dr Pain, we thought his Design might be to carry off this Bag.
- Cockrum. After Pain left us at the Orchard-house , he returned in about an Hour and a half; upon his Return, he appeared in a Fluster, had some Dirt about him, and the Woman asked him where he had that; his Answer was, that he had been at his own Lighter, that he had been there to fetch two half Guineas which he had left in his own Lighter. Pain went away afterwards with the Woman; so afterwards we searched this Lighter belonging to Pain, we looked first and found nothing , but afterwards under the Hatch, under the Stern-Sheets, we found this Bag of Salt-petre, and it was dirty.

                  Brown 
               



            . While I was at the Orchard-house , the Prisoner went out and said nothing to no-body, and he might be gone about an Hour and a half; when he returned, one of them said, Ned, where have you been? He said he was like to make a fine Jobb of it, he had missed two half Guineas on board of the Lighter; says the Woman, you look as if you had been doing something you should not; says she, What is the Meaning of your Breeches Knees being so dirty? So he paid his Reckoning and went away. When Campbell came in, and said he had lost a Bag of Salt-petre, one said none had been out of the Company but 
               
                  Ned 
                  Pain 
               



            ; afterwards we searched his Lighter, and found it under the Stern-Sheets.
Chantry. The same Bag that is now in Court, I saw under the Stern-Sheets, at the Stern-Side; there were Boards all over it.
Tinder that keeps the Orchard-house , and Noland his Servant, confirm those Circumstances of Pain's going from the Company, and coming in dirty, &c.
The Prisoner called to his Character, in the first Place,

One Mrs Taylor, a Relation of the Prisoner's appeared in Court, and charged the Prisoner with wronging her of Coals.

             (the Father of the Prisoner.) My Son served me seven Years, and a very faithful Lad was he, and I never knew him do an ill Thing in my Life.
Q. Has he not got a Wife?
Pain. Yes, and his Wife is ready to lie in; I never heard a bad Character of him from any but Mrs Taylor and Litchfield; she lost some Coals, and she would have charged it upon him: He was never guilty of it any more than I.
George Seal. I have known him four or five Years, but never heard any ill of him.



               Guilty
            .

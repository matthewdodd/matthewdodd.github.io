            . I lost an iron box with two half guineas, four quarter guineas and a nine shilling piece; the money was in the little iron box which I put into a box in my room; between four and five in the afternoon I went down stairs, and returned in less than half an hour; when I came back the box was gone; the prisoner lay with me; I left her in the room when I went down stairs; she was gone when I returned.

            . I keep a public house; the prisoner came into my house and paid me seven shillings she owed; she gave me two quarter guineas to change, and I saw she had a nineshilling-piece.

Prisoner's Defence.
I never saw the money in my life; a woman paid me the money that I had.

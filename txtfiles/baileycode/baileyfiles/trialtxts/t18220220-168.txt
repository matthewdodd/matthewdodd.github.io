            . I live at Enfield. The prisoner was a labourer
 of mine; I discharged him and two others whom I suspected - he begged himself back into my service, and said he would not take any thing for he had suffered enough from being transported before. I desired the patrol to look out for him, and on the 2d of February, they took him with this wheat on his back; I compared it with that in my barn, it corresponded. I have a sample of each.

            . I am a patrol. On the 3d of February, about half-past twelve o'clock at night, I took the prisoner in the road, about a mile and a half from the prosecutor's, with a bag on his shoulder; I asked what he had got there, he said,
"Nothing," I said he had some corn, he said Yes, he had got wheat, which he bought of Mr. Poyser - we said we should take him back, and if he had bought it it was all right - he said,
"For G - d's sake don't take me before a Magistrate, for I stole it," and he would give us his coat, and any money we liked, to be quiet about it; we refused.
(Wheat produced and sworn to).
Prisoner's Defence. I picked it up.

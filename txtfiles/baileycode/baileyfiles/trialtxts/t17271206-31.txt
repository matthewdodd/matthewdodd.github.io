, was indicted for 


               stealing a Watch, value 5 l.
             on the 13th of Nov
. last, the Property of

            . The Prosecutor depos'd, That he was walking home very soberly by himself, but being a little in Liquor the Prisoner pick'd him up, and then pick'd his Pocket; and running away he ran after her, and found the Watch upon her, only the outside Case she had conveyed away; but the Watch being remarkable to that he Swore. She endeavoured in her Defence to make the Prosecutor ridiculous, by a ludicrous Tale of their Familiarity at a Brandy-Shop; but let his Crime be what it would, hers was too conspicuous to escape without Punishment, for the Jury found her 


               guilty to the Value of 10 d.

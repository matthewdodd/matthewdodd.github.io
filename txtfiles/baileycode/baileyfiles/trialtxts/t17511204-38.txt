            . The prisoner was employed as a chairwoman
 for six months in our house. Missing these things mentioned, 14 shirts, several handkerchiefs and neckcloths, we suspected her. I sent for her to come as usual, she came, she was not in the house half an hour before she stole a shirt, a neckcloth and a handkerchief. We had her searched and found the things upon her. Then she confessed the rest, and also where she had pawned some shirts and neckcloths. We went to the place and got some of the shirts again. There were five shirts and four neckcloths in one place, two at another, one Johnson's in Russel-court. [ The things produced in court and deposed to.
Barnard Bane and James Rensford the Constable deposed to her Confession, &c.
Prisoner. I was in great extremity, I have discovered all I know.

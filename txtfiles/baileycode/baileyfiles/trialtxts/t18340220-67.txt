            . I am an officer - on the 7th of January I was in Newgate-street


, about eleven in the morning - I saw the two prisoners following two gentlemen - Wilton had the skirts of one gentleman's coat in his hand, and then 
               drew
             this handkerchief - I went over and collared the two prisoners - I kicked the handkerchief before me into a tobacconist's shop - I called to the gentlemen - one of them said he had lost his handkerchief, but he would not give his name - this is the handkerchief.
Wilton's Defence. I was going to Billingsgate when the officer said I had picked a gentleman's pocket.
Reading's Defence. I was on my way to Queen-street, and saw the handkerchief on the ground.

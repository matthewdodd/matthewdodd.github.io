            . I am a drover, and live next door to Stephens. I heard a noise, and went out into the yard, and found some of the clothes drying there; I saw the prisoner at the top of the wash-house; I laid hold of him, and asked him how he came there; he said, he did not know; the lines were cut, and rolled up with the clothes. Mrs. Stephens claimed them; I found the cloaths stated in the indictment under the prisoner, at the top of the wash-house.
CHALES JAQUES. I am a constable. The clothes and prisoner were delivered to me.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

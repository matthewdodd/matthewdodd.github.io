The prosecutors deposed that they keep a milliners shop

, that the prisoners came into their shop under pretence of buying some ribbon, that they missed a piece while the prisoners were in the shop, that they sent for a constable, who search'd them, that Reed, in pulling off her petticoats, dropped a piece of ribbon, which was produced in Court and deposed to by the prosecutors.
The prisoner Reed said in her defence, that the ribbon was found at a distance from her, under the bed.

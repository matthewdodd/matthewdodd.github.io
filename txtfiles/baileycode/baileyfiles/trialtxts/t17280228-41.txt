.
The Prosecutor depos'd, that it being Sunday Night, at 10 or 11 o'Clock, he went into a Brandy-Shop in Drury-Lane


, and finding the Prisoner there, he treated her with a Quartern of Geneva, that inspir'd by this he went with her into a Back-Room, and there - and there - and there - she pick'd his Pocket; - that he miss'd his Money, and notwithstanding his loving Disposition at that Time, he shew'd his Resentment by changing his Passion from the Amorous on the Outragious; this he said alarm'd the House, and brought a Bully to her Assistance, who without any Dispute, fell to Kicking and Cuffing, and tore his Shirt off his Back. He further said, that he knew the House to have a very ill Name, which render'd him more inexcusable, that could on a Sabbath-Day at Night get Drunk, and fall into such a Place and Company, where, in all Probability, it was impossible for him to escape without falling under some unhappy Dilemma, or committing some Extravagance. The Prisoner said in her Defence, that she knew nothing of taking his Money, otherwise than as he gave her the Change when he paid his Reckoning, and offer'd her more if she would let him, &c. But as his vicious Inclinations would not excuse her Actions, the Jury found her 


               guilty to the Value of 10 d.

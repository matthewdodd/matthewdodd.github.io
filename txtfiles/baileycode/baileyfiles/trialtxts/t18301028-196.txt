            . I am a grocer
, and live in Shoreditch


. On the 30th of September I counted 10l. of silver, in 1l. parcels, for my next door neighbour - there were among it two crowns and several half-crowns; the prisoner came in and asked for an ounce of coffee - while I was serving him another boy came in for some tea and sugar; I turned to get the canister, and the prisoner ran to the end of the counter, and seized 1l. worth of the silver - in doing that he knocked down two more pounds; I did not see him take it, but I heard the noise, turned, and saw him running out of the shop - I said to the other boy
."You young dog, why did not you lay hold of him;" the other boy then ran away - I ran, caught the prisoner, and said,"Give me hold of that silver;" he gave me two crowns and four half-crowns, which made it right.

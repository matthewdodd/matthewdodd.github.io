I and another were going down Lombard-street, I saw a little Boy pass by Mr. Par-son's Window several Times, these two Fellows (the Prisoners) were together, one of them gave a Whistle, and the Boy shoved the Sash up, and took something out; I went to a Watchman, and desired him to assist us in the taking them; and he said, Pshaw, pshaw, I do not see them, let them go; the Prisoners were pursued, and taken in White-chapel .

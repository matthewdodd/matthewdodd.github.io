1437. 




CHARLES WILLIAM BINGHAM
 was indicted

for bigamy. 




WILLIAM SMITH
. I am a tailor, of Fetter-lane. In March, 1846, the

prisoner was in my employ—he married my daughter unknown to me, and tent me this letter—it if in his writing. (This was a letter informing Mr. Smith of the marriage, and requesting kit forgiveness) They lived in my house from June to September as man and wife—he then left, and I did not see him for several weeks, although he lived in the neighbourhood—my daughter is alive; I saw her this morning.

Prisoner. I left her because she was a drunken debauched girl.





JOHN COWDERY
. I am a parish clerk, and produce the registry-book—here is an entry of the marriage of Charles Bingham and Sarah Hislop Smith—I saw them married—the prisoner is the man—I saw the woman this morning—I lived next door to her; I never knew any thing against her character.





ABIAH STOCKER
. I was married to the prisoner last April at Whitechapel Church—he said he was a widower.





JOSEPH PRICE
 (policeman, H 15). 1 took the prisoner, and told him the charge—he said there must be some mistake—I got this certificate at Whityechapel Church; it is a correct copy (read).

Prisoner's Defence. I left her because she was constantly annoying me; I heard she was dead, and married again; I firmly believe her to be dead now.




GUILTY
. Aged 23.—


Transported for Seven Years.

JOHN JONES
 and 




JOHN NICHOLAS SPENCER
 were indicted for

stealing, on the 
1st of April, 1 truck, value 2l., the goods of 



William Cameron; and that Spencer had been before convicted of felony.






WILLIAM CAMERON
. I missed my truck out of my premises on the 1st of April—I went to the station-house, and there found it—it is mine.





JAMES ROOKE
. I am a policeman. On the 1st of April, I was called and saw the truck—Spencer was with it, and had some lead in it—this was after Perry had given me some information—I took the truck, but I did not take him, as I understood two men had been with it.

Spencer. Q. What had I on? A. A short fustian jacket, with pockets in the sides—I have no doubt of his being the man—I bad seen him on the Thursday previous.





JANE PERRY
. On the 1st of April, at ten minutes past six o'clock, I saw Jones and another with a truck—they waited from five to six o'clock, and then drew it to some stables, and loaded it with something which seemed heavy, in a mat—I had known both the prisoners a long time down that stable—I went for the policeman.





ALEXANDER KENNEDY
 (police-constable H 155.) I was on duty on the 22nd of April, and took Jones on another charge.





JAMES FOGG
. On the 1st of April, I saw the two prisoners, and one other, who is not in custody, between eleven and twelve o'clock at night—I took Spencer.





WILLIAM SAFFORD BOBBETT
. I produce the certificate of Spencer's former conviction from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner if the person.

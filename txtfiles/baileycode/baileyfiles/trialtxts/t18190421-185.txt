                  JOHN 
                  BURLETON
               



            . My wife is a laundress, and works for Mr. 
               
                  John 
                  Morris
               



            , who lives in Oxford-street; we live at East Acton. On the 25th of March, I was returning from town, with the table-cloths in my cart to wash. When I got home I missed twenty-three out of a bundle, which contained forty-seven - I think they were taken near Acton. Next day I saw one at Wise's, the pawnbroker - the mark was picked out. We found three more at Lee's lodgings; his wife was there; I left town about half-past six o'clock in the evening, and got to Acton a little after eight.


                  MARY 
                  KEITH
               



            . I am housekeeper to Mr. 
               
                  John 
                  Morris
               



            , who keeps an hotel in Oxford-street. I looked out forty-seven table-cloths for Burleton to wash - twenty-three were missing. I saw two at the office, and another, which was torn. I know one by the mark.


                  JAMES 
                  BRADLEY CHAMBERLAIN
               



            . I am servant to Mr. Wise, who is a pawnbroker, and lives in Broad-street, St. Giles's. On the 26th of March, Mary Hall pledged a table-cloth with me, in the name of 
               
                  Ann 
                  Lovel
               



            , about ten o'clock in the morning.


                  MARY 
                  HALL
               



            . I lodged in Buckeridge-street - I was in distress, and did needlework; I have known Lee near a twelvemonth. I was at Lee's appartments, No. 29, Tower street, Seven Dials; he only lodged there two days - his wife lived with him; I used to go to clean up the place. On the 26th of March, I got there about seven o'clock in the morning; Mrs. Lee desired me to pick the mark out of a table-cloth - the prisoner was present; one of the marks was N, I do not remember the other. While I picked the mark out of that, Mrs. Lee picked out the mark of two others - I saw twenty-two table-cloths there. Henry came in between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning, and looked at eighteen of them; Lee asked 4 l. for them? he examined them, and offered 2 l. 15 s. for them, which was agreed to, and he took them away. He said he was a dealer in oranges - he staid about an hour.
Q. What became of those you took the marks out of - A. Mrs. Lee sent me to pledge one at Wise's - the prisoner was present; I pledged it in the name of Lovel, which was her maiden name - I knew she pledged things in that name; I got 6 s. for it, and gave her the duplicate. After I returned I heard the prisoner say, he was going to take 1 l. 7 s. 6 d. to 
               
                  William 
                  Davis
               



            , which was his share; I have seen 
               
                  William 
                  Davis
               



             at Mrs. Lee's aunt's. Mrs. Lee's sister took me from there to No. 4, Bainbridge-street, where she lived, and then the officers found me, and I told them all about it.
Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. I thought I was doing wrong by picking the marks out, but I was glad to do any thing, as I was distressed.


                  SAMUEL 
                  FURZEMAN
               



            , I am a constable. On the 26th of March, I received information, and went to Bainbridge-street, about half-past eight o'clock in the morning, and found Hall at Lee's mother's house, where his wife's sister lived; the girl directed me to Lee's lodgings, No. 29, Tower-street. I went there about a quarter after nine o'clock, in the one-pair front-room, and found four or five Gipsies there. I sat down, and in two or three minutes, Lee's wife came running into the room, put her hands together, and said to her father,
"For God's sake, put away the table-cloths, for Furzeman has taken the girl." I shut the door, and called out of the window for Kendrick, and the prosecutor to come up. I searched the room, and found three dirty table-cloths in a drawer - Lee's wife claimed them. I took her, with her father and brother-in-law, to the office - they were discharged. About a fortnight after Lee was taken into custody at Bow-street; I had been looking for him without success; I found them both in custody on another charge. They were brought to Marlborough-street, and Hall pointed them out.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

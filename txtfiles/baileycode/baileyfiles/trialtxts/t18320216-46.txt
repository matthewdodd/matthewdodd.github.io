            . I live in Cambridge-road, Mile-end. On the 6th of January I was passing Whitechapel church


, about half-past one o'clock; I felt something unusual behind me - I turned, and saw the prisoner and his companion with him: I felt, and my handkerchief was gone- I first collared his companion, but seeing my handkerchief hanging out of the prisoner's pocket, I collared him, and held him till the Policeman came up.

            . I am a Police-constable. The prisoner was given to me by the prosecutor, with this handkerchief.(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I had been out of employ
 for five months; I was looking for employ at the time; there was a crowd near the church - I saw two boys push in and pick this gentleman's pocket; I had my hands in my pockets - they threw the handkerchief at me, and it caught between my arm and my pocket.

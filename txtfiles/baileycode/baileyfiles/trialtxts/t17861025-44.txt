             sworn.
I am a watchman in New Cavendish-street, to the Dean of Windsor; his house is in Harley-street


; between seven and eight on the 9th of October, the prisoner took a lamp lighter's ladder from the Dean's wall; I saw him take it, and he took down a lamp directly that was out; I thought at first he was taking it down for safety; then I saw him take down two more; he had another with him; and they went into the field; in half an hour they returned with the ladder; I stopped the prisoner with one lamp, and the broken glass; he said, he was a lamp-lighter.

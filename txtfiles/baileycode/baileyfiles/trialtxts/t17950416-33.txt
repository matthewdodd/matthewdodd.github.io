                   PARKER CHURCH
               



             sworn.
Q. I believe you live in Sackville-street, Piccadilly


? - Yes. The prisoner at the bar was my valet
 for about eighteen or nineteen months.
Q. When did he leave your service? - About a month since; he did not leavemy service; I was determined to discharge him, and I gave him notice to get another place, that I meant to discharge him; I ordered him to go with a letter to his Grace the Duke of Portland; I had been out and got wet, and went to change my coat, and I called for him, he had my keys, and I went to my wardrobe to get another coat to put on, and to my very great astonishment I found there was none there to change; at last I found a coat which I had made an excursion in last summer; very much surprised at this deficiency in my clothes, I had a closet opened, to see if there were any clothes there. The next day I ordered him to quit my service, and to give an account of all my clothes to my butler.
Q. Did you afterwards examine into the state of your clothes? - No, I did not. I told him to give up the state of my linen and clothes to my butler, and when that is all right come to me and I will pay you your wages. When the account came to be looked into, I found a great deficiency of my linen and other articles; the man went away, and none of my servants could tell where he lodged. I sent my butler to the magistrates, at Marlborough-street, to apply for a search warrant, and the constable, who, I suppose, is here, went with the search warrant, and he came to me and brought one of my shirts with my mark on it; when he came to me, I went with him to this man's lodgings, and there I found a considerable quantity of my clothes, which, I suppose, are here to be produced, because the constable had charge of them.
Mr. Knapp. These things, most probably, if they were taken at all they must be taken at different times? - It is impossible for me to say.
Q. This man had lived with you eighteen or nineteen months, during that time he had been in the capacity of a valet. Had it, in the course of that time, been your custom to make presents to him of cast off clothes, or any thing of that sort? - It is impossible for me to recollect any thing of that sort. I have no doubt but I did make him some presents; I do not charge my memory with any.
Q. Perhaps you have made him presents of some of the same sort of things that were in this indictment; black silk waistcoats for instance? - I propably might.
Q. Kerseymere waistcoats? - I certainly did not.
Q. Will you give me leave to ask you whether during the time the prisoner lived with you, he had not the opportunity of making away with a Pocket book, with some bank notes in it of your's? - I cannot positively say.
Q. Did not he give you a pocket book, which had either by you been mislaid or dropped which contained bank notes? - During one time he lived with me I did leave my pocket book my in breeches pocket, but what sum of money was in it I cannot tell; when I got up in the morning I said, Francy, did you see my pocket book? Yes, says he, I did, there it is, and returned it; it certainly contained property.
Mr. Knapp. If you mean to inquire from this, whether I had the least suspicion of his dishonesty, I would tell you, no; that I had great confidence in him.

            , sworn.
Q. I believe you are one of the constables of Marlborough Street? - Yes, 135.
Q. Did you go with a search warrant at any time to the prisoner at the bar? - Yes; I went to No. 132, Swallow-street.
Q. Who lodged there? - The prisoner at the bar.
Q. How do you know he lodged there? - Because I asked him to go to his apartments; and he went there with me.
Q. Did you execute your search warrant there? - Yes. The first I found I desired him to open the box; and he opened it very freely; and I told him there was a chest of drawers I must open.He said he had not got the key; I said I must break it open.
Q. Did you break it open? - No, he gave me the key after that. I found this shirt there marked as the butler had described the property to me.
Q. To Prosecutor. Can you speak to the mark on your linen? - Yes: this is one out of twenty eight new shirts; which I had a short time before, eight of which are missing.
Q. Are you perfectly sure that you never gave away any of these? - Perfectly sure I never did.
Q. To Kennedy. What else did you find? - Fifteen pair of silk stockings.
Mr. Knapp to Prosecutor. I am given to understand that the prisoner at the bar had given him a good many silk stockings either by you or Mrs Church. - I know he has taken them.
Q. Be kind enough to answer my question? - I know it is no such thing.
Mr. Knowlys to Kennedy. Have you any kerseymere waistcoats? - Three Kerseymere waistcoats.
Prosecutor. They are certainly my property; and I certainly never gave them to that man.
Mr. Knapp. You never had any quarrel with this man? - Never in the world. I found him a good natured man, but I thought him an unthinking man, because I could not keep him at home.
Q. In short you did not think of parting with him for dishonesty? - I did not in the least.

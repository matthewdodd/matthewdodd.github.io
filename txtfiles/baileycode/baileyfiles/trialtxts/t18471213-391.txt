JANE SHERATON.
 I am a widow—I live in Albany-place, Old Kent-road. On Tuesday evening, 30th Nov., I had some clothes hanging out in my garden—amongst them were four shifts, three shirts, and other things—I lost them—I have examined those which are in the officer's hand—they are mine—I saw them safe about seven o'clock that evening—they were gone about half-past seven.





JAMES COLDMAN
 (policeman, M 159.) On the Thursday morning I met Smith's sister—she took me to Russell-street, where she said there was a quantity of wet linen by the side of her brother's bed—I went, and found these articles there—I took them to the station—I found Smith was in custody for it.





WILLIAM LKADAM
 (City policeman, 556.) At half-past seven o'clock, on the evening of the 30th Nov., I was at the foot of London-bridge—I met the two prisoners—Rolt had something bulky—I asked what she had got—she said, "I am a cap maker, I have got some work"—I found on her a bundle of wet linen—there was a shirt, a bed-gown, and two shifts, which the prosecutrix has identified—Rolt told me she worked at a cap-maker's in the Minories; it was linen she was going to take home to mend—I took her to the station—she then said the male prisoner (who had run away) had given her 1s. to mend them.

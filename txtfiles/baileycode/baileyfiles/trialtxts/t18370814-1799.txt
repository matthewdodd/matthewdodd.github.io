HENRY AUGUSTUS THOMPSON, ESQ
. I am a barrister, living in the Temple. On the 27th of July I was in the Strand, near Wellington-street, alter twelve o'clock at night—the prisoner, and several others, were standing at the corner, and the prisoner rushed at me, and took my handkerchief from my pocket—he ran off—I followed him up the Strand into Exeter-street—

he was there stopped—I never lost sight of him—I have not found the handkerchief—I am sure he is the man.

Prisoner, You say there were three or four more there; was I talking to them? Witness I do not know—you ran from Wellington-street across the Strand, and up another street into Excter-street—I hit you once or twice to make you stop—you would not, till you were stopped by two or three persons—I did not sec you give the handkerchief to any one, or throw it away.





JAMES MOORE
 (police-constable F 52.) I heard a cry of "Stop thief"—I saw the prisoner running—I joined in the pursuit and took him—I found two handkerchiefs tied round his neck, one in the regular way and the other one loosely round.

Prisoner. I had been to the theatre, and I was shoved against the gentleman—I ran into the road—he struck me—I continued running because I was frightened, till I was stopped.

MR. THOMPSON. I did not strike him till ho had run a hundred yards.




GUILTY
. Aged 18.—

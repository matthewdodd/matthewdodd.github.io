            . I am an officer. On the 7th of August, about eleven o'clock, I saw six men pass my door in Brick-lane, and watched them. They had not got above twelve yards before they surrounded the prosecutor's cart; Cox jumped into the cart, took the coat, and jumped out with it under his arm. I went in pursuit of him, but could not overtake him, when I returned, the other five were gone - I informed the prosecutor. I went to Worship-street office, and the magistrate desired me to apprehend them when I saw them - the other two were part of the gang; I knew them all well before. I afterward apprehendeds them.
Prisoner Cox. Q. What do you know of me - 
               A. 
            You belong to a desperate gang.

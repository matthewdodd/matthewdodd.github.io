            . I saw the prisoner go into the prosecutor's house, on the tenth of October, about four o'clock in the afternoon; I saw her come out again with something in her hand: I went and informed the prosecutrix of it.

            . Mrs. Brittain told me that the prisoner had taken something out of my house; I overtook her; she had my glass and quilt in her hand, under her cloak.
(The things produced and deposed to.)
The prisoner said nothing in her defence.

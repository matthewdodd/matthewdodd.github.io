ALEXANDER HOGG
. About half-past twelve o'clock, on the 3rd of May, I was in Gracechurch-street—I felt a tug at my pocket—I turned round, and saw the prisoner two or three yards from me, rolling my handkerchief up—this is it—(looking at one)—it had been in my coat pocket—the prisoner ran, I overtook him—he was not out of my sight—I am sure he is the same person.





JAMES PILLEY
. I was standing at my door at half-past twelve o'clock, on the 3rd of May—I saw the prisoner making some progress up the court, from Half Moon-passage—the prosecutor was running after him, and I took him.

Prisoner's Defence. I was almost starved, I was two days without food—I saw the handkerchief hanging out of the pocket, and I was tempted to take it.

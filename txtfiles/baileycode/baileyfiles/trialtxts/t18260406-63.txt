            . I am servant to Robert Upsall, a pawnbroker
, of Barbican


. On the 23d of February, between three and four o'clock, three women came into the shop together - one of them redeemed a ring; after that they appeared to be looking at a cloak, which hung up - they left the shop, and I missed it directly; I went after them - two of them went towards Redcross-street, and the prisoner towards Aldersgate-street. I took her about three houses off, with the cloak on her back - she said a woman had put it on her back, wearing it - I am certain it is master's - it was torn down, and the strings left on the nail; she said she did not know whose it was - it hung inside the shop.

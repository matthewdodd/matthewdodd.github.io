            . I am the daughter of George Cater, a gardener
 - we live at Hackney


. On the 3d of March I was in the parlour writing, when I saw, from the reflection of a glass-door, that a person was in the shop with his hand in the till - I went out and caught hold of the prisoner while he was in that position; I asked him what he had taken - he said Nothing, he wanted a half-pennyworth of nuts - I then shut the door and stood there till I saw a man pass by whom I knew - I sent him for a constable, and he took him - I examined the till and missed 5s. 6d. from it - I saw the prisoner searched, half-a-crown and three shillings were found on him.

PATRICK KEEFE
. I am an upholsterer, and live at Pleasant-place, Pitt-street, St. George's-road, Southwark. On the night of the 31st of July, about eleven o'clock, I was returning home in St. George's-road, and was suddenly knocked down, and, when down, I found the prisoner in the act of taking my watch out of my pocket—I called out "Police," and tried to take the watch from him—he held the Watch, and I held the seals, until Lee came up—there were two persons attacked me—the one who got away knocked me down, and the prisoner took my watch—I am certain he is the man—the watch produced is mine—I am certain.

Prisoner. Q. You say I had the watch in my hand, and you had the seals in your hand? A. Yes—Lee came and secured you.





RICHARD LEE
. I am a boot and shoe-maker, and live at No. 17, Gable-street, Southwark. I saw the prosecutor in St. George's-road, walking steadily along—he was knocked down by the prisoner's companion—as soon as he was down, the prisoner snatched the watch from hi fob—he got hold of the seals, and the prisoner had the watch in his hand.





RICHARD PROSSER
 (police-constable L 53.) I received charge of the prisoner, and have the watch.

Prisoners Defence. I was returning home and heard a call for a policeman—I went over, and saw the gentleman lying in the road—I was walking away, and the constable laid bold of me, and said I must go with him—I never touched the watch.




GUILTY

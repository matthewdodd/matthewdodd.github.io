REV. JOHN JARRATT
. I am a clergyman. On Sunday evening, the 10th of March, I was in Bishopsgate churchyard—I felt somebody touch my pocket, and missed my handkerchief—I turned round instantly, and saw it in the prisoner's hand—I collared him, and asked him for it—he said he had not got it—the policeman came up, and saw it on the ground—I had observed the prisoner following me all through the churchyard—this is my handkerchief—(looking at it.)





BENJAMIN RICHARDSON
. I am a City police-constable. I heard the prosecutor call out—I went, and took the prisoner—he was trying to get away, and was very riotous, making use of very bad language—I saw the handkerchief lying at his feet.

Prisoner. Q. Did not one of you try to choke me? A. No violence was used to you.




GUILTY
. * Aged 21.—


Transported for Ten Years.

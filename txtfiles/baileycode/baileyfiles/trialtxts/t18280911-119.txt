            . I am a Thames Police constable. On the 30th of July, about seven o'clock in the evening, I was on the West India Export-dock


: the prosecutor came and said he was robbed, and he thought the party was on board his ship - I went on board the George Hibberts, and found the prisoner on the deck; he did not belong to the ship: I asked if he had anything about him - he said No; I found the jacket next to his skin, and the trousers; I asked where the waistcoat was, and in consequence of what he told me I found the waistcoat at the back of the sailor's chest, in the forecastle, and the watch-case under a water-cask in the hold - I found a pair of trousers on him belonging to another ship.
JOHN OSBORN. I belong to the George Hibberts. This property is mine - I had left it in my chest in the forecastle, the door of which was locked, but the chest open; I found the lock broken; the prisoner is a stranger, and had no business in the vessel - I fetched the officer, and found him on board; I had not seen him there before.

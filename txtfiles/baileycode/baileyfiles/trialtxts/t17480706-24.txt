            , spinster, June 17
.
Eleanor Sands. My Lord, I can only say that I was robbed, and I can swear to my goods, which I had from the man in whose house I was robbed; and they owned all before the Justice of the Peace. The buckles were in my shoes, the ring upon my finger, the cap was on my head, and my apron was on.
Q. Where was this done?
Sands. In the house of 
               
                  Simon 
                  Welch 
               



            ; he keeps a publick-house at Charing-Cross


.
Pris. Hutchinson. It is a night-house.
Q. What part of the house was this done in?
Sands. In a little room.
Q. Did you go there to drink?
Sands. It was late, and I could not get in at home, and I wanted to pass a little time away.
Q. What time was it that you went there?
Sands. I can't say.
Q. Was you disordered in liquor then?
Sands. I was not as I should be; and these good women came in, and made a property of me. I had these things when I went in, and when I walked I had not them; but who took them I don't know. When they came to sell the buckles and the ring, they quarrelled about sharing the money, and so the thing was discovered; and they said before the Justice, that Peg took the apron, and that Jane sold the buckles.

                  Henry 
               



            . I bought a ring which Mrs. Sands owns, this is the ring; I gave two shillings for it; it would not melt to eighteen-pence.
Sands. That is the ring.
Q. Is that the ring you had when you went into Welch's house?
Sands. Yes.


                  Benjamin 
                  Henry 
               



            . I bought these silver buckles of 
               
                  Jane 
                  Hutchinson 
               



            , and one 
               
                  Susannah 
                  Steele 
               



             was with her, and gave her four shillings and three halfpence for them.
Sands. These are my buckles.


                  Susannah 
                  Steele 
               



            . I went with 
               
                  Jane 
                  Hutchinson 
               



             to sell a pair of silver buckles.
Q. Did you know how she came by them?
Steele. No, only as she told me they were given her.


                  Simon 
                  Welch 
               



            . I have known Eleanor Sands about half a year; she came that night into my house in liquor, and I put her into a little room by herself, because no other persons should come to her; for the house was full of people.
Q. Were any of the Prisoners in your house then?
Welch. Yes, they were all there.
Q. Did you see them in the room with Eleanor Sands?
Welch. Yes; she was asleep, and I did not know but they might be acquainted, and I left them in the room with her to take care of her.
Q. Did Eleanor Sands complain, when she awaked, that she had lost any thing?
Welch. When she awaked, about six o'clock, she said she had lost a gold ring, a pair of silver buckles, an apron, and a cap; she told me she would make me pay for them, because they were lost in my place, and about three days afterwards they quarrelled about dividing the money.
Q. Were they at your house then?
Welch. No. This little girl, 
               
                  Margaret 
                  Sutherland 
               



            , came and discovered the whole affair, and wanted to be an evidence; she told me, she took the gold ring off her finger, and put a brass one on in the room of it; and she told me where the buckles were sold, and what they got for them; that the apron was sold in Westminster for fifteen pence, and I found the cap upon Sutherland's head. Sands had told me the mark that was upon it. Hutchinson also wanted to be an evidence, and they wanted to keep Morris out. They said she got no more than five pence of the money, and she denied the fact all along.

                  Lavers 
               



            . I am regulator of the watch of St. Martin's. I was carrying a woman to Bridewell, and in walking through the Park, 
               
                  Jane 
                  Hutchinson 
               



             told me, that 
               
                  Margaret 
                  Sutherland 
               



             was going to swear her life away; and then they confessed the robbery that was done in the cellar, and I was with them before the Justice.

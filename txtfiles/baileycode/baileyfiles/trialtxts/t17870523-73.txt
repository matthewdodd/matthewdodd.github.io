             sworn.
I keep a pawn-broker's shop; the prisoner offered a silver spoon to sell in the afternoon, about four or five o'clock; the spoon was marked Langbourn-ward Coffee-house, which gave me a suspicion of it; I asked him if he kept that Coffee-house, and he said he kept it three months ago; there was a woman in the shop, who I begged to go up to the office, and fetch one of the runners.
(The spoon deposed to.)

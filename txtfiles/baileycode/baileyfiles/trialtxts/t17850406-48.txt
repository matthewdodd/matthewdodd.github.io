             sworn.
On Wednesday, the 9th of March, I was standing in Drury lane, talking with an a quaintance, opposite White Hart-yard, between six and seven, and that gentleman came out running.
Who do you mean by that gentleman? - The prisoner; he came out of Russel-court, and they cried out, stop thief; and the boy he came crying, and said, that man has got my bundle; I suppose there were twenty or thirty people after him; the boy was about twenty or thirty yards behind him; I followed him down White Hart-yard, and caught hold of him in Clare-court.
What pace did he go? - He ran as hard as he could run; we took him to Mr. Young's, a tobacconist, and brought the boy to him, the boy had a penny in his hand; says the boy, take your penny, and give me my bundle; the prisoner said, he had not his bundle; says he, you have given it to one of the two men that was with you; no, says the boy, you took it from me. The prisoner said, at Sir Sampson Wright's, that the boy said he was going to fetch a penny-worth of butter for his mother; and the boy said, he did not say any such thing, for, he said, his mother lived at No. 20, in Swallow-street.
Court. His mother? - He called her his mother at that time, but it is his aunt.
Prisoner. The boy was quite in a different story before, at Sir Sampson Wright's, they have had him this month, and been training him up; I am as innocent of it as a child unborn; I know nothing of it.
Court. Have you anybody to speak for you? - I had a person just now in the Bail-dock, and I have sent him for my master.
What trade are you? - A coach-wheelwright; I work in Swallow-street, where the boy says he lives.
Then you have nobody here? - Not a soul, to my knowledge.
How came you to be running? - I was not running; that is not the gentleman that stopped me.

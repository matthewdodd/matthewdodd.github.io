            . I live at Bethnal Green. I hired the prisoner out of the market, the last day of June, my wife being sick; she had been with me one week: I missed my things on the 7th of July, (mentioning them by name); she left me at the time, unknown to me.

            . I am wife to the prosecutor. We went to bed about 11 o'clock, on the Saturday night, and left her to fasten the doors, and come to bed afterwards: in the morning I missed her, and the things mentioned. On the Monday I met her in the street, with my apron, cardinal, gown, and petticoat on, which she pulled off and gave to me; she owned she had pawned the buckles.

            . I am a pawnbroker. On the 9th of July, I lent the prisoner 10 s. on the buckles. (The buckles and cloaths produced and deposed to.)
Prisoner's Defence,
A young woman was on the stairs, in my Mistress's house; she was frighted, and gave me the bundle; I carried them away, and put the cloaths on; I thought of carrying them back again.

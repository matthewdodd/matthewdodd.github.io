THOMAS COTES. I am a draper, and live in High-street, Norwood. On Saturday evening, the 5th of July, I was taking in some goods at my door—I had taken some in, and was returning, for the rest—I saw the prisoner by the side of the door, just outside—I saw him take something, I do not know what—I went after him—when he had got about twenty yards, he turned down a place where there was no thoroughfare—I followed him, and saw him throw a pair of trowsers over a wall—I attempted to take him, and he struck me a tremendous blow on the face—I still followed him, crying, "Stop thief—he turned round, and three times attempted to kick me in the * * * *—he struck me, got away, and ran into the road—I followed, calling, "Stop thief"—he went down into some gardens—I followed him at least half a mile—he was then stopped by another man—we took him along till we got to a gate—he then turned round and struck the man that tried to stop him a tremendous blow—he then caught hold of me by the hair of my head, and held me about five minutes, and pulled it out by the roots—another person came to my assistance, and told me to hold him, which I did, and he struck me again on the side of the nose—he was at last secured by three of us, and given in charge to a policeman—I went to the spot where I had seen him throw the trowsers, and found them lying in the corner—these now produced are them—I can swear they are my property, by my private mark on them—they had been hanging at my door.

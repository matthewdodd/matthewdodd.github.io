WILLIAM APPLETON
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
1st of April, 1 coat, value 1l. 10s., the goods of 



Samuel Reading; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






SAMUEL READING
. I am barman at the Suspension Bridge public-house, Broadway, Hammersmith. I was a patient at St. Bartholomew-hospital—the prisoner was also a patient there—he had the next bed to me—on Saturday the 1st of April, he went away—shortly after he was gone, at half-past five o'clock, I missed my coat—this is it.





WILLIAM WHALAN
. I live in Henry-place, Waterloo-road, Lambeth. 1 was a patient in the hospital—I laid in the bed opposite the prisoner—I saw the prisoner take the coat at half-past five o'clock—he said he was going to play a lark with Reading's coat, and he went away.





JAMES TAGUS SHORT
. I am shopman to Mr. Brown, of Fetter-lane, a pawnbroker. This coat was pledged by the prisoner, I believe, on the lst of April.





JOHH BRAY
 (police-constable G 179.) I took the prisoner, and found the duplicate of the coat on him.

Prisoner. I had been out of employ, and had no means of getting anything.





SCHARLES PALMER
 (police-sergeant G 17.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction from Mr. Clark's office (read)—he is the person.




GUILTY

             sworn.
A little before two last Thursday, in the afternoon, I was standing at the side of St. Andrew's door, I saw the boy next the prisoner and another at this gentleman's pocket; and I saw the prisoner, when he saw me, throw this handkerchief in the mud; I am sure he picks forty forty handkerchiefs in a week.
PRISONER's DEFENCE.
I was going of an errand for my mother, I was never near the gentleman's pocket.
How old are you? - About ten.
Who employs you to do this? - Nobody; I go out with a basket with greens and turnips along with my father.

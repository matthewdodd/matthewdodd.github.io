             say that she had any thing at all? but you say found one of the Handkerchiefs about her Neck; I don't find that she confess'd any thing to you.

                  Anne

             say so?
Fellows. Yes.


                  Q. 
               


            (to 
               
                  John 
                  Herridge 
               



            .) What are you?
Herridge. I went with Mr. Fellows to see if I could find these Women; I happen'd to find them at the House of Mr. Tomson's; there 
               
                  Sarah 
                  Hobbs 
               



             was in the House, and she acknowledg'd she had the Handkerchief, and took the Watch, and said they had ten Shillings: And as for the Buckles, they gave them to a Soldier.
Q. What did you hear 
               
                  Anne 
                  Sparks 
               



             say?
Herridge. I did not hear her say any Thing, but she had one of the Handkerchiefs about her Neck.
Q. What do you know about the other Woman?
Herridge. We found 
               
                  Anne 
                  Hoy 
               



             in Ragg-Fair. We went into an Alehouse; she acknowledg'd to me, if the Man would give her two Guineas she would help him to the Watch.
Q. Did she confess her taking it?
Herridge. She said she did not commit any Robbery, for she was not there; but for a couple of Guineas she could help him to the Watch again.
Court. So you know nothing of her, only that she said she could help him to the Watch again.
Herridge. No.


                  Q. 
               


            (to 
               
                  Anne 
                  Scott 
               



            .) What do you know of this Matter?
Scott. This Gentleman (the Prosecutor) brought in 
               
                  Sarah 
                  Hobbs 
               



             as his Wife; he brought in this 
               
                  Anne 
                  Sparks 
               



             for her Sister; and he paid 8 d. for two Beds for them.
Court. You live there, don't you?
Scott. Sir, 'tis my own Sister; she came in as his Wife, and 
               
                  Anne 
                  Sparks 
               



             came in as her Sister.
Court. Then Sarah Hobbs he brought in as his Wife.
Scott. Yes, Sir, he paid 8 d. for his Bed.
Q. Do you know any thing of their taking these Things?
Scott. Sir, at Three o'Clock in the Morning they went to bed, as Man and Wife: She (my Sister) lets Lodgings there. The young Woman went up at Three o'Clock in the Morning, and she took away his Shoes, Watch and Money; she own'd, when she was took the next Day, the taking the said Things. She hit 
               
                  Anne 
                  Sparks 
               



             a Slap on the Face, for not taking away his Breeches, and said, Why did you not take away his Plate-button'd Coat and Breeches. 
               
                  Anne 
                  Sparks 
               



             is a very innocent Creature, I believe, and 'tis pity she should suffer. Sarah Hobbs own'd the Shoes were pawn'd in Shoreditch for a Shilling.
Q. Did she own she took any thing away?
Scott. 
               
                  Sarah 
                  Hobbs 
               



             took them all away. She waken'd 
               
                  Anne 
                  Sparks 
               



             out of a Sleep, and told her she did not understand her Trade, &c.


                  Q. 
               


            (to the Prisoner.) 
               
                  Sarah 
                  Hobbs 
               



            , will you ask this Witness any Questions?
Prisoner. I don't know any thing of her?
Q. Have you any Witnesses ?


                  Q.

                  Betts

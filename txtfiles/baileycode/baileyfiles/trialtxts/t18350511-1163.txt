GEORGE BAYLEY
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
27th of January, 2 printed books, value 13s. 6d., the goods of 



James Burns.






JAMES BURNS
. I am a bookseller, and live in Portman-street. On the 27th of January, the prisoner came into my shop with a message from Mrs. Spencer Percival, for two books—I did not know him before—I had not got the books at the time—I said I would procure them, and he was to call about half-past four o'clock for them, which he did—they were not ready—he asked me to show him some Bibles, one of which he wanted to buy for himself—two or three were shewn to him—there were other people in the shop which drew our attention from him, and in a few minutes he was gone—I missed a Bible and a Court Guide from an adjoining table—I heard nothing more of him—he never came back again for the books—I am certain he is the same person.





JOHN ROBINSON JACKSON
. I am a pawnbroker, in Gilbert-street, Grosvenor-square—I have a Bible and Court Guide, pawned by the pri-soner, on the 27th of January.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
The prisoner put in a written defence, pleading poverty.




GUILTY
. Aged 37.—


Transported for Seven Years.
There was another indictment against the prisoner.

Before Mr. Justice Park.

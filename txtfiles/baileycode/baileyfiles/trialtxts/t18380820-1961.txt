 was indicted

for stealing, on the

WILLIAM SANDERS
 (police-constable M 170.) On the 16th of August, I was on duty in Palace-yard—I saw the prisoner there and watched him for three hours—I saw him take one handkerchief out of a person's pocket, and return it again—he stood by the prosecutor for three quarters of an hour, and I was close to him—the prisoner then took this handkerchief from him—I closed his hand, and seized him directly with it—I was in plain clothes.





ROBERT HILL
. I am a gentleman's servant—I was in Palace-yard on the 16th of August, and had this handkerchief in my pocket—I did not feel it taken—this is it—(looking at it.)

Prisoner's Defence. I picked it up to give it to the gentleman, and the officer took me—I had been talking to the gentleman a long time, and telling him who the different carriages belonged to.





JOSEPH PYEFINCH
 (police-constable F 58.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the same person.

ELIZABETH WILSON
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
15th of April, 2 table-cloths, value 8s.; 2 spoons, value 6s.; and 4 napkins, value 1s. 6d.; the goods of 



William Smith, her master.






WILLIAM SMITH
. I am a hosier, and lire in High Holborn. The prisoner had been in my service about a month—I missed these articles on the 15th of April—I took the prisoner on the following morning—I sent her to inquire about a butcher's bill; I followed her, and she went into a pawnbroker's—I went in, and inquired what she had pawned—the prisoner had the custody of all my things.





JOSEPH EDWARD CRESSWELL
. I am in the employ of Mr. Barker, a pawnbroker, in Holborn. I produce a table-cloth, pawned on the 7th of April, in the name Ann Wihon—I do not know whether it was by the prisoner.





HENRY DEIGHTON
. I am a pawnbroker. I took in this spoon of a female, in the name of Elizabeth Harris—I cannot say that it was the prisoner.





JAMES KING
. I am a pawnbroker, in Holborn. This table-cloth was pawned in the name of Ann Clark—I believe the prisoner pawned it.





ARCHIBALD CAMPBELL RUSSELL
. I am a pawnbroker. I have some napkins, and a tea-spoon, which I took in, but I cannot swear to the prisoner—the prosecutor came in, in about two minutes after—I told him it was a

person in a blue bonnet; that was all the notice I took of her—I did not notice her shawl—I cannot say whether there had been any other person in the shop after she left.





ROBERT BEAKE
 (police-constable E 82.) I searched the prisoner's box—she unlocked it in my presence—I found in it five duplicates for the articles which have been produced.
(The prisoner put in a written defence, stating that being in embarrassed circumstances she had pledged the articles, intending to redeem them.)




GUILTY
. Aged 28.—


Transported for Seven Years.

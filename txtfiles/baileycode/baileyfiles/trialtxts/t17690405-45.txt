            . I live in the parish of Denham, in Buckinghamshire. I lost a fishing net, on the third of March, out of a drying ground, in the county of Middlesex.
Q. What are you?
Hankins. I am a fisherman
. My son can give a further account.
Q. What sort of a net was it?
Hankins. It was to catch jacks and trouts with.

            . I am son to the procecutor. Digging in my father's garden, I saw three men coming down by the water-side. I thought, if they did not turn over a bridge that goes to Denham, they could be upon no good. I seeing them come by that, I took a stick and went after them. I saw them very busy with their hands down, and when I got about two or three hundred yards from them, I saw them go down towards some bushes. Then I had an opportunity to get farther on. I saw them just going down before. I jumped over the Ware-Gate, and passed Fletcher; then seeing 
               
                  William 
                  Hawke 
               



             with his hand in his pocket, I thought he had got some fish about him. I called to him to stop. Fletcher said, What do you want with me? I said, I want nothing with you. Just before I got to Hawke, he took his handkerchief and wiped his face. I took hold of Lively. I could not get him on so fast as Hawke. I left him, and went on. Hawke threw some craw-fish down. I took up three. I found nine more. Lively came to us. I brought them all three to my father's. I got my father to acquit them. Going up to Denham, I advised them to pursue better ways. Lively had a little remorse of conscience, and said he would never be concerned with them any more. He added, Hawke said he would come and steal this net in the night. I let them go. I heard them go past me, and heard Lively say, Don't go any farther than the crawfish which I tied in the ditch. One of the others said, D - n it, I'll go and have the net that is worth 4 l. Going up the Moor, I met 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Gould 
               



            , my brother-in-law. I sent him down to lie in wait at Cow-Moor gate for them. I went and found the net was gone; and as I was going along, I found 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Gould 
               



             had taken Fletcher with the net upon him.


                  Thomas 
                  Gould 
               



            . I was informed three fellows were come to rob the river; I went down after them, and found the prisoner at the bar with the net on his back.


                  John 
                  Lively 
               



            . We were walking the Moor. I had catched a few crawfish, and coming down the Moor, 
               
                  Isaac 
                  Hankins 
               



            , being angry with us, took hold of Hawke, but I ran away. When we came to Mr. Hankins's house, he forgave us. Then we went up to Denham, to drink together. As he was giving me advice, I told him the intent was to come in the night and get his father's nets. They told me I should come to no harm. I went, and when we came to the Moor, I said, Let us take the crawfish, and go home. They said, No, they would go for the net. They did, and as we were coming along, 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Gould 
               



             took hold of Fletcher, who had the net on his back. Hawke and I got away.

                  Thomas 
                  Gould 
               



             asked me no questions: he came and hit me with a stick, and knocked me down. It is very false to say I had the net on my back. I go to day-labouring work.

            . I had a bushel of wheat in a sack in my waggon at Uxbridge




 some time about Michaelmas last, and in the morning it was gone. I do not know who took it. I know no more than what Lively told me.
Q. Did you ever find it again?
Gurney. No, I never did.


                  William 
                  Hawke 
               



            . I, Lively, and 
               
                  John 
                  Fletcher 
               



            , had been a fishing; coming home about eleven at night, some time in September last, we saw something in a waggon; we thought it was wheat; we went and took it, and carried it to old Fletcher's house; he said he would put a peck of his own wheat among it, carry it to Mr. Dagnell's mill, and have it ground. He carried it as he told me, and he did not chuse to grind it. It was left there a day or two, and examined by several gentlemen; afterwards he fetched it away again.
Q. Did you tell 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Fletcher 
               



             how you came by it?
Hawke. We told him we found it.
Q. Do you think he knew how you came by it?
Hawke. I believe he did not.
Mr. Dagnall. I am a miller. I ground two or three bushels for 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Fletcher 
               



            , the prisoner, that was leased wheat, and when he brought this bushel of wheat, there were some cockle and * rye among it, which was the reason I would not grind it. It was brought on a Monday or Tuesday, and he came for it on the Wednesday. I ordered my man not to do it.
* Farmers chuse to buy leased wheat of pour people to sow their land with, that being gathered by an ear at a time, it must be by accident if there is cockle in it.
Q. What was it in?
Dagnall. It was in a bag. I told him I thought he did not come honestly by it. He said his son John brought it to him.


                  John 
                  Lively 
               



            . What should I be sworn for. I know nothing about it.
Court. You must be sworn.
Lively. I will not. I know nothing of it.
Court. You are to speak the truth, and nothing but the truth, and you must be sworn.
Lively. I know nothing about it.
Court. You must be sworn, or go to Newgate.
He is sworn.
Q. Do you know Hawke?
Lively. I have know him six or seven years.
Q. Do you know 
               
                  John 
                  Fletcher 
               



            ?
Lively. I do.
Q. Upon your oath, was you, Hawke, and 
               
                  John 
                  Fletcher 
               



            , out a fishing together in September last?
Lively. We have been together a fishing several times.
Q. Do you remember your coming home from fishing, and seeing a waggon standing at Uxbridge?
Lively. Yes; I have seen waggons there.
Q. Do you remember any of your company going up into a waggon, and seeing some wheat there?
No answer.
Q. Why do you not answer?
Lively. I have nothing to answer.
Q. Will you answer the question or not?
Lively. No.
Court. Then take him away: let him stand committed to Newgate. (He was taken almost out of Court.)
Court. Bring him up once more. (He comes and stands up again.)

Court. You may offend with your eyes open; you will consider whether you will go to Newgate, or answer such questions that are put to you. You are obliged to say nothing but the truth, but you must answer the question. Do you remember either of you finding a bushel of wheat in that waggon?
No answer.
Q. Will you answer, or will you not? No answer.
Q. Will you answer, or will you not? We do not sit here to be trifled with.
Lively. I will not.
Court. Then let him stand committed, according to his former order.
John Fletcher's Defence.
I have nothing to say.

                  Fletcher 
               



            . The same.
Lively: returned with the Officer.
Officer. Lively is returned again, and desires to speak now.
He stands up.
Q. Tell me who has persuaded you to stand out thus.
Lively. Nobody, upon my honour.
Court. You are upon your oath. Are you now willing to answer, whether you, Hawke, and 
               
                  John 
                  Fletcher 
               



            , know any thing of a bushel of wheat that was in that waggon?
Lively. Y - es.
Q. Who took it out of the waggon?
Lively. One of us took it down; but I cannot say who.
Q. What did you do with it?
Lively. We carried it to 
               
                  John 
                  Fletcher 
               



            's father.
Q. Which of you carried it?
Lively. I believe I carried it myself. We set it down, and left it there.
Q. Do you know what became of it afterwards?
Lively. 
               
                  John 
                  Fletcher 
               



            's father carried it to Mr. Dagnall's mill.
Q. How do you know that?
Lively. The father told me so.
Q. What kind of a sack was it in?
Lively. That I do not know.
Q. Did you see it at the father's house afterwards?
Lively. I did, and he said Mr. Dagnall would not grind it.
Q. Had you any share of it?
Lively. No, I had not.
Q. Then how came you to take it?
Lively. Why - out of fun.
Q. Now, if you expect not to go to gaol, tell me how you came to tell me you would not answer.
No answer.
Court. Depend upon it you shall go to gaol tonight.
Lively. Nobody persuaded me.
Court. Then how came you to do it?
Lively. I - I - was loth he should be cast.
Q. Have you any friends?
Lively. Yes.
Q. Have you any body here that will be bound for your good behaviour?
Lively. No.
Court. You must stand committed till you find sureties for your good behaviour, yourself in 40 l. and two sureties; of 20 l. each. (He is committed.)
Both 

               acquitted
            .
Lively had, among other felonies, not only confesse d this fact, but given it to the Justice in his own hand-writing.

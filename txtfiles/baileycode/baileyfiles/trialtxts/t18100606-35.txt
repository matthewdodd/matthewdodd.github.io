            . I am a silk mercer
, 160, in the Minories


. On the 14th of last month, about eight o'clock in the evening, I was in my shop, I heard a noise at the door, I went to the door. I missed a cloak that had been hanging these about three minutes before.
Q.It was outside of the shop I suppose - A. Partly in and partly out. I saw the prisoner crossing the road, I pursued him and gave the alarm of stop thief; he immediately dropped the cloak, I picked the cloak up, pursued him, and brought him back; I never lost sight of him; I am sure he is the man that dropped the cloak.
Prisoner's Defence. I was going up the Minories, my prosecutor run and holloaed out, stop thief; I run down Goodman's yard to see what was the matter; they stopped me; I said you have stopped the wrong man. Two men that were running got away, and the prosecutor took me in custody.
The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.

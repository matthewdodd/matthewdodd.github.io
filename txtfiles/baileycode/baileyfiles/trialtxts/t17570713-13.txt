            . I keep a cloaths shop in Field-Lane; the prisoner came to me with the goods mentioned in the indictment to sell on a Sunday morning. I suspected they were not honestly come by, so I stop'd them and her. She was committed to Clerkenwell Bridewell. I advertised the goods, and the prosecutrix came and own'd them. Produced in court, and deposed to by the prosecutrix.
Q. Why did you suspect them to have been stolen?
Wright. She offered them all for half a guinea, and I saw a shop mark upon them.

Prisoner's Defence.
I never did nothing before in my life; I was a little in liquor.

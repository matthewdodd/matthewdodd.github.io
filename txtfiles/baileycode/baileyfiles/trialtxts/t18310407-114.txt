THOMAS MASON. I am an upholder
, and live in Castle-street, Leicester-street. On the 2nd of April, between twelve and one o'clock, I was coming towards the City, and had my handkerchief in my outside coat pocket- when I got a few yards on this side of Temple-bar, a person asked if I had lost any thing; I felt, and my handkerchief was gone - I saw the prisoner in the custody of West, who produced my handkerchief from the prisoner's breast; I have not a doubt of its a being mine -I had not observed him near me.

            . I am a Policeman. I was passing under Temple-bar, and saw the prisoner in company with two boys, following the prosecutor; I saw the prisoner take the handkerchief from the prosecutor's left-hand coat-pocket, and put into his jacket on this side Temple-bar; I secured him, and took him up to Mr. Mason, who missed his handkerchief - I took it from the prisoner; his companions made their escape - I saw them again as I was taking the prisoner to Newgate, but could not take them; I should know one of them again - they were about his own age, they bade him Good bye! as we went along.(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner. I beg for mercy, on account of my poor mother.

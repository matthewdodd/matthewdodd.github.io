            . I am an upholsterer, and live next door to the prosecutor. On the 20th of March, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, I was at my door, and saw the prisoner go along with this glass under his arm; I ran into Mr. Donaldson, and understood they had lost one; I followed, and took him in Greek-street - I took the glass from him - he then ran away, but was pursued, and brought to the prosecutor's house. I never lost sight of him.(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I was coming down Rathbone-place - it was given to me by a respectable person to carry - he was behind me all the way to Greek-street; when the gentleman came up and said it was stolen I saw the man run away.

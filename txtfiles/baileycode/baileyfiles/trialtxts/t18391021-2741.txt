OSCAR CALLIS
. I am shopman to Mr. Edward De Lima Woods pawnbroker, in King-street, Hammersmith. On the 23rd of September in consequence of information, I missed a shawl and a shirt from about a yard inside the shop door—I saw them safe about a quarter of an how before—I went with the constable, and found them on the prisoner Appleby, at a quarter before nine o'clock—Maile was with him—these are the articles.

Cross-examined by
MR. DOANE. Q. Were you in the shop the whole afternoon? A. Yes—I did not see any one take them—they were inside the shop—a person could get them without coming into the shop.





JOSEPH BAILEY
. I am servant at the Hampshire Hog public-house. About twenty minutes before nine o'clock that evening I was passing Mr. Woods', and saw the two prisoners standing against the window, looking in—Maile then parted from the other, put his hand inside the door, and took something—he went towards Appleby again, and they went away—I went into the shop and told, and then went after the prisoners.

Cross-examined. Q. Had you known either of them before? A. No—it was quite dark.





RICHARD HANCOCK
 (police-sergeant T 10.) I went after the prisoners, and found the shawl and shirt on Appleby—I produce a certificate of the prisoner Maile's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—he is the person who was then convicted, and I proved a former conviction then—this is the third time he has been convicted.

            . I am a student
 for the bar, and live in Elm-court, Temple. On the 16th of October, about half-past four o'clock in the afternoon, I was in Budge-row


, in earnest conversation with Mr. Wragg - he turned round, and said
"This boy has got your handkerchief." I saw the prisoner alone, with it in his hand.

            . I was with Mr. Blewitt. I saw something flash by, turned round, and saw the prisoner putting the handkerchief behind him. I seized him, and took it from him.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. The gentleman took me into a shop, and marked it with ink.
MR. BLEWITT. I could not find the mark at first, and was told to mark it, to know it was the one I took from him.

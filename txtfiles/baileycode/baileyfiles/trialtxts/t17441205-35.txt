            . On the 22d of Oct. my house was broke open, and I lost the goods mentioned in the indictment: I left them in my house about four o'clock, and went to Temple-bar to try on some stays, and about seven my apprentice came to me, and told me I was robbed; and my wife was in a swoon. I advertised the things the Wednesday following.

Harper. About half a year - he used to carry a yoke and tubs for his mother at a brew-house.
Q. How old is Gadd?
Harper. About fourteen or fifteen - I have heard say so - I have known him these three years.
Gadd. I am but between ten and eleven.
Q. What business has he followed these three years?
Harper. Thieving, my Lord; one night 
               
                  John 
                  Graves 
               



            ,

            , 
               
                  Richard 
                  Morris 
               



            , and myself, broke open Mr. Gorman's house; we had tried to break open several houses before we came to Mr. Gorman's, and could not do it; 
               
                  John 
                  Graves 
               



             got up upon the rails (there's a golden ball there) but seeing some people coming along, he jumped down again; after they were gone he threw the sash up, and went into the house; the first thing he handed out was a bundle of linen, and gave it to 
               
                  Henry 
                  Gadd 
               



            ; Billingsly took the next bundle of linen, there were 52 yards in all; then Graves handed out a coat and waist-coat, and Morris took them from Graves, and went away with them over Red-lion square; Graves had got a silver salt-seller, three silver spoons, and a punch ladle in his pocket, in order to keep them himself; Billingsly said he designed to sink them; we overtook Morris in Red-lion square; some of them thought to go home, but they changed their minds, and Billingsly, Graves, Gadd and I took coach and went to Duke's-place, (Morris walked all the way) to one 
               
                  Samuel 
                  Levi 
               



            , a Jew, and sold them for four pounds, sixteen shillings, and the money was divided between us five; we had eighteen shillings and six-pence a-piece, and the rest was spent. I took one of the things to be a child's boat at first. The plate, linen, and cloaths were sold all together for four pounds, sixteen shillings.
Q. What has been your business for some time past?
Harper. I am a shoemaker, but I have followed this wicked way, as well as they, these four years. - I have known Graves about half a year, I never was concerned with him in any other robbery, for he used to work very hard when I knew him first; I believe he was drawn in by 
               
                  Jack 
                  Potbury 
               



            .
Coun. to Gorman. I ask you whether you did not tell Graves's mother, that you would take twenty pounds, though the goods were worth thirty five pounds, and would go into the country, and would not prosecute him?
Gorman. Who told you that?
Coun. I ask you whether you did, or did not, say that?
Gorman. I said I did not want his life, and that I did not want to hurt the boy, for I told her I did not know any thing of the fact.
Coun. I ask you whether you did not tell her, that though the goods were worth thirty-five pounds, if she would give you ten or twenty pounds, you would go into the country, and would not prosecute her son?
Gorman. I told her, I did not want the life of any person, but I never mentioned any sum of money.

            , his house was broke open between six and seven at night; I was in the room after the robbery was committed - I can't be sure, that the window was down then, for I had not been in the room for a great while before; it was between six and seven when my mistress sent me to acquaint my master with it, and she told me, the things were just taken out.

            . I have known Graves these three years, his general character is that of an honest hard working lad, I never heard any thing amiss of him before this time.
Coun. Was you ever in company with the Prosecutor ?
King. He was in company with us yesterday.
Q. Did you hear him say, that if he had a sum of money, he would not prosecute?
King. I did not hear any talk of money, I heard him say, if he had known it sooner, he would have been out of town.

            . I have known Graves five or six years, he lives with his mother, and was always reckoned a very honest hard working lad; his father worked at a brewhouse - The Prosecutor said, that if Mrs. Graves had come to his house, and had made things easy, he would have been out of town.
Q. Did he say any thing of money?
Adams. I can't say that he said any thing of any sum of money.

            . I have known Graves almost ever since he was born till this day, he was reckoned as hard working a lad as any in England, till this was found out: he used to bring me drink every day of his life, till he was taken up.

            . I have lived in the neighbourhood by Graves near twenty years, I have known him from his birth, and since he could work he has carried tubs for his father; I never heard any ill of him, and don't think he would be guilty of a robbery.

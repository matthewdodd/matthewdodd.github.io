DENNIS GLYNN
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
31st of July, 2 pence, and 2 halfpence, the monies of 



Thomas Appleyard, from the person of 



William Henry Appleyard; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






THOMAS APPLLEYARD
. I live in Dartmouth-row, Westminster—my son William Henry is between nine and ten years old. On the 31st of July he was sent out by a woman who was working in my house, but who is not here, to buy some bread—he had the money with him—I was asleep at the time.





WILLIAM HENRY APPLEYARD
. I am between nine and ten years old. I was sent with a shilling for a loaf—I got the loaf, and had 3d. in change—I was going home, and saw the prisoner—he told me to open my hand—I said I would not—he then forced it open, took the 3d., out, and ran away—I know he is the boy—I did not know him before.





ROBERT SMITH
 (police-constable B 97.) On the 31st of July I heard a cry of "Stop him"—I saw the prisoner running, and he said it was not him that took it—I took him, and the little boy came up directly, and said he had robbed him of 3d.—I looked in the prisoner's hand, and found the 3d.





WILLIAM UPCHURCH
 (police-constable B 25.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got at Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
.* Aged 12.—


Transported for Ten Years.—Convict Ship.

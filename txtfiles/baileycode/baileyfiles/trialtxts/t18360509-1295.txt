GEORGE KEMP
. I am a policeman. I was on duty, on the 2nd of May, in Old-street-road—I watched the prisoner, in company with a third one, for sometime—I saw Marney go by the shop, pull some thing off the shop-board, and throw it down—the other came by, took it up, and went after him, and put it in his apron—Marney pulled them off and Reeves took them up—the third one ran away—I secured the prisoners, and found the boots in Reeves's apron.





THOMAS CAPPS
. I am a shoe-maker—these are my boots.

. I lost my fire irons from the house where I live. They were standing outside with other goods for sale. I heard the irons rattle. My neighbour came and asked me if I had lost anything; I said, yes, the fire irons.

            . On the 27th of July, I was looking outside of my window; I saw two men standing together. I saw the prisoner take the fire irons, and give it to the other man. I am sure the prisoner is the person that took the fire irons.

             sworn.
I served my time to the silk business, winding and doing anything in the business; I had this silk on my premises, I was going to get a light to sit down to work, it was on Tuesday the 31st of August, I had twenty bobbins, the bobbins were taken out of the place, and were dropped; I missed nineteen from my place: I thought I heard somebody in my room, I immediately went and peeped into my room, I thought I saw the shadow of somebody; I cried out, for God's sake, O my work! he made across a ditch, and got out of my sight; they were in a basket in the back room, at the window where I sit with my reel; it was about eight o'clock when I went to light my candle, I saw the glimpse of a man just turn out of the back door, I called stop thief! the man was taken by

             sworn.
I was going home about a quarter after eight, and the poor woman came out of her door and said, Lord have mercy upon me, I have lost all my master's work, and the man has run off backwards; I did not see him till after he was taken.

             sworn.
They hallooed out, stop thief! I was in the field, and saw a man run, and I run after him; I did not observe whether he had any thing or no; I seized him, he threatened to rip me up, he had his knife in his hand, it was a clasp knife, but he had not time to open it: the prisoner is the man.

I took charge of the prisoner, the 31st of August, I carried him to prison.

             sworn.
I took the prisoner, but before I caught him he cast something out of his hand, but what it was by that light I cannot say; I went and picked up a bundle of linen.
Prosecutor. They belong to my mother and sister, a parcel of cloth, they were in the garden; the silk was dropped the other side of the ditch with the basket; the neighbours about the place picked it up, I cannot say who they were, it was none of these people; I saw the basket in his hand as he went across the ditch, there was no other man went across the fields, his back was towards me.
PRISONER's DEFENCE.
I had been at Whitechapel, I heard a noise, and the people caught hold of me.
Court. What way of life have you been in? - A seaman.

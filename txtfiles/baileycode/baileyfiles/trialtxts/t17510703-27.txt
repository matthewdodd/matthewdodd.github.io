            . On the 31st of May, at twenty minutes past eleven o'clock, I came home from club, then I went to bed and the house was fast. My shop was found open at three o'clock in the morning, and the cellar window thrown into the street; the lock was wrench'd off, the staples drawn, and the goods mentioned in the indictment taken away; about the Wednesday following there came the beadle of St. John's, Wapping, and said, there was a man taken that had made a confession, that he, and others, had broke open my house, and stolen twelve or thirteen pair of breeches. They had him in custody from Thursday till Sunday, and then he found means to get out of the watch-house. He had confess'd, that

            , and the two prisoners, all knew what was become of the goods; that some of them were pawn'd to Mr. Longdale, in East-Smithfield, and some of them sold to one Baker, in Blue-anchor-yard. At the last place I found none, at Mr. Longdale's I found one pair, which I swore to be my property. I took up the two prisoners, and

She directed us to the places where she sold them both, one pair for three shillings, the other for three shillings and sixpence, one to Mr. Lyons in Rosemary-lane, the other to Mrs. Gladman. The three pair were produced in court and deposed to. Butler said, he used to lie with the prisoner, Mary, which he call'd

ANN LAWRENCE
. I am the wife of Frederick Lawrence, of Charles-street, Westminster-road. About seven weeks ago, I met the prisoner at a public-house I had never seen her before—she asked me if I would give her a little boiling water to make some tea—she brought out tea and sugar enough for one person—I let her come to my house—she remained about an hour and a half—I then said I expected my husband home, and she mast leave till after he was gone; she went—while she was there, I left her alone about a minute —two or three minutes after she was gone, I missed a shawl, which I had seen in the room while she was there—about five weeks after, I saw her in custody—I told her I would rather not give her into custody, if she would tell me how I could get the shawl—while we were talking, my husband came up, and gave her into custody.





ANN LAWRENCE, JUN
. I am the last witness's daughter—I remember the prisoner coming home with my mother; I am sure she is the person—I never saw her before, or again till she was taken—while she was at my mother's, I saw the shawl on her arm—I thought my mother had lent it her, and did not stop her.

Prisoner's Defence. I met the prosecutrix at the public-house, but did not go home with her.





JAMES COKER
 (policeman, L. 1). I produce a certificate of the prisoner's conviction—(read—Convicted here Aug. 1848, having been before convicted; and confined eighteen months.—I was present—she is the person.

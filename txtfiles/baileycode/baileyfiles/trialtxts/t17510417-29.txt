            . I am a baker
: I was with my basket in Thames-street


, near the foot of the Bridge: I had pitched my basket in order to carry some loaves over the water, a gentleman came and touch'd me on the shoulder, and said, a man had taken my handkerchief out of my pocket, and ran down the turning towards the old Swan; some body had stop'd the prisoner, and when I came there I saw my handkerchief about twelve inches from his feet on the ground; it was produced in court and depos'd to; this was about a hundred yards from the place where I pitch'd my basket.
Mr. Binks. I saw the baker with his basket on his shoulder ; at the same time I saw the prisoner put his hand into the baker's pocket and take his handkerchief out, and walk off with it; I at first imagin'd he had been acquainted with the baker, till I saw he went another way; then I told the baker, and we call'd out, stop thief, so the prisoner was taken.

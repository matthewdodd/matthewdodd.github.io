CHARLOTTE TRIBE. I am the wife of Thomas Tribe, and live at Uxbridge


. These articles I hung out to dry -I saw them safe about six o'clock in the evening, and in the morning they were gone - I knew the prisoners by sight.

            . I am a baker. I met the prisoners between seven and eight o'clock in the evening of the 13th of July, about a quarter of a mile from the prosecutor's house, in company together; Miller had a bundle - I asked what they had got - he said he did not know; I asked to see it - he put the bundle down; I opened it, and found this wet linen in it - I took them both in charge; I have seen them in company before, and know they are companions.(Property produced and sworn to.)
Barnett's Defence. A boy asked me to go bird's nesting, and these things laid on the common - he took them up, and as we came along Fletcher met us; I had told him to take them to his mother and have them cried.

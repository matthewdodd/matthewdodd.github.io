            . I am a cheesemonger
: I can only swear to the ham, it had been out of the boiler but about four o'clock, and it was lost between six and seven in the evening on the 28th of December.

            . I am servant to Mr. Heming, I saw the prisoner at the bar take the ham from off a table by the shop-door, between six and seven in the evening, on the 28th of December. He carried it below the May-pole about 30 yards from the shop door. I followed him very close, and with the assistance of another man we catched him there, he had dropped it about 13 doors from my master's house; he was very greasy, and smelt very strong of ham when taken.
Prisoner's defence.
I belong to the coal trade
, I had been over the water seeing a shipmate, I was going to get on board before it was late, and they came and stopped me.

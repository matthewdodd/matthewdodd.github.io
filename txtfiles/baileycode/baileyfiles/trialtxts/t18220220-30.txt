                  JOHN 
                  CORT
               



            . I am in the service of Messrs. Alasworth, of Manchester. I packed up some muslin for 
               
                  Abraham 
                  Turner
               



            , on the 20th of December, at Manchester; they were marked L. J. 9 and 10 - I delivered them to Foxley, the carrier, and took his receipt, which I produce.
Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. You do not know Turner - A. He is a manufacturer, of Chorley. I know these were his goods.


                  JOHN 
                  FOXLEY
               



            . I am a carman to Mr. Bache. I received two bales of goods from Cort, and gave this receipt for them, it is my hand writing. I took charge of the bales, and delivered them at my master's warehouse, at Castle-field, Manchester, they were marked 
               L. J. 
            9 and 10.


                  JOHN 
                  HAYWOOD
               



            . I am shipping clerk to Mr. 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Bache
               



            , at Manchester. I have the book containing the entry of two bales, 
               L. J. 
            9 and 10, being shipped by Aldridge's, boat, No. 8, from London, by canal.
Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Did you see them in the boat - A. No; I saw them weighed within a few yards of the boat.


                  JOHN 
                  ALDRIDGE
               



            . I am master of Mr. Bache's boat, No. 8. I received a load in the boat, in December, I brought it safe to London, as they were given to me; I delivered the cargo to Morris, at Paddington wharf. The whole cargo was right.


                  FRANCIS 
                  MORRIS
               



            . I am warehouse keeper to Mr. Bache, at Paddington. The boat No. 8, I received on the 28th of December; among other packages, there were two marked 
               L. J. 
            9 and 10, which were sent the same day to the warehouse in Moor-lane, by Kettel and Cummings; I delivered them as I received them.
Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. How did you receive them - A. I called the mark over, and checked it.


                  GEORGE 
                  KETTEL
               



            . I am a servant to Mr. Bache. On the 28th of December, I took part of a load from Paddington to Moor-lane, there were two bales among it, I do not recollect the marks. We delivered part of the load at different places by the way, and took the rest to Moor-lane.
Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. You deliver them according to your directions - A. Yes; the book-carrier delivers them.


                  JOSEPH 
                  CUMMINGS
               



            . I am guard to the waggon. I recollect on the 28th of December, taking a load of goods with the waggon, from Paddington, to Moor-lane. There were some packages there, I do not recollect the marks or numbers. We delivered part in Moor-lane, to Stephen Haines.


                  STEPHEN 
                  HAYNES
               



            . I am in the employ of Mr. Bache, at the warehouse, in Moor-lane. Cochrane was guard to one of the waggons; Atkinson was waggoner; Cork was an in-door porter to Mr. Bache; Cochrane and Atkinson's duty was to carry out goods, and bring them to the warehouse; Cork had access to the warehouse, in Moor-lane. I have a memorandum which was made at Paddington, and brought to me by Cummings, it is an entry of 
               L. J. 
            9 and 10, (reads)
"
               
                  Abraham 
                  Turner
               



            's order, two packages, L. J. 9 and 10;" Cumming and Kettel delivered it to me with the goods; the two packages 
               L. J. 
            9 and 10, were delivered me by them, and stowed in our warehouse, in Moor-lane - I checked them off as being delivered. It is my business to take an account of goods coming in and going out. On the 21st of January, we had an order from Lawrence and Jolland's for goods, and found there ought to be such packages in the warehouse - I entered them in the carrier's book for Ansford to take them. No. 10, weighed 2 cwt.
Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Who wrote this paper - A. One Huggins, he is not here. I saw those very packages, nine or ten days after they were brought. If Ansford had not called them over, I should not have checked them off. The guard delivers goods on the road, but when brought to the warehouse, he has nothing to do with them. The waggoner is under the direction of the guard, to whom the bill is delivered. The goods in Moor-lane, are in my care; I lock up, about eight o'clock, and keep the keys. When we are short of hands, the waggoner is employed in the warehouse. We have watchmen at night, and when I am absent in the day, I have a substitute.
Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. Q. Would Cochrane have to load and unload - A. If he had time; his duty is generally out of doors; he did not guard these goods to Moor-lane.
MR. ANDREWS. Q. When goods are to be taken from Moor-lane, the waggon is brought there - A. Yes; but they generally take from there direct to Paddington - they are generally loaded by Cork, Lord, and Ansford. If they are to be delivered in town, the waggon comes into the warehouse, and the goods are lowered into it - Cork would be one of the persons to do that. Ansford calls them over, and I tick them off, which enables me to say they came into the warehouse.


                  WILLIAM 
                  ANSFORD
               



            . I am porter to Mr. Bache, in Moor-lane. On the 28th of December, I remember the goods arriving, I called them over to Haines, who ticked them off; they were put in a loft up one pair of stairs. An order came from Lawrence and Co., on the 21st of January, I looked for the packages, and found No. 9 and 10, were gone. I put them away together.
JOHN CORT re-examined. I find by my book that No. 10, contained eighty-four pieces of muslin, each measuring twenty yards.


                  SUSAN 
                  SMITH
               



            . I live in Tenter-street, Little Moorfields, over some stables; I have lately lost my husband, he dealt in wool. I have known Cochrane almost all my life. In December last, he was in Mr. Bache's employ; I had seen Atkinson driving a waggon, with Cochrane in the street, before Christmas - I first knew Cork, six or seven months ago, I then saw him in the street with my husband. I have a servant named 
               
                  Jane 
                  Barber
               



            . I slept in Wilmot-street, Brunswick-square, on the 9th or 10th of January, at Mr.Morris's. I had been to the play with Mr. Morris and his wife, and slept there all night; he is no relation of mine, they lodge there. I have a brother named Smith, who is now indicted.
Q. Did you, next morning, take away any goods from there - A. Yes. I went home in a coach, and took them with me - the goods had been in the passage at Morris's house.
Q. When you went to Morris's did you expect any goods to be there - A. No; the goods were lifted into the coach by Morris and my brother. When I got home, I opened them, and found they contained muslins, they were corded up in coarse wrappers - I did not notice whether they had been opened before. There was a mark on the wrapper, in ink, I did not notice the figures or letters. My brother went home with me in the coach; he got out at the end of Old Jewry - I went on in the coach to Tenter-street, with the goods, and put them in my passage; I got home a little past nine o'clock in the morning, and my brother came home in about half an hour. Barber and I helped him to take the goods up stairs, into the sitting room, it was opened there, and contained from sixty to sixty-five pieces of muslin; I left them in the room without packing them up again. About an hour after this, Cochrane came, the girl might be in the room, and if she was, I sent her out - Cochrane said he wanted 73 l. for the muslins; I said I I could not tell what I could give for them, until I saw what they would fetch; my brother, Smith, was present at this conversation. Cochrane said he should send his wife for some for her own use; he went away, leaving the goods, and my brother went out - I did not look at the packages when they were at my house, to see the marks of them. Cochrane's wife came in about an hour or two, and took two fine pieces and another coarse, this was either on a Wednesday or Thursday. Cochrane called again the same day, and said if either of the other two men should call with him, I was to say I was only to give 40 l. for them. On Saturday night Cochrane, came with Atkinson, whom I had seen in his company in the street before, and am sure he is the man; Cochrane said to him,
"These are the goods, and Mrs. Smith is to give 40 l. for them," Atkinson said,
"Very well," they went away; I think my girl let them in that day - they were in the bed-room where the muslin was. Cochrane called in the course of the next week, to know if I had any money, I told him I had not, I had told him his wife had had three pieces, he said, very well - his wife afterwards came, I gave her 8 l. I afterwards told him she had 8 l., he said, very well; he called several times for money, and I paid him 6 l., he and his wife had in all 28 l. at different times - I thought it was 30 l., but it was counted up, and was only 28 l. On the Sunday after, before I was taken to prison, on the Monday, I saw Cork at my house, it was on the 27th of January, Cochrane was with him; we went into the bed-room, Cochrane said,
"Mistress how much money have you paid?" I said 30 l. Cork said,
"That is, right Mistress; I thought Robert was on the shuffle" - my husband's sister was there at the time, but not in the bed-room. Cochrane went away, and Cork stopped and had some ale with my brother, who was at home, but not in the bed-room - Cork called several times at my house, and enquired for my brother, but nothing passed about the goods. My brother lived with me, he was a pawnbroker's servant out of place. I paid 28 l. in all; there was one 5 l. Bank note among it; I pledged some of the goods, (two parcels) at Mr. Sowerby's, Chiswell-street, for 1 l. 10 s., and sent some to be pledged by my servant; I think she only pawned two pieces. I know Mrs. Bowers she pawned some for me. I offered some to a gentleman one morning for sale, I asked him 30 s. a piece for the fine, and 20 s. for the coarse. I know Forster, I told him I had goods to sell, and he said he would send a gentleman to look at them.
Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Your's is a room over a stable - A. Yes; I have two rooms, one leads to the other. My brother lived with me; I have two beds in one room, and a turn-up one in another - I do not know where my brother is; I did not give him notice to be off - I have not seen him since the morning I was taken to prison - he was to receive no part of the money for them, nor pay any part, he only lifted them in the coach. I was only put to the bar once at the office; I was taken there three times, as a criminal. I did not know that my brother was off when I became a witness. I had no communication with any body. Cochrane shewed Atkinson the goods, and said,
"These are the goods," he said, very well. I do not know whether my servant saw Atkinson.
Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. Q. How much did you raise on the muslins which you pawned - A. I do not know; I gave the officer all the duplicates. I went to the play with Mr. and Mrs. Morris, and next morning, Morris came up, and said George had left a large bundle in the passage, and George came up to me, he said he had them from Cochrane, and he was coming to my house to look at them - it was bulky, I did not know the contents till I got home, I did not conceal it.
Q. Might not conversation in one of your rooms be heard in the other - A. Not without paying particular attention. I told the officers of it directly they came to my house. I was not so much surprised to find muslin in it, as I might have been. I gave Cochrane's wife a 5 l. note, which I had saved for my rent; I mentioned this at Guildhall.
MR. ANDREWS. Q. Did you send the servant out of the room - A. No; she was in the sitting room - I went into the bed room. I have been in custody ever since. I have had no promise that I shall not be prosecuted.


                  THOMAS 
                  MORRIS
               



            . I live in Wilmot-street, Brunswick-square. About the 9th or 10th of January, at half-past six o'clock in the morning, some goods were brought to my house, packed in a large parcel, in canvas; it was brought by a waggon which stopped at my door, three men brought it. I did not notice any name on the waggon. I cannot swear either of the prisoners are the men, but I believe Cochrane was one of them; I had seen him before.
Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. What are you - A. An attorney's clerk. 
               
                  George 
                  Smith
               



             was one of the persons who left it - I knew him very well, he came to the door with it, I took it in, as it was left by him, it was merely brought into my passage - I had no previous communication about it. Smith asked if I would suffer him to leave it at my house, and I consented - he has absconded.
COURT. Q. Did it require more than one person to bring it in - A. I think two, for it was very heavy. Smithcame at nine o'clock for it, and went away with Mrs. Smith in a coach; I helped to lift it in the coach - it was brought about half-past six o'clock, it was then dark, I was sitting up, writing.


                  ELIZA 
                  ANN SMITH
               



            . I am sister-in-law to Mrs. Smith. I have seen the prisoner, Cochrane and Cork before - I have seen Cochrane at Mrs. Smith's once; it was on a Sunday, the day before she was taken up. I saw Cork there the same day in the afternoon, when I went, and Cochrane came while Cork was there.
Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. Q. What time did you go there - A. Between three and four o'clock. I went away, returned, and then Cochrane was there, he did not stop above a minute, he came about six o'clock, went into the parlour, but did not stop - I am the sister of 
               
                  George 
                  Smith
               



            .


                  JANE 
                  BARBER
               



            . I lived servant with Mrs. Smith, in Tenter-street, for six or seven months, till she was taken up; she went to the play on Wednesday evening, and slept out that night, she had slept out twice, the last time was on the Wednesday evening - she came home about nine o'clock in the morning, in a coach. 
               
                  George 
                  Smith
               



             had slept in the house that Wednesday night; there was a very great parcel in the coach when Mrs. Smith came home, it was taken out and taken up stairs into the bedroom - 
               
                  George 
                  Smith
               



            , my mistress, and I carried it up, 
               
                  George 
                  Smith
               



             had got up very early this morning, between five and six o'clock, for a knock came at the door. I went down to answer it, but my light went out; I did not open it, but asked who it was, and a voice, which I took to be Cochrane's, asked if George was at home. I had seen him before, and believed it to be his voice. I called Mr. Smith, went to bed again, and he went out - it was between five and six o'clock. About an hour after the parcel was brought, Cochrane came, the door was open, he went into the parlour, my mistress and 
               
                  George 
                  Smith
               



             were there; they stopped in the parlour for about an hour. I did not hear what passed, the parcel had been in the bedroom, but was afterwards taken into the parlour, it was in the parlour before Cochrane came. I saw Cochrane go out with 
               
                  George 
                  Smith
               



            , I did not go into the parlour while they were there. Before the parcel came, I had seen Cork and Cochrane at my mistress's house, the other is quite a stranger to me - I had seen them more than once before the parcel came, I had seen Cochrane four or five times before, and Cork two or three times.
Q. Had you been desired by your mistress to pawn any goods for her - A. Yes; the first thing was some of her wearing apparel, this was before the parcel was brought; after it was brought, I pledged about three pieces of muslin, for 1 l. each - she told me to take them to Mr. Sowerby, at the corner of Finsbury-street, and I pawned them there - I took one parcel to Attenborough's.
Q. Did you know of any woman coming to your mistress - A. I have seen Mrs. Cochrane there, on the morning the goods came; she took away about three pieces of muslin - I do not know Fenton, 
               
                  Christopher 
                  Atkinson
               



             and Smith were at the house when the goods were there.
Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. Q. When the knock came, you was outside - A. Yes; I did not tell the Magistrate that it was his voice, nor that Mrs. Cochrane took away any muslin, I was not asked. I have seen my mistress three times, I do not think I have talked with her about this - I cannot say whether she has spoken to me about Mrs. Cochrane; I was with her a quarter of an hour each time, and spoke to her to-day for about five minutes - I believe Cochrane was acquainted with my mistress.
MR. ANDREWS. Q. You have seen your mistress in Giltspur-street Compter, three times - A. Yes; I could not hear what Cochrane said to my mistress when he came, I heard talking in the room.


                  JOHN 
                  HORN
               



            . In consequence of information I received, I went to Mrs. Smith's house on the 28th of January, and she shewed me some jaconot muslins; I took two patterns of them, which I produce; they were in the front room, there were twenty pieces.


                  JOHN 
                  LACY HAWKINS
               



            . I am a marshalman. I went to Mrs. Smith's on the 28th of January, and found a quantity of muslins; Horn cut patterns of two of them - I found nine duplicates of muslins, pawned at different pawnbroker's, in a cash-box, in her parlour, I think it was locked. Mrs. Morris gave me one or two pieces, at her house, in Wilmot-street.


                  MARY 
                  ANN BOWERS
               



            . Mrs. Smith employed me to pawn muslin for her two or three times - I pawned them at Matthews's, Attenborough's, and Barker's, (looks at the duplicates), these are what I got for them, it was on the 10th, 12th, and 22d of January - I pawned them in the name of Smith.


                  THOMAS 
                  SOWERBY
               



            . (Looks at some duplicates), These are mine; they are dated the 10th and 12th of January. I produce the goods answering to them - I believe Mrs. Smith pawned one of them, they are both pawned in her name - I advanced 2 l. 10 s., and 1 l. on them.

            . I am captain of Mr. Bache's boat, the Defiance. About the 21st of January, I met Cochrane, at Paddington, by Pickford's warehouses; he asked me if I had met his waggon, I said, No. He said he thought the waggon had been come, and that he had been into the town, to carry a great deal of money for Mr. Bache; he put his hand to his side-pocket, and shewed me a great quantity of sovereigns, there was a handful of sovereigns.

            , re-examined. Cochrane had some talk with me about money, about the time the muslin was missed; he came to me and said, he had been extremely fortunate, that he had found a purse, containing a sum of money; I asked how much, he said there was some sovereigns in it. I asked him if there was any bills in it, to lead to a discovery of the owner, he said, Yes; there was a bill; I asked if it was a bill of exchange, he seemednot to understand me; I asked if it was a Bank of England note, he said it was very much like one, that he found it near the London Docks - I advised him to have it advertized, he said he would look at the papers and see if the owner had advertized it. I cautioned him not to make an extravagant use of it; he said he would not, and that he had handed it over to his wife. About a week or ten days after, we had a further conversation; he said it contained more than he had told me. I asked him what, he said it contained a bill of 10 l., payable at the Bank of England, but not a Bank note, and that it had been out for three or four years, that his brother had taken it, and it was paid without hesitation - he had 32 s. a week.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
COCHRANE'S Defence. I can account for the money. My master sent me to Charing-cross, for twenty-one sovereigns; I often had 30 l. of his money. The money I spoke to Haynes about I found the Sunday before Christmas-day; as I was going to Limehouse. I told him to look in the papers for an advertisement - it was as hard for me to get the goods, as to break from this bar.
Atkinson put in a written defence, denying the charge, and stating that the guard always directed him to deliver the packages.

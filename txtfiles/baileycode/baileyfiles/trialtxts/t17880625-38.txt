I keep the Anchor and Crown, Fleet-Market
, I know of losing the pots, the prisoner did not take them out of my house, they were lost from a neighbour's door.
The prisoner was taken with the pots upon him, which were produced and sworn to.
PRISONER's DEFENCE.
After what has passed I have nothing to say, I was in distress at the time I took them, I acknowledge myself guilty; my situation is so that I have strayed from my friends, and nobody knows my present situation.
Court. Where do you belong to? - To London.
How have you got your livelihood? - By selling things with a horse and cart; I have kept my situation unknown to the world, because I thought if ever I obtained my liberty, it would be the means of hindering my getting my bread.

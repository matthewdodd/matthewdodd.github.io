MARGARET SULLIVAN
 and 




MARY ANN HARRISON
 were indicted for

 stealing, on the 
30th of July, 2 shawls, value 1l., the goods of 



Charles Hook; and that 
HARRISON had been before convicted of felony.





WILLIAM DONOGHUE
. I am shopman to Mr. Charles Hook, of St. John-street. On the evening of the 30th of July the two prisoners came into the shop—Harrison asked for some bonnets which she had seen in the window previously—one of them then fetched in a third party, they said they would have a shawl then, and a bonnet at some future period—I showed them I suppose thirty shawls—they fixed on one silk shawl, but a fourth person was to be fetched in—an aunt—the person who went out for the aunt took two shawls oat, and never returned—I laid a shawl which I had in ray band, on the counter, and sent a lad for a policeman—I cannot say which of the prisoners it was who went out for the third person—it was the third person who took the two shawls—I am sure of that, I had laid the shawls on the counter, and no one was in the shop but the third person and the two prisoners—I told the prisoners of it, and they said I must be mistaken—it was one of the prisoners who told the other one to fetch the aunt—they did not buy any thing—they had only 1d. on them.

Harrison. The other one who went out had my money, 18s. or 19s.; she had moved away from the street where I lived about a month before.





EDWARD GEORGE STONE
 (police-constable K 209.) I produce a certificate of Harrison's former conviction, which I got at Mr. Clark's office —(read)—she is the person.

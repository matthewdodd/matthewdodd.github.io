ROBERT PERRY
. I am shopman to Robert Fulcher, linen-draper, Hackney-road. About half-past five o'clock on the 24th of Nov. this printed cotton was on the railings inside the door—I saw it drop from the railings—I watched it about a minute—the hand of a person took it from the shop—I went out-immediately, and saw the prisoner with it in his arms—I took him—he threw it into the gutter.

Prisoner. Another man dropped it and ran away. Witness. No; a girl

came and told me of it: I told her to go on, I had seen it myself, and would watch it—the girl said he was the man.

Prisoner. It was my birth-day, and I was intoxicated.





TIMOTHY M'CARTHY
 (police-constable H 73.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—I am sure he is the man—I have not the least doubt oi it—I was present at his trial.

Prisoner. I was never here before in my life. He it perjuring himself.




GUILTY.* * Aged 21.—


Transported for Seven Years.

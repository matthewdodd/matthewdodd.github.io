            .
Q. Are either of them here? - A. No.
Q. Then you cannot know the nature of the partnership between them? - A. No; they carry on the livery-stable business

; the property was taken from the stable, which is all under one roof with the house, on Sunday morning, the 7th of June.
Q. Was the prisoner a servant, or a stranger? - A. He rode in the yard some time back; the stable was shut up about twelve o'clock on the Saturday night; the articles mentioned in the indictment were in the stable; I was alarmed by the watchman about one o'clock in the morning; I saw part of the property in Spitalfields watch-house about ten o'clock the next day.

             sworn. - I am a watchman: About three o'clock in the morning I met the prisoner in Wheeler-street, Spitalfields, with a bundle upon his shoulder, containing a chaise-harness, a horsesheet, and two bridles; I asked him what he had got there; he said, d - n my blood, what was that to me; then he said it was his own property; then he dropped the things, and called to his partner; he knocked me down, and they fell upon me and beat me terribly; there were five of them, and then they all ran away.
Q. Did you pursue them till they were taken? - A. No.
Q.Had the prisoner a round hat on? - A. Yes; I did not see him till the Monday morning, about ten o'clock.
Q. How did you know him again? - A. I took very particular notice of his face and his dress; he was in the same dress.
Q. Knowing this man's life to be at stake can you take upon yourself positively to say that he is the man? - A. I am confident of it. (Produces the property).

             sworn. - On Sunday, the 7th, 
               
                  Patrick 
                  Hannah
               



             came to my house; I heard that some harness had been stopped; I was in the neighbourhood of Petticoat-lane, I met the prisoner, I knew that he had worked on the premises; I said, James, I want to speak to you; I told him his old mistress's premises were broke open; that five of them had knocked the watchman down, and got away, and, from the description, he was one of the five;he then immediately owned that he was the man who knocked the watchman down.
Q. You had not told him it would be better for him to confess? - A. I had not in the least; Addis, the watchman, was sent for to the watch-house, and he picked him out; the man seemed very much bruised and beat about the head.(Hannah identified the articles produced by Addis.)
The prisoner did not say any thing in his defence.

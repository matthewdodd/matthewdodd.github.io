, of Fore-street, City


. On the 28th of May, at half-past eight o'clock in the evening, the prisoner and a boy came into the shop together; I saw the boy draw his hand from a drawer of ribbons on the counter, and give something to the prisoner - I taxed them with it, and before I could get round the counter they ran off, and the prisoner dropped these ribbons against the door: they are my master's property; I followed, and never lost sight of him till the officer took him.

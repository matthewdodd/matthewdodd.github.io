109. 




MARTHA MILWARD
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
23rd of November, at 
St. Andrew, Holborn, 1 violin, value 20l., the goods of 



Jane Ellis, in her dwelling-house.






GEORGE CUTLER
. I live with my father, in Union-place, St. Andrew, Holborn. Between seven and eight o'clock in the evening I was coming up the narrow part of the place, and saw the prisoner inside Mrs. Ellis's house, looking out on the step of the door—she went in again, and I got just up to the door, when she came out with the violin in her hand—I followed her, and told Mrs. Ellis's son, who caught hold of her, and took it from her—she said nothing.





JOSEPH ELLIS
. In consequence of what Cutler told me, I stopped the prisoner, and took a violin from her—I have seen her come into my mother's shop to sell fiddle-bows—she lives with a fiddle-bow maker.





CHARLES PALMER
. I am a policeman. The prisoner and violin were put into my hands—she said she did not know what she was after.





JANE ELLIS
. My husband is dead—he dealt in violins. I know this

to be mine—I value it at 20 guineas—I am sure it is worth more than 5l.—I recollect my husband asking 25 guineas for it.

Prisoner's Defence. About three weeks ago I received a severe cut in my head, which has affected my brain very much—I was not in my senses at the time I committed the rash net, which has brought me to this disgraceful situation.




GUILTY* of stealing under 5l. Aged 43.—


Transported for Seven Years.

Second Jury, before Mr. Recorder.

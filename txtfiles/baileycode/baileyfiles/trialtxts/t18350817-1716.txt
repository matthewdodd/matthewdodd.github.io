ELIZABETH MARTIN
. I am a widow, and live in Charlotte-street, Whitechapel. On the 31st of May the prisoner came and took a lodging, at 2s. a week—there was a pair of sheets on the bed, and a towel in the room—the next morning they were gone—he did not return.

Prisoner. She said she did not know the sheet. Witness. No; I said I should know it by the tear.

JOHN SEAFFER
. I am in the service of a pawnbroker—this sheet and towel were pledged by a female—this is the duplicate I gave her.

Prisoner. I am not the person.

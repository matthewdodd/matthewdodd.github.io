1131. 




SAMUEL MATTHEWS
 was again indicted

 for stealing 2 sheets, value 8s., the goods of 



Margaret Jane Woodgate and others.






MARGARET JANE WOODGATE
. I live with my mother and brother—they keep the Bell Inn, Friar-street, Southwark. On the 23rd of Feb. the prisoner came for a bed—he was shown to one—no other person lodged at the house that night—there were three rooms on a floor—next morning I received information, and there was one pair of sheets gone from the next room to the one the prisoner slept in—the end of the sheet was turned over, and one sheet brought from No. 10 room, and put into No. 9—the bolster was covered as if with a pair of sheets—there was no person to take them but the prisoner—I am positive he was the only lodger in the house.

Prisoner. You saw me in the morning when I went out. Witness. No, I was not up.





LOUISA FRANKS
. I am the servant at the house—I saw the prisoner going out the next morning—he looked very stout round the waist, ready to burst.

Prisoner. Q. Did you answer the bell when I rung? A. Yes—you went

down to the bar, and stopped a good bit—I looked at your room, and it was all right—I had no idea of going into the other rooms.




GUILTY
. Aged 40.—


Transported for Seven Years.

(There was another indictment against the prisoner.)

             (Police-constable N 72). On the 3rd of July I met the prisoner at the end of Shoreditch - she bad something concealed under her apron; I thought it was something she ought not to have - I pursned, and asked what it was; she said a bottle which had been given to her, but she did not know by whom; I said she must go to the station, and on the way there she said it was given her by her mother, who had borrowed it the day before, to get some wine, as she was ill - I at last found the prosecutor.

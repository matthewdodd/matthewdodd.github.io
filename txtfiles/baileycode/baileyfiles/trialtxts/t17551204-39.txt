                  Joseph 
                  Vernham 
               



            .

Q. Do you know 
               
                  Jane 
                  Porteir

                  Joseph 
                  Vernham

                  Jane 
                  Porteir 
               



            ?
Sevane. I was present at their being married.
Q. When was it?
Sevane. I can't be certain as to the day; as it stands in my remembrance it was in June last.
Q. Where were they married?
Sevane. At the Savoy chapel.
Q. Who married them?
Sevane. I believe it was the prisoner at the bar, by what I can recollect of the man.
Q. Look at him now, and tell us as well as you can?
Sevane. I think it was him.
Q. How old was Miss Porteir at that time?
Sevane. I think she was not twenty-one years of age.
Q. Where did 
               
                  Joseph 
                  Vernham

Q. Is the Savoy chapel in the parish of Covent Garden?
Sevane. I don't know what parish that is in.
Q. Were any questions asked about consent?
Sevane. Yes, there was. The last evidence and I, the night before the marriage, had heard the mother say her daughter was at liberty to marry whom she pleased. I believe she had made some endeavours to persuade her against the marriage before that; but she said her daughter was at her liberty, and the daughter called the last evidence and I in, to hear her mother say that.

Q. Where was the father?
Sevane. The father and mother did not live together.
Q. Did you know the father's opinion at that time?
Sevane. I never heard the father's opinion before that time.
Q. What have you heard of it since?
Sevane. I have heard since that he disapproves of the marriage. The mother said to us, you may tell the parson that marries them he never will be troubled by any of our family.
Cross examination.
Council. You say you was present at this marriage?
Sevane. I was.
Q. Did the minister refuse to marry them till he heard of the consent?
Sevane. He did. We told him what the mother had said, and he said, he thought that consent was not sufficient, but if we had it signed by the mother, that he took to be sufficient; and upon that he married them.
Q. Was there any thing said by her of having authority from her husband?
Sevane. She said we might assure the parson that married them that none of her family would trouble him.
Q. Did not you understand by that declaration that there was the consent of the father as well as the mother?
Sevane. I imagined there was a kind of an understanding between the mother and father.
Q. How an understanding?
Sevane. That she spoke from what she had heard the father say.

Sevane. There was a kind of a licence, but I don't know what that was; it was something upon parchment, and the vacancies were filled up.
Q. Filled up by whom?
Sevane. I believe by the clerk.
Q. Was the prisoner present ?
Sevane. He was.
Q. Was that licence fetched from the Commons, or the archbishop of Canterbury's office ?
Sevane. It was taken from out of a cupboard or off a table in the chapel.
Prisoner's defence.
I intirely rest upon your lordship's judgment. I did not knowingly do it to offend against the laws, of my country; it is not probable I should do such a thing knowingly when I married my own son there. I never knowingly or wilfully transgressed the laws of my country; I married them by a licence, and that I thought a proper authority.
For the prisoner.

Q. How long have you been clerk?

Q. Do you look upon it to be a peculiar jurisdiction ?

Q. How do you govern yourselves?
Philips. There is a chapel-warden and overseer.
Q. Do they go to qualify themselves at the commons?
Philips. I never heard that they did.
Q. Who repairs the chapel ?
Philips. The minister has done several repairs.
Q. Has Mr. Wilkerson been minister since you came there?
Philips. Yes, he has.
Q. Do you know any thing of his granting licences there?

Q. Do you know he did before the late act of parliament ?

                  Page 
               



             and 
               
                  Elizabeth 
                  Price 
               



             by licence, 1687. Here is a great many by publication of banns, and some by licence.
Q. Do you still continue putting them down in this manner?
Philips. We do, but do it more perfectly.
Q. Did you ever see in any register any alteration, where it was by a different licence?
Philips. I think I have seen two instances, one by licence from the archbishop of Canterbury, and the other from the bishop of London; all the other licences are by the minister of the Savoy.
Q. Whether you thought you was aiding and assisting in any fact contrary to act of parliament, when you assisted in these marriages?
Philips. No, I did not. I thought them good licences.
Q. Whether you ever knew any jurisdiction as to the bishops of London or Canterbury to be exercised in this chapel ?
Philips. No, I never.
Q. Did you ever look upon yourselves to be under any visitation ?
Philips. No, I never did.
Q. In what light did you look upon it?
Philips. I look'd upon it that the minister himself was ordinary, and sufficient to grant licences.
Q. What is the form of your licences?
Philips. The form of them is this '' That whereas '' such and such persons, aged so and so, are desirous '' to live in the holy state of matrimony, without '' publication of banns, &c. therefore he consents '' that the same be solemaized in St. John Baptist's '' chapel; and signs his name 
               
                  John 
                  Wilkerson 
               



            , '' ordinary and minister.'' (He produced a licence on parchment.)
C. for Crown. What is that?
Philips. This is the licence the pair were married with.
C. for Crown. Was that fill'd up before they were married ?
Philips. It was.
C. for Crown. Was it sign'd by Wilkerson before it was fill'd up, or after ?
Philips. It was before it was fill'd up.
Q. Do you remember any thing of the marriage of Vernham ?
Philips. I do. I remember it was very remarkable. Vernham and miss Porteir came three or four days running, and desired to be married; they were refused because she was something under age. They could not be married unless she had her friends consent.
Q. Who refused it?
Philips. Mr. Grierson and I did. The last day they came, they brought two gentlemen along with them (who have been sworn ) to facilitate the marriage. She said she had a father, but her father and mother had been parted several years; but she said, as for me my father does not care if I go to the devil. We said you must have the consent of them, or else you must not be married. Then Mr. Death and the other gentleman went to the mother with a paper; for miss said she would never go home till they were married; and upon this the two gentlemen returned, and produced the mother's consent, and they both testified it, and said they saw the mother sign it; and we made them sign their names and places of abode. Then we fill'd up the licence, and they assented to every part contain'd there. The one declared himself a batchelor, the other a single woman.
Q. Whether you don't think Mr. Grierson used such caution for fear of offending against an act of parliament?
Philips. He was very cautious.
Q. Did not you beleive that to be a good licence?
Philips. I did believe it to be as good a licence as any from the archbishop of Canterbury.

            . I work for Wm. Honeywill, of Berner-street, Oxford-street. On the 18th of April, about half-past five o'clock in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner coming out of the counting-house, with this box-coat under his arm - he was quite a stranger; as soon as he saw me he threw it down. I laid hold of him at the door and asked what he wanted - he said he wanted a job, and that he was in distress; the coat laid in the counting-house, about four yards from the door - my master was at tea; he has had the coat two years.
Prisoner. Q. Where was the coat? A. On the stool - and when you took it, you threw it down by the stool.

Prisoner's Defence. I went to look for a job, being a coachmaker; I went into this house, and seeing nobody went backwards.

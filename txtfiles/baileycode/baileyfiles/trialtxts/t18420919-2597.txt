. I live in Broad-street, Bloomsbury. About six o'clock in the evening of the 30th of August the prisoner came to my window, put her arm across, and took this piece of bacon, she then came into the shop, spoke to a woman, and went out—I went and took her, about a hundred yards from the shop, with it—the bacon produced is mine.

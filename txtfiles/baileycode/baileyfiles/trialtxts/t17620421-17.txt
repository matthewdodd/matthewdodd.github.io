The prosecutors are chairmen

; they were waiting in Brewer street


 for their fare on the 10th of March; while they were in the passage to screen themselves from the inclemency of the weather, the things mentioned were stolen. The two prisoners were found in John's-street sitting together at the step of a door, and the things behind or partly under the woman.
Wilkinson in his defence said, he was a coachman; he had been drinking with a brother coachman; was got a little in liquor. As he was going home saw Clark sitting; he asked her, what she sat there for? She said, she was not well. He asked her, if she would drink part of a pot of beer; she would not: then he sat down by her; and in about five or six minutes came the chairmen, and asked, if they had seen such things? That he knew nothing of them till the woman got up.

                  Anderson 
               



             above 20, all gave him a good character.

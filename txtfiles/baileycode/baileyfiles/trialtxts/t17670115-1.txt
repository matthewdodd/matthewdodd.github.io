            . I live in High Holbourn; I keep a sale-shop. The prisoner came to me on the 9th of January, about twelve or one o'clock, with another old cloaths-man; the old cloaths-man said he has got a coat and waistcoat to sell, but he thought he asked too much for them; the prisoner shewed me them; he asked 18 s. for them; I bid him 14 s. he and I agreed: after that I had a message from Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            ; I went there; there was the prisoner; I took the coat and waistcoat with me; the prosecutor swore to them.
Q. to prosecutor. Where were your cloaths taken from?
Prosecutor. They were in a box up two pair of stairs in an alehouse.
Q. Did the prisoner use that alehouse?
Prosecutor. I never saw him there; I had no key to it; the people used to lock the door.
Prisoner. I have nothing to say for myself; I own I am guilty of the fact.

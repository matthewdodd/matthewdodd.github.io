            . My husband's name is Stephen; we keep a toy-shop
 at Charing-cross


. The prisoner came and asked to see a pair of silver buckles, about three weeks ago; he fixed upon a pair and asked the price, I went to weigh them; he then took up another pair and went out, I followed him out and called to have him stopped, he was soon brought back with the buckles.
Mr. Beaver. On the 13th of June I was going by this shop, I heard her call, stop thief; I pursued the prisoner, who ran up a court where was no thoroughfare; he had something in his hand, I asked him, what he was going to do with that in his hand, not knowing but he had got a pistol; he said, he was going to throw the buckles into a hole. I took them from him, and brought him and them back. (Produced in court, and deposed to by prosecutrix.)
Prisoner's Defence.
I went out of the shop to shew the buckles to a person that was in the street.

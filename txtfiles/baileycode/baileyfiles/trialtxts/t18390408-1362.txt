GEORGE LEQUIRE
. I live in Peter's-lane, Cow-cross, and am a boot and shoemaker. The prisoner lived in the same house with me, but he had no right in my room—I missed the articles stated, on the 29th of March.





PETER M'DONAGH
. I was in a public-house on Friday night, the 29th of March—the prisoner came in with a parcel of tools—he offered them for sale—I refused to buy them, but he said he had not had a bit of bread all day, and I gave him 6d. for them.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

Prisoner's Defence. I was in great distress, and on Good Friday I met a man who asked me to carry these for sale—I did, and got 6d. for them—I returned with the money, and received only 2d. for my trouble.





SAMUEL PARKER
 (police-constable G 100.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the man.




GUILTY
. Aged 27.—


Transported for Seven Years.

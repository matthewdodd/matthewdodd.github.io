            . I keep a cheesemonger's shop
, near Temple-Bar


; the Prisoner came into my shop the first of December, pretending to buy a hock of bacon; after she had been a little time in the shop, she goes to the door as though she would consult her husband, crying John ! John! still she kept going farther from my door; I look'd upon my stacks of cheeses that had an equal number on each stack, I presently miss'd one Gloucestershire cheese: I stept after her, still she went forward crying John! John! I took hold of her, and tax'd her with stealing a cheese; she denied it, I felt about her under her petticoats, and could not perceive it; at last when I oblig'd her to move, I found the cheese between her legs.




               Guilty 10 d.

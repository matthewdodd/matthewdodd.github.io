 to Mr. Mitchell, of Wimpole-street


. On the 8th of August, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, I came in and put my hat in the passage, and in a quarter of an hour I heard somebody knock at the area door, and found the officer with the prisoner and my hat. He must have come in at the area door to take it.

            . On the 8th of August I passed the prisoner with another boy; I had been watching them several days; and in about five minutes the prisoner went down the area and came up with this hat and gave it to the other boy (whose name is Dwyer), to look at; he returned it to him. I took hold of the prisoner, he endeavoured to throw it down. He said I would not allow him to beg and so he must thieve. I tried to take the other boy but he escaped.

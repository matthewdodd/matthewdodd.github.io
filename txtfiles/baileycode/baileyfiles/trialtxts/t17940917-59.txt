                  WILLIAM
                   SPICE
               



             sworn.
I am a coachman
 to Mrs. Bevan, at Dalton, in the parish of Hackney. On the 12th of August I lost my property out of the stable, I lost a double gilt metal watch, a stop watch with a gold seal; I lost eleven neckcloths, and all the articles in the indictment.
Q. When did you see them before? - I saw them that same day, Friday, at twelve o'clock, as I missed them at nine o'clock the same night; at nine o'clock I went to take out my money and watch, and then I missed the things.
Q. Where was it kept? - They laid on the top of the box, just inside of the lid, on the top of the other things; in consequence of my loss, I went to the public house, a little way off the village, to know if I could hear of them, I went afterwards to the public office, and I had hand-bills printed, and distributed about the town; I heard of them on the 28th, I was sent for to the office, I see this 
               
                  Ann
                   Murphy
               



             sitting in the room when I went in, and I heard Mr. Armstrong asking her some questions, and I had got this mark in my pocket, that my linen was marked with, the letters of my name, set as they are now; then Mr. Armstrong shewed it to her, and she said, I believe I have got a shirt at home in my lodging, that is marked so; and that gave me a suspicion that the watch, which she had told Mr. Armstrong, that was then in pawn, was my watch; then Mr. Armstrong and I went to the lodgings, and we found this shirt; this 
               
                  Ann
                   Murphy
               



             lived in the lodging of 
               
                  George
                   Carr
               



            ; the shirt was in a bundle, it is my shirt, I have it here; then we went to Mr. Dexter's, where this 
               
                  Ann
                   Murphy
               



             told us the watch was pawned, there we found the watch, and that proved to be my watch, that watch is here likewise; and then we came back into the office, and asked this Ann Murphy, if she knew of any more things? and she said, yes; and then we went to another pawnbroker's, Mr. Warner in Spitalfields, and we found a shirt, and a pair of silk and cotton stockings, marked the same as the other; then we came back again to the office, and I was ordered to go the next day morning to New Prison, at Clerkenwell, where these two prisoners were, and there I found both these two prisoners, and this Reynolds was called up, and I looked at his linen, to see if he had got any thing of mine, and there I found a shirt on his back, which was mine, the mark was taken out, the shirt is here; 
               
                  George
                   Carr
               



             said, that this Ann Murphy had nothing to do with the watch, he pawned the watch himself.
Q. Was it recommended to him to consess any thing about it? - He was asked how he came by it? he said 
               
                  Ann
                   Murphy
               



             knew nothing about it, he brought it himself.
Q. Was not this examination taken in writing? - Yes, it was.
Q. Did you find any more of your things? - Nothing more.
Prisoner Reynolds. When he came to the prison to me, he said, directly as I came up, that is not my shirt, that has got a frill, and never a one of my shirts has got a frill on. - I said it was not my shirt on account of the frill, but when I saw the place where the mark was cut out, I saw it was my shirt.
Q. He went into the room along with the young woman that is evidence against me, and he offered her five guineas if she would swear that she cut the name out of the shirt, and sewed the frill on? - I never offered her any thing, she owned herself that she let it out at the collar, it was not big enough for him.
Prisoner Carr. These things that are brought against me now, I bought of two jews together, in Rosemary-lane.

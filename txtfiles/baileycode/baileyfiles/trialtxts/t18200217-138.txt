            . I am a cutler, and live in Bishopsgate-street. About three months ago the prisoner came to my shop, pleaded distress, and asked me to buy these things; I said they were of no use to me, but in consequence of his distress I bought two dozen of bistery scales for 2 s. In about half an hour he brought some lancet scales, and said he found them in some rubbish. I gave him 18 d. for them. About a month after, I sold them to Petch's wife.

CAROLINE EARLE
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
22nd of February, 1 thimble, value 6d.; 2 rows of beads, value 6d.; 2 pairs of socks, value 4d.; 3 yards of ribbon, value 6d.; and 1 tea-caddy, value 5s.; the goods of 



William Smith.






MARIA SMITH
. I am the mother of William Smith, of Ebenezer-place, Shackle well. This property was missed between four and seven o'clock, on the 22nd of February, from a tea-caddy in the front room—the door was on the latch—I had seen the prisoner two or three times—she lives a Church-street, Newington.





JOHN BURGESS
. I am a pawnbroker, and live in High-street, Kingsland. I produce a tea-caddy, pawned with me by a young woman resembling the prisoner, about eighteen years of age, but I can hardly say that it was her.





CATHERINE RICHARDS
. I have known the prisoner five or six month—she made my little girl a present of this row of beads on Saturday morning, the 23rd of February.





JAMES PLAYFORD
. (police-sergeant N 3.) I apprehended the prisoner.





MARY SMITH
. I am the wife of William Smith. These beads are my little girl's, and this caddy is mine—I leave my mother-in-law in the house when I go out—my room is on the ground-floor—I know the prisoner—she lived servant in a house where I worked six month ago.

Prisoner. I picked the beads up.




GUILTY
. † Aged 18.—


Transported for Seven Years.

WILLIAM BROUNGER sworn.
Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am a salesman in that part of Houndsditch which is in the city, in partnership with William Cheney Prosser; the prisoner was our porter; the partnership was dissolved on the 20th of last February, In consequence of an information the latter end of February, I can not tell the exact day, I found I had lost some of my property.


                  Q. 
               


            Was that information before or after the dissolution of the partnership? - A. A few days after; I went with an officer, Mr. Sapwell, and took up the porter; he was searched, but nothing of any property of mine was found upon him; he was taken to the Compter, and the next day examined by the Lord-Mayor.
Court. Q. At the dissolution of the partnership what became of the property, did it become your's? - A. Yes.
Mr. Knapp. 
               
                  Q. 
               


            When did you dissolve the partnership? - A. On the 20th of February.

Q. Did your partner dwell in the house before that? - A. He hid.
Q. Then he left it? - A. He did.


                  Q. 
               


            Did you go any where before you went to the Lord-Mayor to make any search? - A. I don't recollect that I did; Sapwell, the constable, went with me afterwards to the prisoner's lodgings, Sparrow-corner, Tower-hill; we searched his lodgings and found two small pieces of linen cloth, upon one of which was my private mark, it was found in a room that had the appearance of a kitchen, in a drawer; I am quite certain it was my property; we did not find any thing else.
Cross-examined by Mr. Jackson. Q. You dissolved the partnership on the 20th of February? - A. Yes.
Q. How did you settle the matter? - A. I paid him his proportion of the profits, and took upon me the property, and all the debts; the agreement left the whole of the property with me; I was to pay for it as soon as the attorney had drawn out the deed, that was in about ten days, or a fortnight; I believe, not a fortnight.
Q. That was after the prisoner was in custody? - A. It was.
Q. You are in a large wholesale way of business? - A. Yes.
Q. You supply a great variety of shop-keepers with different articles? - A. I do.


                  Q. 
               


            When had you seen this piece of cloth, before you saw it in his lodgings? - A. I cannot say.
Q. You are in the habit of selling large quantities of linen of that sort? - A. I do, when made up, feldom otherwise.
Q. Upon goods of the same description and price, you put the same kind of mark? - A. Yes.
Q. You cannot say whether you had sold this particular piece formerly or not? - A. I cannot say.


                  Q. 
               


            You have a considerable number of persons in your employ? - A. Yes.


                  Q. 
               


            There are a great many fragments about the house of course? - A. Yes; I had not missed the things.


                  Q. 
               


            Whether they were taken from your house at one time, or separate times, you cannot pretend to say? - A. I cannot; I would have it understood, that all the property was not in the situation of this linen.


                  Q. 
               


            When you sell your goods, you neither take off your marks nor your tickets? - A. No.
Q. Of course, if this had been sold, it would have continued its mark? - A. It would.
Q. This man has lived a number of years with you? - A. I believe six years, with a short interval.
Mr. Knapp. 
               
                  Q. 
               


            Had you sold this linen to your servant? - 
               
                  A. 
               


            Certainly not.

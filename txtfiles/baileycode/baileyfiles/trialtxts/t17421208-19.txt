            . On the 16th of last Month, I was with this Person at the Bar, at the House of one Mrs Smallpiece. - The Prisoner lodges there. I went in with another young Woman, 
               
                  Sarah 
                  Phillips 
               



            , between one and two o'Clock in the Afternoon, and sat down at the End of the Table with the Prisoner's Concern.
Q. Concern! What is that?
Emmet. She called her so: I do not know what she meant [Consort or Companion] which was 
               
                  Sarah 
                  Phillips 
               



             . 
               
                  Sarah 
                  Phillips 
               



             and I laid down upon the Bed together; I was not there above two Minutes, before the Prisoner came and laid down by my Side. I was no sooner laid down, but I was fast asleep: In a little Time I started up, and seeing the Prisoner was gone, Lord! says I to 
               
                  Sarah 
                  Phillips 
               



            , where is the other Person? She said she was gone. The Door was lock'd, and the Key put under it. I felt under the Bolster for my Watch, and it was gone. It was ten Days before I found this Woman, and it was said, that she went and was married with the Money she made of the Watch; but it has been prov'd since, that they were only married by jumping over a Mop-stick.
Q. Was the Prisoner gone when you fell asleep?
Emmet. The Prisoner was not gone before I fell asleep, but she was gone before I was awake. - The Prisoner fell asleep, and I believe we all fell asleep. - I have had my Watch again: She confessed before the Alderman that she took it, and told that Gentleman (
               
                  William 
                  Jones 
               



             ) where it was pawn'd, and that it was pawn'd for 22 s. 6 d. I heard her say, she took it from under the Bolster.
Q. Are you sure she said so?
Emmet. I verily think she said so, I will not swear it.


                  William 
                  Jones 
               



            . May it please you, my Lord, I will tell you the Story as well as I can. This young Man is my Kinsman: He said to me one Day, as I was going Home from the India House, that he had something to tell me. Says he, I have lost my Watch. I hope not, said I: Where did you lose it? Said he, I met a Woman in Bishopsgate-street, and went through Devonshire-Square, and went into a House with her, where there was another Woman; we all three lay down upon the Bed together, and I lay between the two Women when I was robb'd. We went into several Houses in order to find them, but could not: We happened to meet with the Husband that it was pretended she was married to with the Money she made of the Watch, and he went with us for the Sake of a Crown to betray her: We found her, and promis'd her, if she would tell us where the Watch was, we would show her Mercy, as far as it was in our Power.
Q. Who was it that promis'd her Mercy?
Jones. Both my Kinsman and I did: We went with her to the Three Kings in the Minories: She denied it for a long Time, but at last own'd that she took it from under the Bolster, and had sold or pawn'd it for 22 s. 6 d. I took two Men and a Constable, and went to the House where she said it was sold, and staid till ten o'Clock at Night, and could not find the People. We carried her before Alderman Bernard, and she confessed before him, that she sold it for 22 s. 6 d. and he committed her to Newgate. We went to a House where there sat an old Woman, which by the Description we had of her, was the Person she had sold it to. Do you sell a Dram? said I. She said, Yes. So we had a Quartern of Gin. Said I, I come to enquire after a Watch that is pawn'd here, and I am credibly informed, by one that is in Prison, that you have it; and if you do not return it, there is a Constable just by, and you shall go too. Said my Cousin, before I was aware, if you will let me have the Watch, I will give you the 22 s. 6 d. that you gave for it. Said she, I believe I can help you to it, but I have it not in the House. I went to an Alehouse at next Door, to enquire after this Woman's Character, and told the Woman the Story. Said she, if she promis'd to get it for you again, you will be sure of having it; and the Woman of the Alehouse lent me 22 s. 6 d. to pay for the Watch; there was a little Girl came to me, and gave me a Tap on the Back, and bid me come along with her. She led me into a narrow Passage in Rag-Fair, and bid me a good Night, and in that narrow Passage, I had the Watch put into my Hand; but who gave it me, I cannot tell, whether it was a Man or a Woman; the Person put a 
               
                  Brown 
                  Paper 
               



             into my Hand, and in that Paper was the Watch.
Prisoner. This 
               
                  Sarah 
                  Phillips 
               



             called me up Stairs, to bring a Quartern of Brandy; and I went down directly; she called me up Stairs again, and said, Take this and pawn it for me, and gave me Six-pence for my Trouble. The young Man was asleep then; I did not hear him speak: I was not within the Room; I was no farther than the Door. 


               Guilty of the Felony: Acquitted of taking it out of a Dwelling-House

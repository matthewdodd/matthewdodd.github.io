CHARLES TOON
. I live with my mother in Hare-court, Aldersgate-street. On the 20th of December, at one o'clock in the morning, I was

returning home and met the prisoner in King-street, Snow-hill, she wanted me to treat her to drink, which I refused—she followed me about thirty yards, and then left me suddenly, opposite Hosier-lane—when I got a little further I missed my watch—I went back a little way, and saw her—I met a watchman and gate her into custody—I had won the watch at rafle only that night.

Prisoner. He wanted me to go home with him, and I told him I would have nothing to say to him. Witness. It is not true—I am quite sure I had my watch while she was talking to me—I missed it not a minute after she left—it was in my breeches pocket—she was dose on my right hand side, and followed me asking me for drink.





MICHAEL DOWNEY
. I am a watchman of St. Sepulchre. I took the prisoner in John-street, West-street, about a hundred yards from Hosier lane—I saw a watch picked up in John's-court, by the Inspector, on a dust heap—the prisoner was between ten and fifteen yards from there, coming from the heap when I took her—I met her in Fox and Knot-court about a quarter-past one o'clock, and the prosecutor charged her with stealing his watch.





THOMAS BOUCHER
. I was constable of the night. The watch was brought to me by one of the Inspectors.





CHARLES TOON

re-examined. This is my watch; nobody was near me but the prisoner—we were not arm in arm—I did not feel her touch more all—it was in my right-hand pocket—I was sober.

Prisoner. Q. Was I ever near enough to take the watch? A. Yes.

Prisoner's Defence. He must have done it on purpose to give me is charge—I never knew he had a watch.




GUILTY
.* Aged 24.—


Transported for seven Years.

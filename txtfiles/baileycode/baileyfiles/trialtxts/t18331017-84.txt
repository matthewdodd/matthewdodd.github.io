: the prisoner lived with me as servant
 - on Sunday, the 15th of September, I left home in the morning - I left her at home, and gave her permission to go to church, as the lodgers were at home she was to stop at home afterwards; I was sent for in the evening, and came home, between seven and eight o'clock, and when I got home I saw part of my property had been taken away, and part of it laid in the passage - there was a milk-pot and four table-spoons - the prisoner was not present - I had left the milk-pot and table-spoons in my cupboard some days before - I had locked the cupboard that morning, but had not seen them then. I went up stairs, and perceived a small mahogany box had been taken out of the cupboard. I immediately went in search of the prisoner; my brother-in-law went with me to the station-house, and there I found her - the box contained a pearl brooch, a pearl ring, a smelling-bottle, a silver thimble, and a few other trifling things - I value the milk-pot at 50s.; the four table-spoons at 3l.; the pearl brooch about 50s.; the pearl ring at 35s.; the smelling-bottle at 3s.; the silver-thimble at 1s. 6d. - they were altogether worth much more than 5l. - they are all my property, all that I have named - (looking at the property) - this is my milkpot and spoons - this box is mine; the lock is broken open - the lock of the cupboard was not broken open - this pearl brooch and ring and smelling-bottle are mine - I had not seen the contents of the box that morning; I had seen them on Friday night.

            , (police-constable G 224). On Sunday, the 15th of September, I was at Bunhill-row station-house on duty, I received information, and went with Mr. Murch, the prosecutrix's brother-in-law, into Playhouse-yard, Whitecross-street, and saw the prisoner going along the street - I knew her from a description I had of her, and secured her - I took this box from under her right arm; there was nothing in it then. On searching her, I found these articles in her bosom - she was better than a mile from Percival-street - I thought she might be there, having been told her friends were Irish people - it was about eight o'clock in the evening.

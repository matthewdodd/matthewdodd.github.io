 were indicted for

 stealing, on the 
22nd of Dec., 1 tobacco-box, value 12d.; 1 sovereign, 1 half-sovereign, 1 crown, and 1 shilling, the goods of 



Thomas Haynes, from his person.






THOMAS HAYNES
. I am a labourer. I was at the Plough, at Ealing, on the 22nd of Dec.—I had a tobacco-box, containing a sovereign, and the other money stated, in my pocket—the prisoners sat close to me, Carter on my right hand, and Deane on my left—there were other persons on the other side of the tap-room, but only the prisoners sat by me—I missed my box, and a sovereign and a half, a crown, and 2s.—the prisoners went out—I went after them and overtook them going towards Brentford as hard as they could go—they went to the Magpie and Stump—I went for a policeman, and had them taken.

Cross-examined by
MR. DOANE. Q. You had a sovereign, a half-sovereign, a five-shilling piece, and two shillings? A. Yes, in a steel tobacco-box—I had not been drinking long—I was quite sober—I had nothing to drink at the Magpie and Stump—I walked with the prisoners part of the way to the Magpie and Stump—I did not tell them what I had lost.





JAMES CUSHIEN
 (police-sergeant T 15.) I went to the Magpie and Stump—I told the prisoners the charge against them—Deane said, "All the money I had got when I came to Brentford was one fourpenny-piece," and Carter pulled out his money, and said, "This is all I have," and that was a sixpence in silver, and 2d. in coppers—I then heard something fall from Deane—I said, "That is a crown-piece, I know by the report"—Deane said, "That is my money"—I searched Deane, and found a sovereign, and a half-sovereign, in his trowsers' pocket, and a bad shilling, and a knife.

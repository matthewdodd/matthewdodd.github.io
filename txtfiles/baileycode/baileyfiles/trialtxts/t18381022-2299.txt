DAVID LERIGO
. I live in Old Compton-street, and am a green-grocer. About nine o'clock, on the 29th of September, I was in Covent-garden—I had been purchasing some vegetables, and was paying for them—a young man told me I had lost my handkerchief—I put my hand into my pocket, and missed it—he said the man in the Petersham coat had robbed me—I went to the prisoner, and said he had got it—he said he had not, but that man had got it, who was going up James-street—I said, "Come with me"—he still kept saying, "There he goes"—I thought it suspicious—I said, "I think you have got it"—I opened his coat, and did not see it—I then felt in his trowsers pocket, and found it—this is it—(looking at it)—it was not more than two minutes after I missed it.




GUILTY

Transported for Ten Years.

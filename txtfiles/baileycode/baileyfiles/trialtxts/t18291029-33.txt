            . I am a boot-maker
, and live in Sherrard-street, Golden-square


. On the 24th of October I went into the parlour to take my meal, and placed my chair so as to see into the shop; I saw three persons at my window - one of them came into the shop, took the boots, and gave them to the prisoner; I went out, and took the prisoner, who was walking along with them - the other two were walking behind him, so as to cover him; I gave the prisoner to the officer - these are the boots.

            . I am a Police constable. I came up, and took the prisoner.
Prisoner's Defence. I was going along, and saw two men standing against the window - one of them accosted me in rather an abrupt manner; I went along the street, and heard a man running after me - I turned round; he dropped the boots, and ran off; the prosecutor then came up, and said they were his boots - I gave them to him: I had been drinking at the Queen's Head, and had had enough.

            . They had never been on the ground; I took them as soon as the other gave them into his hands - he shammed drunkenness, but he was no more so than I am.

JOHN TIGHE
. I am a work-box manufacturer, and live in Golden-lane. On the 13th of January, I had been out, and got rather drunk—I was returning home at half-past eleven o'clock, and met the prisoner fronting a public-house in Golden-lane—he asked how I was—I said very well—he asked me to give him something to drink—I had seen him before, and spoken to him—I gave him something, which, I believe, was some ale—we came out, and he said he was very hungry, would I give him something to eat—I said it was too late—he said he would show me a shop in Farringdon-street, where we could get some coffee and toast—we went there, and stopped two hours—it was then too late to get in at home, and I stopped there till daylight—about half-past four o'clock, he said would I give him something to drink—I said yes—I took him to a house across the way, and gave him some gin—I then went back to the coffee-shop with him, and stopped till it got quite clear daylight—I then gave him some more toast and coffee, and went with him to another public-house, and gave him some more gin—I went back with him to the White Hart—he then wanted some more to drink, and I gave him some ale—he asked me the time—I told him—I then put my watch into my pocket—I did not see it again—I went to a beer-shop, where I was well known, to wait till I recovered, as I did not like to go home in that stupid state—I laid down, and went to sleep—I did not see the prisoner again till he was taken—my watch was gone—I have not seen it since—the ribbon was a faded grey, with a dark stripe down the middle.





WILLIAM HANNAGAN
. The prosecutor is an acquaintance of mine—on

the evening of the 13th of January, I was passing through Cloth Fair—I looked through the window of the Pilot public-house, and saw Tighe there, with his head on the table—I went in, and saw the prisoner on the other side of the table—I tried to awaken Tighe, but I could not, he was so drunk—the prisoner said, "What business have you to awake him; what do you know about him?"—I asked what he knew about him—he said he lodged with him, and slept with him—I asked him when—he said, "The night before last"—I said, "No, you did not, for I slept with him that night myself"—"Yes, I did," said he, "and I will get a cab, and take him home"—I said, "Where does he live"—he said, "In Golden-lane"—I said, "No, he lives in a court in Golden-lane"—I saw a watch-ribbon hanging from the prisoner's fob—I said, "Where did you get that watch?"—he pulled it out, and said he bought it for 11s.—I said, "That is Tighe's watch"—he said, "No, my name is in it"—I said, "Your name is not in it, for it is Tighe's watch, and I saw him try to pawn it last night"—I said, "Show me the watch till I see your name in it"—he said, "Yes it is," and he put it in his pocket—it had a greyish ribbon to it—I had known the watch for two years—I went out, as he would not give me the watch, to get a policeman; and before I got back, he was gone—he was taken, I think, on the 24th.

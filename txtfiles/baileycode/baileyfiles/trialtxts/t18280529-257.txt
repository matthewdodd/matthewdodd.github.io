CHARLES HARRINGTON TWIGHT. On the 16th of April, between seven and eight in the evening, I was in Smithfield


 inquiring my way and felt my handkerchief drawn from my pocket; I turned round, and a woman said"A man has drawn your handkerchief from your pocket;" I saw the prisoner running; I pursued and cried Stop thief! the patrol stopped him - I had not lost sight of him; he was about five or six yards from me when I first saw him; there were some persons by his side, but none between us - he ran straight forward; a little boy picked up the handkerchief - it is the one I lost.
Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Were you able to describe the handkerchief at the watch-house? A. Yes; I was not positive whether there were any initials on it - I said it was like one I had at home.

            . I am a patrol. I saw the prisoner stopped - the prosecutor was running after him; a lad gave me the handkerchief.

            . I saw the prisoner running and saw him drop the handkerchief; I took it up and gave it to the officer.

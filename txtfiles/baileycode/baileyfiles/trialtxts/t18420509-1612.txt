JEMIMA CLEMENTS
 was again indicted

for stealing, on the 
9th of May, 3lbs. weight of veal, value 1s., the goods of 



George Sutton.






ANN HOMAN
. I am single, and live in Goldsmith-row, Hackney-road, nearly opposite Mr. Sutton's. I was standing at my window on the 9th of May, between eight and nine o'clock in the morning—I saw the prisoner and Edwards come out of Mr. Sutton's shop—the prisoner had a plate of steak in her hand—she said to Edwards, "What a fool you was you did not take it, you had a good opportunity"—it appeared to me that the prisoner had something under her shawl.





SAMUEL MILLS
. I am in the employ of Mr. George Sutton. The two young women came in for a pound of steak—I served them, and they went out—they came in in a minute or two and said they must have another half a pound, which they had—the prisoner stood near the window where the veal was, and Edwards stood where I was cutting the steak—the prisoner said, "I shall go and get some tea, and make Jack's breakfast"—I served Edwards with half a pound of steak, and she went out—in about half an hour my master came down—a person over the way called my master, and gave him information, and he missed the piece of veal—nobody but the two girls had come in that morning, except a little boy.






SARAH EDWARDS
. On Monday morning she asked me if I would go with her to buy a pound of steak for breakfast—I said I would—she went home with the steak and I with her—I went back with her for another halfpound—while the little boy was serving her she put the veal under her arm, went away with it, and left me waiting for the steak—I saw her take it—she said, "I shall go home and get Jack's breakfast"—that is a man she lives with.

Prisoner. She had as much to do with it as I had.

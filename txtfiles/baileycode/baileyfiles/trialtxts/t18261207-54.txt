            .
THOMAS STANDAGE. I am a furniture-broker
, and live at No. 114, Chancery-lane


, which is in the City. On the 22d of November, about six o'clock in the evening, I saw a young man take this looking-glass off a table in my shop - he took it about ten yards and gave it to the prisoner - my man collared him, and he dropped it in my presence - it was only chipped - I should know his companion again; he is well known in our lane.

            . I am in Mr. Standage's employ. I was coming along on the other side of the way, and saw a tall man take the glass from a table, which was half a yard within the door; I had seen the prisoner pass the door twice before it was taken - the tall man took it about ten yards, and then gave it into the prisoner's hands - I ran across the road - my foot slipped, or I should have caught him; he was secured before I lost sight of him; I kept close to his heels, and saw him drop it.

            . The prisoner was brought to the watch-house with the glass, which I have had ever since.

THOMAS TURRELL
. I am a licensed victualler. I was at the end of Holborn, close to Field-lane, on the 14th of July, about eleven o'clock at night—I felt some one at my pocket—I turned round, and caught the prisoner with my handkerchief in his hand—I gave him in charge—this is my handkerchief—it had been in my coat pocket.

Cross-examined by
MR. PAYNE. Q. Had you used it before? A. Yes, a very short time—it was not dropped.

Transported for Ten Years.

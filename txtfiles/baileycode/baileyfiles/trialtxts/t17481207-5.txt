, the prisoner at the bar came into my house the 19th of Oct. last and stole a china punch bowl and two glass tumblers, he was apprehended in the house with them in his hand. I heard the cry of stop thief, and the man said, if you call me thief, I will knock your brains out.
Q. What man?
Hinkley. The Prisoner at the bar. I pursued him, he was never out of my sight, he turned up a turning about six doors from my house, where was no thorough fare, and the neighbours came to our assistance and took him.
Hannah Hill. I caught him in the entry with the things in his hand as he was coming out of the parlour.
Q. Where did he take them from?
Hill. From the buset in the fore parlour; I took hold of the skirt of his coat, and he threw me down. I recovered myself, and run after him and kept hold of his coat till others came and took hold of him.
Q. Was any of these things found upon him?
Hill. No, my Lord, he threw them down on the floor, and they broke into pieces.

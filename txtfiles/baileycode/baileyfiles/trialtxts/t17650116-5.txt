            . I am a carpenter
, and live in Shadwell


; my wife keeps a shop: coming home the 11th of this instant, I observed a man looking in at my window; we had before lost some handkerchiefs: I passed by the door, and stood in a convenient place, to observe him; there came another fellow to him; they both stood looking in at the door: as soon as I saw the prisoner take the things, mentioned in the indictment, I ran over and seized him; the stockings he had in his hand; he dropt the two pieces of gartering: I got assistance, and secured him; the other man ran away.

Prisoner's Defence.
I was going to Blackwall, to see if I could get on board an East-Indiaman; I was but just come home; there was a man there that ran away; I never meddled with any thing.

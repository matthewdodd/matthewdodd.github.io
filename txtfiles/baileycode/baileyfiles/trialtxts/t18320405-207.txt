            . I am a Police-constable. On the 18th of February I saw the prisoner at the corner of Orange-street, Red Lion-square


, between eight and nine o'clock; there were two others with him - he went into Mr. Draper's shop; he came out in about a minute, andran - I pursued and took him; he dropped this coat about twenty yards from the prosecutor's.
Prisoner. He has been a reputed thief himself, and has been along with me and others, who are as had as himself; when he had hold of me, he said he did not know it was me. Witness. I believe he was a school-fellow of my brother's; I have never been with him - I have been in the Police two years and a coat.
SAMUEL DRAPER. This is my coat.

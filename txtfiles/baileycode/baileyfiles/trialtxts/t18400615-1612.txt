CHARLES YATES.
I am a plasterer. I left my coat in a building at Paddington, where I was at work on the 21st of May, at half-past one o'clock, I missed it about two o'clock—a boy told me something, and I went out, found the prisoner, who is a stranger, with my coat under his arm, and took him—this is my coat—(looking at it.)






DANIEL MULLCHEY.
I was at work there and saw the prisoner take the coat—he walked away with it, and I told the witness.

Prisoner. Q. Did you see me take it out of the building? A. Yes.

Prisoner's Defence. I found it outside the building—I was not inside at all.

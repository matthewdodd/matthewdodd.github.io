On the 30th of May, a couple of farmers came out of the country, and sent to me to find this cart, I am a constable, and a person having given me an item when I was out on Saturday, on Sunday I found the cart, I know nothing of Summers.
Was it altered? - No.
Did not you see him bring it in? - No.
PRISONER's DEFENCE.
When I got up in the morning, a man asked me whose ground that was, I told him, it belonged to Mr. Summers; and he said, do you think he will let this cart stand here, then out came Mr. Summers and said, it must not stand there, I knew nothing of the cart from that time to this, nor never saw it before in my life.
Court to Summers. Was there any other person standing by? - There was.
Are you sure that the prisoner did not refer you to the other person? - I am sure he said, it was his cart, I never saw the other person since, I knew Mr. Higby, he keeps an old iron shop.
What is his character? - I do not know.
The prisoner called three witnesses who gave him a good character.

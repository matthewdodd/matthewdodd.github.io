            , Gent.
 The Evidence for the King was Mr. Ashborn, who declared that the Prisoner was some little time a Servant
 to him before the Robbery was Committed, and when he miss'd his Goods, the Prisoner absented himself, and being Apprehended he Confess'd it. The Prisoner did not much deny it upon his Tryal, but said he did it because there was an Execution coming out against him, with some other frivolous Excuses, so he was found 

               Guilty
             of the Felony.

1498. 




HENRY CHURCH EMERY
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
29th of February, 1 pair of boots, value 5s. 6d. the goods of 



Patrick Grady; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






MART GRADY
. I am the wife of Patrick Grady, a tailor, in Blue-gate-fields—the prisoner lodged with us about two months. On the 29th of February I went up to his room to call my little boy—my husband's boots were there then, and the prisoner also—I went out for about three quarters of an hour, and when I returned the prisoner and the boots were gone—these are them.





JOHN BLABY
. I am a pawnbroker. These boots were pawned on the 29th of February—I cannot say by whom.





HENRY ELLIS
 (police-constable K 30.) I took the prisoner, and he put the duplicate of the boots into Mrs. Grady's hand.

Prisoner's Defence. I met the woman, she said her husband was in distress for his boots; I said I would give her the money and the duplicate, and I slipped the duplicate into her hand.





MARY GRADY

re-examined. He did not give me the duplicate till the policeman arrived.





THOMAS SQUIRE
 (police-constable K 316.) I produce a certificate of

the prisoner's former conviction, which I got at Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
.* Aged 34.—


Transported for Seven Years.
(There was another indictment against the prisoner.)

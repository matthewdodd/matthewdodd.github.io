MARY CARR
. I live at No. 1, White Horse-court, White-cross-street, St. Luke's, and am a widow. The prisoner lodged in my house not quite three weeks—she occupied one room—on the 25th of July I missed a bundle, containing the property stated in the indictment—I had been robbed before, and I had only fetched them home, and not locked them up I suspected the prisoner—she was at home—soon after she went out, I missed them—she returned about eight o'clock in the evening—I taxed her with taking them—she said she knew nothing about them—I laid I should send for the policeman—then she said she had pawned them, and torn the duplicates to pieces—two or three little articles she brought, and dropped in the room; the rest I lost entirely—I never knew her do any work, but her husband allowed her 2s., a week, and she used to go to her daughter's—this cloak and two little things are what she bought, and that is all.





ANN COLLINGHAM
. I am a searcher at the station house—I searched the prisoner—she said she had pledged a pair of boots and a shawl belonging to the prosecutrix in Red cross-street—I found nothing on her.





GBORGE BAKER
 (police-constable G 186.) I took the prisoner—nothing more has been found—she said, in going to the station-house, that she had pawned the articles.

Prisoner's Defence. I lodged in the same room, but did not pawn the articles—I was in liquor at the time—I had been to my daughter's, and had a drop of gin.

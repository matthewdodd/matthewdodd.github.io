. On the 2nd of February, about four o'clock in theafternoon, the prisoner came, and asked to see some black silk handkerchiefs, which I showed him, and immediately suspected him; I watched, and saw him secreting these handkerchiefs under his coat; I caught hold of his coat, but he broke from me, and got out of the shop while I went round the corner - I secured him about two hundred yards off - the moment I got up to him he unbuttoned his coat, and let the handkerchiefs fall - they are two pieces of black silk handkerchiefs, containing seven.

            . On the 25th of December, about ten o'clock in the morning, I was in Old Montague-street


, at Mr. Crowther's. I live at Romford. I left my coat, laying over my horse and cart, in his care. When I returned I found the prisoner in custody.

            . I saw the prisoner and another man come out of a house - the other spoke to the prisoner, then went and took the coat - they were both together, I saw them in conversation before he took it.

            . The prosecutor's cart was at my door; the coat was covered over or the horse - there was a cry of Stop thief! I saw the prisoner and another running. I stopped him, but the other got away. They threw the coat down.

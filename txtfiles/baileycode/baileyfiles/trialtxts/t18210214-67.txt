            , who is a dyer
, and lives in Long-alley


. On the 3d of February, about half-past ten o'clock, the table stood outside the door for sale; it was fastened - the prisoner asked the price of it: I said 18 s.; he said, he could get three such for that. About half-past ten o'clock, I saw him and another coming up Long-alley; the other came in for a half-quartern loaf, which I gave him, but did not stop to take the money. I saw Jones take the table, and put it on his head - I ran after him - the other said,
"Drop it, Jones." The watchman came up and took him. I am sure he is the man.

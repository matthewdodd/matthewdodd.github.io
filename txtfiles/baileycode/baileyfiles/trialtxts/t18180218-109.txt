On the 14th of January, about eight o'clock in the morning, I stopped the prisoner, and another person, with the paper, in Hemming's-row - He resisted very much; his companion ran away. He said he bought it at Charing-cross. As I was taking him to the Office he said a man gave him a shilling to take it to Tottenham-court-road.

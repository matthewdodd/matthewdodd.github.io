             sworn.
I am a smith
; on Friday the 27th day of April, I lost the things mentioned in the indictment, value about 38 s.; when I came to work in the morning, I found that black man, Johnson, in the shop; I went backwards and forwards out of the shop two or three times, I found him there still; in the afternoon he was gone, and some of the men had lost their tools; I saw the black there at nine in the evening, the next morning the shop was broke open; I found the black at Salt-petre-bank, up a pair of stairs, opposite the Black Lyon; we took him into custody, and went to Cozier's shop, and there I found my things; I did not see Eaton then.

             sworn.
Confirmed the other evidence as to the shop being broke open, and the things gone; he went with the prosecutor to Cozier's shop, and saw the things found there; the prosecutor took up an axe, and said, he would forgive him if he would produce the glass-cutter's tool; and Cozier pointed to the place where it was; and when he had got it, he said, I will give you the severity of the law; he was taken into custody; before the justice, he said, he bought it at five in the morning for eight shillings; the black man said he did not break in.
(The things produced and deposed to.)

             sworn.
I apprehended Cozier; he said, he bought the things of the black man, I had told him the black man was in custody; and when he saw the black man, he knew him again; Eaton came voluntarily to the office, the magistrates would not detain him; I was surprised to read this morning he was indicted, he has lived there three or four months.
Prisoner Johnson. I know nothing of it.

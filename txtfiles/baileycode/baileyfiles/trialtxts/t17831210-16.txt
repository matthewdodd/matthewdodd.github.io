How came the prisoner in the house? - Some part of the area was broke down and he went in that way, I suppose or else at the door way; it was about six o'clock in the evening, it was quite dark, nobody was with the prisoner, he had the lead on his shoulder.
(The lead produced)
Court. What may the value of it be? - It cost when it was laid on twenty-two shillings a hundred, here is about twenty-eight pounds.
That is about two or three shillings for these pieces? - Thereabouts.
How was it separated from the gutter? - It seems to be cut by a knife, I found a part of a knife in the gutter.
What did he say for himself? - He owned himself guilty; he said, he was going to take it to a public house, to the prisoner Oldfield, who was to sell it for him. I saw the lead there before.

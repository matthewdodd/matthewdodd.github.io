            . I am a surgeon, and a friend of 
               
                  John 
                  Gootch
               



            . On the 27th of July, at half past nine o'clock in the morning, he and I were walking arm-in-arm in Red Lion-square


, and as we crossed near Leigh-street, I felt a jerk, and on turning round I perceived the prisoner in the act of taking a silk handkerchief out of Mr. Gootch's pocket; he had got it quite out, and was in the act of giving it to a companion who was with him; he let it fall - I called Stop thief. His companion ran through the square, and he down Leigh-street; I secured him without losing sight of him, and am confident he is the man. I have had the handkerchief ever since, and produce it.

Prisoner's Defence. I heard the cry, turned round, and the gentleman took me and said, "I think you are the man who picked my friend's pocket." I said, "I am not."

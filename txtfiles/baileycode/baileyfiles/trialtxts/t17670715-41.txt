            . I live in St. Anne's-lane, Westminster; on the 10th of June, my coat and hat were taken out of the timber-yard where I work on Mill-bank


; I had been treating the prisoner with a pot of beer, and he left me there, and when I came to look for my hat and coat, they were gone; I suspected him.

            . The prisoner came into the timber-yard, and went with a pretence to go to work; he worked about ten minutes, then he put on his coat, and took Bligh's coat and hat, and went out at the gate with it; I thought he was going to carry them to him to the alehouse; after that Bligh came into the yard and missed them.
Prisoner's defence.
If he saw me with it, why did he not stop me?




               Guilty 10 d.

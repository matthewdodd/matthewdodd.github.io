            . I know the prisoner; on the 21st of August


, he was brought to my house in Leadenhall-street


, by my foreman; he said he had had the misfortune to lose his money out of a hole in his pocket, and he wanted to borrow £2 which he had to pay for his father, Mr. Dell, the Witham waggoner, who brings meat for me to sell at Leadenhall market, and that on Saturday, his father would be up, and he would be sure to pay me; the prisoner was dressed in black, and he had a smock frock on - I desired my man to take him over to my counting-house, and give him the money - I didnot go to see it done.
Prisoner. Q. Had you ever seen me before? A. No; I am sure you had a smock frock on; but I could see the lower part of your dress - I could not see your coat.

            . I am foreman to Mr. Lee; the prisoner came to the shop and enquired for Mr. Lee; I took him to the house - my master was at dinner; the prisoner said he had the misfortune to lose two sovereigns, and he wanted to borrow two sovereigns of my master, saying he was the son of Mr. Dell, who had given him the two sovereigns, and if my master would lend it him, his father would pay it on Saturday; my master desired me to take him to the clerk, who gave him £2 in silver.

            . I am clerk to Mr. Lee; I gave the prisoner five half-crowns, thirteen sixpences, and twenty-one shillings; he had a smock frock on - I cannot say whether it was long enough to conceal his trousers, as I was inside the counting-house.


                  JAMES 
                  DELL
               



            . I am the Witham waggoner; my eldest son is between twelve and thirteen years old, but the prisoner is not him - the prisoner is not my son; I have seen him several times - I never gave him any money for me, and never owned him as my son.
Prisoner's Defence. I am innocent of the charge - I never saw Mr. Lee, nor any of his men till I was in custody - I never was in his shop in my life; Mr. Lee accused another man of it as I was told, and stuck hard and fast that it was him, until Mr. Dell said that man was not in town on that day; and then he said it was the other man, and Mr. Dell asked me if I would come up and show myself, and clear myself of the charge, and I did so; and when I came, Mr. Lee said I was not the person, and then he said he thought I was.
HENRY LEE. I said at first that I thought the prisoner was not the man, as he had not his smock frock on - I never accused any one else of it; the other man was shown to me, and I said he was not the man.

                  SMITH
               



            . The prisoner was in my presence about ten minutes - I can positively swear he is theman - I have no doubt whatever; he had a smock frock on, but as soon as I saw him again, I was sure he was the man.


                  FREDERICK 
                  BOLTON
               



            . I am quite certain the prisoner is the man - I have no doubt of him whatever.

                  DELL
               



            . I have seen the prisoner in London, and on the road; he has come to town by the waggon and paid his fare; he knew the days it came up - I don't know that he knew I came to Mr. Lee; he knew my name very well.

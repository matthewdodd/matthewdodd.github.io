NICHOLAS HAMILTON
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
26th of January, 2 fowls, value 4s., the goods of 



George Winter.






GEORGE WINTER
. I live at No. 5, Minerva-terrace, New-cross. I had some fowls—I saw them safe on the 25th of January, about mid-day, and on the 26th my fowl-house was broken open, and I missed two Poland fowls—these are similar to them.





SAMUEL BARKER
 (police-constable R 203.) I met the prisoner on the road, between four and five o'clock that day—I saw he was rather bulky, and asked what he had under his jacket—he said, "Nothing but another shirt"—I put my hand to his side, and said there was something more than that—he said, "Yes, a fowl—my sister, who lives at Greenwich, gave it me"—I asked where his sister lived—he said he did not know—he then said, "Where the fair is kept, and her name is Anderson"—I said, "Let me look at the fowl"—he did, and then I found the other on him—this was half a mile from the prosecutor's—I took the prisoner to the station-house, and then to the cage—I found the prosecutor, and I went to the prisoner, after he had been remanded—I asked him how he came to find such a curious place as where the fowls were—he then said that Captain Wilson's son told him where they were, and he wished to be lagged for seven years, for he should be better out of the country than in it.




GUILTY
. Aged 21.—


Transported for Seven Years.

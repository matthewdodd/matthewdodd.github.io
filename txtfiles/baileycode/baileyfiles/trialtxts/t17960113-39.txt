I am a publican
: I keep the Three Tuns, at Kingsland


; I have lost a great many pots; the prisoner often frequents my house, and calls for a pennyworth of beer; the beadle, Mr. Griffths, brought this pot to me, with many others.
WILLIAM PURCELL sworn.
I keep the Mermaid, at Hackney; the prisoner came to my house on Wednesday the 8th of January, and had a pint of beer; as she was going out, a Jew man met me in the passage, and said,that woman, I believe, has taken something that she should not, she whip'd something into her basket very quick; I said, I had nothing but pots, and I did not think she would take the pots, I had known her a great while; on Thursday she did not come; on Friday she came again; I stopped her, with several pots in her basket, and some under her arms, and others round her waist.
Q. Did you find any belonging to Mr. Day? - A. Yes; I gave it to Griffiths.
- GRIFFITHS sworn.
I am a constable of Hackney: This is Mr. Day's pot; it was given me in charge, with the prisoner, on the 8th of January.
Mr. Day. This is my pot.
Prisoner's defence. I have not a word to say in my own behalf; I was very much distressed, and am very sorry; I hope your Lordship, and the Jury, will be merciful to me.



               GUILTY
            , (Aged 57.)
Tried by the second Middlesex Jury, before Mr. COMMON SERGEANT.

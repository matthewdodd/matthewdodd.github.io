            . I am a nurseryman, and live at Islington. On the 21st of June, about four o'clock, I received information that a person had got into an empty house; I got up and went to the back part of the premises; I heard some one in the house; I tried the back door - it was fast; I went to the front of the premises, and found the prisoner in the adjoining carcase; he made a little resistance, and then begged for mercy - but finding it was no use, he began to pull these locks from his pocket and his hat; these three locks were on him, and this large lock and the screwdriver were by the area.

            . I locked up the house, about halfpast nine o'clock the night before, and a little after four the next morning, I heard an alarm; I went down and found the prisoner with the witness, and these locks lying about; I believe these were the locks that were on that house, but I cannot swear to them.

            . I am the owner of the house. I believe these locks to have been fastened on the doors of that house.

SARAH SHERRY
. I am in the service of James Willis Brooks. On the 27th of June, about five o'clock in the afternoon, I was in the area—I saw the prisoner at the pantry cupboard with this coffee-pot and three spoons in his hand, which I had seen safe that morning—I asked who he was, and what he was doing there—he said he was doing nothing—I shut the door, and by that means he was kept in—he put the coffee-pot down on the floor, and laid the spoons on the table, and begged of me to let him pan—he tried to get out—he got away from me after a struggle—his coat was torn—I followed, and he was taken—he is the person.

from the house, and a gentleman stopped him—I detained him and took him back to the pantry—he said nothing.

Prisoner's Defence. I had been walking all day—I went down to the kitchen—I asked the servant for a drop of water, and she seized me.

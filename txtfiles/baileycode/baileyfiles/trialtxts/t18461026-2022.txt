JOHN M'GINNISS
 was indicted

 for stealing 1 handkerchief, value 6d. the goods of 



John Ferriday, from his person; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






JOHN FERRIDAY
. I live at H ox ton. At half-past twelve o'clock at night, on the 10th of Oct., I was going through Long-lane, Smithfield—I felt a sort of twitch at the skirts of my coat—I turned, and detected the prisoner just behind me—I put my hand to my coat pocket, and my handkerchief was gone—I said to the prisoner, "You have robbed me"—he said he had not, and slunk back—I was fearful I had lost my account-book, but I felt, and found it safe—during that time he ran away—I ran after him, and called, "Stop thief!"—he was overtaken by the officer in a turning out of Alders-gate-street—my handkerchief was produced afterwards by another person—this is it, and the one I lost.

Prisoner. Q. You did not see it in my hand, nor see me throw it down? A. No.





WILLIAM TOMKINS
. I live in Greenhill's-rents. I was passing down Long-lane—I saw the prisoner and another following the prosecutor—I saw one of them hand something to the other—the prosecutor turned and spoke to one of them—the other dropped the handkerchief—I took it up, and gave it to an officer.

Prisoner. Q. You did not see me throw it away? A. I saw you throw something—I did not know what it was till I took it up.






GEORGE DOUGLASS
 (City police-constable.) I saw the prisoner running as fast as he could—I took him—this handkerchief was brought to the station by another officer.

Prisoner. I was running home; I ran through a, court, and this man stopped me.





SAMUEL SPINK
 (City police-constable, No. 119.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction—(read—Convicted 11th Sept., 1843; confined seven days, and whipped)—the prisoner is the person.

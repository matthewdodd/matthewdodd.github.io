CHARLES ILSLEY.
 I live in Wellington-street, St. Luke's. On 15th April, between one and two o'clock in the morning, I met the two prisoners at the end of Brick-lane, Old-street—they came up and spoke to me—I stopped talking a few minutes, and they began to pull me about—I found Brown's hand in my pocket, and saw her hand pass to Handley, who was close by—I heard three or four sovereigns drop—I stooped to pick them up—I

had previously had some loose silver in my right-hand trowser's pocket, gold ring, and twelve sovereigns, and one half-sovereign, in a purse—I know that I had the money in my pocket at the time I saw them—I put my band into my pocket after I saw Brown take her hand out, and I found nothing but the loose silver—the purse had been put back into my pocket, but it had nothing in it; the twelve sovereigns and a half, and the ring, were gone—I never saw the purse out of my pocket—I accused the prisoners of robbing me—they said the money they dropped was money they had taken over night—I called two policeman to my asistance—some money was heard in Brown's mouth—it was not found; she swallowed it—I saw them stoop and pick up the remainder of the money, except one sovereign, which I picked up—Brown told Handley to pick up some money, and Handley picked up some; I cannot say much—when the officers came up, I said that Brown had some money in her mouth—I saw her pass something to her mouth, and heard it rattle against her teeth—I had hold of her hand at that time—the officers took charge of both the prisoners—Handley struggled very much, and when we came back from the station we found the gold ring in the kennel, on the spot—this is it (produced)—I can swear to it by its being scratched round the edge, and bent in two or three places—I have it in my possession since my wife died—it was her wedding-ring.

Cross-examined by
MR. PAYNE.
Q. Where did you happen to be when you found the hand in your pocket? A. just in a a little court in Brick-lane—I was partly obliged to go up the court; they pulled me—I cannot say how long I stood talking with them—I should have gone home, and not spoken to anybody, if they had not come and pulled me about—I am a milkman—Handley might be there or four yards off when Brown's hand was in my pocket, and when Brown passed the money over to her I heard it drop—I was sober—I had had a little business to attend to that night with my brother—I went up the court against my will—I have got one sovereign: I do not know where the rest is—I had been at a gin shop, at the corner of Featherstone-street—I had had some gin and water and some half-and-half, in company with my brother and another gentleman—I believe it was about one o'clock when I left, and it might be twenty minutes or half an hour after that I met the prisoners—I had been walking on the pavement—I cannot say how many other women I saw before I saw the prisoners; I do not belive I saw above one or two—I had not been drinking at public-houses before I went to the gin-shop—I cannot say how much I drank that afternoon—I am not in the habit of getting drunk.





JOB SMITH
 (policeman, G 44.) About half-past one o'clock, in the morning of the 15th April, I heard a scuffle up a court in Brick-lane—I and Reeves went up, and found the prisoners and the prosecutor, who was making a desperate effort to keep them in the curt—he said, "They have robbed me of twelve sovereigns and a half, and a ring"—he said Brown had put, her hand in his right-hand trowser's pocket and took it out from a purse, and she had just put some in her mouth; but previously, in passing some of the money to Handley, it had dropped, and that one said to the other, "Pick it up"—he said, "I have picked up a sovereign myself; they have picked up the rest"—the prisoners said they had not robbed him—I took Handley, and my brother officer took Brown—Handley made great resistance, and I saw her throw her hand on one side, and heard something fall, but I could not say what—I saw Brown with her hand towards her mouth, and I heard something rattle in her mouth; I could not distinctly say what it was, but I

thought it was the money—she appeared to be nearly choked—I told my brother constable to put his hand towards her mouth, and tell her to spit the money out—he did so—she was some minutes before she spoke, and her face was very red—she was then just out of the court, in the lane, near a at light—in a minute or two after, she spoke, and said she had not swallowed the money—I went to the station, and then went back and found this gold ring just on the sopt where Handley was making resistance to get away.

Cross-examined. Q. where were the parties when you first got up A. Just in the mouth of the court—it is not thoroughfare—it might be about twenty minutes before I came back to the place—I did not pick up any money—I belive this is not the first time I have said that Handley moved her hand and threw something away—I will not swear I said it before—I might have made a mistake—the prosecutor was perfectly sober.





JOHN REEVES
 (policeman, G 95.) I was with Smith—I took hold of Brown—I heard something rattle in her mouth—I took hold of her throat, and asked what she had got in her mouth—she said, "Nothing, "but it seemed as if she swallowed something before she spoke—she said had not robbed him, and did not know anything about the money—I took her to the station—I did not go back.





CHARLESS ILSLEY

re-examined. I did not stop and talk to any other woman before I saw the prisoners—I was walking along from Featherstone-street to Brick-lane; that might not take me twenty minutes—I had my brother with me, and Mr. Pardy—I stopped talking with them a few minutes—I had left my brother about two minutes when this happened—he keeps a public-house in Drury-lane.





WILLIAM CONSTABLE
 (policeman, G 81.) I produce a certificate of Brown's former conviction, at Clerkenwell—(read—Convicted 28th Oct., 1846, and confined six months)—she is the person.

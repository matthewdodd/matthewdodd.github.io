I was opening the warehouse, and a man saw a person go into the warehouse, and bring this parcel under his arm; it was the 20th of May; he shewed me the person, and I run after him, I pursued him down Aldermanbury, and called to some people to stop him, I just lost sight of him once, turning the corner of a court, I saw him in Lad-lane, he was stopped by the church in Aldermanbury; the parcel was lying on the ground in the court.

I was standing next door to Mr. Livesay's, in Lad-lane, and I saw the prisoner go into the warehouse, and come out with a parcel in about two minutes; he run down the lane towards Aldermanbury; I shewed Cooper.
Can you swear to his person positively? Yes, Sir, I believe it is the man.

I was setting out a waggon in Aldermanbury, I saw the prisoner come with a parcel as fast as he could run, as he was turning into the court, I caught him by the coat but could not hold him; I saw him drop the parcel on the right hand of the court, I saw Mr. Livesay's man pick it up.

JAMES STRUTT
. I am assistant in the shop of John Dennis and another, in Tooley-street. On the 9th of November the prisoner came and asked for something, I could not tell what—I asked heragain—she muttered something, and was going out—I went to her and pulled up her cloak, and saw this piece of print, which she had taken from the counter.





JAMES HIGHWOOD
. I am a policeman. I received the prisoner into custody.

Prisoner's Defence. I was going into the shop for a skein of silk—my foot kicked against this print—I took it up and was going to the light—this gentleman came and said I had taken it off a pile.

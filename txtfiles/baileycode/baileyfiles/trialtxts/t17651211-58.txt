                  Woodward 
               



            . I am servant to 
               
                  Gilbert 
                  Pudner 
               



            , a haberdasher of small wares
 in Fleet-street


, opposite St. Dunstan's church. On a Monday night our shop window was broke open between 6 and 8 o'clock; there were ribbons lying near the place. The evidence Brown was taken up upon the information laid against him before Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            , and brought to our shop between 10 and 11 o'clock the same Monday night, and for fear of being taken to the watch-house, he confessed. I went with him about one o'clock in the night, and took the prisoner, by his direction, in Northumberland-street. He was lying on a wad of hay, in a stable-yard, belonging to the waterworks, with the ribbons upon him (produced in court.) Here is a mark upon one of them of my own making.
Q. How much does that piece contain?
Woodward. There is about five yards and a quarter of it: there was a ribbon rough made for a lady, found also, which he had given to a girl, (that is not in the indictment.) When the prisoner was charged with breaking the prosecutor's shop window, he begg'd forgiveness, and said it was the first time he had done such a thing: he was searched, and in his pocket was found 2 pair of plated buckles; they did not belong to us. We took him to the watch-house.

            .
Q. How old are you?
Brown. I am between 14 and 15 years old.
Q. How long have you been a thief?
Brown. Not long. I never was with the prisoner but this time in my life, to take any thing. He broke the gentleman's window.
Q. How did he break it?
Brown. He pushed the glass in, and I pulled the ribbons near with a wire, and he took them out with his hand: they were of different colours: he gave them to me, and I put them in my pocket. He afterwards took them from me, and kept them in his own pocket: then we came by Temple-bar, and a soldier followed us. The prisoner looked in a hosier's window when we came to St. Clement's church: the soldier said he saw him going to break into that shop; then he said I belonged to him, and he took me up; then he said, if I would tell what I had done at that shop, he would let me go; so I told. The prisoner ran away. The soldier carried me into Drury-lane; there he met one of Justice Fielding's men; he delivered me up to him, and left me. I knew the soldier before; he had a son transported, and I knew he knew us. Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            's man carried me to the prosecutor's house, and I helped them to find the prisoner at the bar.
Q. How did you know where to find him?
Brown. He told me when he ran away, that I might find him there.
Q. Who told Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            's man what house you had broke, the soldier or you?
Brown. I did.
Prisoner's defence.
About 8 at night I met that boy by St. Clement's church: he had some ribbons, and two pair of plated buckles. He said, will you see what I have got; I took them. After this a soldier, whose name is Jones, came across the way. As soon as he saw him, he ran through a court; Jones followed him. After that I went down the Strand, as I did not know what to do with the things. I staid in Covent-garden, thinking I might see him, and give him his things again. I had no money, I went to this place, and fell asleep. Between 12 and 1 o'clock, one Wilkins came with another man and this boy, and took me. He found the things about me; they carried me before Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            : this lad was here last sessions, and was cleared. I have seen this boy at the end of Eagle-court three or four months ago with this Wilkins that is now cast.

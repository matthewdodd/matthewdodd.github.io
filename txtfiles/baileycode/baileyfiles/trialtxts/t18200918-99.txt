            . I live in Hoxton-fields


. On the 11th of August I went out about eleven o'clock in the morning. I saw the prisoner and another laying in a field in which my house stands, as I thought, asleep. I went up Ask-terrace, met a friend, turned round, and saw them both go towards my house; I saw the prisoner lift the other in at the window, which was shut before I came out, he gave the prisoner a pair of breeches. I ran and saw him stopped with the breeches under his arm. He was never out of my sight. They were not worth 5 s.

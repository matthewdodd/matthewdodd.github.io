            . I am servant to Mr. Charles Roberts, tallow-chandler
, of Chandos-street. I was taking a box of candles in the cart to the Saraeen's Head, Aldgate, between six and seven o'clock - it was safe when I was at the top of Houndsditch


, and near Cutler-street; I missed it when I got to Aldgate-church


; I saw a man with it, whom the officer had given it to.

            . I was on duty in Cutler-street, and saw the prisoner running towards Petticoat-lane, with a box. I asked what he had there - he threw it down and ran off; I took him twelve yards off, without loosing sight of him; three or four others were with him; he had a cord tied round it.

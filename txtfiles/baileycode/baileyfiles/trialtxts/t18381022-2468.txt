ELIZABETH STEVENSON
. I am the wife of Philip Stevenson; he is an officer in the navy. On the 19th of October I was taking a walk down to Charlton Fair—I stood looking at a little child dancing on a stage, and felt something at my pocket—I turned, and caught the prisoner's hand in my pocket—the policeman came up, and took him to a person's house, and marched him, but did not find my purse—as I came out of the press I saw something glisten, and it was my purse—I have not the least doubt that he dropped it—there was no other person near me—it was in my pocket—it contained two shillings—the prisoner begged I would forgive him—he said he never had it till he was going to be searched—this is my purse, (looking at it) and the two shillings in it—it is just as he took it.

Prisoner. You said if I gave it you I should go. Witness. Yes, and then the officer came and took you.





JOHN SIZER
. I am a policeman. I took the prisoner in Charltoa Fair he was accused of robbing this lady of her purse—I took him into a Passage and searched him, but did not find it—the lady found the purse—I did not see it.

Prisoner. It is all false—I never was guilty of such a thing.




GUILTY

Transported for Ten Years.

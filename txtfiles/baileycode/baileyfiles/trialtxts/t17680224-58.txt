            . I was coming towards Hackney, and when I was betwixt Lea-bridge turnpike


 and Clapton turnpike


, the prisoner met me; he demanded my money, saying I was a dead man if I did not deliver, and produced a pistol tinder-box, and held it to me as if it had been a pistol; I told him I was a poor man and had nothing for him, and away I ran from him, and he after me; I got the heels of him; I met with the watchman, and described the prisoner's cap he had on, and his person; they took him; he was searched, and the pistol tinder-box found upon him, (produced in court.)

            . I was with the watch when the prisoner was taken, about ten minutes before eleven at night, on the 13th of February; the prosecutor described him about ten minutes before nine; when the watchman met him, he asked him where he came from; he said, no where; he asked him where he was going; he said, no where; we took a great stick from him and secured him; we found this pistol tinder-box upon him; as we were taking him to the cage, he said, they can't hang me, I wish they may transport me.
Prisoner's defence.
I never was within five yards of the man, I did not demand any money.

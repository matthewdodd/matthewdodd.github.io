 for stealing, on the

THOMAS MACAULEY
. I live in Curtain-road. At half-past three o'clock on the 16th of July, I was in my sitting-room, and saw the prisoner at the till in my shop—there wares about eight half-crowns and a shilling or a sixpence in it—I went and asked him what he had been doing, and how he came there, and so on—he cried, and said he had got two half-crowns, which was all he had taken, and them he gave me—I could not swear whether one or two half-crowns were gone, but I am sure one was, and these two were in his hand, and the till was open.

Prisoner. A boy got me to go into the shop, and said he would open the till if I would take the money. Witness. There was another boy with him.




GUILTY
. * Aged 13.—


Transported for Seven Years—Convict Ship.

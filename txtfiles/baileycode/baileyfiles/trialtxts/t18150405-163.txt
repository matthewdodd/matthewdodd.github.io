            . I live at 123, Newgate-street, I am a wholesale glover. The prisoner Cowling came to my house, on the 21st of January, he brought an order, as if coming from a customer of mine; this written order is one of my customer's cards
"two dozen woodstock gloves, one dozen tan ditto, and two dozen coloured kid;" at the bottom it is,
"let the mens be as near the size of the pattern as you can". I executed the order, and gave them to him, five dozen in the whole; this was between twelve and one o'clock. I knew the prisoner, he had lived with a customer of mine, a Mr. Tidcomb, of Knightsbridge; the prisoner delivered me the pattern; I delivered them to the prisoner as the order of Mr. Tidcomb. He came again on Monday, the 23rd, with this written order, as from the same person, for
"three dozen of Norway ditto gloves, of different colours;" that I delivered also. I sent to Mr. Tidcomb; he said, he never received the goods, in consequence of that, I had the prisoner apprehended.
MR. TIDCOMB. I live at Knightsbridge. The prisoner never lived with me as a servant; he has been in the trade. I never gave him any order, or sent him to Mr. Uxley for goods, nor ever did I receive the goods; the order is not my writing.

                     Fuller 
                  



               
            , of St. Martin's in the Fields


, was indicted for 


               privately stealing a Silk Handkerchief, value 12 d. on the 2d of this Instant June
, from the Person of 
                     
                        
                           Edward 
                           Mathews 
                        




. The Prosecutor depos'd, That about 3 or 4 a-Clock in the Afternoon, as he was passing under Ludgate


, he miss'd his Handkerchief, and seeing the Prisoner run hastily cross the Way, he pursu'd him, and chang'd him with taking it; but before he could well lay hold of him, the Prisoner dropp'd it, and this Deponent said immediately before he dropp'd it, he could just discover a Sight of it in his Bosom.
He said in his Defence, That a Coach coming along, he run to avoid Mischief, fearing to be run over, and that he found the Handkerchief crossing the Way; but this frivolous Excuse gaining but little Credit with the Jury, he was found 


               guilty to the Value of 10 d.

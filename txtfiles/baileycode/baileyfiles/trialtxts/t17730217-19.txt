            . I lost a box containing the things mentioned in the indictment, on the 15th of January, at the fire in Whetstone-Park

- Green. I am a watchman: I stopt the prisoner in Tottenham-court-road, on the 15th of January, with a box upon his back; I asked him where he was going with it; he said he did not know. When he found I insisted upon securing him, he proposed that we should snack it.
(The box with its contents produced and deposed to by the prosecutor.)
The prisoner, in his defence, said, a man employed him to carry the box.

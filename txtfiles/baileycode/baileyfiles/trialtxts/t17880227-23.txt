I am coachman
 to Lord Grannard; on the 18th of January as I was in the yard, the prisoner came and asked me how I did; I came out of the stable and pulled the door after me, he followed, and I went about my business; this was a little before five o'clock, I returned about seven, and missed my great coat; about a month after I heard the prisoner was at a public-house, I got a constable and went and took him, I never found my coat again.

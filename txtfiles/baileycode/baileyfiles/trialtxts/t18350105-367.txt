FRANCIS KEYS
. I am an officer of Marylebone. On the 22d of December I met the prisoners together, just by the Duke of Wellington public-house, at the corner of Grosvenor-place—I turned back, and watched them down Grosvenor-place—I saw the man go to the corner of Chapel-street, and wait there—the woman went backwards and forwards four or five minutes, then went up some steps and stopped, then came down the steps to the man—they stood close together—I could not see whether any thing passed, but she came back to the house again, and was going backwards and forwards—I saw her go and stoop down an area, then go over to the man again, and come back—I watched them very closely—I saw her going backwards and forwards to another house for eight or ten minutes; then go up the steps, come down, and go to the man—I then followed, and took them into custody—I found one pot in the man's pocket, another in his hat; and a soldier, whom I had been talking to, found a pot under the woman's arm—she cried out, "Oh! Keys, Keys, do not take him; he knows nothing of it"—I took them both to the station-house.





HUGH LEE
. I keep the Sun, in Chapel-street, Grosvenor-place. This quart pot is mine.





WILLIAM TAYLER
. I keep the Feathers, in Grosvenor-place. This pint pot is mine.





WILLIAM EVERETT
. I keep the Coachmakers' Arms, in Belgrave Mews. This pot is mine—I have lost £30 worth of pots within eight months.

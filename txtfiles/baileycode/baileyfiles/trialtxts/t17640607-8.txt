            . I live in Tyburn-road, and am a wheel-wright
. I left this ax (producing one) on the 7th of May, a little after eight in the evening. I had left work; I can only say it is my property.


                  James 
                  Edwards 
               



            . I saw the prisoner take this ax from about two yards within the gateway; we call it all the shop. I was then in the yard.
Q. Did you know him before?
Edwards. I never saw him before, to my knowledge. I took hold of him, and brought him back with the ax in his hand.
Q. What did he say for himself?
Edwards. He said he had no money, and he wanted something to get some victuals and drink; he said he could not starve.
Prisoner. I had four or five shillings in my pocket: I seeing it lying, took it, and carried it about eight or nine yards; he came and asked me where I was going with it, and I gave it him.

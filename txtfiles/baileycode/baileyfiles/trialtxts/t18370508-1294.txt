CHARLES CLARKE
 (police-constable D 117.) Last Monday night, at half-past ten o'clock, I saw the prisoner carrying something in Lissongrove—I went after him—he took to his heels, and ran—I followed him about 150 yards, and just before I got to him he dropped something—I

pursued and took him—I brought him back, and took up this gown, and asked him where he got it—he said, "You are not going to get any thing out of me; I did not get it at this end of the town"—I took him to the station.





CHARLES KNAPP
. I am a pawnbroker. This is my gown—I saw it safe in my house on Monday morning—it has my private mark on it now—I did not miss it till the officer came—I know the prisoner.




GUILTY
. Aged 17.—


Transported for Seven Years.

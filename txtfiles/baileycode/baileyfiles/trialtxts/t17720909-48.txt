            . I live at the King's Arms, in the liberty of the Rolls


; on the 7th August, about seven at night, the prisoner came into my house, and called for a pint of beer; he sat in the kitchen, in a box where this tea chest was; we had made use of it for tea about four o'clock; when he went out I saw something under his coat; I went to see if my tea chest was within and it was gone. I overtook him, and put my hand under his coat, and there I found the tea chest. (Produced and deposed to by the prosecutor.)

            . I saw Mr. Baylis have the prisoner by the collar. I believe the prisoner was in liquor.
Prisoner's Defence.
I was very much in liquor, and know nothing about the house, nor the man. I had sent my chest down to Portsmouth; I was going out in a ship.
Prosecutor. He seemed very sorry for what he had done afterwards.

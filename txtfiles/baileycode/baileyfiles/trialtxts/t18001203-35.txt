            : I am a servant of all work: My mistress keeps a shop of ready-made linen, and all kinds of linen-drapery
, at No. 55, Shoreditch


; the prisoner at the bar came into the shop, and said he wanted half a dozen shirts; I went out of the shop into a little room that was adjoining, and my mistress put several shirts on the counter, but I cannot tell the number; I could not see any thing pass more than my mistress serving the shirts; my mistress is a Quaker; I saw the prisoner going out of the door, and my mistress called to me; I went into the shop immediately, and as he was getting on the step of the door, my mistress said to him, stop neighbour, let me see what thee has got under thy coat; he turned back, and knocked his hands upon the counter with great violence, and he swore that he would punish her for accusing him with being a thief; he went out of the shop, and when he had got about twenty yards from the door, I followed him, and said to him, be so kind as to step back, for my mistress insists upon knowing what you have got under your coat, and he lifted up his hand to strike me; I stooped, and his hand passed over my head; it was with his clenched hand; I thought I would follow him till I came to No. 38, where my mistress's brother lived, to get assistance; the prisoner ran up Badger-court, and my mistress's brother's journeyman and myself went up the court in search of him, but could not find him; we went to two different houses, and could not find him; and we said we would get a search-warrant; a woman looked out of a window, and said, you are welcome to come in without any search-warrant, and we found the prisoner upon the stair-case up two pair of stairs; he came down stairs, and George Ashington and myself detained him till a headborough came; and as he was standing at the door in the passage, he pulled the cellar-door close to, and slipped the bolt; when the headborough came, he pulled off the prisoner's coat, and felt in his pockets, but there was nothing found upon him; I then told the headborough he must take him back to my mistress; it was supposed that he threw the property down this cellar; the headborough did not go into the cellar.
Q. What did your mistress do? - A. My mistress told the headborough, as there was nothing found upon him, to let him go, and he was let go in the evening there was a report that a man had been taken out of this cellar in Badger-court, and taken to the office in Worship-street; I said, I would go and see if it was the man that had stolen the shirt; when I went in, the officers asked me if I could swear to my mistress's property, if I saw it; I told them, if I saw my mistress's mark upon it, I would swear to it; John Ray said that he had found a shirt on him; it was a new-made shirt, quite new.
Court. Q.Was there any mark upon it? - A. Yes; it was No. 8; the selling price was eight shillings, which was put upon it, that I might know what to sell it for when my mistress was out of the way; I swore to the property, and that was all I did.
SARAH SMITH sworn. - Upon the 21st of November, on a Friday, between eleven and twelve at noon, I heard the alarm of stop thief up the court I lived in, and they said they would search my house; I opened my door to come down stairs to see what was the matter, and the prisoner was upon the stairs; he seemed to be very much frightened, indeed, and he offered me a shilling to let him come into my room; I went out to him, and said, I suppose you are the man that the alarm of stop thief is about, and he said, he was; I went down stairs to tell them where the man was, and the headborough took him down stairs; that is all I have got to say.
Court. Q. Did you see him near a cellar any where? - A. No; there is a cellar-door in the passage.
Q. Were you there in the evening when the shirt was found in the cellar? - A. No; I was not.
GEORGE ASHINGTON sworn. - I work at the Quaker's brother's: I was called out by 
               
                  Maria 
                  Smith
               



            , who gave the alarm; I found the prisoner at No. 3, in Badger-court; I kept him there till the officer came.
Q. Was there a cellar-door in the passage? - A. Yes; I saw the prisoner bolting the cellar-door; the officer took him to the person's house to whom the property belonged; I went with him, and there he was discharged.
JOHN HARROW sworn. - I am a carter; I was the man that took the prisoner out of the cellar at No. 3, Badger-court; I lodge in the cellar; I was just stripping to put some dry things on, when I heard a rumbling on the cellar stairs; I immediately got up, and opened the cellar-door, and saw the prisoner; I said, what business have you here, and he said, d-n your eyes, what is that to you; he stuck me several times; I immediately collared him, but I missed my hold, and let him go; I followed him to Shoreditch, and immediately a person came up, and said, he was the man who had stolen the shirt.
Court. Q. Did you see the shirt at the time? - No; I did not see the shirt till I took him to the office.

             sworn - (Produces the shirt) I belong to Worship-street office; Upon Friday, the 21st of November, about six in the evening, the prisoner was brought to the office, and given into my custody, on suspicion of stealing a new shirt; I asked them if they had searched the prisoner; they said no, they had not; I began to search him in the office, and he seemed to be rather unwilling, and got his back up against the wall; I rubbed him down, and I found something very bulky behind; he said he had got nothing, he was a Dutchman, and wore large breeches; I unbuttoned his breeches, and took this shirt out, (produces it); it has never been washed; there is a figure of eight upon it; on searching him in a different places, I found a watch that had been concealed. (Produces the watch).

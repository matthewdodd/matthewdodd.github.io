            . As I was passing through Newgate


, on Monday morning, between eleven and twelve, just as I got to the begging box I felt something at my pocket; I turned round and saw the prisoner throw my handkerchief up the steps that go into Newgate; I seized him by the collar, and charged him with having picked my pocket; he endeavoured to get from me, but with some trouble I got him back, and he picked up the handkerchief and gave it me. I charged a constable with him; he was taken to Guildhall and committed.
Prisoner's Defence.
I know nothing of the handkerchief; I never had it in my hand.

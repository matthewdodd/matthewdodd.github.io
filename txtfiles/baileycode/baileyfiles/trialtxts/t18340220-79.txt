            . I am in the service of 
               
                  William 
                  Bateman
               



            , of Cumming-street, Pentonville, in the parish of St. James's, Clerkenwell


 - the house was robbed on the 16th of January, in the night - the house was safe when I went to bed - I discovered that it was robbed at half-past six - I found the doors open when I came down in the morning - the thieves had got in through the coal-hole from the coach-house - the coach-house is not kept fastened at the back, it is inclosed in a yard - I missed the articles stated in the indictment, which are worth 60l. all together - the prisoner had been in master's service, and had left about three months at the time of the robbery; he was his groom - the persons had gone out at the doors which I found open; they had come through the garden and gone back the same way - I found footsteps in the garden - next day I saw some shoes compared with the footsteps, and they corresponded with some of them - there were footsteps of more than one person - the shoes of one person which were compared fitted some of them.

            . I am a policeman; I apprehended the prisoner on the 17th of January, at six o'clock in the evening - I told him what I took him for at the station-house - I told him I wanted him for a robbery at Mr. Bateman's, which he denied, and said he knew nothing at all about it - I took him to the office next morning - Mr. Bateman was there; I then heard the prisoner say something - no promise or threat was used to him; he said he would tell the gentleman all about it, if he was allowed to do so - he said he had been in company with two men named Wood and Grey; and Wood, Grey, and himself went to the house of Bateman, that they put the prisoner half-way down the coal-hole; he could get no further, and Grey pulled him back again - he said they then got through the coal-hole, I believe it was one of the others, he said, got through - he said they took the plate, and took it up to Chapel's house, opposite our station-house, that morning, and at ten o'clock they went and sold it, and he received 2l. out of the money - that they got 26l. for it - the other two we have not succeeded in taking - I did not look at his shoes particularly, but his overalls, gaiters, breeches, and coat were all over coal-dirt, such as they would have been if he had gone down a coal-hole - I did not take his shoes off - I found 5s. 10d. on him.

            . I am a policeman - I assisted in apprehending the prisoner; I took off his shoes, which were all over mud and dirt; I took them to the garden and fitted them to the impression of about twenty foot marks, and they fitted - I have not a doubt they were made with those shoes; they are nailed in a very curious manner.
Prisoner's Defence (written). - "I am the victim of others who are at present at large, and who, I am sorry to confess, has brought me to this awful situation - their names are

             and Joseph Wood - Mr. Bateman, my late employer, having no further occasion for my services, discharged me in November last - I then went to a relation of mine, residing at Islington, and remained with them until 31st of December, 1833 - on that day I met Presday, whom I knew as living in the neighbourhood of my master - he introduced me to a young man, named 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Turner
               



            , who said he would board and lodge me, if I would assist him in his work, which was that of a flageolet maker - I had not been with him, long, before he began making inquiries respecting the situation of my master's house, whether he kept much plate, where it was kept - which, after much pressing on his part, I gave him every particular - he proposed for me to show him the house, hinting, that it would be easy to break open - I was unwilling to accede to his wicked suggestions, but he prevailed upon me to have something to drink, which overcame me - at about twelve o'clock at night, two young men came to us; we all had more drink - they then offered me 2l. to show them the house, which I agreed to - we climbed over the garden wall - I remained in the garden while they was in the house - after the robbery, I went part of the way home with them - next morning, I saw them; they told me the plate fetched only 10l. - Grey and Wood I had never seen before - I wish you to take into your wise and serious consideration, my being the dupe of the villains I have named, and who, I trust, will ere long be taken into custody - I have no parents, and being comparatively speaking in a state of destitution, was tempted to join in so disgraceful a transaction against so good a master who, I trust, will, after this statement of real facts are made acquainted to him, recommend to mercy - I feel, mostkeenly, the remorse of conscience, and humbly throw myself upon the mercy and clemency of the judge and jury.

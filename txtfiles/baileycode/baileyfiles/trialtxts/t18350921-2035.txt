JOHN KNIGHT
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
19th of September, at 
St. Marylebone, 1 milk-pot, value 35s.; 1 tea-pot, value 5l.; 1 suger-basin, value 2l. 15s.; 1 coffee-pot, value 10s.; 3 spoons, value 12s.; and 1 pair of sugar-tongs, value 6s.; the goods of 



Charlotte Frances Ackland, in her dwelling-house.






MARY ROE
. I am the wife of John Roe, and live in Upper Harley-street, Cavendish-square, with Mrs. Charlotte Frances Ackland, widow. On the 19th of September, I was going from the kitchen to the servants'-hall, and saw the prisoner come out of the pantry—I asked what business he had there—he made no answer, but turned to run away; and in his hurry dropped the silver milk-pot on the steps—I pursued him up into the street, but saw no more of him, till he was brought back—I am quite sure he is the man—the house is in the parish of St. Marylebone.





JOHN ROE
. I am butler to Mrs. Ackland. I saw the milk-pot picked

up in the area—the prisoner was brought back by Smith the footman—I am sure he is the person I saw in the area—I went into the pantry, and found this tea-pot and sugar-basin in my apron, packed up to be taken away—when the prisoner was brought back, I took hold of him, and three spoons and the sugar-tongs were produced from his pocket—they all belong to Mrs. Ackland, and are worth 10l., and more altogether—they are all silver but the coffee-pot—the prisoner kneeled down, begged for mercy, and said he would never do so again.





PHILIP WEBSTER
. I am an officer. I took the prisoner in charge with the plate.




GUILTY
. Aged 18.—


Transported for Life.

Before Mr. Justice Williams.

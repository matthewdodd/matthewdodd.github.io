WILLIAM SALE



, stealing 1 pair of reins, value 6s. the goods of 



William Minter; 1 whip, 1 pair of shoes, 2 coats, and other articles, 11s.; the goods of 



William Hopkins: having been before convicted.






WILLIAM MINTER
. I live at Broad-wall, Stamford-street, Blackfriars-road, and occupy a stable in Prince's Mews—this pair of reins (produced) are mine—in consequence of information I went to the police-station, and afterwards to my stable, and missed the reins, and another pair that have not been found—they were safe the night before—I found the prisoner and the reins at the station.





WILLIAM HOPKINS
. I occupy a stable next to Minter. On Saturday night, between seven and eight o'clock, I put two coats, a smock frock, a pair of shoes, a whip, and a pair of reins into the stable—I missed them nest morning, and found them at the police-station—these are them (produced)—I found the prisoner in custody with the smock-frock, and jacket on.





JAMES DRAPER
 (policeman, L 70). Between twelve and one o'clock on Sunday morning, 19th Nov., I saw the prisoner in Prince's Mews, about a dozen yards from Hopkins' stable—I asked what he had got—he said a pair of reins, and a whip which were his own—that he had been dismissed from Mr. Pickford's service, and there they found their own reins—he had this coat and smock-frock on—I took him to the station, and found on him a pair of scissors, shoes, and compasses which Hopkins claims.

Prisoner's Defence. I bought them for half-a-crown; I carried them openly. (The prisoner's father gave him a good character).





PATRICK STACK
 (policeman, L 123). I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction—(read—Convicted May 1847, confined three months and whipped)—I was present—he is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 19.—


Transported for Seven Years.

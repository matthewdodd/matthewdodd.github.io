            . My Master lives in White's-alley, Chancery lane


; I missed my things the 10th of May; they were taken out of my chest.
Q. Was your chest lock'd?
Hawkins. It was, my Lord; the prisoner lodged there some time, and he absconded his lodgings that very day; I had him advertis'd, and he was taken on the 10th of May.
Samuel Church. I was at the taking of the prisoner in Holborn; when he saw us he strove to run away, knowing us; we live in the same alley: I followed and took him in Drury lane; he begged of us not to take him before the Justice, but to go first to his sister. We sent for her to an ale house, and then he confest in my hearing that he got a man to sell the coat and waistcoat in Rag-fair for 3 s. 6 d.

            . On the 16th of May, as we were going up Holborn, we saw the prisoner, Samuel Church ran after him and took him.
The rest as the former witness.

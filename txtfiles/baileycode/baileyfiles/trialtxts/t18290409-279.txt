. The prisoner came in on the 30th of March to redeem an apron; she asked the price of another apron, and pulled out some others; Hare watched her -I heard something snatched from the door, and she was brought back with this handkerchief, which is mine.

            . On the 30th of March I saw the prisoner pull the handkerchief from the door; she was then on the threshold - she put it under her shawl and was going off; I took hold of her - she said "Don't, don't;" I brought her back - the handkerchief has my master's mark on it.

- Baily. I am a watchman at the Custom house


. I was ordered to attend this lighter particularly; I saw the prisoner in the lighter. I called to him, and then I saw him taking some coffee out of his pocket and emptying it into a cask. I insisted he should come immediately out of the lighter, which he did; and I took a large quantity of raw coffee out of his pocket.
- Birch, a gangsman, confirmed this evidence.

                  RICHARD
                   LOVETT
               



             sworn.
I went to Lady St. John's house, in consequence of the information of Ingram, the butler was not at home; I returned to the watch-house, and I found the prisoner Brown in a coach, with the blinds up, and a silver spoon was found upon him. At Ingram's lodgings I found some duplicates of Gordon, the pawnbroker's, and some of Mulcaster's. Brown acknowledged some duplicates to be his, which I found in a dirty shirt at Lady St. John's, they belong to this jacket and waistcoat.


                  David
                   Gordon
               



             produced a spoon which he received of Brown, whom he knew by the name of Mr. Jones.


                  Robert
                   Mulcaster
               



            , jun. produced a great coat, which was pledged in the name of 
               
                  Joseph
                   Brown
               



            , to a young man, named 
               
                  George
                   Paul
               



            , who was gone away, but could not tell whether he was present when it was taken in, and did not remember being present when a great coat was taken in, and believed he was not present.
Robert Mulcaster deposed that he knew 
               
                  Joseph
                   Brown
               



            , and had different customers of that name, and remembered taking different pledges from the prisoner, and a coat, but could not say what sort of a coat, and never told Lovett that he had received that particular coat of the prisoner at the bar, though he had no doubt but it was pledged by 
               
                  Joseph
                   Brown
               



            , but did not remember his bringing it.


                  John
                   Moore
               



            , another pawnbroker, produced a coat and waistcoat, which he received in pledge from him, on the 9th of June, 1791, and thinks he was the person, but cannot be certain.


                  JACOB
                   GUNN
               



             sworn.
Deposed to the jacket and waistcoat, as the property of Lady St. John, to whom the prisoner Brown was a servant
; that there was one small spoon, about the size of one then produced, which was in the custody of the prisoner Brown.
PRISONER BROWN's DEFENCE.
I leave it to my Counsel.
Mr. Garrow. I am instructed to say that Lady St. John had a good character with him.
The prisoner Brown called five more witnesses, who gave him a very good character.
Gunn. Brown told me, when he gave me the silver spoon, that he had another making for one that was lost, and he wanted to see if it matched.

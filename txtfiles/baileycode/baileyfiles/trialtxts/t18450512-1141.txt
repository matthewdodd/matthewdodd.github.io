MARY DAVIS
 was indicted

 for stealing 2 engravings and frames, value 5s., the goods of 



Joseph Flack, and that she had been before convicted of felony.






MARY CUMMING
. I am servant to Mr. Flack, who keeps the Ben Jonson public-house. On the 30th of April, between eleven and twelve o'clock, I went up stairs, and found the prisoner standing behind the room door—I asked what brought her up there, and she handed me one of these pictures—she had these two pictures with her, which are my master's, and had been hanging up in the room in which she was—it was an up-stairs room, and she had no business there.





JOSEPH FLACK
. I keep the Ben Jonson—I heard a noise up stairs—I went up and found a frame lying down on its side—the prisoner must have been behind the room door at that time—I heard another noise—I went up again and found her there—these are my pictures—she had no business in the room.

Prisoner. I am very sorry, I hope you will have mercy on me.





GEORGE BANHAM
 (police-constable B 84.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read—Convicted, 1st Jan., 1844, and confined six months)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 45.—


Transported for Seven Years.

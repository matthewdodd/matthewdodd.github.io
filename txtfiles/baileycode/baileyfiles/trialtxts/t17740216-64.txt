             was a labourer on some buildings of Mr. Green's; the lead was found missing from a garret window; the lead was found the next morning or soon after; I will not swear it is the same lead, but it fits it exactly, therefore I believe it is the same . (The lead produced).

            . I am a plaisterer; the lead produced exactly fitted the place the lead was taken from; I have no doubt but it is the same lead.

            . The lead was brought to me to sell by Hibberd; suspecting it, I went out and called in Barnard, the constable. Before the Justice they both owned they took the lead.

             confirmed the evidence of the last witness.
- Green. I went to Clerkenwell prison with my man to see the prisoners; there Leonard owned it.
The prisoners, in their defence, said, they found the lead.
Both

            , partners. They are malt distillers

 ; they trust to me to tell the sacks, and give an account of the corn. I was up in the granary on the 27th of Nov. I heard somebody coming up. It was our lighter-man 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Bennet 
               



            , he had got five empty sacks, he went and put them into a binn. When I ask'd him what he was going to do; he said, he was going to lie down, and the sacks were to cover him; I had some suspicion; I look'd over the sacks in the lighter, and could not find the number of sacks there ; then I ask'd him, what he had done with the five sacks he brought up empty in the granary? said he, I have carried them to the place where I had them. I went and found these five sacks tuck'd in between two hop bags. Then I told him, I believ'd he had been doing something with four sacks of wheat. There should have been 95 quarters and a half, but when we came to tell them up, there were two quarters missing.

            . I was servant to Mr. Rouse; 
               
                  John 
                  Cox 
               



             the prisoner came to me when I was in Limekill Dock, and said, if I would let him have some sacks of wheat, he could sell them to 
               
                  John 
                  Pursley 
               



            ; I was a yearly servant, and work'd the corn. I let him have four sacks from on board the lighter; there was nobody on board but myself, who shot the corn out of my master's sacks into four sacks of his, which he brought. He went away from me, and landed them at Elan's wharf. The next morning I saw one sack carried into Pursley's house. The corn came out of the Essex sloop.

                  Sweet 
               



            . I am a porter. I carried the four sacks of corn, between twelve and one in the day, by order of 
               
                  John 
                  Cox 
               



            , from Elan's wharf, to Pursley's house, and pitched them on the back side of his house where he sets his wheat, &c. he was not at home when I carried them.

                  Barnet 
               



            . I am constable. I had a warrant to take up Pursley; on the 30th of Nov. I went to his house, and he was in the backhouse. I told him what I came for, and said, I was very sorry for it; he said he knew nothing at all of the matter, and that he never had any dealings with Cox at all. When we were before justice Hammond, he denied it a good while. At last Cox was brought to his face, who told him he bought it, and gave him 35 s. and 5 s. set off for bread; then Pursley owned it, and called Cox old rogue, and said, he would not have dealings with him again, if he might have 500 l.


                  John 
                  Rouse 
               



            . I am lighterman to Mr. Staples and company; every lighter that is loaded, I send a note with it; and when this lighter was unloaded, there were four sacks missing. I then took up Bennet, and had him before justice Hammond; there he acknowledged, that he and Cox stole the corn, and that Cox told him he could sell it to Pursley, for he used to deal with him. I had a warrant to take up Pursley; I went to the house, and told him I had a great suspicion he had received four sacks of wheat which were stole, and that he must go before a magistrate. He said I was welcome to look all over his house; for as to Mr. Cox, he knew nothing of him: after that he said, he knew Cox as a neighbour; at first he denied he had any dealings with him, then he was ask'd, whether he thought Cox could come honestly by four sacks of wheat. He said no, he did not believe he could; then we carried him in order to go before Esq; Hammond; he was not at home; so justice Browning committed him for farther examination, and in the evening we carried him to justice Hammond, where at first he stead-fastly denied it; said Esq; Hammond, what will you say if I bring the man to your face, and he says you bought it? [ Cox was brought out of a room to him. ] Said the justice to Cox, do you know any thing of four sacks of wheat that you stole out of Mr. Rouse's lighter? yes, said he, I stole them, and sold them to Mr. Pursley. Mr. Pursley was in a rage, and said, I wonder you should serve me so: said Cox, you need not deny it; Cox said, he had received 35 s. and 5 s. in bread of Pursley; at last Pursley was very sorry, he said, for what he had done, and made a few excuses; Pursley then said, he paid him 40 s. for them, but he never saw the wheat. I have known Cox for 15 years; he was servant to a miller, and used to work his boat up and down the river; but for some time past he has been a boom-boat man, selling gin upon the river.
Q. What do you think them 16 bushels of wheat were worth at that time?
Rouse. These four sacks of wheat cost my masters 50 s. and they bought a great quantity together at Bear-key, it cost 24 s. and 6 d. per quarter, and lighteridge and other charges, makes it amount to that money. I heard Pursley say, he paid Cox for them four sacks of wheat.


                  Richard 
                  Staples 
               



            . The price at Bear-key, at this time the wheat was stole, was 24 s. and 6 d. per quarter, and according to my own opinion, I think Mr. Pursley must know the wheat was then worth more money than he gave for it. I was by when he acknowledged he paid 40 s. for that wheat, he at first denied he had had any dealings with Cox, and at last he did acknowledge he had.
Mr. Simpson. At the time I bought this wheat, there was no wheat at Bear-key worth so little as 20 s. a quarter; except it was damaged wheat.
Cox's defence.

             came to my house, I was not at home; my wife sent for me, I came home, he stay'd and sup'd with me that night; he said, I must go along with him, and I should have four sacks of wheat. I went and received them, and sold them to Mr. Pursley, and I gave the porter a shilling, for carrying them to his house.
Pursley's defence. I leave it to my counsel, who call'd three persons to his character.
Both  

               Guilty

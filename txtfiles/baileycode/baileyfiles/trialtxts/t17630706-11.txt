            . I am a manager of a workhouse
 in Beech lane. I lost about ninety or an hundred ells of Russia cloth out of a room in my house; it was not in use. The prisoner was a servant in the house; she absconded about the 8th of May, she was taken about a fortnight of three weeks after; we found 63 yards at different pawnbrokers, which she acknowledged before the bench of justices, she had taken and pawned.

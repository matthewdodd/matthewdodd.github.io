HENRY COSTER
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
20th of February, 5 handkerchiefs, value 14s. 9d., the goods of 



Michael Hall and another.






CHARLES GOULD
. I am in the employ of Michael Hall and another, linen-drapers, in St. Pauls-churchyard. On the 20th of February, the prisoner came for a pair of braces for 6d., and while the young man went to another part of the shop, he took five handkerchiefs in one piece, and put them under his jacket—I took them from him, and sent for a policeman.






THOMAS WALKER
. I was in the shop—the prisoner came in, and asked me for a pair of braces about 6d.—I went to get them, and when I returned, he was in custody of Gould, and was begging for mercy—these are the handkerchiefs.

Prisoner. The handkerchiefs were on the counter—I laid hold of one to look at—I only had them in my hand.




GUILTY
.* Aged 15.—


Transported for Seven Years.—Convict Ship.

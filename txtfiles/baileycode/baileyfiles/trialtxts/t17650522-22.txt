            ; the prisoner lived servant
 with us, on and off, for 16 years; my wife died on the 16th of March: when my wife died she was between 90 and 100 years of age; the prisoner was very careful of her in her illness: on the 30th I wanted to look into the chests to take an inventory of the things: I thought I missed some things in the first chest; but when I came to look into the second, where principal part of the things were, the prisoner absconded, when she found she could not put me off from looking at the things: I missed abundance of things, a blue damask silk gown, and a green paduasoy, a white muslin apron, two shifts, four pewter plates. Several napkins, three silk petticoats, two linen petticoats, two chintz curtains, and a velvet cardinal; what linen my wife had I do not know: I missed more things than are in the indictment: I saw the things put up into the chests; but here is a person here that knows some of them better than I do: I know they were in the chests last

             wife was childish some years before she died. The prisoner came and surrendered herself to me; and said, she had no peace day nor night; this was in the time of last sessions here: she was sent to Clerkenwell Bridewell; she told me of her taking these things; and that two others were concerned with her: she hoped I would forgive her; and said they were in pawn at such and such places: I have seen many of them since; some at

            . I AM a pawnbroker, and live in Shoreditch: the prosecutor is a neighbour of mine: the prisoner pledged these things with me; (producing a blue domask gown, a green silk gown, a sheet, a napkin, and three pewter plates.)
Prosecutor. These two gowns, the napkin, and two plates, are my property.


                  Thomas 
                  Townsend 
               



            . I live in Cock-lane, Shoreditch: the prisoner pledged this velvet cardinal with me on the 21st of January: (Produced and deposed to by the prosecutor.) I have other things here, pledged by 
               
                  Sarah 
                  Smith

                  Mattim 
               



            . I live in Holywell-street, Shoreditch: I have four different articles here; (two petticoats, a curtain, and a white apron); but I never saw the prisoner in my life till yesterday, 
               
                  Sarah 
                  Smith 
               



             brought them to me.

                  Messenger 
               



            . I live in Holywell-street, Shoreditch: 
               
                  Sarah 
                  Smith 
               



             pledged these two petticoats, and white apron (producing them) with me.


                  Mary 
                  Moss 
               



            . I have known the prosecutor's wife ever since I was a child; when she was living I was there for days and days together; I have seen her have these silk gowns on many a time; and I believe the velvet cloak, to be her cloak.


                  James 
                  Gibson 
               



            . About the latter end of April the prosecutor came to me, and said his servant maid had robbed him: after that he came again with a paper, on which were wrote a parcel of things he said were pledged by the maid, and desired me to go to the pawnbrokers and see if the things were there; I said, the best way was to get the prisoner first: the next day he said he had heard of her: after she had surrendered, I went with her to these people; there we saw these several things; she told me of a vast number of things that she had taken; and that 
               
                  Sarah 
                  Smith 
               



             had went and pawned many of them: she described them very particularly, and told where they were pawned: (a dimity gown, a brown damask gown, a striped silk gown, a muslin apron, and a counterpane, produced); these she owned she had taken unknown to her master, and Smith pledged them at Mr. Townsend's. I believe all these to be the prosecutor's property.
Gibson. I saw this blue silk petticoat at Mrs. Mattam's, (produced); this she told me she took unknown to her master; and also these chintz curtains, and under-petticoat, (produced); she said they were pawned by 
               
                  Sarah 
                  Smith 
               



            , for her use. I asked her what she had done with the money? she said, she had spent it all.



                  Mary 
                  Moss 
               



            . I believe these things to be the prosecutor's property; here is the fellow curtain, (produced and compared.)
Gibson. A black sattin petticoat the prisoner said she had taken, and sent Smith to pawn it; (produced.)
Prosecutor. I am well assured this is my property.


                  Mary 
                  Moss 
               



            . I know the prosecutor's wife had such a petticoat as this.
Prosecutor. I should be glad to have all the pawnbrokers asked, upon their oaths, whether they have not more of my things?
They were all asked, and declared they had not.

             was chairing in the house; we got pretty intimate together; she wanted some money, and persuaded me to take these things.

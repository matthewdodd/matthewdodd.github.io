WILLIAM DELL. I am a waiter at Long's Hotel. On the 12th of January I was at the bar, about five o'clock in the afternoon, and saw the prisoner coming from the staircase; he appeared very bulky, as if he had something about him. I followed him, and overtook him about eight or ten yards from the door, and asked what he had been doing up stairs? he said he had been to the water-closet, and that the housemaid had showed him up. I told him I thought he had something about him which did not belong to him, and asked him to come back. He then said he had lived in the house, which I knew to be false - I collared him, and brought him back, and put him into the coffee-room, and sent for an officer. While the officer was gone for, he pulled the things from under his clothes, and some from his pockets. The officer came and took him.
Prisoner. Q. What parish is the house in - A. St. James's.

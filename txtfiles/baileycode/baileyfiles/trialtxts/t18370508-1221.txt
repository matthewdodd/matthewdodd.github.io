THOMAS JONES
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
13th of April, 1 table-cloth, value 18s.; and 4 napkins, value 12s.; the goods of 



John Wilson Patten.






JOHN WOOD
. I am a policeman. I was in Queen-street, May-fair, on the 13th of April, about half-past ten o'clock, and saw the prisoner carrying a bundle—I asked what he had got, and what he was going to do with it—he seemed rather confused, and made no answer—I then asked where he got it from—he wished me to go to Little Pulteney-street—he said a man gave it him to carry, but he did not know where to—I took him to the station, and found in the bundle a table-cloth, and four napkins—made inquiries, and found whose it was.





ELIZABETH PERKINS
. I am housekeeper to Mr. John Wilson Patten, of Hill-street, Berkeley-square. This is my master's property—it was taken out of the housekeeper's room—I missed it at half-past four o'clock—a stranger could only get to that room, by going down the area—the gate was unlocked.

Prisoner's Defence, I was standing at the bar of a public-house, in South-street, drinking a glass of ale, a man came in with a bundle, and called for some beer—we got into conversation, and he asked me, when we came out, to hold his bundle—I walked on, and was taken on suspicion of stealing it.

COURT to JOHN WOOD. Q. Did the prisoner tell you that a man, who was just behind, had just given him it? A. No—he said he did not know the man, nor where he was.




GUILTY
. Aged 22.—


Transported for Seven Years.

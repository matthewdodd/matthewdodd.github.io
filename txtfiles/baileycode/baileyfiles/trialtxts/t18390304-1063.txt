MARY GOLD ING
. I am single. On the 2nd of March, I was standing next to Mr. Humphrey's door in Whitechapel-road—I saw the prisoner and mother man looking in at the window—the prisoner took a pair of shoes in his hand, turned them round, and cut or broke the string, and tried to conceal them about his person—the two persons then went away.





THOMAS MASTERS
. I am shopman to Mr. Edward Humphreys is Whitechapel-road—Golding made a communication to me—I took the prisoner about a dozen doors off, and asked what he had got under his waistcoat—he made no answer—I pat my hand round him, and felt the shoes under his waistcoat—his companions rescued him, after a quarter of an hour's struggle, but I followed, and never lost sight of him until the officer took him—these are the shoes I took from him.





GEORGE KING
 (police-constable H 111.) I heard a cry of "stop thief"—I ran, and on coming to the end of the street I fell down—the prisoner passed me—I followed immediately, and overtook him—he said he had done nothing, he was merely running with the mob, but he was a considerable distance before them.

Prisoner. I heard the cry, and was running with the mob—I never had the shoes.




GUILTY
. Aged 18.—


Transported for Seven Years.

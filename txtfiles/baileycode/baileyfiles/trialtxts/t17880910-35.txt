I keep a warehouse
 in St. Martin's-le-Grand


; I lost some handkerchiefs on the 15th of July, at five in the afternoon; the prisoner was taken with the handkerchiefs in his breast, while I was backwards; I did not see it; the goods were on my counter; I saw them about three quarters of an hour before.

             sworn.
I work nearly opposite the prosecutor's; between four and five I saw the prisoner go into the warehouse; he was there some little time, and I saw him come out, buttoning his coat; he went a little way, and I went up to him and said, what have you under your coat? he unbuttoned his coat, and threw something away; I did not see what that something was; I laid hold of him, and took him, and picked it up, then I saw what it was; I never was out of sight of him; it was a piece of handkerchief; I took him back to Mr. Heron's warehouse and asked him if it was his property, and he owned it; the property was taken to the magistrate's with him, and I have had it ever since; this is the same.

PRISONER's DEFENCE.
The person that says he found them upon me, says a falsity.
Jury to Prosecutor. I presume you have some servants or shopmen? - No, I have not.

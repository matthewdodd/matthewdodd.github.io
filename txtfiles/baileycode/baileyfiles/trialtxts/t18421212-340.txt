THOMAS THOMAS
. I am in the employ of Charles Scott, of Plumber's-row, City-road. On the 3rd of Dec. some one came in, and gave me information—I looked about, and missed 200 yards of glazed cotton which I had seen safe about ten minutes before five o'clock—I went in search of the prisoner, and found him in Old-street-road with this parcel on his shoulder, wrapped in brown paper, and his apron over it—these are my matter's property, and what I lost—I found him from five to eight minutes after they were lost.

Prisoner's Defence. I was crossing Bath-street; I was overtaken by two persons who asked me to carry the parcel; I went a little way; they were behind me; Thomas came, and took me; they were not a stone's throw behind me when I was crossing.




GUILTY
.* Aged 20.—


Transported for Seven Years.

            . Last Saturday about four o'clock, my child, who is six years and eight months old, got liberty of her mother to go and play in St. Bartholomew's-hospital square


; after missing her about three hours, a man brought her home, stripped of her ear-wires, frock, bib, and apron, and a little pocket handkerchief; after that the prisoner was brought to my house in Little Britain by Mr. Ward; when at Guildhall, the constable took my child and showed her the pictures; then when the prisoner, whom she had not seen, was with several other women, he said, now, child, see if you know the woman that took your clothes; she ran to the prisoner, and said, that was she.
Mrs. Bethel confirmed the account given by her husband.
Mr. Ward. I am a pawnbroker, I live facing St. Andrew's church, Holbourn; last Saturday the prisoner brought a child's slip, and a pair of small gold wires, and pledged them with me (produced and deposed to;) and on Wednesday she came and offered me a pair of silver buckles, and I having had an account these were stole, stopt her; I cannot find an owner to the buckles; there has been a child stripped and robbed of a pair of buckles in Chancery-lane; that child described the prisoner, but the parents say the buckles are not the size of the buckles they lost.
Prisoner's defence.
These things were given to me to pawn.

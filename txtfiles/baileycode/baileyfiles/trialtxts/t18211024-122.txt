SARAH LOVETT. I am servant to Mr. Hall, who lives in Grosvener-street, West


. On the 25th of October, about a quarter before nine o'clock in the morning, I heard a noise of something falling - I went into the kitchen on the ground floor, it opens into a passage; I ran in and saw the prisoner, he run away - I pursued, and gave an alarm, he was taken by the watchman. I found the tea caddy thrown down - I had seen it safe two minutes before in the kitchen window, it could not be seen from the street, no other person but him had been in the kitchen - it could not have fallen off the shelf; I found it about two yards from the window. There is a gate, and a forecourt, before the house.

            . I was in Grosvenor-street, and saw the prisoner coming out of the gate, hearing the alarm, I ran round, and took him - he wanted me to search him. I said somebody else would do that.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I was never in the house. I was crossing the fields when they took me - it being dirty I went out of the path.

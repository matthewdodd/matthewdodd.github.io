            . I am a clerk
. On the 8th of June, about a quarter-past nine o'clock in the evening, I was in St. Paul's church-yard


, going from home; an officer stopped and gave me information - I felt my pocket, and my handkerchief was gone; I immediately saw it in the prisoner's hands - the officer had hold of him at the time; he said it was not him, that he took it from the hand of another boy, and was going to give it to me.
ROBERT TVRRELL. I am a constable. About a quarter-past nine o'clock I stood at the corner of St. Paul's church-yard, and saw the prisoner in company with another about his own age, following Mr. Biden, and about half way down the church-yard I saw the prisoner attempt his pocket, but he did not succeed - he went a few yards further, and then took the handkerchief from Mr. Biden's pocket; I laid hold of him, took it out of his hand, and his companion ran away.(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence (written). I was passing through St. Paul's church-yard, and saw a boy pick the gentleman's pocket of a handkerchief; I immediately went towards the gentleman intending to inform him, when the boy threw it down - I took it up, and was in the act of giving it to the gentleman, when the officer accused me of taking it; I solemnly protest my innocence.

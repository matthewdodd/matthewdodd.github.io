LEWIS LEWIS
. I am an ironmonger, and live in Conduit-street, Marylebone. On the 9th of Dec. I missed three brushes from inside the door-post—these now produced are them.





RICHARD OLDAKER
. I live in Homer-street, Marylebone. About three o'clock on the 9th of Dec. I saw six persons coming up in one side of the street, and the prisoner and another on our side—I taw them with some brushes, and I watched them—six went round the New-road, and the other two went another way—I ran up Chapel-street, and saw the prisoner showing the other the three brushes—he saw me, dropped them, and ran away—I took up the brushes, ran, and took him—Mr. Lewis's shop is at the bottom of the street, about four doors from the corner.

Prisoner's Defence. I had the brushes given to me in Dorset-square.





JAMES M'REATH
 (police-constable D 176.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY

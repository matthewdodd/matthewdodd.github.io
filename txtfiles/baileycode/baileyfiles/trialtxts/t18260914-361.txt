JOHN HUMPHRIES. My son had been bathing in the canal, on the 30th of July - he had a handkerchief when he went out, and returned without it.

            . I went to bathe. I left my father's handkerchief in my hat, by the side of the Regent's-canal, near Primrose-hill


 - my cousin called me out, and said the prisoner had robbed me.

            . I was by the side of the canal, and saw the prisoner take the handkerchief out of the hat, and ran away - some other boys were about - I saw him fold it up and give it to some one - he stood still, and I gave an alarm.

            . I was on the opposite bank, and saw the prisoner get out of the canal naked, and take the handkerchief; I did not see what he did with it; he ran among about a dozen others, some of whom were naked - I secured him; he was then dressed - he said he had taken it, and given it to some person, whose name I do not remember - he afterwards refused to tell the name - I am certain he is the boy.

            . I am an officer, and received him in charge; he said he had given the handkerchief to another person, but would not tell me who; he said, at the watch-house, that he would rather be lagged for seven years, than he would split.

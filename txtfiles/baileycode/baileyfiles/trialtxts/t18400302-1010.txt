 (police-constable T 134.) About half-past three o'clock, on the 18th of February, I received information that the prisoner had a pair of boots, which were supposed to have been stolen—I took her, and found them in her lap—she said she bought them at Maidstone two months ago.

Prisoner. I bought them of a woman for 4s.

 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
18th of March 1 looking-glass and frame, value 1l. 2s., the goods of 



William Charles Woollard.






JAMES WILLIAM BAYLEY
. I am a journeyman to Mr. William Charles Woollard, of Old-street. I was in the room adjoining the shop, at a quarter past eleven o'clock, on the morning of the 18th of March—I saw the prisoner going out of the shop with a glass in his hand—I heard no noise—I turned and saw him—I ran after him—he had got about four doors—I collared him, and said he must come back—he said, "What for? your master sent me for it"—I brought him back—my master said, in his presence, that he had not sent him; and the prisoner went down on his knees and begged to be let off—Mr. Woollard then gave him in charge—no promises had been held out to him.





JOHN DONOVAN
 (police-constable N 100.) I was sent for and took the prisoner—I saw him go on his knees and promise never to do so again.

J. W. BAYLEY. This is my master's glass, and the one that was taken.




GUILTY
.* Aged 19.—


Transported for Seven Years.

Fifth Jury, before Mr. Sergeant Arabin.

            . I keep a shoe-shop at the corner of Field-lane, Holborn. On the 31st of March, about nine o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came and offered to sell me some boots - my shopman brought them up to me - I went down and saw the prisoner - he asked 9s. for them - I said I knew they were stolen, and took him to the watch-house - he appeared very much distressed indeed.
THOMAS LEWIS. I live in Marchant-street


, and am a boot and shoemaker
. These are my boots, and were in front of my shop - they were taken away on Monday evening, the 31st of March - they are worth 14s. - I tried them on a customer on Saturday morning - they are made in the country to my order.
Prisoner's Defence. I was sitting by the fire at my lodging, and John Ready brought the boots in, and asked me to go and sell them for him - he told me to ask 9s. for them, and said he would give me a shilling for myself.
MR. FORD. He told me the same story - he said he knew they were stolen, but he did not steal them.

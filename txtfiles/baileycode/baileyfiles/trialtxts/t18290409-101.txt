            . The prisoner lived with me between three and four months - I lost a great deal of property; she ran away, I think, on the 26th of February; I then missed some other articles - these are the articles; a great part of them are marked.

            . I am a pawnbroker. I have two sheets, one shirt, one table-cloth, and one handkerchief, all pawned by Hayte.

                  HAYTE
               



            . I received these articles from the prisoner, and pawned them with Mr. Donkin, at different times; I was not employed at the prosecutor's; I have known the prisoner some years, and knew she lived there- I thought the articles were her own.

            . I apprehended the prisoner on the 28th of March, at Lambeth; she said she hoped Mr. Harrison would forgive her, and she was coming that day to try to settle it; she told me that Hayte had pawned them, and Hayte gave me the duplicates.

                           Thomas 
                           Chorley

                  THOMAS
                   CHORLEY
               



             sworn.
I am a carpenter
; I missed some lead from some houses I had recently built in Union-street, Shadwell


; I missed it first on the 21st; I saw the lead on the following day at the office; I fitted the lead the day after to the place from whence I had lost it; I knew it by the end I worked down, and from the nail-holes; I have no doubt of it being my lead; it had been laid down about two months; the piece weighed about thirty pounds; the piece I describe completely filled up the vacancy.


                  WILLIAM
                   TURNER
               



             sworn.
I know the prisoner at the bar; I met him at the head of Old Gravel lane, with the lead in a sack, on the 21st of November, about four in the evening; I asked him what he had got there; he said, a bit of blue; that is slang for lead; I do not know whether any examination was taken in writing before the magistrate; he said he had had it seven months: at the public-house he said he had an estate in Hertfordshire; the lead has been kept in the office under my charge; I marked it with a W.


                  WILLIAM
                   DUNCH
               



             sworn.
I took the lead from the office, and fitted it to the place; the hole does not run right through, it runs upon an angle; I can only swear to one piece of the lead; they were detached pieces of lead, some fitting one house and some another.

                   BURTON
               



             sworn.
I was also present. (Deposes to the same effect.)

                   FRANCIS
               



             sworn.
I am a plumber; I have no shadow of doubt but it is the identical lead fitted toMr. Chorley's house; I have taken a great deal of pains to satisfy myself.
Prisoner. I bought five pieces of lead, and gave 18 s. a hundred for the lead; I bought it to send into Hertfordshire, where I was building a little tenement; Turner is only a cadee; he is a thief; he has been in Newgate; he stole beer and pork; he is well known in Newgate.
Turner. I was convicted of an assault, and confined in Newgate; it was upon a girl, for striking her; it was not for an attempt to commit a rape.

               Transported for seven years
            .

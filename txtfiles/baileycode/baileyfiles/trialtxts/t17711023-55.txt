            . My wife and I were walking near Holborn bridge


, on the 20th of October, at night; she told me somebody was busy about my pocket: I felt in my pocket and missed my handkerchief; the prisoner standing near me, I seized him, and charged him with having stole my handkerchief; at first he said he had no handkerchief. I took him towards the watch-house; he took my handkerchief from under his arm, and said, here, I will give you this handkerchief that we may have no words; when I looked at it I found it was my own.

            , a hackney coachman, deposed, that the three first prisoners, and he believed the last, got into the coach, and drove to that house. In the prisoner Bramsley's pocket, was found the stone buckles, a pair of silk gloves, and a pair of leather gloves, two pair of ear-rings, one pair of wash-leather gloves, a silk pocket-book, a pair of black silk women gloves, and two locks of hair, and a quantity of cocoa-nuts. Upon the prisoner Nadan, was found a letter, directed to Miss Orton, a silver pen, and a little bit of pink silk, and an old silk handkerchief. Upon the prisoner Stokes was found, a pair of scissars with a paper sheath.
The prisoner Lamb brought his father and brother to prove, that he slept at home the night of the robbery, and also the maid servant to some lodgers in the house, who saw him go up stairs, at half after nine at night.
The prisoner Lamb called three witnesses who gave him a good character.

SOLOMON WORMS. I am a broker
, and live in Queen-street, St. Giles'


. On the 11th of December this looking-glass was outside my window, which was not open; I had a lad there to mind the things - an opposite neighbour's lad hallooed out; I ran out, and saw the looking-glass in the road, opposite my door - it was mine; I had seen it safe five minutes before.

            . I am twelve years old, and live with my brother, who is a broker, opposite Mr. Worms'. I was looking across just at dusk, and saw Worms' lad talking to two other boys; the big boy gave Worms' boy a piece of sweet-stuff - I saw the prisoner take the glass off the door, and walk away with it; I ran over and caught him - he then dropped it, and said, "Let me go;" I called to Worms, who came out, took the glass up, and claimed it; I had seen the prisoner before, I did not know who he was.

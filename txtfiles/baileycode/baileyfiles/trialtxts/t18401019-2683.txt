EDWARD ATTWELL
. I am master of the Britannia smack lying at Cherry Garden-stairs, St. Mary's, Bermondsey. On the 21st of October, about twelve o'clock at night, the prisoner came on board my smack to pilot me down the river—I did not know him before—he brought me down to Cherry Garden-stairs—I take any body that offers himself to pilot me—I went down into the cabin to bed—the pilot was to call me—I laid my jacket, waistcoat, and trowsers on the locker—I had a pocket-book which contained a 10l. note and seven sovereigns, belonging to me—the watch and seal belonged to William Davies—in the morning the boy got up to light the fire—the watch and property were gone, and the prisoner was gone too—he had taken my boat on shore, and made her fast—I found

him in bed with a lady—I found the pocket-book and the 10l. note in his jacket pocket—this is it—it is mine.





DAVID HANSELL
 (police-constable M 117.) I went to a lodging-house in Tooley-street, and found the prisoner in bed with a woman—I found the watch in the bed, and the pocket-book in his jacket pocket—he said it was a bad job for him.
(Thomas Knight, a publican, gave the prisoner a good character.)




GUILTY
. Aged 21.—


Transported for Ten Years.

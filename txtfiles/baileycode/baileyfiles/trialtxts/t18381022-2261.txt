WILLIAM LEA
 was indicted

for feloniously uttering a request on the 
19th of September, for the delivery of 1 ream of Imperial paper, with intent to defraud 



William Magnay and another.






GEORGE MAGNAY, ESQ
. I am in partnership with my brother, william Magnay, we carry on business on College Hill. On the 19th of September, about five o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came to the counting-house produced this order, and said he came from Mr. Gadden, and wished to have a ream of Wilmott's Imperial—Gadden sometimes signs an order at full length and sometimes in initials—I have frequently executed an order in initials, and this is in initials—I gave the prisoner the paper myself, believing

him to come from Mr. Gadden—I have no doubt of the prisoner's identity—he was in my presence from five to seven minutes—(read)—" Please to let the bearer have one ream of Imperial, of Edwards's make, or any one near it—W.D.G."





WILLIAM DANIEL GADDEN
. I do not sign orders with my initials—I sign the name of the firm, "William Daniel and Edward Gadden"—I generally sign at full length—but sign in the initials of the firm sometimes, and those requests have been complied with—this request is not in my handwriting, nor did I authorise any one to write it—the prisoner is not in my employ in any way—it is not my partner's writing.

Cross-examined by
MR. JONES. Q. It is not at all like your writing is it? A. No, nor is this the way in which I sign—my partner is not here—no person but myself writes orders—I never go out—I always conduct the in-door business.
(Stephen Scuddamere, a box-maker, Crow-street, Bethnal-green-road; Benjamin Hawkins, Trinity-lane, Queenhithe, a packing-case maker; T. H. Hexton, a plasterer; and Joseph Matthews, of London-wall, deposed to the prisoner's good character.)




GUILTY
. Aged 53.—


Transported for Seven Years. (There was another indictment against the prisoner.)

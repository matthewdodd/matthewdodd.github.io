RICHARD NORMAN
. I live in Manchester-square. On the 31st of December, about half-past three o'clock, I was in Green-street, and felt something pull at my coat—I passed my hand rapidly round, caught hold of the prisoner, and found my handkerchief at his feet—no one else was near enough to have taken it—I delivered him to a policeman—I had felt my handkerchief safe within three or four minutes—he was quite close to me.

Prisoner. Q. Were there not two boys, one in a brown coat and another close to you? A. No, not within fifteen or twenty yards—the prisoner

epeatedly asked me to give him a good beating and let him go, as it was his first offence.





JOHN GIBLING
 (police-constable C 125.) The prisoner was given in to my custody, with this handkerchief.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

Prisoner's Defence. There were two boys—they taw me going to tell the gentleman, and they threw the handkerchief down—I was not so near him as the other two, but he collared me and the others ran away.




GUILTY
. Aged 14.—


Transported for Seven Years.

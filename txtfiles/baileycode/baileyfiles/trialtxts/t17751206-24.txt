            . I live at the corner of Portland-street, Cavendish-square


; the prisoner lodged in my house: I lost two blankets, a counterpane, two sheets, two pillows and cases, a tea kettle, four cups and saucers; those I lent to her in her lodging. She was a single woman. I was apprehensive of the things being gone, so got a warrant and searched her lodgings, when all those things appeared to be missing. I went to one Finch, a pawnbroker in Berwick-street, Soho, found part of them there, the rest I found in John-street. She acknowledged before the justice that they were my property, and that she had pawned them herself. (The goods produced and sworn to by the prosecutor.)

             (a pawnbroker) produced a pair of blankets, and a tea spoon, which he said were pledged with him in the prisoner's name.

             (a pawnbroker) said the prisoner pledged with him four cups and saucers, and two sheets (which things he produced). I have known the prisoner very well for more than twelve months.
PRISONER's DEFENCE.
My landlady knew the things were in pawn, but said she would never hurt me.

MARY ANN FOSTER
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
2nd of August, 1 pair of stays, value 2s.; 2 basins, value 8d.; 1 plate, value 4d.; 1 yard of silk, value 1s.; and 1 yard of patch-work, value 1s.; the goods of 



Elizabeth Wright-2nd COUNT, stating them to be the goods of the 

ordinary of the Diocese.






ELIZABETH WRIGHT
. I am a widow. I live at No. 6, Turville's-buildings, Turville-street, Bethnal-green—my husband died on the 2nd of August—the prisoner came to our house several times to fetch a few errands, as we were all laid up with a fever—we were all so bad we could not get out of bed—on the 2nd of August she came in and asked me if I would let her sit down in my room where I lodged—I left her in care of that room—my little girl is eleven years old—I was gone from half-past ten till eleven o'clock—this property was taken from my box—it was not locked—my husband was lying dead in the bed—I lost a pair of stays, two basins, a plate, a yard of silk, and some patch-work-when I returned the prisoner was gone, and the room was in darkness—I saw her again on the Thursday following, seven or eight days afterwards—these stays and basins are mine.





JOHN WILSON
. I keep a chandler's shop. The prisoner brought these stays and basins to my shop, and asked if I would let her have a few provisions on them, to the amount of 6 1/2 d.—this was on the evening of the 2nd of August.





FREDERICK EAGER
. I am a policeman. I went in search of the prisoner, and found her eight days afterwards, in Kingsland-road, in a state of great distress, and in a bad state of health—I know she has no place to

live in or to go to—she sleeps about in the brick-fields, or any where she can.




GUILTY
. Aged 18.—


Transported for Seven Years.

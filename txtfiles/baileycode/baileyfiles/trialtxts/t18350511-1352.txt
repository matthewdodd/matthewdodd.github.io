GEORGE DIXON
 were indicted for

stealing, on the 
20th of April, 1 handkerchief, value 2s., the goods of 



John Drayton, from his person.—2nd COUNT, stating it to belong to a man unknown.






JAMES WILD
. I am a police-officer. I was at Greenwich fair, on duty—I saw the two prisoners following a gentleman; and Dixon drew this handkerchief from his pocket, while he was going into a booth—I took them both into custody, and found this handkerchief and another on Marsh—I had seen Marsh sound the gentleman's pocket, and he said to Dixon, "You go in"—I followed them into the booth, and saw Dixon take the handkerchief—the gentleman went to the station-house with me, and gave his name as John Drayton—he stated that he was a barrister, of Lincoln's Inn—I have not heard of him since—I do not know his name except from what he said.

Marsh's Defence. I had nothing to do with picking the gentleman's pocket; I was five or six yards away from him.
(Joseph Price, an Upholsterer, of Crown-street, Finsbury; George Swan, a chair and sofa-maker; and John Meredith, a carver; gave Dixon a good character.

MARSH—


GUILTY
. Aged 19.—


Transported for Seven Years.

DIXON—



GUILTY. Aged 12.—Recommended to mercy by the Jury.
—



Confined Six Days.

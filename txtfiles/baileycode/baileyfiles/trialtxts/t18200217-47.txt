            . I am an inspector of Hawkers and Pedlars. On the 31st of January, about twenty minutes before twelve o'clock, just before the Lord Mayor's carriage came up to Chancery-lane


 to meet the procession, on the day of proclamation - there was a great concourse of people. I saw the prisoner among a great number of others, whom I knew to be pickpockets. I saw the prisoner lay hold of a gentleman's pocket, and take this handkerchief out, he immediately put it into his bosom. I collared him, and asked the gentleman if he missed any thing? he missed his handkerchief; I produced it, and he claimed it. He followed me to St. Dunstan's watch-house, there was noconstable there. I took him to Fleet-market, the gentleman did not follow me, but sent to say he would not attend.

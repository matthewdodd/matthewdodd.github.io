 - on the night of the 2nd of January, I went to bed in the barracks in the tower, and hung my watch on a nail close by the bed-head about ten minutes past nine o'clock - the next morning, I awoke about half-past six, and my watch was gone - the prisonerand several other soldiers slept in the same room - these are my watch, seals, and key.

            . I am a pawnbroker - the prisoner brought this watch to our shop, about seven in the evening on the 3rd of January - my fellow-shopman took the watch, and asked how he got it - he said he had stolen it, in order to get his discharge from the regiment - we said, we had orders to stop him - he ran off - I went after him, and caught him.

DOMINICK CONNER. I am a tailor
. On the 2d of November, about half-past ten o'clock at night, I was going home, and was within a few yards of my own door, in Greek-street


, when a man tapped me on the shoulder, and asked if he should see me home - I was quite sober - I said, No, I wanted no assistance - I was just at home; he then ran across the street, and splashed my stockings; I told him he should not do that; he repeated the words over again; and while he was talking, the prisoner came up, pulled my watch out of my fob, and ran away. I followed him through Blackhorse-yard, into Tottenham-court-road, but lost sight of him there; he afterwards was taken. I am certain he is the man, I have known him for many years.

            . I was at the corner of Blackhorse-yard. I saw the prisoner come out of the yard, and run down Tottenham-court-road. He was afterwards stopped.

            . I am an officer, and heard of the robbery. On the Wednesday night I found the prisoner at a public-house, in Tottenham-court-road, and took him. The watch has not been found.

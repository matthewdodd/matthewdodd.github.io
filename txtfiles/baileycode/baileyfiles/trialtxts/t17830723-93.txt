             sworn.
I live in New Quebeck-street, on the 7th of July a little before six in the morning I went to my work, and I saw the prisoner at the bar going behind some buildings called the Circus


, and I turned round and saw the prisoner come along the Mews with leads from the Circus into the middle of Quebeck-street


 with a load on his back, as there had been a great deal of lead stolen, I called some people to see what he had got, he was stopped and I saw he had lead, then we took him down to the watch-house, Mr. Wild went with us, and we asked him if he had not more lead, he said he had taken more lead to a house in Oxford-road, and he was to carry this, he went to Litchfield-street and did not deny the fact.
How do you know it was taken from the dwelling house of 
               
                  John
                   Saunders
               



            ? - It was the house of 
               
                  John
                   Saunders
               



            , I did not see him steal the lead, we took the lead there, and matched it by the nail holes, and it agreed.

                   WILD
               



             sworn.
I was with Robson and my evidence is the same as his so far as the lead corresponding.

             sworn.
I saw the prisoner go into this house at half past four, I did not know him before, I am positive to his person, I am not positive of the house, it was one of the Circus houses.
Have you pointed out the house to any of these gentlemen? - Yes.
Which of them? - To 
               
                  John
                   Robson
               



            .
Did you see the prisoner cutting or stripping any lead? - I did not observe him after he went in.
Court to Robson. Is that house she shewed you the property of 
               
                  John
                   Saunders
               



            ? - It is.

             sworn.
I live at No. 19, New Quebeck-street, I saw the prisoner a little after six come out of the Circus with a bag upon his back, I pointed out the house to Mr. Robson.
Court to Robson. Is that the same house? - It is.
PRISONER's DEFENCE.
My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury, I found this lead, I had been at work in Tottenham-court-road, and I was out of employ, and I asked for work.
Court to Robson. Does it at any time happen that lead rolled up in this manner may be laying in the house? - It is rather uncommon.
Prisoner. It was laying in the area, I know nobody in London.

Court. The woman saw him go in between four and five, and you met him at six, had he time enough in that space? - He could do it in half the time.

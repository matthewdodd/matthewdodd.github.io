. On the 29th of September, between one and two o'clock I lost some carpet, which was safe a quarter of an hour before; the shop-door was open, but the carpet was seven yards from the door inside the shop - I was called down stairs by my boy; the prisoner was in custody with it - he was quite a stranger to me.

            . I am a cork-cutter, and live in John-street, Hackney. I was in a shop opposite the prosecutor's, in Budge-row, and saw the prisoner, in company with another, pass the shop - in a short time he returned, went into the shop and brought out some carpet - I pursued and brought him back to Mr. Matthews, who gave him in charge; when I took him, he threw it down and said, I might carry it myself - I gave it to the officer.

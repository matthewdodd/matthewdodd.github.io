            . I saw the watchman stop the prisoner, and saw him drop the cheese, he said, he found it, and if I would go with him, he would show me the place where he found it; he took me to the prosecutor's, he laid it down at the door, and said, he found it there:
John Hornblower, servant to the prosecutor, deposed that the cheese was Mr. Buckland's property, and had the witnesses private mark upon it, and that the prisoner had a short time before been in the shop and bought a pennyworth of cheese which he was eating when he was taken.
Prisoner's Defence.
I picked it up in Thames-street, three or four yards from the cheesemonger's door.

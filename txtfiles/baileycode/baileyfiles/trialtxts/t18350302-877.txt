 stealing, on the

WILLIAM MURFIT
. I live in the parish of St. George the Martyr Southwark. I had three shirts hanging in my yard on the 27th of February—I saw them safe at three o'clock, and missed them at a quarter past three—I found them in pawn the same evening—these are them.





CHARLOTTE PIGG
. I know both these boys by sight—I saw them on the 27th of February—they went down the court where the prosecutor lives about three o'clock—I had seen the shirts hanging there—I saw them come up the court again, and a boy who is not present gave Davies something white—they then went away together.





WILLIAM PARR
. I am a pawnbroker. I took in two shirts, on the 27th of February, of the female prisoner, in the name of Ann Johnson—I sent them the same evening to Union Hall.





JOSEPH CLOTHIER
. I received the shirts from Parr, and gave them to the officer.





GEORGE SAWYER
 (police-constable M 61.) I took the two boys—Davies said he gave the shirts to Neale—she was taken, and asked where she pawned them, and she told.

Mill's Defence. I never saw the shirts; I did not know what I was taken for.

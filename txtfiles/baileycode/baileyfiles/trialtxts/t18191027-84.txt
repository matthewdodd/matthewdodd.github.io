            . On the 28th of September, between twelve and one o'clock in the morning, I was in George-street, Bloomsbury


; my friend and I went to the Maidenhead, public-house


, to have a glass of liquor, and on coming out on the step of the door, the prisoner came behind me and took my hat off my head. I turned round, and collared him with it in his hand - my handkerchief dropped out of it; I took him into the public-house. He gave the hat to another person behind him, who ran out of the back door with it; the prisoner tried to get away, and got as far as the back door. We got the watchman, who secured him; the door was fastened and all the lights put out. Just as the lights were knocked out, the watchman came in with his lanthorn - I never let him go.

            . I came out of the house with Knowles - the prisoner came and snatched his hat off. I am sure he is the man.

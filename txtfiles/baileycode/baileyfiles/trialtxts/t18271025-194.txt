            . I am a baker. On the 25th of September I saw the prisoner go into Mr. Rushmer's shop, King's-terrace, Commercial-road


, and run out with something; I asked Mrs. Rushmer if she had lost any thing - I then pursued, and took him, concealed under the arch of the bridge, and within three or four doors of the house - he pulled this handkerchief from his bosom - I gave him in charge.

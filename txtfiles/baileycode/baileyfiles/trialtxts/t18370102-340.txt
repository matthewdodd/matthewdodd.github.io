CHARLES JONES
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
18th of December, 1 handkerchief, value 1s., the goods of 



Erasmus Wren, from his person.






ERASMUS WREN
. I live in Fenchurch-street. About half-past ten o'clock, on the evening of the 18th of December, I was on Holborn-bridge

—I felt a person taking my handkerchief, I turned round and secured the prisoner, who was the only person near me—he had not my handkerchief in his possession, but it was dropped behind him—there was no else within ten yards of me—I charged him with taking it—he denied it and struggled very much to get away; and the other person, whom I saw about ten yards off, rushed upon me and struck me, and ran off immediately.

Prisoner. I showed him the man that picked his pocket. Witness. He did after he had ran off, but it could not possibly have been that other man, he was so far off.





EBENEZER WILLIAMS
. I am an officer. I took the prisoner at the watch-house—the prosecutor's nose was bleeding when he came then, through the blow he had had, and the handkerchief was all bloody.




GUILTY
.* Aged 18.—


Transported for Seven Years.

JAMES PARRY
. I am a constable. At half-past nine o'clock, on the evening of the 17th of April, I fell in with the prisoner, in Church-street, Dept-ford, with a large bundle in her apron—I asked what she had got—she said, nothing but her own—I asked where she was going to—she said to her friends in Greenwich, but she did not know the name of the street—I asked where she brought them from—she said, from the Spanish Legion Office, Cornhill—I took her to the station—the prosecutor came and claimed it, and said it had been lost about twenty minutes.





MARY GALLAVIN
. I am the wife of Daniel Gallavin—I have a lodger in my house named Cavanah. My next-door neighbour brought the prisoner in on Sunday night, and asked me to give her a night's lodging, which I did; and on Monday she pretended to be very bad, and kept her bed all day, all but two or three hours—my husband came home, and thought she was very bad, and got her some gin and water—she went away between nine and ten o'clock at night—I missed her, and then missed these things, which are all mine and my lodger's.




GUILTY
. Aged 25.—


Transported for Seven Years.

                  Levi 
               



            . My husband's name is Myer Levi, we live in Bull-court, Petticoat-lane


. I went to Horn-fair, at Charlton, on the 18th of Oct. and lock'd my room door, about nine in the forenoon: the two prisoners are my lodgers in a garret; I have two rooms in the same house: when I came home, about eight at night, I miss every thing I had, ( mentioning the things laid in the indictment) which I had left safe in my room. Berrisfort was gone away, Flint was in the house. I told her I had been robbed. She said she was very sorry, and told me Berrisfort had done it, and had pawned the things.
Q. Where was your husband?



                  Mary 
                  Levi 
               



            . I do not live with him. I went about to the pawnbrokers: I found the linen gown and petticoat at Mr. Pembridge's, in St. Gyles's, and cap and ring at Mr. Marsden's, in Petticoat-lane, and the lamp at Mr. Howard's, at the Catherine-Wheel, Hounsditch. I took Berresford up; she owned she had taken them, in company with Flint.
Q. Did Flint own to any thing?


                  Mary 
                  Levi 
               



            . She said, she pawned the petticoat. (The pawnbrokers produced the several things, which the prosecutrix deposed to. Marsdon deposed the things pledged with him were in the name of 
               
                  Mary Ann 
                  Flint 
               



            , and be believed, she herself brought them.)
Berrisfort's Defence.
I was going down stairs, and found the gown and petticoat on the stairs, and the room door open.
Flint's Defence.
I know nothing of the things.
Both 


               guilty of stealing to the amount of 25 s. Only

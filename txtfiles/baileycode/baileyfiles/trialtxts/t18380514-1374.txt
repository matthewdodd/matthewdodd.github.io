ELIZABETH EDDS
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
19th of April, 1 shawl, value 2s. 6d.; 3 shillings, 4 pence, and 16 halfpence; the goods and monies of 



Mary Mahoney; and that she had been before convicted of felony.






MARY MAHONEY
. I am a widow, and live in Harding-lane, Woolwich. On the 9th of April I went up stairs to put my child to bed, and left my shawl and this money down in my room—the prisoner lives next door to me—I came down in ten minutes, and my shawl and money were gone—it was between six and seven o'clock in the evening—this is my shawl, I am certain—(looking at it.)

Prisoner. Q. Did you not lend me a shawl that morning? A. No, I never had any thing to do with you—I had only lived there seven days.





FRANCIS CHANDLER
. I am shopman to Mr. Davis, a pawnbroker at Woolwich. On the evening of the 19th of April, Millar pawned this shawl with me.





PHILIP MILLAR
. I am a baker. I was at the Duchess of Wellington public-house—the prisoner called me outside, and asked if I would take the shawl and pawn it—I said yes, and did so—she gave it to me off her shoulders.


Prisoner's Defence. In the morning I asked the prosecutrix to lend me a shawl, to go down the town, which she did; and when I came home, she said she wanted it, and I might have the other if I liked—in the evening I asked that young man to get 9d. on it, and I would fetch it out in the morning; and when I was apprehended I told them I would fetch it—I had pawned it for 9d.





CHARLES STEWART WARDEN
. I am superintendent of the watch at Woolwich. I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction of felony from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the woman.




GUILTY
. Aged 49.—


Transported for Seven Years.

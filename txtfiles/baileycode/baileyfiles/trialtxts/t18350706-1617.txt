WILLIAM STEVENS
. I am a carman. On the 24th of June I was out with my cart, and hung my coat on a rail where I was delivering goods, in Dean's-yard, Westminster—I missed it—It was delivering goods, in in the morning—I did not see the prisoner there—this is the coat.





WILLIAM TALBOT

GEORGE WARD
. I am a policeman. I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got at the clerk of the peace at Westminster (read)—I was a witness on the trial—she is the person.

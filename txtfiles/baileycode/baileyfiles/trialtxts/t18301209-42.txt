             - he lives at No. 2, Grange-court


. The prisoner had lived servant
 with me for three months, but I discharged her for getting tipsy. On the 26th of October, when she was gone, I missed a table-cloth - I fetched her to my house, and questioned her about it; she denied it at first, but afterwards owned it, and said where it was pawned - this led to the discovery of twenty-three other articles, which she owned she had taken; she took this cloth out herself, and gave it to the officer, but he is not here.

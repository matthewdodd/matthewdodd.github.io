 was indicted

 for stealing, on the

ANN DAWKINS
. I live at home with my parents. On the 17th of December I saw the prisoner and another near the shop of Mr. Eveleigh, a linen-draper in Munster-street—one of them pulled the tippets, and could not get them—they went away and then came again, and the other pulled a tippet, got it down, gave it to the prisoner, and they ran away—the policeman caught them—I am quite sure the prisoner is the person.





RICHARD OVENDEN
 (police-constable S 143.) I was spoken to by Dawkins—I saw the prisoner and another younger—the other went up, and took the tippet from the line—the prisoner took it from him, and they both ran away—I pursued, and took the prisoner—I saw him throw the tippet away—I picked it up—the other entirely made his escape.





OLIVER MONGSTON
. I am apprentice to Mr. John Eveleigh—this it his property—it was hanging on a line at the door—I saw it about half an hour previous.




GUILTY

Transported for Seven Years.

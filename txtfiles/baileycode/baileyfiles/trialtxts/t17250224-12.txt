             depos'd, that late at Night the Prisoner brought the Sheep into the Queen's Head Alehouse in Rosemary Lane, and ask'd if any body would buy any Mutton. What will you have for the whole Carass? says one in Company. You shall have it for a Pint of Geneva, says the Prisoner. Let me see it, says this Evidence. I am afraid you stole it? No, reply'd the Prisoner, I'll give you my Word I came honestly by it, for l found it in the Street. This Evidence looking upon the Carcass, presently knew who it belong'd to, by the Mark upon the Shoulder, and forthwith sent for the Prosecutor, who own'd it.

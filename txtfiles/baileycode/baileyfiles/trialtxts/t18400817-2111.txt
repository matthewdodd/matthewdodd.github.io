MARY SULLIVAN
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
21st of August, 1 jacket, value 20s., the goods of 



Hugh Elliott.






HUGH ELLIOT
. I met the prisoner on the 21st of August—she asked if I was looking for my shopmate—I said, "Yes,"—she said, "Go up stairs, he is in our house"—I went up, but he was not there—I asked her to give me some water—she gave me some to wash myself—I laid my jacket on a chair close to the door—she went down stairs to pretend to get the water—I looked round and my jacket was gone—this is it—(looking at it.)

Prisoner. Q. Did you not give it to me and tell me to take it to the public-house to get beer on it? A. Never.





CORNELIUS OWBN
. I am a policeman. I met the prisoner about half-past five o'clock in the morning, with the jacket rolled up in her apron—I asked what she had got—she said, "Nothing"—I opened the apron and found this jacket—I said, "Where did you get it?"—she said a sailor gave it to her to go and get half-a-pint of rum—I said, "That won't do for me," and took her.

Prisoner's Defence. They would not take it at the public-house, and I was taking it home to the man.

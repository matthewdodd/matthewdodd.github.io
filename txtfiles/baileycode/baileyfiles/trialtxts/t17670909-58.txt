            . I am a gangsman at Summer's-key


; I went into the warehouse, and found the hogshead broke open, on the 3d of August in the morning, and sugars taken out; there might be half a hundred, or three quarters, of sugar, taken out; I saw some scattered on the ground.

            . On the 2d of August, on a Sunday night, I was with 
               
                  Peter 
                  Price

                  Devereux 
               



            , and John Row, and four that are not taken; I met 
               
                  John 
                  Edwards 
               



             at the foot of London-bridge, and we went in at a hole at the bottom of some pales, where they were building some part of St. Magnus's church; that hole leads into the buildings to the back of the warehouses; we saw a ladder placed up about two story high; Fosset said, lets go up that ladder, the door of the window was open; Fosset, Poling, and M'Cave, were with us, but they are not taken; I, Fosset, and 
               
                  Matthew 
                  Poling 
               



            , whom we called Butterarse, we went up; I sat eating the sugar; Fosset said, do not lie eating, lets fill our handkerchiefs; he produced six handkerchiefs, we filled them, and an apron; we chucked them down, and put them through the holes to the others; then we carried them, and all met by agreement on Tower-hill; then we carried the sugar to East-Smithfield, where we had sold sugar before; the woman and man were in bed, we knocked at the door; there came a man, who said, there was no body to buy it; then we left it there, and I was taken in about two hours and a half after.

            . On Sunday night, the 2d of August, was my watch-night; the beadle and I were going round to see that all the watchmen were on their duty; one of the watchmen came after us, and said, they had got a sugar merchant; I came to the watch-house, there was the prisoner Edwards; he had his pockets full of sugar, we turned them out, there was about nine pounds; the watchmen said, there were a dozen boys upon Tower-hill; Edwards said, he would go and show us where the rest of them were; we went to Saltpetre-bank, and there we took the evidence, and Smith, and Price; we brought them to the watch-house; last Monday was fortnight I took Devereux and Row, I examined them in the watch-house whether they made a practice of selling sugar near the May-pole, for we had found the sugar there between five and six on the Monday morning, four handkerchiefs, and an apron full, about forty-four pounds weight in the whole; they acknowledged they had taken sugar, and carried it there.

             brought in Edwards, and said, there were more boys upon the hill, which he thought were upon a roguish design; Edwards cried, and said, if I would let him loose he would give me what he had got, which was some sugar; we turned it out of his pockets, there was nine pounds of it; then he said he would tell me where the rest of the boys were that stole sugar; he went with us to Saltpetre-bank, there we took four boys coming back; he told us where they had carried the sugar; the next morning we went to the house by the Maypole, and found five handkerchiefs and an apron full of sugar.

                  Dresden 
               



            . I took Edwards on Tower-hill, with nine pounds of sugar upon him; then he took us to Saltpetre-bank, there we took the evidence, Smith, Price, and one 
               
                  Lawrence 
                  Wade 
               



             (he is not in the indictment;) then we went to a house facing the Maypole in the Butcher-row, and found the five handkerchiefs of sugar, and an apron full.
Edwards's defence.
They told me they had got some sugar, I went with them to sell it, then I went and found the evidence.
Row's defence.
I was coming over the bridge about eleven o'clock in the night; there were some boys, they desired me to carry some sugar, which I did.
Smith and Devereux said they knew nothing of the matter.

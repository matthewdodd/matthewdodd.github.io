 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
30th of October, 2 shirts, value 16s., the goods of 



Charles Tudor.






MARY KNAPMAN
. I am servant to Charles Tudor, of Union-place, Lambeth. On the 30th of October I hung out some clothes to dry, at twelve o'clock, in a garden at the back of the house, which is fenced round with a paling—in consequence of what Mrs. Tudor told me, just before two o'clock, I went and missed a dozen shirts—these are two of them—(looking at them)—I know nothing of the prisoner—he could get over the palings.





ROBERT SUTTON
. I am a policeman. On the 30th of October I saw the prisoner going over Westminster-bridge about twelve o'clock, in company with two thieves, and about six o'clock in the evening I met him in Old Pye-street—he came up to me—the other two were three or four hundred yards off—he had something under his arm—I asked what he had there—he said, "My old shirt, I had it to be washed"—he had another in his jacket—I said, "What is this?"—he said, I bought them of a man in the street for a crown"—I took him into custody.

Prisoner's Defence. He never saw me go over the bridge at all—I bought them of a man for 5s. at six o'clock at night.




GUILTY
.* Aged 18.—


Transported for Seven Years.

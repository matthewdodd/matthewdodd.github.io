            . On the 11th of the present month, I was coming from the Jerusalem coffee-house with a correspondent, and I had the notes in question in my pocket-book in my pocket. I felt something like a pull at my pocket, and on immediately turning round, I missed my pocket-book, and saw the prisoner running away. I immediately pursued him, and when he was stopped the pocket book was found on him under his coat.

            . I was upon Cornhill


, and saw the prisoner's arm at the prosecutor pocket. The prisoner immediately ran off. Mr. Crosbie complained of having lost his property. He was taken before I could come up.

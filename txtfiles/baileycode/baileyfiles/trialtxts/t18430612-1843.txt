1843. 




HENRY MILLS
 and 



John Davis, were indicted

 for stealing, on the 
19th of May, 2 pairs of trowsers, value 1l. 8s., and 2 waistcoats, 5s.; the goods of 



Issac Levi Miers, and that Mills had been before convicted of felony.






AARON NATHAN
. I manage the business of Isaac Levi Miers, in Chiswell-street. About nine o'clock on Wednesday evening these trowsers were safe, and when I arrived, about a quarter past eight next morning, I missed them, as the boy was opening the shop—I got a policeman in private clothes to watch the shop, and next morning, the 19th, I placed myself in a public-house oppsite—the boy opened the shop at eight o'clock—soon after he opened the door, previous to his taking down the shutters, the prisoners came and went into the shop—I watched them out—we followed them to Whitecross-street—they turned, saw me, and ran—the policeman caught Davis—I took Mills, in Whitecross-street—I went to the station, and saw these two pairs of trowsers and two waistcoats, found on Davis—they were safe the night before—they have the tickets on them, which are always taken off when they are sold—they are my master's.

Cross-examined by
MR. PAYNE. Q. How far off were you looking? A. About twenty yards—I am not in partnership with Mr. Miers.





HENRY TURPIN
 (police-constable G 119.) I took Davis, and these things were found in his pockets—Nathan took Mills—I asked Davis what he had got—he said, "Nothing."





JOHN SAYERS
 (police-constable N 235.) I produce a certificate of Mills's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person.

(Davis received a good character.)

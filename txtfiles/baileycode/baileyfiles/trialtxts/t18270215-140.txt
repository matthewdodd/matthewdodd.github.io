HENRY HENRICHSON. I am clerk
 to a sugar-refiner. On the 23d of January, I lost a cloak out of the warehouse- a pane of glass was broken in the window, to admit a boy through, between the Sunday and Monday morning.

            . I keep a marine-store shop. - The prisoner offered me a cloak for sale - I think it was on the 29th of January, not on the 23d; I said I did not understand its value, but I would take it to Mr. Marshall, who lives near me, to see what it was worth - he was not at home, but his wife took it in. The cloak remained at Marshall's, and the prisoner was to call again.

                  MARSHALL
               



            . I live next door to Mrs. Berry, and my husband is a broker; Berry brought a cloak to our house between nine and ten o'clock in the morning, for my husband to value it - it remained there.

            . I am Elizabeth Marshall's husband. I have had the cloak in my possession ever since.(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. On Tuesday morning I met a chap, who asked me to take it for him; I went to this shop, and left it - I did not go again for the money.

            . I am a sailor
. I live on board the Tobago. I was on shore; I saw the prisoner go on board a ship. I went directly after him. I found him on the forecastle; there was nobody there but the prisoner. He was cutting down a hammock. He cut down the hammock, and took it on his arm. He took a pair of trowsers, and a pair of boots; he tied up the trowsers and the boots in the hammock. I asked him what he was going to do with the things. He said he came from another ship. I said, no, you came from the Tobago. He said, pray forgive me, I will never do so again. I gave him into the constable's charge. I produce the things; they have been in my possession ever since. They are mine.
The prisoner said nothing in his defence, nor called any witnesses to his character.

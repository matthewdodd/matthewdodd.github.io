            . On the 21st of July, I lost a wooden handspike and copper kettle out of a ship at the Hermitage, they were the property of Mr. Limeburner who lives at Hull in Yorkshire. I don't know who took them; they were found at Union-stairs, and I was sent for.

            . On the 21st of July, between two and three in the morning, I had occasion to be at Union-Stairs with another man; we heard a snoaring, and thought it was somebody in the mud; we followed the sound, and found the prisoner asleep and the kettle by him; we asked him where he had it from; he said, out of a ship at Bishop's-chain


, and said, he would take us to the ship; we went with him, but the ship was not there, and giving no account of himself, we delivered him over to the constable:
The prisoner said nothing in his defence.

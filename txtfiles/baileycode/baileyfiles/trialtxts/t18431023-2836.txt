MARY CONNER
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
21st of Oct., 7 plates, value 2s., the goods of 



Mary Titensor; and that she had been before convicted of felony.






HENRY GODDARD
. I an shopman to Mary Titensor, who keeps a chinashop in Drury-lane. Last Saturday evening, about half-past eight o'clock, the prisoner came to the door and asked to look at a pudding-basin—I showed her three—she said they were not large enough—I went to the back of the shop to get another, and on returning missed her from the door—I went to the door, and met her at the door—I asked where she bad been—she said, to tie up her garter—I missed seven plates from a pile that stood at the door—I asked her to let me look in a basket which she had with her—she said she would not, and went away—I followed her—she went across the road—I ran after her, met Reed, and gave her in charge—she had the basket concealed behind her under her cloak—the policeman found the plates in it.





MICIAH REED
 (police-constable E 30.) I took the prisoner into custody, and found the plates in the basket—she said, "God knows I did take the plates, and it is no use for me to deny the truth; but it is the first time I took any thing, and it was distress that drove me to it."

Prisoner. I was very much distressed, having seven children and no victuals to eat; and my husband is in the hospital, having broken his leg and four of his ribs by falling off a tree.





GEORGE JOHN RESTIEAUX
 (police-constable E 49.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction—(read)—I was present at her trial, in the name of Mary Pantomy—she is the same person who was convicted—there is no truth in her statement.




GUILTY
.* Aged 40.—


Transported for Ten Years.


Fourth Jury, before Mr. Common Sergeant.

JOSEPH SPELLER
. I am a pewterer. On the 10th of May, between eleven and twelve o'clock at night, I was with my wife in Featherstone-street, St. Luke's—I had a watch, a seal, and key in my pocket—we had come from my brother's—I was perfectly sober—the prisoner came across the road from James-street—I turned and looked at him, it being moon-light—he snatched my watch, and ran away—I quitted my wife and ran after, him, crying, "Stop thief"—he got into the City-road—I never lost sight of him—the witness caught him in my presence—I was close to him—I said, "That is the fellow that has got my watch"—the policeman came up and collared him—the prisoner shoved the watch towards me; but whether he intended to throw it on the ground, or to give it me, I cannot tell—I gave it to the officer, this is it—there was no one but the prisoner that I could see.





ELIZABETH SPELLER
. I was walking arm-in-arm with my husband—the prisoner came across the street, and snatched his watch—he ran away, and was taken in the City-road—I never lost sight of him—I saw the watch in his hand.





JOHN BIRCH
. I was in the City-road; I heard the alarm, and saw the prisoner run from Featherstone-street towards Tabernacle-walk—I stopped him—I saw the watch in his hand.

Prisoner. I delivered the wateb up directly—it was given to me by a young man, and then this person seized me—I gave it to the prosecutor.

(Richard Bax, of No. 4, Peter-street, the prisoner's master, gave him a good character.)




GUILTY
. Aged 21—


Transported for Seven Years.

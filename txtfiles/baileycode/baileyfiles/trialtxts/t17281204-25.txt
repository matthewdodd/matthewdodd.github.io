            , of St. Martin's in the Fields


, was indicted for 


               privately stealing 15 Yards of Lace, out of the Shop of 
                     
                        
                           Mary

, on the 19th of October
 last. It appear'd, That the Prisoner came to the Prosecutor's Shop, under the Pretence of wanting some Edging but she not being a ready Money Customer, and they not knowing her, she could not expect Credit, yet willing to be a Dealer in her own Way, she artificially palm'd a Piece of Lace upon a Card, but conveying it into her Bosom, she was seen by a Lad next Door, who pursu'd, and took her with the Lace in her Bosom. She pretended in her Defence, That it dropp'd into her Bosom by Accident, and she was coming back with it, when she was apprehended: but as one Part of her Defence was impossible, the Card lying on the Counter, so the other was very improbable, she being hurrying on a contrary Way from the Shop, out of which she took it, the Jury found her 


               Guilty to the Value of 10 d.

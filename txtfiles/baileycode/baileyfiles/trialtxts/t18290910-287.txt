            : he has a milliner's shop
 in Cheapside


. The prisoner came there, and asked to look at some ribbons, at half-past five o'clock, on the 22nd of August; I shewed her some - she staid above five minutes; she did not buy any, but was going away - I saw something under her shawl, turned it back, and saw this ribbon, which I took from her; it was one of the pieces I had shown her - she said she had not taken it.
Prisoner. Q. Did I turn from the counter? A. You went a little way from the counter - I do not think you turned your back.
Prisoner. I stood at the counter, and you accused me of stealing it; I looked, and it was on the counter, under my shawl. Witness. She was about half a yard from the counter - I saw something project under her shawl, turned back her shawl, and took it.

Prisoner's Defence. I went to see if they could match the ribbon I had, but they had none - I deferred having any.(Property produced and sworn to.)

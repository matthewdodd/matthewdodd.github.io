On the 20th of last April, I gave the prisoner 11 firkins of butter to carry to Mr. Fry's; there were two half firkins missing, when he came there; after he was taken up, and charged with taking them, he at first denied it, but at last acknowledged, and said, he would pay Mr. Fry 2 s. a week, till he had paid the value of them.

The prosecutor gave the same account as on the trial of Steers, and Stevens, see No. 19 and 20 in this mayoralty; and also on the trial of Brinklow, No. 289 in the last sessions paper, to which our readers are referred.


                  John 
                  Wilks 
               



            , who keeps the Cock, in Aldersgate-street, deposed, that he had seen the two prisoners at the bar come after Fuller, the evidence, to his house very frequently, at different times of the day.


                  Richard 
                  Fuller 
               



             gave the same account he did on the trial of Brinklow before mentioned.

            , deposed, that Fuller made a voluntary confession of this robbery before Sir John, when he was taken up, the same as he said in court.
Cole's Defence.
When I come to town I used to put up in Tyburn-road, I have been at Mr. Wilks's once or twice, there I may have seen this other prisoner, as I might see another man, I never had any connections with him in my life.
Clark's Defence.
I know nothing of the evidence, Fuller, nor do I remember I was ever in the house he speaks of in my life.

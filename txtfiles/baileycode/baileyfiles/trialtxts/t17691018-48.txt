            . I am a gardiner
. I lodge in Cock-court, near Carnaby market. On Tuesday night last I was a good deal in liquor. I went into a house with the woman at the bar, and lay down on a bed. It was near the sign of the Boot, by Long-acre.
Q. Where did you meet with her?
Anderson. I met her on the top of Holborn, near St. Giles's. I awaked near two or three o'clock, and found myself alone. She was gone, and my watch was gone; likewise about six shillings in silver was gone. There had been none but the prisoner with me.
Q. Where had you put your watch?
Anderson. I was not undressed. My watch was in my fob.
Q. Are you sure you had it when you was in the room?
Anderson. I am sure I had. It was a silver watch.
Q. Did you ever find it again?
Anderson. No, I never did.
Eliz. Owen. I live in St. Giles's.
Q. What way of life are you in?
E. Owen. I get my bread as well as I can, in the same way as the prisoner does. On last Tuesday morning I was by the Pilgrim alehouse, in Holborn. The prisoner had a watch; it seemed to me to be a silver one. She shewed it me. I asked her where she had it. She said she had it of a young man.
Q. Did she say what young man?
E. Owen. No, she did not. Her husband bid her let the right owner have it again. I never saw it after that time.

            . I was at a public house last Wednesday morning. E. Owen came and told me, a man was robbed of a watch. I asked what man. She said she did not know. I said, Who has got the watch? she said, Pat Bourn, that is, the prisoner. She lives with a man named Burnet. I went and found her, and asked her about it. She acknowledged she took a watch from a man, and delivered it to Burnet, and he returned it to her again, and would have nothing to do with it. She owned before Justice Welch she had it of the prosecutor. She told me before that, she sat down in the street, and while she was sleeping, somebody picked her pocket of it.
Prisoner's Defence.
Last Tuesday night, as I was going to St. Giles's, I met this man; he asked me to take part of a pint of purl. I went with him. We had two pints and some gin together. He asked me where I lived. I went with him to Cross-lane. We sat down upon a bed. I asked him for a present. He said he had but sixpence. Then he said, To make me satisfaction, I might keep the watch for a security. I said, I had rather you would leave it at a pawnbroker's. He said, My dear, I think it is as safe in your hand as in a pawnbroker's. After that he went away. I went out and fell asleep, and lost the watch out of my pocket. Somebody stole it from me.

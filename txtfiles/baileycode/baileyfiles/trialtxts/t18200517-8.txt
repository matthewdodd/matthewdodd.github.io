            . I am housekeeper to the Bishop of St. Asaph; he lives in Gloucester-place, Portman-square

            . I am a painter and glazier. On the 2d of May, about twelve o'clock, I was at work opposite the Bishop of St. Asaph's, and saw the prisoners, with another, looking down several areas - at last Shaw stopped by the Bishop's area-gate; he nudged Crouch, who went down the area, and came up with the table-cloth under his arm, folded up. Shaw held his coat open; and Crouch put the table-cloth under his coat, crossed over, and ran away. I pursued and overtook him, without losing sight of him. He said I was mistaken - I said
"No, I am not." I took the table-cloth from under his coat, and took him back to the Bishop's.

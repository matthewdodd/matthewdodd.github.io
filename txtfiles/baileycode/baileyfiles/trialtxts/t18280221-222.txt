REV. JOHN SHORT HEWITT, D. D. On the 19th of January, I was in Greek-street


; a man touched me on the shoulder, and said I had been robbed - I felt, and my handkerchief was gone - I described it, and gave my card, and in about three quarters of an hour, a man came to my hotel, and said the men were in custody - I found the prisoners at Marlborough-street office with it.

            . I am an officer. About eleven o'clock, on the 19th of January, I watched the prisoners from Soho-square to Greek-street. I there saw Burns take a handkerchief from Dr. Hewitt's pocket, and run up Rose-street - I went and got the prosecutor's card; then went and took Jones at the corner of Rose-street; I waited there till Boston came back with Burns; they were close together when the handkerchief was taken - I knew Jones before; but never heard any thing against him.
JOHN BOSTON. I was with Betraun, and saw Morris take the handkerchief; I pursued, and took it from his coat pocket.(Property produced and sworn to.)
BURN'S Defence. I saw nothing of Jones, except at the watch-house.
JONES' Defence. I know nothing of the other prisoner.

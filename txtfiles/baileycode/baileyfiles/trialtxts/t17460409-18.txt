Swannick. Please you my Lord. Mr. O Marsh and Mrs. O Marsh sent their two sons two or three Morning.
Q. When was this; about how long ago?
Swannick. Very nigh two Months ago, since they sent them to 
               
                  John 
                  Fall

Q. What Time of the Day was it they sent them?
Swannick. Between Six and Seven o'Clock in the Morning; the first Time.
Q. Did you go with them?
Swannick. I liv'd at 
               
                  John 
                  Fall 
               



            's.
Court. You said you lodg'd at O Marsh's

Swannick. So I did; but when I got into Place at Fall's, they sent their two Some of a Morning.
Q. Was you present when they sent them?
Swannick. I was at my Master's Son's.
Court. The Man and Woman were at home: How can you say they sent them?
Swannick. I went over-night, and Mrs. O Marsh came to the Door, and told me they had got 9 d. upon the Apron in pawn.
Court. Then they came to your Master's in the Morning.
Swannick. Yes. The first Time they came I gave them an Apron.
Court. You gave the two Boys an Apron?
Swannick. Yes, Sir. It was an Apron my Master took in for Money.
Q. You gave them that Apron; they carried it away; What then?
Swannick. I went the Night following, and they said they had 9 d. upon the Apron, in pawn.
Q. What have you to say more how you came to give them this Apron?
Swannick. The Boy told me his Mother was in want: When I went first into the Place, that Woman ask'd me if I could get any Thing of my Master to make her amends for lying in their House, &c.
Q. Then old O Marsh, the Man, knew nothing of that?
Swannick. No, my Lord: Two Days following the two Boys came again, and I gave them a Towel and two Clouts; then they came about Twelve o'Clock the next Day and I got a Guinea of my Master's Money.
Q. How came you by that?
Swannick. I got the Key of my Master's Drawers; I knew where he put them: I had a Shilling in Silver, and I and 
               
                  Robert 
                  O Marsh 
               



             went out to drinking; and when we came home we were fuddled, and Mrs. O Marsh took the Guinea out of my Pocket and bought a Fillet of Veal; so they spent very near 10 s. that Night; in two Days time the other was spent; and so, Sir, Mrs. O Marsh went to my Master and desir'd him to pay me what small Wages he ow'd me, and said I was a poor Boy and almost starv'd; so my Master, took me again; so when I went again to my Master she said I should rob my Master again, and that I should rob him of 3 or 4 Guineas. And Please you, my Lord, there was some Tripe which I stole, and 
               
                  Mrs, O


             Marsh dress'd it when she knew it was stole.

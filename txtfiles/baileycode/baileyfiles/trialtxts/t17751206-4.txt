GANETT ATKINSON. Are you the wife of 
               
                  
                     Robert

             the prosecutor? - Yes.
What do you know of your house being broke open? - I left the house about six in the evening, and left no body in the house: my husband was not at home; I returned between eight and nine o'clock, and found the outer door, and another door, part of which is glass, both laid open: when I went out they were both shut and fastened: I was much surprised when I saw them open, and would not go in till I had called all my neighbours. I found when I went in that the chest, full of my wearing apparel, was gone; which contained a black negligee, blue paduasoy nightgown, pompadour silk gown, white lutestring gown and coat, a white muslin night gown, two sets of car-rings, one of paste, the other garnets; a cotton counterpane; these were all in the chest: I saw it that night before I went out, and every thing in it.
Did you find any of your goods again? - On Sunday the 4th of November one Mr. Jones told me I must go to a justice Durden: I went, where I saw the prisoners and some of the goods. The justice ordered me to come next day at ten o'clock: some of my goods were brought in a bag when I was at the justice's. (The goods produced.)
Prosecutrix deposed they were part of the goods taken out of her house the night the robbery was committed.
What do you know against the prisoners? - They broke my house open.
How do you know that? - I am very sure, for they threatened to do it before.
Are you acquainted with the prisoners? - No: they broke my window, and before that threatened to break open the house.

             desired to ask the witness if ever she saw him near her house in her life? - She said she had.
Prisoner Langford asked if she could swear that he broke her window? - She said I can.

            . About eight o'clock, on a Saturday night, about a month ago, the prisoners at the bar brought me those goods now produced: I gave them a guinea for these gowns and petticoat.
Did you ask how they came by them? - No: I took the goods to a neighbour's house that night.
Are you sure the prisoners brought those things? - Yes; I have seen them many times before; I had a light in the house: there was another young woman with me.
Cross Examination.
What business do you follow? - No business: I once kept a chandler's shop in Peter-street, Westminster, but broke: I keep none now.
Where do you live? - New Way, Westminster,
The prisoners asked, why she did not take them to the justice at first? - When the justice sent for me on a Sunday, I went, and carried those things with me.
Court. You don't know how the justice came to know of your having the goods? - I know nothing of that,

            . I live in Petty France, Westminster. On a Sunday afternoon the prosecutrix came to my house, told me her house had been broke open and robbed. I went and found the middle of the door, the glass-door and lock, and hinges, were broke. I heard the chest was found in a hog well: I found it empty, only some rags and papers in it. It had been dragged along the ground, by which we traced it to a public-house in Tothill Fields, where we found the three prisoners, and apprehended them. They all confessed: they said they sold the things to Mrs. Ross in the New Way. They likewise owned it before t he justice. I went down with another officer, and took Mrs. Ross to the justice. She denied it at first; she sent her servant with me to a house, six or seven doors from her own, where the goods were; they were in a coarse bag. These are the goods now produced.
One of the prisoners asked if the witness could swear that they confessed before the justice? - She said, upon my oath, they did.

            . Mr. Jones and I took the prisoners. They acknowledged the fact before the justice. The one said to the other, if you will not turn evidence, I will: when Mrs. Ross came, the justice admitted her as an evidence.

The prosecutrix was asked, if her husband lived with her? - Who said, he did not.

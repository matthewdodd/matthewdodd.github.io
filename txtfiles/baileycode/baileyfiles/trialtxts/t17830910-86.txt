               feloniously stealing on the 21st day of August
 last, one tortoise-shell snuff-box, value 5 d.
             the property of

             sworn.
I was at the bank the 21st of August, between twelve and one o'clock, and one of the witnesses held up this snuff-box, and asked who owned it, I said, it was mine, and he gave it me.

I took the snuff-box off the ground, I did not see it drop.

             sworn.
On the 21st of August, a broker in the bank came and said several of them had lost their handkerchiefs, and seemed to cast his eye on the prisoner; Mr. Stow came forward and owned the box: I saw the box fall from the prisoner's hand, which Mr. Stow owned; that very box.

             sworn.
On the 21st of August, I was standing in the market-place of the bank, and the prisoner was seized, and I immediately looked and saw him drop a snuff box: It had the appearance of this box, but I am not sure to the box; it was the box that Mr. Faircloth picked up.
PRISONER's DEFENCE.
I was taken prisoner in the bank, and was kicked and abused there, I have no witnesses, I do not know any of them, and therefore I cannot call them to witness; I worked for a nursery-man at Barnet.

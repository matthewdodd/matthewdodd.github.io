WILLIAM LANGTON
. I am a gentleman. On the 24th of June I was near Temple-bar, and felt something twitch my pocket—I turned—no one was near me behind—I looked in front, and saw the prisoner a few yards off, with his two hands behind him, under his coat—I took him, and found my handkerchief in his hand—I gave him to the first policeman.

Prisoner I picked it up against a pastry-cook's shop, and having no place to go to I kept it. Witness. I had not used it from the time I left the Castle and Falcon till I took it out of his hand.




GUILTY
* Aged 17.—


Transported for Seven Years.

ALFRED HERRING
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the
 22nd of Aug., 1 pair of boots, value 3s. 6d.; the goods of 



John Gould; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






JOHN GOULD, JUN
. I live with my father, John Gould, in Leader-street, Chelsea. From information I received on the 22nd of Aug., I ran after the prisoner—I caught him—some boots were produced, which were my father's, and bad been hanging inside the door-post—I had seen them safe a quarter of an hour before.





ROBERT TAYLOR
. About four o'clock, on the 22nd of Aug., I was standing at my door opposite the prosecutor's—I saw the prisoner and another one together, leaning on the frame of the window—the prisoner went away—the other one beckoned to him—he went and took the boots down from a nail—they both ran away—I cried, "Stop thief."

Prisoner. Q. Did not the other take them down? A. No; I spoke to my wife before I hallooed, "Stop thief."





JOSEPH JAMES
. I live in Benson-terrace, Chelsea—I saw the prisoner chuck these boots over the wall—they were picked up and given to me and the constable—the prosecutor identified them.

Prisoner. Q. Where were you when I threw them over? A. Standing by Mr. Gould's door—the garden is in the same street where I was standing—he threw them as he turned the corner—I have never been convicted of felony—I never was in the court before, or in prison.


Prisoner. I was in prison at the same time as James; he is as likely to take a pair of boots as I am.





EDWARD THORN
. I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(ready)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 22.—


Transported for Ten Years.

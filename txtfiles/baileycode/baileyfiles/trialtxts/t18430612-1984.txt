 and 



ELIZABETH CROSBY
 were indicted for

 stealing, on the 
29th of May, 5 1/2 yards of printed cotton, value 1s. 10d., the goods of 



Thomas Read; and that Sidnell had been before convicted of felony.






EDWIN ASH
. I am assistant to Thomas Read, a linen-draper, in Sidney-place, Commercial-road. About six o'clock, on the 29th of May, the prisoners came outside the shop window to look at the goods—Sidnell took this piece of blue print, and put it under her shawl, and went out—she had gone as far as the next window—a boy then stopped her—Crosby stood by her while she took it, and left—the boy took the print from Sidnell—I gave her in charge—I had seen the prisoners talking together.





JAMES PARSONS
 (police-constable K 179.) I took the prisoners, and produce the print.





WILLIAM DAVISON DAY
 (police-constable K 74.) I apprehended Crosby—she said she went out with Sidnell, but she did not know what Sidnell had done.

Sidnell's Defence. I purchased the cotton of Mr. Read.





GEORGE TEAKLE
 (police-sergeant H 8.) I produce a certificate of Sidnell's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—she is the person.

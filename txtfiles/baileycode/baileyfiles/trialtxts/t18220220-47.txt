            . I am a hatter
, and live in West Smithfield


. On the 6th of February, my hat was in the shop - I missed it between six and seven o'clock in the evening; one of the prisoners were brought back with it.
FRANCIS KEYS. I am a constable. On the 6th of February, I was in Smithfield, and saw the prisoner walk backwards and forwards by the prosecutor's shop; I saw him pass the door - Reeves put his hand inside the door, and took the hat out, and gave it to Woolf, who had a cap on, which he took off, and on putting it into the hat, put it on his head, when I siezed him with it on his head, Reeves ran off, and the next day, as I was taking Woolf to the Compter, I saw Reeves opposite the Compter - I took him; I knew him before, and am sure of him.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
REEVES'S Defence. I am not the person.
WOOLF'S Defence. I never had it.

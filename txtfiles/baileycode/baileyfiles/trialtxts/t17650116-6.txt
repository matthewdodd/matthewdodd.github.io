            . I live at Islington. I lost a coat on Christmas-day at night, and found it again at Mr. Crow's, in Rosemary lane. I found it by the prisoner's confession before Justice Palmer.
Wilkinson Barnwell. I am a constable I had the prisoner in charge: he owned he came from Petticoat-lane, about eleven o'clock at night, and took this coat out of the stable, at Islington, and went and sold it to Mr. Crow, where it was found.

            . I bought this coat of the prisoner at the bar, on the 26th of December. (Produced and deposed to).
The prisoner said nothing in his defence.

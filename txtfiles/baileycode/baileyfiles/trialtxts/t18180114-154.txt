JOHN GLANSFIELD. I live at Weldhill, Herts. On the 27th of December my father's stable was broken open, and the bridle taken away. I locked it at ten o'clock at night, and found it broken open at six the next morning. I saw the bridle again at Bow-street, where the prisoner was taken. He lived about a mile from me.

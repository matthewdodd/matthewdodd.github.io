                  Burchel 
               



            . I live in the parish of St. George, Hanover-Square



, and am a house-keeper; on> the 10th of July my house was broke open, and I lost a copper-pot, val. 7 s. and a tea-kettle, val. 3 s.
Q. What time did you go to bed over night?
Burchel. I went to bed between ten and eleven.
Q. Was all fast then?
Burchel. All was fast; but when I got up in the morning about five I found my door open.
Q. How was that fastened ?
Burchel. It was not lock'd, but fastened with a string twisted round a nail.
Q. Why do you charge the prisoner ?
Burchel. He was taken up by a watchman, on suspicion of robbing another house, and to the constable and the watchman he had confessed the robbing of mine; so they brought him to me, and he told me before them, that he and two others had got over the wall into my garden, that they found the door only fastened with a string, which they cut with a knife.
Q. Did you observe the string to have been cut?
Burchel. It was cut; he said they took the copper pot and tea kettle from out of the places where they had stood, describing the places.
Q. Did he say what time of the night it was when they got in?
Burchel. He did, he said it was between three and four in the morning; he told us likewise he had carried the things to 
               
                  Ann 
                  Dust 
               



            , the other prisoner, and that she had carried them to one 
               
                  Mary 
                  Goddard 
               



            , and sold them. We took a search warrant, and search'd 
               
                  Mary 
                  Goddard 
               



            's house, we did not find them there, but the next day we found them at another pawnbroker's, where 
               
                  Mary 
                  Goddard 
               



             had pawned them. Then we took up Ann Dust.
Q. Did she confess any thing ?
Burchel. She owned she carried them and sold them to 
               
                  Mary 
                  Goddard 
               



            , but she knew nothing where they were.
Q. Did she say she knew them to have been stolen ?
Burchel. No, my lord, she did not.

            . I am constable, this man was taken up as a disorderly fellow, and committed to Bridewell: As we were going along he confessed to me that he, and two others, that morning had entered two houses in that neighbourhood. I asked him to go and shew me the places ; he went with me, and shewed me at the prosecutor's, how he got over the wall; he also mentioned their taking the copper pot and tea kettle, and a saucepan which we did not find.
Prosecutor. I lost a sauce pan at the same time I lost the other things, but as we did not find it, so I did not lay it in the indictment.
Elkins. Then the prisoner went and shewed us the other house they broke into.

Q. What do you know of 
               
                  Ann 
                  Dust 
               



            ?
Elkins. I took her up upon his mentioning that she said the thing for him; she confessed she sold the pot to Mrs Goddard for four shillings; we went and search'd Goddard's house, but could not find any of the things; and Goddard denied she had any such thing; but we found the next day that she went and pawned them to Mr. Gunston herself; she is now upon bail.
Q. Did Ann Dust say she knew the goods to have been stolen?
Elkins. No, she did not.
The prisoners had nothing to say in their defence.

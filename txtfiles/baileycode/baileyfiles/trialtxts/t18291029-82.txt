            . I am the son of Christopher Buckland, a cabinet-maker
, of Circus-street, New-road


. On the 16th of October this tea-urn was on a box near the door for sale; Mr. Clarkson came and told us it was taken - I looked and missed it; I had seen it safe half an hour before - I ran out, and saw the prisoner walking away with something under his coat; when I came up he held it out to me, and said, "Take it, take it."

            . I live opposite the prosecutor - I saw the prisoner looking at the goods exposed for sale; he then looked at the goods inside - in a moment or so he withdrew, and lifted up an apron which he had on, covered something with it, and went into the New-road; I pursued, and saw him stopped, and he gave up the urn.

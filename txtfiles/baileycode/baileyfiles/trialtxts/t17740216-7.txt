                  Jane
                   Tate
               



            . Cavernor Tate is my husband: our house was broke open about eight o'clock at night, on the 19th of January: my husband is a sea-faring-man
; our house is in the Coal Yard, St . George's


; I fastened my door and window about six o'clock; when I went out to a neighbour's I left no one in the house; I came home between seven and eight o'clock; I found my door open, which very much alarmed me, and looked up at the chamber window, and saw there was a light in the room; upon which I cried out, and before any body came to my assistance, they made their escape out of my garret window into the next garret window. 
               
                  Isaac
                   Wood
               



             went into the next house, and took the prisoners. 
               
                  Mary
                   Lewis
               



             was taken under a bed in the garret.
Q. Is the next house an empty house?
Tate. No; it is the house of 
               
                  Elizabeth
                   Stanford
               



            's father. There were three concerned; the other made her escape. My property was packed under Mrs. Stanford's bed, in the chamber. I found all my things there that were taken as contained in the indictment (repeating them).
Q. Were all these things left by you in the house when you went out?
Tate. They were.


                  Isaac
                   Wood
               



            . Coming home from my work in the evening of the 19th of January, I heard Mrs. Tate cry out.
Q. What time of night was it?
Wood. The moon shone; I do not know the time exactly. I ran up stairs in her house; I could find nobody there; when I came down stairs again we saw the shadow of some woman going over the tiles from one house to the other; I went into the house which was Stanford's; I ran up into the garret; we saw two upon the tiles; at first I saw 
               
                  Elizabeth
                   Stanford
               



             stand trembling in the garret; I said, Bet, sure you have not robbed the house, you are not a thief; she said the thieves were gone by her house, and had broke her window, which had frightened her; I took her along with me, and went into the next room; there was the girl that is turned evidence. I asked 
               
                  Bet
                   Stanford
               



             whether she knew the girl; at first she said she knew nothing of her; afterwards she said she was her cousin. I went up into the garret again, and there I found 
               
                  Mary
                   Lewis
               



             with a feather-bed drawn over her. The constable was at the house at that time; he took them in custody, and they confessed the fact. I was in the room when these things were taken from under the bed: Hartly, that is admitted an evidence, was in the room where these things were. Stanford's father and mother are esteemed very honest people.
- Hartly. 
               
                  Elizabeth
                   Stanford
               



             came to me the day before, the Wednesday, I do not know the day of the month, and asked me to drink tea with her; I went; after we had drank tea she asked me to lend her the key of my street door.
Q. Where do you live?
Wood. In Cloth Fair. She said she would be in again in a quarter of an hour; she came back in about that time, and she brought in her apron a tea chest and cannisters, and a tablecloth.
Q. Do you know which way she came again into her own house?
Wood. No.
Q. Was this the night that Mr. Tate's house was robbed?
Wood. Yes.
Q. Did she say where she had the things from?
Wood. No. 
               
                  Mary
                   Lewis
               



             was with her when she went out; they went out together; Stanford came in again three or four minutes before Lewis; she did not bring any thing with her. Just after they came in, I heard the alarm; I do not know where the things were hid; I was not in the room. On her cross examination she said she was in the room when Stanford came back; that it was a one pair of stairs room; that Stanford was gone about a quarter of an hour, and that she never knew any harm of her before.


                  George
                   Elliot
               



            . I am a constable: I took up the women on Wednesday the 19th of January, at nine o'clock at night. I was sent for and informed there was a house broke open; I went, and found a great many people in the house, and the prisoner Lewis sitting on a bed; I was informed they had robbed the next house. I asked them if they had searched them; they said they had not; I saw Lewis had a small key in her hand; she got up; I searched her, but found nothing upon her of any consequence; she sat down again on the bed; I asked her what was become of the key she had in her hand; she said she had none; I made her get up and found it on the bed (producing it.)
- Tate. It is the key of my husband's case which he had on board of ship; it was in my room.
The prisoners, in their defence, said they knew nothing at all of it.
Stanford called six witnesses who had known her a great many years, and gave her a good character.




               Both guilty of stealing the goods, but not guilty of breaking and entering the dwelling house

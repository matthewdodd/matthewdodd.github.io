THOMAS JAMES BARRETT
. I am a shoemaker. On the 20th of February, I was in Shoreditch, and saw the prisoner and another in company—I watched them for some time, and saw the other, who was taller than the prisoner, take a handkerchief out of a gentleman's pocket—the prisoner was close to him at the time—I had seen them in company together, and

they had been following the gentleman—the other man put the handkerchief behind him, and the prisoner took it—I went and told the gentleman—he sung out "Stop thief"—the prisoner and the other ran—I followed the prisoner until he came to Cock-lane—the policeman was there, and I pointed him out—I still followed until he fell down, and dropped the handkerchief—I do not know who the gentleman was—I went back to the place, and he was gone.





THOMAS BURCHAM
, (police-constable H 33.) I saw the prisoner and another running up Church-street—the witness said, "Stop the short one, he has got the handkerchief"—the prisoner then took this handkerchief out of his pocket, and carried it in his hand—he ran on until something, caught his toe, and he fell—he was then taken—he dropped this handkerchief.




GUILTY

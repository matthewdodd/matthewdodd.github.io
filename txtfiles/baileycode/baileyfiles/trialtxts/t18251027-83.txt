MATTHEW WILSON. I was on Dowgate-hill


 a little before five o'clock on the 28th of September; I felt a pull at my coat-pocket, and turned round; I saw the prisoner and another person - each of them had hold of my silk handkerchief; I collared them both, but being very weak, I let the other go, and kept the prisoner.
Prisoner. Q. Was not I on before you about ten yards? A. No. you was behind me.
Q. Did not I ask you why you let the other man go, and you said, as I was the least, you would pummel me to the ground? A. No.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

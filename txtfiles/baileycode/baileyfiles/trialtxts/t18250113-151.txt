                  MARCH
               



            . JUN. I am a fishing-tackle maker, and live in Fleet-street. On Sunday evening, the 9th of January, I was in Salisbury-court


, and saw the prisoner cross the road and follow three gentlemen; he put his hand into one of the gentlemen's pockets, took out a handkerchief, and put it into his trowsers. I seized him, he threw it from his trowsers, knocked me down with a violent blow in the breast, and got away. I described him to the street-keeper, and am confident he is the man. I knew him before by having seen him attempt gentlemen's pockets - the gentleman got away in the crowd.

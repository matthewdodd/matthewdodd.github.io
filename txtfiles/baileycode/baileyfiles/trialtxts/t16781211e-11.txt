            , who said she had it from the Prisoner Leake, and other parts of it were found at the Dyers. He knew it to be his Cloth, and it was of a Popinjay Green Colour.
Susan Reynolds attested that he brought the Cloth to her, and desired her to lay it up for him till he called for it. That she knew him, because he had been with her Brother six or seven times at her house. That he told her he took up the Cloth to carry to Sea with him, and he found it on Good-mans Fields, he desired her to lay up part, which was found in her house, and to carry part of it for him to the Dyers.
The Prisoner, who was a Lusty Fellow and an able Seaman
, said nothing, but that he found it, and being asked why he did not Cry it, 
he said he did not understand the way of it, but could give no Evidence that he found it. Therefore it was left to the Jury.
That John Leak is 

               guilty
             of stealing the Cloth off the Tenters.

JOHN WILLIAMS

8th of June, 1 handkerchief, value 1s. 6d., the goods of a man unknown, from his person.






JAMES BROOK
(police-constable L118.) On the 8th of June I was at Greenwich fair, in plain clothes—I saw the prisoner take this handkerchief, which I now produce, from a gentleman's pocket, about seven o'clock in the evening—I laid hold of him with the handkerchief—he made great resistance, and we both fell to the ground—on getting up I saw the handkerchief under him—I do not know the name of the gentleman—while the prisoner was struggling he got away.

Prisoner. You know there was a great crowd there. Witness. Yes, there was—you made great resistance—you took the handkerchief with your right hand—you said, "Let me go, it is all fair in fair time."





MATTHEW COOKE.
I am a policeman. I was at Greenwich fair, in plain clothes—I was opposite Clark's booth—I saw my brother officer seize the prisoner—they fell to the ground, and as they fell I saw the handkerchief in the prisoner's hand—when we got him up he had it under him—he struggled very violently, and was almost more than we could manage—he would not go any further without water—we got him nearly a quart, which he drank—he then got, on further, and would have some more—we could scarcely get him to the station-house—he said, "Let me go this time, I will never do it again"—afterwards he said, "Let me go, it is all fair in fair time."

Prisoner's Defence. I asked the officer several times what he took me for; he refused to tell me; he said, "I will tell you by and by." I had been fighting, and I thought it was some of those persons had come to seize me; the handkerchief was my own; I was wiping my nose with it. I could bring parties to prove that they have washed it and that I took it out of pawn, if I had time.

THOMAS LARKE. I live in Union-place. On the 14th of July, between eleven and twelve o'clock at night, I was going home with Thomas Dean, my landlord - the prisoner ran up against me, and said, "I beg your pardon, Sir;" and as he said that, he drew my watch out of my pocket. I caught it with my left hand, and caught him with my right hand.

            . I was with Larke; his account is correct; I was about six feet before him; he called me; I turned, and saw the prisoner in his hands; he gave me the watch; I took it to the office - Larke was sober.
Prisoner's Defence. I was going along - this gentleman was in a mob, and seemed in liquor; he took me, and said I had robbed him; he took the watch from his pocket, and gave it to the other witness.

            , in Red Lion Street



, facing Chapel Street. On the 1st of August, between four and five in the afternoon, I saw the clock on the table in the parlour. I fastened the door and went out, and left no body in the house, and came home about a quarter before nine: then I found the window of the parlour up, which I had left down. I got a light, and looked round and missed the clock; likewise, from out of my work basket, two pair of ruffles, and a gauze apron, and several other things in it of mine. The clock was brought home again the next day in the afternoon.

            . I went out with my fellow-servant between four and five. We had fastened all the back windows, and thought there would be no danger of the fore-room windows. When we came home, which was about a quarter before nine, I immediately lighted a candle, and found the window up. We missed the clock; likewise the ruffles and gauze of

            , and I, went out that day, the first of August. We had been in the country, and came home by Red Lion-street; Stapleton got over the iron rails, lifted up the sash, went in, and handed to me a basket of gauze and lace, and came over the rails again. Then David Price went over, and Stapleton followed him: they both went in at the window, and looked about a great while. They found a clock, and Stapleton handed it out to me over the rails. I took and carried it home: they all came with me. Then I gave Stapleton a halfpenny to buy a candle: we then went up stairs and looked at the clock. We sent Stapleton for Dailey; this was in a lodging in Dailey's house; Caton and Stapleton rent the room: Dailey came up and looked at it a great while: he said he had a clock of his own, and he did not chuse to buy it; but he would think of it by the morning. I told him it would not do to keep it in our lodging, for the chimes would strike, and we should be found out; he told me I might take it to his dwelling-house. I took it under my coat, and carried it to his house, which was but the next door; I carried it up stairs, and left it in a fore-room. We were taken up that night, about twelve o'clock, as disorderly persons: I and Stapleton got clear of that, and about twelve the next day, Dailey went and discovered the clock to the gentleman, as he found Caton could not get off. (The clock produced in Court, and deposed to by the servant maids, as their master's property.) I was taken up again between twelve and one, at the Running-horse, at the corner of Bambury-street, St. Giles's.
Q. How old are you?
M'Mahon. I am eighteen years of age.
Q. How long have you known the prisoners?
M'Mahon. I have known Caton and Stapleton a good while, and Price also, but never had much acquaintance with them.
Q. from Price. Where did you find me that day?
M'Mahon. I met with him at the corner of Red Lion-street, leaning over a post, between eight and nine in the evening: he was not in the country with us.
Price. I was at the corner of Red Lion passage.

            . I am a constable. It being a search night we went into Dailey's rents, and took M'Mahon, Price, and Caton: Stapleton got out at a window, and ran away. We searched the rooms in the house, it is a lodging house, but found nothing. The next day we took them before the Justices; M'Mahon was cleared: after he was gone, Dailey came and told me he had got some things in his house that he believed were stolen. I went and told the Justices of it, and went to Dailey's house, and there was the clock. Then we went and took M'Mahon again, and brought him and the clock before the Justices. He told us whose clock it was. Then he and the others informed us that Stapleton went out at the window: he was taken soon after. We found a parcel of linen and gauze in Dailey's necessary house the same day.

                  Burnett 
               



            . We went and searched several houses of bad character, and in Dailey's rents we found M'Mahon, Caton and Price, and carried them to the round-house, the next day, when we came to the Rotation-office, M'Mahon was cleared: he told the Justices he never lay in Dailey's rents before, and that was on account of his being out so late, that he could not get in at home. Price was also discharged. Caton was detained by reason one of the Justices had seen him pick a person's pocket. Stapleton I never saw, till I met with him here to-day. After Dailey had told of a clock at his house, we went and found M'Mahon at the Running-horse; we carried him to the Justices's, went and fetched the clock, and took the things out of the necessary.
Mr. Clay. I know nothing more than has been mentioned already, except what the evidence said; he said he had robbed a house in Red Lion Street, and if I would go along with him, he would shew me the house. I went with him, and he fixed upon the house of the prosecutor. I knocked at the door, and asked the maids if they had lost a clock; they told me they had. Stapleton. I believe was committed by Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



             for other offences.
Caton's Defence.
I got up one morning to go to see my father. I called at an ale-house, the Running-horse, and had a pint of beer. I had drank more beer than ordinary. I got into that house to lie, and they came and took me. I am as innocent of the charge as the child unborn.
Stapleton's Defence.
I lodged at the Running-horse, and used to play at shuffle board. M'Mahon said, As I had no money, if I would go with him, he would shew me where to get some. I went with him to this house that night.
Court. You are not called upon to accuse yourself.
Stapleton. I did not go with him.
Price's Defence.
I was standing at the corner of Red Lion passage, and this M'Mahon and two others came by: he had a clock under his arm. He asked me to go along with them. We went to the Running-horse, and drank a pot of beer till it was twelve o'clock. I was afraid my father would lock me out, so M'Mahon took me to a house where he lodged.
Dailey's Defence.
M'Mahon never lay in my house, he called me up, and asked me whether I would buy a bargain. I said, No; I'll have nothing at all to do with it. I went down stairs, then up into my own room, and went to bed; he followed me up and left the clock in my kitchen. I know no more of its being there than the child unborn, till I got up: then I went to the constable, and told him there was such a thing left in my house. I have got a very good character.
Q. to Mr. Clay. What time did you first see the clock?
Mr. Clay. It was not brought till about twelve o'clock. Galaway Dailey came and told me of it between eleven and twelve. The boys were taken up long before.

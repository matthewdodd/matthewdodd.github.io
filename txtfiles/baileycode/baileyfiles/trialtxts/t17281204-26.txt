, and being out of Business, he invited him to Dinner, which the Prisoner readily accepted, and after Dinner, was as ready to assist in serving the Customers, it being a Publick House; but afterwards a Tankard being missing, and the Prosecutor remembering he lost a Pint Pot the last time the Prisoner assisted him; in the Morning when he came again, he took him up Stairs, and charg'd him with taking both the Pint Pot and the Tankard, which he obstinately denied for some Time, but at length confess'd, that one Brooks of his Acquaintance came to him the Night before, as he had the Tankard in his Hand in the Entry, and took it from him, that he met Brooks afterwards and took it again, and put it into a Hole in the Wall below Stairs, and they going down, he put his Hand in the Hole and pull'd out the Tankard; after he was committed, he likewife confess'd his taking the Pint Pot, and directed them to one Mrs. Gibbs, to whom he sold it, which Mrs. Gibbs confirming, the Jury found him 


               guilty to the Value of 39 s. for the feloniously taking, but it did not appear that he took the Goods out of the Dwelling-house
            .

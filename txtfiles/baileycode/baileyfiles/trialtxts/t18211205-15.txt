             keeps the house; the prisoner is a poor boy who used to be about the neighbourhood, he used to come to light my fire two or three years ago, and I used to give him his breakfast for it. His parents keep a green-stall in Park-street. After he left me, he used to call occasionally; he called on the 25th of September, about three o'clock in the afternoon, and broke some flint stones in my area; I live in the kitchen. I took him to a public-house and gave him a pot of porter, we came back and I gave him sixpence. He wanted to do some jobs for me, he said "You have got something that wants cleaning in the cupboard I know" - I know, he opened the cupboardand took a bill-book out and covered it with a cloth. He said he was going to clean it. My watch hung in that cupboard - I saw him go to the cupboard again and take the watch down - I said "What are you going to do with the watch," he said, it was about four o'clock. He looked wild, I walked towards the door to look for assistance, he came and collared me, I found him too strong for me - he ran up and banged the door and took away my watch. I went up stairs and called Stop thief! but he was gone - I did not see him again till the last day of October, when he was in custody. I never got my watch - I gave twelve guineas for it, it was gold; I had had it thirty years, and bought it second hand - I have been told it would fetch seven or eight guineas.

            . I did not consent to his taking the watch, I would not have trusted him with it. It was a leaver watch and made abroad.

I live at No. 4, White Hart-court, Broadway, Westminster


; I have had a house there five years; I know the prisoner about seven weeks; he lived with me, and had a one pair of stairs room, ready furnished; there were all the things mentioned in the indictment; they were let with the lodging to the prisoner and his wife; I missed them the 11th of December, they are here; they were pawned: the prisoner was in confinement at the barracks at Knightsbridge; we did not live at that house: on the 11th of December, I discovered the things were gone; I found the woman playing at cards; she went with me; she said she had lost the key of the room; I got a constable and got the duplicates from the woman; it was about ten at night.

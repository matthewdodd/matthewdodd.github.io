JOHN MOORE
. I am a pawnbroker, and live in Richard-street, Woolwich, in partnership with Thomas Pacey Burts. On the night of the 9th of November I heard a voice cry out, "Mr. Moore, somebody is stealing your trowsers"—I ran out, and caught the prisoner with eight pairs of trowsers in his possession—they were trailing on the ground—I took him myself—a watchman was behind, and I gave him into custody—the trowsers hung outside the front of my shop on a rod, about seven o'clock in the evening—he had taken rod and all.

Prisoner. You did not see me steal them—I picked them up.





PETER INCH
. I am a watchman. I was passing along Richard-street on the 9th of November, and saw the prisoner take the trowsers off this place—I ran after him—Mr. Moore took him with them in his hand—I found 11 1/2d. on him.




GUILTY
. * Aged 26.—


Transported for Seven Years.

WILLIAM LANGLEY
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
8th of October, 5 half-crowns, 5 shillings, 2 sixpences, and 3 pence, the monies of 



James Gould, his master.






JOHN WARDWELL
 (police-constable S 208.) On the night of the 11th of October, I met the prisoner on Clerkenwell-Green, at half-past ten o'clock—he said he had robbed his master of a sovereign—he came up of his own accord—I asked him where his master lived—he said in Tottenham-court road, that he had been to Saffron-hill with some girls and boys, and spent his money, and then they sent him out to sell matches—he had matches with him—in going to the station, he said the money did not belong to his master but to a lady, and it was 18s. 9d., but it was for his master's goods.





ELIZA GOULD
. I am the wife of James Gould, of Tottenham-court-road, a potato-dealer and green-grocer. The prisoner was engaged with me for one day—I sent him with some vegetables to a customer in How-land-street—they came to 1s. 3d.—he brought back a sovereign—I gave him 18s. 9d. to take back to the customer, and he never returned—I went to the house to pay the change over again, after the cook had come to say that the boy had the sovereign, and not returned with the change.

Prisoner. I have been in the House of Correction so many times, I should like to be sent out of the country.




GUILTY
.* Aged 16.—


Transported for Seven Years.

            . On the 16th of July I was in Newgate-market; I am in the fruit and vegetable line. I saw the prisoner lurking about the prosecutor's person, and saw him take the handkerchief from England's outside pocket, and put it into his own pocket; I turned round, told England, and pointed him out; he was coming towards us; England collared him; I got an officer, and saw the handkerchief found on him.

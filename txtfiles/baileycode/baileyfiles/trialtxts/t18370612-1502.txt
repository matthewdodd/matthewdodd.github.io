 for stealing on the 
21st of May, 1 saw, value 5s.; and 1 tap and box, value 5s.; the goods of

JOHN JAQUES
. I am an ivory-turner. The prisoner was in my employ on and off for about two years—he has been a very irregular man—he was in the habit of coming early, before the other men, and leaving for breakfast—I know these articles to be mine.





FREDERICK THOMPSON
. I am in the prosecutor's employ. I know these things—the prisoner acknowledged he took them, and took me and the policeman to Mr. Quartick's, a turner, on Back-hill, where they were.





GEORGE QUARTICK
. I bought these tools of the prisoner on the 29th and 31st of May—I knew him before, and understood he was respectable man.




GUILTY
. Aged 35.—


Transported for Seven Years.
(The prosecutor stated that the prisoner had previously robbed him, and had been forgiven.)

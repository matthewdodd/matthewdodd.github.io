MARY TOOMEY
 and 




JULIA CRAWLEY
 were indicted for

stealing, on the 
18th of February, 2 pillows, value 8s., the goods of 



George Gifford.






GEORGE GIFFORD
. I let lodgings. The two prisoners slept at my house—they have slept in one bed, and in separate beds—Toomey had not frequented our house very long—I had known Crawley before—I missed two pillows on the 17th, and I spoke to them the next morning on the subject—they both said they had pawned them, and meant to bring them back—I found them at the pawnbroker's—I do not positively swear to these, I believe them to be mine.





JOSEPH PARKER
. I am a pawnbroker, and live in New Gravel-lane, I took in one of these pillows from Toomey—I did not take the other, but I believe she pawned both.





MICHAEL DEMPSEY
 (police-constable K 247.) I took the prisoners—they both said they took the pillows, and would get them out again when they had got money; and Toomey handed me a ticket of one of the pillows—this is it.
(The prisoners put in a written Defence, stating that they had pledged the pillows, being in distress, but intended to redeem them.)

TOOMEY—


GUILTY
. Aged 19.—



Confined Six Weeks.

CRAWLEY—


GUILTY
. * Aged 20.—


Transported for Seven Tears.

             sworn.
I am a day labouring man
, in the stables at Portland-place. I did not know the prisoner. As I was going along Duke-street, Portland Chapel


, the prisoner snatched my chain from my watch; he walked with me two or three hundred yards; I had been drinking, but I wasvery sensible; I was not worse for liquor; I had lost my way coming home; I had been into the city: I have known the town about three months: and I asked the prisoner my way; and he said, he would go along with me; then he snatched at my watch; I pursued him, and took him as soon as I could catch him; I found nothing on him.
PRISONER's DEFENCE.
I was going down Marybone-street; people were coming along; this gentleman came running after me, and said I had robbed him.

             sworn.
I took charge of the prisoner. The prosecutor did not appear to be in liquor.
The prisoner called one witness, who gave him a good character.

            . I live in Tonbridge-street. St. Pancras


. On the 5th of October I let the prisoner a furnished lodging, as a married woman, and a night or two after she introduced a person who she said was her husband - he used to come two or three nights in a week and sleep there; I was urgent upon him, and he went away - she said he had broken his leg; I desired her to go, but she would not, and I put in a broker - this property was missing and these duplicates of it were found.

            . I am the son of Dominects Gobby, a broker
, in Leather-lane. I was fetching some luggage from St. Katharine's Dock, and in Hatton-garden, near Charles-street, a female came up and said, "There is something taken off your cart;" I crossed to the cart, and two coats were gone off it; I found the prisoner in custody with them.

            . I am an officer. On the 20th of November, about six o'clock in the evening, I was in Cheapside - I saw the prisoner, and another man in his company, following the cart - they went behind, and tried to get a box off; they followed it to Hatton-garden


, and on the other side of Charles-street his companion went to the cart, pulled the coats off, and gave them to the prisoner, who stood on the pavement - he then went and stood with his back to the railing of a house; I went and took the prisoner with the coats on his arm; the other ran away.(Property produced and sworn to).
Prisoner's Defence. I heard an alarm that a cart was robbed; a young man ran by me and dropped the coats at my feet - they never were on my arms.

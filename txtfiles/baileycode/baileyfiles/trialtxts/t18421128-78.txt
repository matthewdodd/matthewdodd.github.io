PRESTON NEWBURN BRUNTON
. I am the master of a brig. I was in Lombard-street on the 23rd of November—I felt some one touch my pocket—I turned, and took the prisoner with my handkerchief in his hand—I gave him in charge—this is my handkerchief—I am sure of it—it has no mark, but I know the pattern—the prisoner said a boy took it out of my pocket, and threw it upon him.

Prisoner's Defence. A boy picked the pocket, and before I could get to the gentleman he threw it on my shoulder. I was taking it off as the gentleman turned and took me.





GEORGE BOWLES
 (City police-constable, No. 554.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got at Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person.

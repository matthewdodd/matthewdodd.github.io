757. 




JAMES FULCHER



, unlawfully obtaining 4 half-crowns, and 4s.; the money of 



Harriet Watkins, by false pretences.






HARRIET WATKINS
. I know the prisoner. On 12th Feb., he came to me, and said he had had a letter from my sister Sarah, which was partly written to me, telling me to let him have what money be required—he said he wanted to pay for some things to send to my sister—I let him have 14s., believing he had had a letter from my sister Sarah—I should not have done so, had I not believed it; it was only done on my sister's account.

Cross-examined by
MR. SAUNDERS. Q. How long had you known the prisoner? A. About a week—I had seen him once before—I understood that he was about to be married to my sister—he said he was looking out for a public-house, to go into business; but he did not mean to do anything of the kind—he represented himself as an inspector of police.





SARAH WATKINS
. I never wrote a letter to the prisoner, asking him to go to my sister for money, to send me things.

Cross-examined. Q. Did you never do so? A. No—he was paying his addresses to me, and was an accepted lover—we talked about being married, and settling in business.




GUILTY

Transported for Seven Years.

Mr. Bannister. Here is the roll of the appointment of Lord Viscount Townshend, Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. (producing it.) It is read.


                  William
                   Fortescue
               



             Esq. I am the accomptant of the general post office, in Dublin.
Q. Do you know Sir 
               
                  George
                   Macartney
               



            ?
Forteseue. Yes; he is first secretary to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland.

Q. Doth he act as such?
Fortesque. Yes.
Cross Examination.
Q. Has Sir 
               
                  George
                   Macartney
               



             any appointment from the Lord Lieutenant?
Fortesque. None, as Lord Lieutenant, only notifications to the post office here that he acts for him.
Q. Do you know whether he has any notification in writing?
Fortesque. No; I have heard him say not.
Q. Do you know of his acting as secretary?
Fortesque. Yes.
Q. Of your own knowledge?
Fortesque. Yes.
Mr. Todd. I am first clerk to the secretary of the General Post Office.
Q. You have a frank importing to be a frank of Sir 
               
                  George
                   Macartney
               



            's?
Todd. Yes.
Q. How did you come by it?
Todd. On the 22d of June, the day that the first came to the post office, the inspectors of franks supposed them to be counterfeit; they brought them to the secretary's office. Mr. Williams, the person it is directed to, was sent for to the post office; he came, and was told that they were supposed to be counterfeit franks.
Q. In order to avoid an objection to your relating of any conversation that passed between you and Mr. Williams, which would not be evidence to affect the prisoner, I would desire to know-if in-conversation from any thing passing between you and Mr. Williams, the prisoner was sent for?
Todd. Mr. Williams himself brought him.
Q. Did you ask the prisoner about these franks?
Todd. Mr. Todd, the secretary, did, in my presence; he said he had had a frank or two of Sir 
               
                  George
                   Macartney
               



            , and that he had told him he need not give him the trouble of writing the names, but he might frank in his name himself; he admitted this to be his hand writing; that he had wrote the superscription of the whole. (the superscription of the two letters read.)
Q. to Mr. Fortesque. You said just now, you knew Sir 
               
                  George
                   Macartney
               



             well, and have seen him write?
Fortesque. Yes.
Q. Are you well acquainted with his hand writing?
Fortesque. Yes.
Q. Now is either of these his hand writing?
Fortesque. Indeed neither the one nor the other.
Q. Are they at all like his name?
Fortesque. They are a very bad counterfeit of his name.
Cross Examination.
Q. You say you have seen him write several times?
Fortesque. Yes.
Q. You think this is not at all like it?
Fortesque. No.
Q. to Mr. Todd. Did this letter come by the post from any place.
Todd. Yes; from Edinburgh.
Q. Where did he say he franked these?
Todd. At Mr. Williams's lodging, in Walbrook.
For the Prisoner.
- Gibson. I live in Birchin lane; I am a glazier. I have known the prisoner upwards of four months, as long as he has been in England; he came from Edinburgh; he has been remarkably sober and regular since he has been with me; he is appointed a surgeon to an East Indiaman.
- Dickins. I know his friends in Ireland they live in very good credit; I did not know him till I saw him here; I heard, before I came here, that he is a very good lad; I know by his neighbours, that he has the best of characters.
- Thornton. I am a glazier in Fleet street. I have known him since he came from Ireland, he is a surgeon and apothecary; I have heard a good character of him.

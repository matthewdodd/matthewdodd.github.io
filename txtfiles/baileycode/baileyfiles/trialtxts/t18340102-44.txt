            . On Sunday, the 8th December, I was with John Coppick; and we went to the Blue-coat-boy at Islington, at half-past eleven at night - I was not drunk - we had one quartern of gin there - we stopped four or five minutes - we were then going on - I then saw the prisoner; but I had not noticed him in the house - he told my friend he would see the old gentleman home - he laid hold of my arm, and we walked down St. John-street-road


 - I said he was welcome to part of my umbrella, as it rained; and I walked in the middle - when we got opposite Owens-row, the prisoner drew my watch out of my fob, and ran off - I said to my friend, "I have lost my watch;" and I pursued and overtook the prisoner forty or fifty yards off - I asked him for my watch two or three times - he said he had not got it - I called the officer, and then the prisoner put the watch into my hand.
JOHN COPPICK. I was with the prosecutor - I can corroborate what he has said - I knew nothing of the transaction till he said he had lost his watch - he dropped his umbrella, and pursued, and took the prisoner - the prisoner denied having the watch till the officer came up, and then he gave it to the prosecutor.

             (police-constable G 183). I took the prisoner - he took the watch from his waistcoat pocket, and gave it to the prosecutor.

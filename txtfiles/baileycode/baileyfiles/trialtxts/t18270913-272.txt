            . I am one of the watchmen of St. Katherine's Docks


. On the 7th of August, about half-past eight o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner taking some lead off a small wash-house; he broke it and doubled it up; I sent for an officer and had him taken - he had removed it from the top to the bottom - it belonged to the Company.

            . I was called by Thorby - we could not see the prisoner; I called for a light, and found him in the adjoining washhouse, and found the lead on the ground; I compared it with the place - it fits exactly with what remains.

            . I am clerk to Messrs. Paulin and Co., who are employed by the St. Katherine's Dock Company - they have been in possession of this house some time - it is in Mablin's-rents, all of which is in the Company's possession; I had possession of the house for them.
Prisoner's Defence. I was going into this house to look for my trowel - I had been at work in Burr-street.

            . I am sure he is the man whom I saw pulling the lead off the wash-house.

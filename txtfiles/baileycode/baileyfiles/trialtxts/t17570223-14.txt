. This is my copper pot (producing one.) It was found upon the prisoner, as I was told. I found it in the Round-house.
Mr. Porter. I was coming out of Buckingham-Street, on the fast-day, about nine in the morning. I saw the prisoner and another woman offering this pot to sale to another woman, that was crying the form of prayer. She said to me as I came by, I am afraid these women have stole this pot, for it is hot. Then I shew'd her a constable's house, and said she would do well to secure them. The constable knowing me, we took the prisoners and carried them before justice Cox. There they said they found it.
Prisoner's Defence.
I found the pot crossing from Durham Yard to Halfmoon-Street.




               Guilty, 10 d.

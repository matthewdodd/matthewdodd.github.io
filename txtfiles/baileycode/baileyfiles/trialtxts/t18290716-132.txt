. On the morning of the 17th of July, about half-past ten o'clock, the prisoner took these boots off the window - she then came into the shop, and asked the price of some little shoes at the side of the door; I told her - she said, "That don't suit me" - I took hold of her, and said, "It don't suit me;" she said,"Go along, go along;" but I held her, and sent for a constable - these are the boots; I saw her put them under her arm.
Prisoner's Defence. I had been laying on the boards for several days without a bit of food; it was the height of distress led me to take them - it was the devil caused them to come in my way; I throw myself on your mercy.

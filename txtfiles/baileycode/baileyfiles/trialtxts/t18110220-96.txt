             before she was married to the prisoner; she was married to him about five years ago the 28th of last October, at the parish church of Maidstone in Kent. I was present at the marriage; I saw his wife last Wednesday. She was a spinster when he married her, about eighteen years of age; she was a publican's daughter, her father kept the Bull in Cranbourne parish. The prisoner was an usher to a school; when he married he came up to London, and set up a school.

                  ADAMS
               



            . Q. Where did you become acquainted with the prisoner - A. I lived with Mr. Moreton as house-maid, at Kensington gravel-pits; he was a schoolmaster
; I became acquainted with the prisoner in the latter end of January, 1810; he was writing master at that school. I was married to John Liles on the 9th of April, 1810
, at St. George's, Hanover-square


; he told me that he was a widower, his wife had been dead two years, her name was 
               
                  Hannah 
                  Bates
               



            . I was in place when I was married, and continued in place till the 28th of June; he lived with me till the 1st of September.
Q. Did he acquaint you where he was going - A. Yes; he desired me to keep it a secret for fear he should be arrested for a debt to the person that lived with his wife. The day he left me I was told that his first wife was alive. I never saw him from the day he left me till he was apprehended.
Q. Had you saved up any property in service - A. He had only four pounds in money of me, not all at once, at different times; he took away my clothes, part with my consent; he said he had thirty-two pounds to receive, if I would let him have my clothes he would return them me when he took the money.
Q. Have they ever been returned to you - A. No. and I was ill; through improper conduct of his I was obliged to have medical relief of the parish.

Prisoner's Defence. My first wife and I parted by mutual consent; she proposed for me to sell her at Smithfield; I did not like to do that; there were writings drawn up between friends, and we separated; she consented for me to marry. I acted upon and that involved me into this unfortunate difficulty.

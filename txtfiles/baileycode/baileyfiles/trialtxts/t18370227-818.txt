WILLIAM ROBERT MAYNARD
. I am shopman to Maria Newby, a pawnbroker in Drury-lane. About 12 o'clock on Friday, the 24th of February, two handkerchiefs hung at the door tied together—I saw, one lying on the ground, which made me look for the other, and it was not there—the prisoner was standing by the door at the time—I looked at him very hard, and inspected him—I laid hold of him, and found the missing handkerchief on him—I dragged him into the shop, and he dropped it—I took him to Bow-street, and gave him into custody.

Prisoner. I caught hold of it to stop it from falling. Witness. I found it on his person.





THOMAS KELLY

            , in Barbican


, and serve in the shop
. On the 24th of December, about five o'clock, the prisoner came in, and again about six - he had been several times before. He asked for a pair of shoes; there was a pair on the counter, with two pairs of stockings, a necklace, and a handkerchief, and while I went to get him a pair, he snatched these things up, and ran out with them - I went after him; he crossed the road, and got into some of the courts by Jacob's-wells, and got off. I described him to Harrison, who took him on Sunday. I have not found the things. I saw him going out with them.

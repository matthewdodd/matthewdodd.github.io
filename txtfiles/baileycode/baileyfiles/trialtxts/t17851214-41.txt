I saw the prisoner taken, running down Bear-yard, between ten and eleven or thereabouts; I went to my own shop, and I pursued the prisoner, and found him with another boy
 in Stanhope-street, he had one pair of breeches under his coat, he said, he had bought them, and that that boy would go with me to shew me, I told him he should go with me, and when we went a few yards together, he threw away the breeches and run away, he was taken, I lost sight of him, I am sure he is the same.

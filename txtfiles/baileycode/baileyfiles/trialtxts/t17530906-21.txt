                  Mullings 
               



            . I live in Watling-Street


, am journeyman to 
                  
                     Edward 
                     Thorn 
                  



               , a vellum binder
. I had 2 guineas and an 18 s. piece, in a snuff-box, in a drawer under my trunk in a room at my master's where I lie. The prisoner worked in the same room. I missed the money mention'd, July 27.
Q. When had you seen it last?
Mullings. I can't be certain as to that. I suspected the prisoner. I took him up, he confessed he took it that same night to me and others; and said he spent the 18 s piece, but throwed the 2  guineas in the box into a pond at Islington, saying his conscience pricked him.

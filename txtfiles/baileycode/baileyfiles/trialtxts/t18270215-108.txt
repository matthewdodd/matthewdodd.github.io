            . I live at Laytonstone, and am a farmer
. On the 28th of December the prisoner carted some potatoes for me, to Mrs. Mahoney, at Poplar - I told him if I did not meet him at Poplar, he was to receive the money for them, and take care of it for me; I had not entrusted him with money before. I found the team left at the Coach and Horses public-house, with a man, and he had absconded; he was apprehended in about a month - he was my weekly servant.

            . I bought a load of potatoes, and paid the prisoner two sovereigns, and two half-sovereigns, and he gave me 2s. change; the man was like the prisoner, and said he came from Mr. Tucker's - he gave me this receipt.
MR. TUCKER. This is the receipt I gave him.

            . I am an officer. I found the prisoner at a lodging-house at Stratford - he said he fell in with a tinker at the Bird-in-hand public-house, at Bow, who robbed him of the sovereigns, and swallowed them.
Prisoner's Defence. I put the money into my fob, and at Stratford I missed two half-sovereigns; I met a man, and asked him to take my team home - I went back, and met a man, who advised me to see if the money was not in my shoe; I took it off - he took up the two sovereigns, and swallowed them directly.

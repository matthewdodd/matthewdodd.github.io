            . I live with Sarah Ashbridge - she is single
. At five o'clock in the afternoon, of the 3d of April, I saw the prisoner and three more pulling about a pair of trousers inside her shop; they all went away three times and came back again, and each time they took out some pins - when they had taken them all out, the prisoner and another came back; the prisoner took them down, folded them up, and had gone about half a yard from the door - I missed them, went out and took him with them in his hand; he begged my pardon, and said he would not do so any more.

            . I am an officer. I was going by and took the prisoner.
Prisoner's Defence. I was looking at the trousers - I fell in at the threshold of the door; I was going to pick them up - he came, took hold of me, and struck me.

            . I did not hit him - I forced him back into the shop; the trousers had been hanging on an iron rail - another person came back with him the last time, and was looking at another pair.

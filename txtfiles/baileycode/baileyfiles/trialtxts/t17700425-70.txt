            . On the 26th of March, about nine in the evening, going along Lombard-street


, I heard somebody step behind me. I turned round; there was the prisoner. He halted as I did. I went on again; he mended his pace. He put his hand into my pocket, and took my handkerchief out. I took it from him. He had hold of one corner, and I took hold of the other. I was the officer, going to set the watch. I sent for my brother officer, who took charge of him. When at Guildhall, he told me, if I prosecuted him, I should not live to prosecute another.

I was going to carry a letter to the post. I did not attempt his pocket.

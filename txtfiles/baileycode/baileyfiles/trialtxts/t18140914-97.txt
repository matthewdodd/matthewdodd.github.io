            . I am a baker
. On the 17th of August, I was standing in the shop, between ten and eleven in the morning, the prisoner came into the shop from the bakehouse; Mrs. Steane came behind him, and said, what is this; she laid hold of him, and asked me. He pulled her out of the shop, and knocked her down; he then run away. I pursued him, and brought him back to the shop, and took this stocking of flour from him.

            . When the prisoner lived with us, I suspected his honesty. On the 17th of August, between ten and eleven in the forenoon, as he was going out, I put my hand to each of side of him; I asked him what he had about him when he was going out. I laid hold of his jacket pocket; he dragged me out on the pavement, and knocked me down.

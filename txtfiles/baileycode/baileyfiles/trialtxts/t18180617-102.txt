            . I am a bricklayer

            . I am an officer. On the 4th of June, I was sent to the prisoners' lodgings (they live together), to search for leaden pipes. I found them there, with another person. I 
               drew
             a bag from under the bedstead containing three fowls; and I found another bag in the bed, containing four more. The prosecutor claimed them; he described them exactly before he saw them.

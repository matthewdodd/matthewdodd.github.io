RICHARD COATES. I am a constable. On the 19th of October, about seven o'clock in the evening, I stopped the prisoner in Marylebone-lane, with the copper on his head. I asked him where he got it; he said a man gave him half a crown to carry it to Berners-street - the man was a stranger. I told him he was going the wrong way to Berners-street - I secured him. He said he did not take it; but he never would tell who the man was that did.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

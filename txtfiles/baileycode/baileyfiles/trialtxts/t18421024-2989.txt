JOHN WILLIAM GOWER
 was indicted

 for bigamy.






THOMAS BRIDGE
. I live at the fire-engine station-house, St. Martin's lane. I have examined the marriage register at the parish church of St. Martin-in-the-Fields—I produce a marriage certificate, which I compared with the book—(read)—"St. Martin-in-the-Fields, 1838, February 5th.,

John William Gower and Sarah Lygo were married, in the presence of Septimus Ramsay and Ralph Gaffney."





RALPH GAFFNEY
. I was present in St. Martin's church on the 5th of February, 1838, when the prisoner was married to Sarah Lygo—she is my wife's sister—I saw her alive yesterday.





SARAH BRIDGE
. I am the daughter of Thomas Bridge. I shall be twenty-one years old next December—I was in service—I met with the prisoner, and was married to him at Paddington church, on the 5th of September last—I lived with him till this was made known—he always passed himself off to me as single.

Prisoner's Defence. My first wife left me. I received a letter from her while I was in the Penitentiary, stating that she had sold my furniture, and did not want to see me again. I heard that she was dead.




GUILTY
.* Aged 23.—


Transported for Seven Years.

Q. What had you in the cart - A. Thirty-six firkins of butter. I got behind my cart, he had cut my tail rope, and got a firkin of butter out of my cart; he had the firkin in his arms; I made a catch at him, and missed him the first time, the next time I catched him, I secured him; I took him to the shop where I was going to, and charged him with a constable.
The firkin produced and identified.

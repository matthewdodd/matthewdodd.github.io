            . It appeared that the Prosecutor going along Kingsgate-Street


 about 9 at Night with her Petticoat over head to keep off the Rain, the Prisoner came by and pull'd off her Pocket with the Keys and Money in it, and she seeing of him run, mist her Pocket and cry'd out Stop Thief; thus he finding himself pursued, made a Stop, then ran a little further and was taken, and the Pocket was found thrown over some Rails just where he stopt, that there was no Body near her but the Prisoner; that he made his Escape from them as they were carrying him to the Watch-House, but he was soon re-taken. It did not appear that she was put in Fear, but that her Pocket was rather privately taken from her; the jury found him

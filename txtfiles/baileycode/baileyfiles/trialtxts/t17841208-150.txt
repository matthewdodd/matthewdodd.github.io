             sworn.
I caught the prisoner in my room, I seized him by the collar, he gave me a violent push in my stomach, and pushed me on one side and run out, but stumbled over the step; I cried out stop thief! and he was stopped in about a hundred yards, and I saw the prisoner drop the things mentioned in the indictment, and other things.

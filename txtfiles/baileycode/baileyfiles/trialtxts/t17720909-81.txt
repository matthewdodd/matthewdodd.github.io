            , is a ballast man
; we suffered the prisoner to be in our house till he could get a birth; we missed the things mentioned in the indictment; we suspected the prisoner, and took him before the justice; there he confessed that he had robbed us, and had sold the buckles for 11 s. 6 d. and he gave us a direction to the pawnbroker where he had pledged them; there we found them.

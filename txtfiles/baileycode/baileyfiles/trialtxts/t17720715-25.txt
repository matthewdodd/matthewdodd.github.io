            . I keep a stable
 for my own horses, which I let out; I lost a saddle out of my stable, on the 4th of July, which was brought back again about eight o'clock in the morning.

            . I saw the prisoner coming out of Mr. Earl's stable with a saddle in a bag upon his back, at eight o'clock in the morning; I suspected him; I went to Mr. Earl's son, and asked him if he knew the prisoner; he said no; we pursued him, and took him in about three minutes, with the saddle on him.
Thomas Earl confirmed this evidence.
Prisoner's Defence
As I was going through the yard, I met an hostler; he gave me the saddle to carry for him to the Green Man and Still. I served the King twenty-nine years.

He called a witness, who said he had been formerly transported.

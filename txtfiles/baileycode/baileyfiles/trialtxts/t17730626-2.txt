            . I saw the prisoner on the 15th of February, in a field near White-Conduit-house, knocking some streaks off a wheel; I came over the same field on the Wednesday following, and saw him knocking some iron off of another wheel; I informed Mr. Wellings of it, and he sent to Mr. Dodd a servant of Mr. Jones to know if they had left any wheels.

            . Mr. Welling's informed me there was a man breaking up a wheel in a field; I went to Mr. Welling's field, I saw the prisoner laying the iron together; as soon as he saw me, he ran off; I went up to the place and found six streaks of iron and the fellies; I took the prisoner that night; the streaks are marked with a bird's claw. (The streaks produced and deposed to.)
Prisoner's Defence.
I was not the person that was breaking up the wheel.

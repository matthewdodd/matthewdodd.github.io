JAMES GADSEN. I live in New Nichol-street, Bethnal-green


, and am a weaver
 - the prisoner is my son. On the 11th of February he was at home, and next morning I missed my great coat from the front kitchen; I never allowed him to pawn my things - I am obliged to prosecute him, as I can keep nothing.

ROBERT CHAPMAN
. I am master of the schooner Spring, lying off the Custom House. On 30th Jan., between two and three o'clock in the morning, I was in bed, and was awoke by the prisoner drawing my watch from a shelf over my head—he had no business there—I seized him with it in his hand—he had lit the candle, which I bad put out when I went to bed—there were three men on board, but no one slept aft but me—we struggled; he bit my fingers—my mate came to my assistance, and the police—I missed my purse, three sovereigns, and two sixpences, from the shelf—there was a ship on each side of mine—this is my watch; it fell on the bed.





WILLIAM HENRY FORFAR
 (Thames-policeman). On 30th Jan., between two and three o'clock in the morning, I was in a police-galley, heard a noise, and saw the prisoner and Chapman struggling on the deck of the Spring—I went; the prisoner was very violent; we were obliged to lash his hands and feet—he said he had lost his knife; he only wished he had it, he intended it for some of us, but he was innocent—he could get on board by one of the watermen's boats—he was sober.

Prisoner's Defence. I was in liquor, and had been with a friend; I walked over the tier to get ashore, and the captain came on deck and seized me.





JOHN SIMMS
 (policeman). I produce a certificate of the prisoner's con viction—(read—Convicted June, 1847, and confined six months)—I was present—he is the person.

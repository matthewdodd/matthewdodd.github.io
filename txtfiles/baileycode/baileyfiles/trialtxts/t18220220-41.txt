            . I am a chymist
, and live in Whitechapel. I was in Cornhill


, going home; my handkerchief was in my outside coat pocket, a few minutes before; an officer asked if I had lost any thing, I felt and missed it - he collared the prisoner, who was close to me; and saw it found on him.

            . I am a night patrole of the City. I saw the prosecutor near the 'Change, the prisoner was close to him; he put his hand in his right hand coat pocket, and took out a handkerchief - I told the prosecutor. We secured him, and found it in his breeches pocket - he said it was of no use searching, and took it out himself. I found another in his hat.

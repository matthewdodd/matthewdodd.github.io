            . I keep the White Horse Inn, Cripplegate
, the prisoner was my clerk
, and entrusted to receive money on my account. I have partners - the business in town belongs to me; the money is divided between us by mileage - we are a company. He ought to pay all money as he receives it - I was to remit it to butchers in the country. I enquired of Mr. King what money he had paid at my office, in consequence of which I went to the prisoner, and said Mr. King had informed me that on the 23d of October he had paid 2 l. 5 s. 7 d. into our office; he said he had received it and not accounted for it. This was a week or ten days after the 23d of October - he was in custody at my office at the time.

            . I am servant to Mr. King. On the 23d of October I paid two 1 l. notes and 5 s. 7 d. to Horwood, at the prosecutor's office - the prisoner was not there.

            . I am clerk to the prosecutor. On the 23d of October Coleman paid me 2 l. 5 s. 7 d. on account of King - I paid the same money to the prisoner when he came in.

            . I am clerk to Mr. Deacon. The prisoner never accounted to me for this sum - there are no other clerks.

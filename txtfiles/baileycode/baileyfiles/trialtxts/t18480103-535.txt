WILLIAM STROUD
. I am a haberdasher, at New Bridge-street, Vanxhall. On 28th Dec., about half-part eleven o'clock in the morning, I was in the parlour behind my shop, and saw Arrall go out—I went out, and saw him give some knives to Jackson, who was round the corner, four shops off; Jackson dropped them, and ran off; I caught Arrall, and Blake caught Jackson—they were both brought back to the shop—Arrall threw out one of the ties, and the other the policeman took out of his trowsers—these are them (produced)—they are silk, and were in the shop-window with the knives give minutes before.





JOHN BLAKE
 (policeman.) On 28th Dec. I saw Jackson running—I stopped him, and saw Mr. Stroud holding Arrall—we took them back to the shop, Arrall drew this tie out of his pocket, and threw it over the counter—I found this other the rolled up in the bottom of his shirt—Mr. Stroud had gen knived in his hand.

Jackson's Defence. I was standing at the corner of a street; my brother went on; I am on to overtake him, and somebody called, "Stop thief"

another boy, with bricklayer's clothes on, ran behind me, and Arrall also; the policeman caught us, and asked Arrall who it was; he said it was me; a you g woman said I was not the boy.

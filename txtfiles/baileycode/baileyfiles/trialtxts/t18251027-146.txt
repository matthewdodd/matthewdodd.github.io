JOSEPH ELLIOTT. I am a grocer
, and live in Crown-street, Finsbury


. About six o'clock in the evening of the 15th of October, I was in my room up stairs, which overlooks the shop - I saw a man going from my door - he had nothing - I saw another man stooping down and taking a bag of ginger from within the shop-door - I went down, and saw the prisoner a little distance off, with the ginger - he let it fall, and I pursued, and took him in about two minutes.

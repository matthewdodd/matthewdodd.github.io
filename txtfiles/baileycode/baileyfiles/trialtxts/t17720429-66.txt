            . I live at Poplar


; on the 8th of April, I had a good deal of linen hung up in the garden to dry; a neighbour came about one o'clock, and said a man had stole a gown; I run out and took the prisoner; he was crouched down by an old barn joining to the garden, with the gown under him to hide it; (the gown produced and deposed to by the prosecutor.)

             deposed, that he saw the prisoner take the gown from the line, which he immediately informed the prisoner of.

What they have sworn is as false as God is true.

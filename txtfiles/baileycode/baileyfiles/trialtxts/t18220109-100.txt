            . I am a watchman. On the 20th of December, about a quarter past five o'clock, I was near Evans's shop, and saw the prisoner standing by the side of the window, looking into the shop. I saw her put both her hands up, and snatch something from the shop - I let her go about two doors, then laid hold of her, and found the cotton under her pelisse - she said she had just picked it up. I took her into the shop, she resisted, and dropped it. I picked it up.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

            . I am a solicitor
, and live in Poland-street, Oxford-street


. The prisoner was my clerk
 - on the 3rd of July I gave him nine 5l. notes to pay to Messrs. Gosling and Sharp, my bankers, in Fleet-street - he never returned; I saw him again on the 13th of October, in custody: he had been with me four months.

            . I am a clerk to Messrs. Gosling and Sharp. The prosecutor keeps cash there - there were no 5l. notes paid in on his account on the 3rd of July - I am cashier, and keep the book; they were not paid to me or any one else.

            . The prisoner surrendered himself to me on the 13th of October - he said he had been in Dublin, and spent his master's money, and the only atonement he could make was to surrender himself up.

            . I am servant to Mess. Whiting and Deverell at Holborn-bridge. About the 4th or 5th of March Mr. King, son to 
               
                  Elizabeth 
                  King 
               



            , came to our house, and asked me whether we had not sent a parcel to their waggon, at the King's-arms at Holborn-bridge, to go to Mrs. Holmes at Watford, that contained tapes, pins, thimbles, and quality-bindings. I told him we had. He said that parcel was stolen out of the waggon; he said he suspected the 2 prisoners, and desired me to go to the house where he had information of it, saying there was such a parcel, but the direction was torn off. I went and saw it, at the Fox in Fox-court. The 2 prisoners were taken up, and carried before my Lord-Mayor, there we opened the parcel; in it we found our bill of parcels, which answered to the things. The 2 prisoners confessed they had taken the parcel out of the waggon in Holborn


, on this side the bars, and carried it to the Fox, in Fox-court, Gray's-inn-lane.


                  John 
                  King 
               



            . I am son to 
               
                  Elizabeth 
                  King 
               



            , she is owner of the waggon; this parcel (producing it) was delivered to me on the 1st of March: when we came home to unload, the parcel was missing: when I came to London again, I was informed a parcel was stopped at the Fox, in Fox-court; there we found it: this was the 4th of March. We let it alone for 3 or 4 journies; and when the 2 prisoners came there again, they were stopped. Then Lamball said How got up into the waggon, and gave it to him, and he carried it away, between 10 and 11 o'clock in the day, a little before the waggon came to Holborn-bars.

            . I live at the Fox, in Fox-court, a public house: 
               
                  Joseph 
                  Lamball 
               



             brought this parcel to me on the 1st of March, betwixt 10 and 11 o'clock, and desired he might leave it, and said he would fetch it in 10 minutes, for his waggon was gone before, and he should have anger if he did not take care of it; the other prisoner was with him; they were not in their soldiers cloaths, they were both dressed like countrymen. When they had been gone about half an hour, I began to be very uneasy; I found the direction was torn off, and the bottom of the letters left upon the paper: I saw they had opened a corner, to see what was in it. I sent for a neighbour, and told him of it. He said, Don't trouble yourself with it, you may have a great deal of trouble. Soon after Lamball came in, and asked for it. I said I would not part with it, till I had been before a justice of the peace. I went to secure my tankard, and How said to Lamball, Go and fetch the man that gave it you: he went out. Then I said to How, Don't you think this is stolen, by the direction being taken off? Said he, I know nothing of it. I said to him, Pray where does your waggon stand? He said, At Temple-bar. I said, You mean Holborn-bars. He said, Yes, I do. Then he said, Madam, do not part with it: for, depend upon it, it is stolen; and away he went. I went out to see for him, and they were both standing together in the middle of the road. I found afterwards, they had used to load this waggon. My Lord-Mayor ordered me to take the parcel into my custody till it was produced here, which I did.

            . I live opposite Staple's-inn in Holborn. I was standing by my door, the Watford waggon was going by; I saw a man jump up into it on his knees and put his head into the waggon, and pull out a paper parcel like this. He went with it to Wharton's-court, which goes to Fox-court; he was in a country dress. This was between 10 and 11 o'clock in the forenoon; I am not certain to the day.
Lamball's defence.
I had been up all night drinking; we were coming along Holborn, and saw this parcel lie in the street; I took it up, and, having other business to do, we carried it to this woman's house. I belong to Colonel Baugh's regiment

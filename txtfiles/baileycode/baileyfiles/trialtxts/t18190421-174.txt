            . I am a cheesemonger
, and live in Oxford-street; the prisoner was my shopman
, and entrusted to receive money for me. I suspected him, and on the 27th of January I requested Mr. Jones to mark some money, and lay it out at my shop. The prisoner got up the first in the morning, opened the shop, and served the customers - he was the only person in the shop. I watched him up stairs; he was in the act of pulling off his coat - I seized him by the arm in his own room, and found 7 s. in silver and copper, which he acknowledged he had taken out of the till, and begged I would not prosecute him.
Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Did you give Mr. 
               Jones
             the money to lay out - A. No, it was his own. I had left a shilling in the till the night before; he did not say he meant to put the money into the till.

            . I am a grocer, and live in Oxford-street. I sent a stranger with one shilling and two sixpences to the prosecutor's shop, to buy butter. The messenger brought the butter back. I saw the same money soon after in the hands of the constable - (looks at the money) - this is the money I marked. I wrote Tom, Ned, and Jack on it.

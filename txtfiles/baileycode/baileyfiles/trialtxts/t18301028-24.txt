            . I live at Henley-on-Thames. On the 20th of September I was residing in Little Britain - I am a linen-draper
 - about half-past nine o'clock that morning, I was going up the Old Bailey


; there was a great crowd at an execution - I am certain my handkerchief was safe in my inside coat pocket, when I entered the crowd; I felt somebody at my pocket - I turned round, saw the prisoner, and saw a handkerchief in his small-clothes, not quite concealed; I took it from him, and secured him - the Police-constable was passing, and I gave him in charge; this is the handkerchief - it is silk, and worth 4s.; it is not marked; I know it by the pattern and wear.

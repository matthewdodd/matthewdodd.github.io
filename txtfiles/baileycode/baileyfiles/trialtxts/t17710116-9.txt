            . I keep a goldsmith's and jewellers shop
 in New Bond-street


. On Monday the tenth of December, the prisoner sent a message to my shop by the name of Capt. Hamilton, to desire me to wait upon him at his lodgings with some diamond rings and pins. I went to his lodgings and took some with; me this was about ten in the morning, he approved of a silver pin with brilliant diamonds; I told him I could shew him some diamond rings in the afternoon; he said he had thirty guineas to lay out for a lady; I went again in the afternoon, between five and six o'clock; he then fixed upon a diamond ring; then he bid me sit down and make a bill and receipt. He called for paper, I sat down to make it, I laid the ring and pin down upon the table I was writing upon; he walked up and down the room, and he took them from the table imperceptibly; he had a couteauon, and I think boots; he walked out of the room, I thought to bring me the money; I sat three or four minutes wondering he did not come in; I looked for the ring and pin, and they were gone.
Q. I understood you that he said he had but thirty guineas to lay out?
Nodes. He said he would make up the difference for the lady. I went to Great Russel-street, Bloomsbury, where he said Mrs. M'Kensie lived, that he knew; but could not find such a person; then I went to Sir 
               
                  John
                   Fielding
               



            's, there I found the prisoner already in custody; I believe the whole transaction was within an hour.

            . I am a pawnbroker; on the tenth of December, the prisoner brought me this diamond ring and pin, and offered to pawn them; he offered to pawn the diamond pin for six guineas; he said, he gave twelve guineas for it in Paris; I said it was too much; he said, If you dispute my honour, I will leave this ring, and produced the diamond ring; I asked what he gave for that; he said, he gave sorry guineas in Paris; I told him it was customary to have such things valued by silversmiths; he said, we had better offer them to pledge; I agreed to that, and proposed to go to a pawnbroker's in Carnaby-street; that pawnbroker was not at home, then I took him to Mr. Hill, I got the pin and ring from him, and then I had him secured, and we took him before Sir

            . My husband's name is Thomas. The prisoner's father is a painter, and lives in my house: they turned her out, on account of her not doing as they would have her. My sheets were missing the last day of July, and the petticoat on the Friday following, and the shirt and shift about the beginning of August. I have found all again, except the shirt, at Mr. Brewin's, a pawnbroker. (Produced in court, and deposed to).

Mr. Randall. I was charged with the prisoner, and took her before Mr. Alderman Cokayne: she was charged with this offence: she said she did do it.

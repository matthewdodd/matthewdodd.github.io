            . On the 13th of March, I was going to the White Horse, Fleet-bridge, to bed, about nine o'clock; just at the corner of Field-lane


 with Mr. Larking. I felt something at my pocket. I felt, and said I had lost my book. I said immediately, I thought that must be the man (meaning the prisoner); for I saw no other. He was crossing the way with it in his hand: Mr. Larking ran over, and took him by the collar. the ass's skin-book was within side the other. (Produced in court and deposed to). The prisoner denied having it at first, and put it down between his legs.

             confirmed the account he had given.

I found it upon the stones: the gentleman asked me if I had a pocket-book. I said, No. I did not know it was his.

            . I was in the Minories between ten and eleven o'clock on the 18th of March - I felt a tug at my pocket, and a blow came against my thigh, just at the time that I turned aside to let an elderly lady pass me; I saw the prisoner close to me, with my handkerchief in his hand - this is it; I took him, and gave him to the officer.
Prisoner. I leave myself to the mercy of the Court.

MATTHEW TESTER
. I am a servant out of place, and lodge in Tottenham-court-road. Yesterday morning I was at the end of St. Giles's, about ten minutes before eight o'clock—I had a handkerchief in my pocket—I did not miss it till I got back to my lodgings in the evening—I then received information, and saw it at the station-house—this is it.





THOMAS PEGLER
. I am a policeman. I was on duty yesterday morning in St. Giles's, and saw the prosecutor—I saw the prisoner follow him, and take his handkerchief from his pocket—he saw me, and ran away—I pursued and caught him—he said, "For what reason do you take me?"—I mid, "Where is the handkerchief?"—he had dropped it, and it was brought to me by a boy in about a minute—I brought the prisoner back to the place where he took it, but the prosecutor was gone—I found him in the evening—he described the handkerchief, and I showed it to him.

Prisoner's Defence.—I had just come out of a coffee-shop, and the officer took me—a handkerchief was brought to him, and he said I had stolen it.




GUILTY
. * Aged 19.—


Transported for Ten Years.

            . I am servant to 
               
                  Charles 
                  Moody
               



            , who lives in Adam-street, Adelphi


. On the 11th of October, the prisoner brought a letter for Mr. Moody; I took it up to my mistress - I met her on the stairs, she said she knew nothing about it? when I went down, the prisoner was gone. I missed the tea-pot and spoons out of the kitchen. I am positive he is the man.

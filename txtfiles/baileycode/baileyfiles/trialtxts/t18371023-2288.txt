HENRY COPE
. I live at Ealing, and am a shoemaker. On the 28th of September, at half-past two o'clock, I sent my son on an errand to Mr. Burrey's, in Old Brentford, for some nails which I wanted—I gave him a half-crown tied up in one corner of a handkerchief—he returned at half Past five o'clock, and the half-crown was gone—I had seen the prisoner before—my son is seven years old.





EDWARD COPE
. I am the son of Henry Cope. He sent me to Old Brentford, to buy a few articles—he gave me some money, wrapped up in handkerchief—I met the prisoner, I did know him before—he said, "Let me look at the bill"—he then told me to carry some potatoes—he got a round piece of leather, as big as the half-crown, and put that in, and then he said the bill was not right—he kept on along with me—he took the half-crown—I told my father of it.





MARTHA LEAKS
. I live at Brentford. I was coming down the lane,

the prisoner went across the field, and took the child across the field—I was coming from taking my father's dinner.





JAMES CUISHEN
. I am a policeman. On the 28th of September I received information that this boy was robbed of a half-crown—I got the description of the prisoner, whom I knew very well—on the 29th I went to his mother's house and met her at the door—I asked if he was at home—she said he was not—I went in, and found him up stairs on the bed—I told him the charge—he denied knowing any thing about it—I took him and found a knife, and duplicate, and a piece of leather, about the size of half a crown.





JAMES STEEL
. I am a policeman. I have the certificate of the prisoner's former conviction from Clerkenwell Sessions-house—(read)—the prisoner is the boy.

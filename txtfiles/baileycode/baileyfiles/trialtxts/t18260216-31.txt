, with a handkerchief in my pocket - I felt for it, and missed it - I turned round, and saw Hughes coming after me with it;>he had the prisoner in custody - I asked how he came by it - he made no answer.(Property produced and sworn to.)

            . I am a lapidary. I was coming from St. Bartholomew-hospital, and saw Mr. York on the other side of the way - the prisoner and another were behind him; I saw the other pull a handkerchief about six inches out of York's pocket - a gentleman passed who obstructed my view - I then saw the handkerchief was gone; the prisoner was putting on his hat - the other ran across to Fleet-market; I immediately seized the prisoner, and found the handkerchief in his hat; I called to Mr. York, who claimed it.
The prisoner pleaded distress.

                  Head 
               



            's house is there; about nine o'clock at night I had information, that two iron bars were gone from the rails at his door. I went to the end of the street, there I saw the prisoner sitting on some logs at the end of Rathbourne Place, and was tying up two bars in an apron. (Produced in Court) I took him and the bars; I compared them to the place where they were taken from, and know them to be Sir Francis's property: I found an old chisel upon him, with which I suppose he broke the stone they stood in.
Prisoner's defence.
As I was going from Fleet-market, I sat down upon the logs to tye my stocking up, I saw something lie white; then I took my apron off to wrapt them in, and designed next day to enquire who had lost such things; the watchman came and took me along with him, and I gave him a chisel that lay on the bars.

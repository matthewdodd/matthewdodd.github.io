John Burch. As I was going along Fenchurch-street


, with a little girl in my hand, I felt a hand in my pocket; knowing it worth but little, I let it go, and two or three minutes after that Mr. Sherlock follow'd me with the prisoner and the handkerchief, and said he saw him take it from me.

                  Sherlock 
               



            . On the 13th of Sept. last, Betwixt 8 and 9 o'clock, I was standing at the corner of Philpot-lane, making water: going on I saw the prosecutor and prisoner before me. I saw the prisoner make a motion at the prosecutor's pocket, and draw out his handkerchief, and drop it behind him; there was a man which followed him, whom I took to be his accomplice; he seeing me come up at that instant, cross'd the way, and made off with some precipitation. I took up the handkerchief, and followed the prisoner and prosecutor about 40 yards, and then laid hold on the prisoner's collar. I tap'd the prosecutor on the shoulder, and ask'd him if he had lost any thing; he felt in his pocket, and said he had lost his handkerchief. I shew'd him this; he said it was his handkerchief, so he charg'd the constable with him.
The prisoner had nothing to say in his defence.

            . I am a watchman of the Commercial-road. On the 11th of July I met the prisoner with these four sashes on his shoulder, about half-past two o'clock in the morning; he said he brought them from Poplar, and was going to his master, Mr. Jones, a builder, at No. 19, John-street - I took him to the watch-house, went to see for his master, and found it was an empty house - I afterwards found that these sashes were taken from Henry-street


, which is about a quarter of a mile from where I met him.

            , JUN. This house was nearly finished - it is my property; the lock of the door had been stolen the night before, but the workmen had blocked up the door - these sashes had been fixed in the usual manner.

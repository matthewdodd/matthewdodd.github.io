            . I am a post-boy
, and drive a carriage and pair of horses. I live in the parish of Stepney


: I went down into the country with my fellow-servant, and, when I came up again, I missed four shillings and six-pence out of my box in the stable; also I missed a pair of red breeches, a cloth waistcoat, and a pair of pumps; I found the cloaths the same day upon the prisoner in Hackney-marsh: he has the breeches and waistcoat on now.
Prisoner. I was half starved to death, having no victuals to eat, and the waistcoat was torn all to pieces.
Prosecutor. He was one of the poor belonging to the work-house; they have plenty of every thing.
- Coleman. I took the prisoner with the cloaths on his back; he swore and resisted, and would not come with me for some time.
Q. To prosecutor. Was the prisoner employed in your stable?
Prosecutor. He was; he had the key, and could go in when he pleased. The stable belongs to the master of the work-house.
Prisoner's Defence.
I had only part of the money.

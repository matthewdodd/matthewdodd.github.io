GEORGE MORRIS
 was indicted

 for stealing 1 handkerchief, value 3s., the goods of 



Charles Gosling, from his person; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






CHARLES GOSLING
. I live in Wilmott-street, Brunswick-square. On the evening of Jan. 25th I was going up Holborn-hill, and felt something behind—I turned round and saw the prisoner—I said, "What did your hand do in my

pocket?"—he said, "The boy hat run down Holborn"—he then went off, and threw down my handkerchief in the middle of the road—I ran, a cry was raised, and he was taken—this is my handkerchief.

Prisoner. Q. Was I behind you or before you? A. You were directly close to me, and said the boy ran down Holborn.

Prisoner. I saw the handkerchief on the ground; I took it up and crossed over; he called "Stop thief!" and I threw it down.





WILLIAM TICKNELL
 (City police-constable, No, 290.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, at this Court—(read Convicted on 15th of Sept., 1845, and confined three months)—I knew him before and since then, always with thieves.




GUILTY
. Aged 17.—


Transported for Ten Years.

            . I was constable of the night. On the 1st of September, about two o'clock in the morning, I stopped the prisoner about two hundred yards from the house, with a hag; I asked what was in it? he said it was old iron. I found it was 40lbs. of lead. It was afterwards compared with the gutters, and it fitted exactly.

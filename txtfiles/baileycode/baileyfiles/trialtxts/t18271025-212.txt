            . I keep the George public-house, Vauxhall-road




 - the prisoner was my pot-boy
. I paid him weekly - he did not account to me for any money paid by Smith, on the 25th or 26th of August - he should account to me every morning for what he had received the day before; he absconded on Sunday night, the 26th; he should have given me that morning what he received the day before. I gave information, but could not find him for some time - his week's wages would be due on Monday morning; he lived six weeks with me, and behaved well.

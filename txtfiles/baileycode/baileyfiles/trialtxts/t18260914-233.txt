            . I was in the service of Thomas Langley, in Mile-end-road


. On the 31st of August I was at work in the shop, with my back to the door, for five or ten minutes - when I turned round I saw Keefe behind the counter, shutting the till; he stooped, came round, and walked out at the door; Poole was at the door, looking through the window; they crossed the road, and met Wolfe, and they all joined together; I went and looked at the till. and the money was all gone except a penny or three halfpence; I ran out, and secured Keefe and Poole- Wolfe attempted to run off, but two Excisemen came up, and I asked them to stop him; I brought them back, and Keefe dropped the silver on the stones; he had the money when I took him. I took off Wolfe's hat, and found this wire in it, and some string.
KEEFE'S Defence. I went into a house to buy some bread and cheese, and this man came and took me.

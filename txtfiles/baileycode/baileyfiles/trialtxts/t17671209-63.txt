            . I live in Plumbtree-court, Shoe-lane


; I am a mason
, and work under Mr. Dixon at Backstairs bridge; my wife light of the prisoner in the Fleet-market about a fortnight before I was robbed, and said he was her townsman from Eltham in Kent; she brought him home to my house, I never saw the prisoner but once before the day I was robbed, which was Monday the 2d of November; I came out of my house at twelve at noon, and left my wife in the house; I took a bit of victuals with me, and the prisoner and I went over the way at the King's Arms to dinner; I staid an hour, my usual time; the prisoner staid with me best part of half an hour, when my wife came to us; the prisoner said he was hired to a place, and he must be there at one o'clock, and immediately left my wife and I; I went to my work, and my wife for home at one; she came to me about three, and told me the door was broke open, and we had been robbed, and she suspected the prisoner; I went home with her; I have only a lower apartment, I am tenant to Mr. Crosby at the Red Lion; I found my room door open which is on the ground floor, the latch was hanging by one screw; we missed the things mentioned in the indictment, (mentioning them by name;) he had told my wife he lodged in Gun-alley, Drury-lane; we did not find him, but the next day we found him at the Crown and Cushion in Little Russel-street, he had a bundle by him; my wife kept him there while I went for a constable; he was taken before Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            , there he confessed every thing; there was my tortoise-shell snuff-box, a pair of breeches, a pair of trousers, a red handkerchief, the copy of my freedom, and two gold rings, (produced and deposed to;) he owned the fact before Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            , and said he was weary of living; he said there were some things at Mr. Monk's a pawnbroker in Drury-lane, and went with the constable for them.
Anne his wife gave the same account, with this addition; the prisoner owned some of the things were sold to Mrs. Davis near the New Church in the Strand; there we found a cloak, a pair of breeches, a laced hat, four gowns, a silk coat, about a dozen handkerchiefs, and three aprons; (produced and deposed to.)

            , that he broke the door of the prosecutor's room and took the things.

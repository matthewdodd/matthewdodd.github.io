GEORGE BURDETT
. I was walking in Broad-street, St. Giles's, on the 30th of March. I felt a twitch, and turned, and saw the prisoner with my handkerchief in his hand—I took it and made an attempt to take him, but he escaped into the coal-yard, where he was taken—this is my handkerchief—I saw it in his possession.





HENRY COLTER
 (police-sergeant F 5.) I received the prisoner, and this handkerchief in charge.

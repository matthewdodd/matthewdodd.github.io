THOMAS BROWN
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
12th of October, 18 loaves of bread, value 6s.; and 1 basket, value 7s.; the goods of 



Henry Warren; and that he had been before convicted of felony.—2nd COUNT, stating them to belong to 



James Young.






JAMES YOUNG
. I am a journeyman to Mr. Edward Warren, baker, of York-road, Lambeth. On the 12th of October, I was out with bread—I

went into a public-house with my basket, and the prisoner, whom I had seen once before, came in—we went away together, and he offered to assist me to serve my customers—we went to two or three customers, and I then left him with my basket while I went to a customer—I came back in two or three minutes—the prisoner and my basket, with eighteen loaves in it, were gone—I saw him again the next day, and asked where my basket and bread was—he said he did not know—I gave him into custody.





JAKE COOPER
. I am a servant. On the 12th of October, the prisoner served me with a loaf—I know he is the man I saw with the basket.





WILLIAM GRAY
 (police-sergeant G 12.) The prisoner was given into my custody.

Prisoners Defence. I waited ten minutes for the prosecutor in the rain, and he did not return—he was drunk, and did not know what he was about.





ROBERT ADAMS
 (police-sergeant B 15.) I produce the certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the man.




GUILTY
. Aged 17.—


Transported for Seven Years.

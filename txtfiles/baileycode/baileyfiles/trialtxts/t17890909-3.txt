             sworn.
I am a green grocer
; I lost, on the 27th of July last, on Monday, about nine in the morning, as I was about my business in Newgate Market


, twenty-five halfpence and a farthing; I saw the man draw his hand out my pocket; I stopped him, but he was too nimble for me, and he dropped the halfpence in his own pocket; I had half a crown's worth of halfpence; I examined him directly; he had twelve penny worth of halfpence, one halfpenny, and one farthing, which was the precise money I found on him; there were two halfpence I could swear to; he was committed for this offence by me, and taken to Wood-street Counter.
(The halfpence shewn to the Jury.)
The prisoner dropped four or five of the halfpence as he took them out of my pocket.



               GUILTY
            .
Tried by the London Jury before Mr. RECORDER.

            . I am a boot and shoe-maker
, in Finsbury-street, Finsbury-square


; I keep a shop
 there. On the 6th of March, about half after five in the evening, this boot was hanging against the door on a hook; my wife saw the prisoner take the boot; I ran after him, and took him, and when I got within two yards of him, he dropped the boot; I picked it up, and took him. This is the boot, it is my boot; it is worth seventeen shilling.

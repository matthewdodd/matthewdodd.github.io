            . I am apprentice to the prosecutors. On the 17th of November, about half-past eight o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner three doors from the shop with this coat under his arm. I ran in and asked the shopman about it - I then ran after him, calling Stop thief! He ran a little distance, and then dropped it, and was secured without my losing sight of him. I picked it up.

            . I am a constable. I was near this shop, and saw the prisoner pass quickly with the coat under his arm. I turned the corner, and saw him running, on the cry of Stop thief! I pursued - saw him throw it down in Orchard-street. He was secured twenty yards further on.

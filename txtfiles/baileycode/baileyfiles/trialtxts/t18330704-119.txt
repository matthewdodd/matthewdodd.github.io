JAMES SIMMONS ATKINSON. I am clerk at a carpet-manufactory
, in Regent-street. On the 30th of June, I was in St. Paul's-church-yard


 at a quarter before ten o'clock in the evening, I felt for my handkerchief and missed it; I turned, and saw the prisoner in custody of two officers with my handkerchief at his feet - this is it.

            . I am a patrol of Farringdon-within. A few minutes before ten o'clock, I saw the prisoner going down St. Paul's-church-yard following the prosecutor; I saw him take this handkerchief from his pocket - I caught hold of his right hand with the handkerchief in it, he threw it down, and the gentleman turned and said, it was his - I took the prisoner to the Compter.
Prisoner. It is false; I was walking through St. Paul's-church-yard, some person threw the handkerchief at my face, it was falling to the ground, I picked it up, and this man took me.

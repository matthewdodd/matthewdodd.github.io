            . I am the wife of 
               
                  John 
                  Thomas Fisher
               



             - he lives in White Horse-court, Prescott-street, Goodman's-fields


. Last Monday this box stood on a table under the window; I had opened the window at the top and bottom to let in air - I saw the box safe about half-past ten o'clock, and missed it about half-past eleven; the officer brought the box and the prisoner with him - this is the box; I know nothing of the prisoner - there is an area to my house; it is a private house.

            . I am an officer. I met the prisoner, on the 6th of April, in Petticoat-lane, with another man, a little before twelve o'clock - the prisoner had this box under his arm: the other man was walking by his side; I asked the prisoner what he had got - (the other man got off;) the prisoner said it was his own property - I said he must satisfy me that it was so; when I took him to the watch-house he said it was of no use to deceive me, he had stolen it, and told me where - I went to look for the place, but could not find it; I went back and told him, and he said he would shew me where, which he did.

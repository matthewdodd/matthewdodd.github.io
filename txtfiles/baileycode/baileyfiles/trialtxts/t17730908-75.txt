            . I am set to watch merchants goods at Botolph wharf


; I saw the prisoner take the sugar out of a hogshead with a stick, and put it in his pocket; as soon as he saw me he made off; I followed him, and took him at Smart's key; he had 4 lb. of sugar in his pocket; it is clean sugar; I don't know whose hogshead it was; he said if we would forgive him he would shew us the buyer, and took us to Rosemary-lane; the woman of the house was not at home, but there was another woman; she took him into the cellar and put the sugar into a pan, and said she would give him 2 d. a lb. she is in custody in Middlesex.

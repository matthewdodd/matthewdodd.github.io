            . On the 19th of November, between five and six o'clock, as I was heading up casks of Mr. Johnson's on the Keys; a person told me, that 
               
                  John 
                  Clark 
               



             had got a man for stealing rossin, and had carried him to the Hen and Chickens; I went there and saw the prisoner; I asked his reason for stealing it; he said, he was drunk. Mr. Clark had given charge to the constable before I came: we had him to the Compter that night; when he came out of the house, he walked very well.
Q. Where was the rossin, when you saw it?
Humphry. At the Hen and Chickens. I am sure it was Mr. Johnson's, because there was no other rossin on the Keys.

            . I did not see the prisoner cut the mat, but I saw him lift it up, after it was cut, at Hamon's Key, about half an hour past five o'clock; I let him take it up upon his shoulder, and then went to him, and asked him, where he was going to carry it? he said, to sell, and wanted to get away; I kept him till I called assistance.
Prisoner's Defence.
I did not know what I was doing.

            . The two women at the bar came into my shop to buy a cap.
Q. What are you?
H. Crawley. I sell old cloaths
. I missed a cloak and shirt after they were gone. I took them up, and charged them with taking them.

             confessed she had taken them.
Q. What said Durning?

Q. from Davis. Did not you give me the cloak?

            . I happen'd to come by the prosecutrix's house when she said she had been rob'd. Durning was then in her shop. I was charged to assist. Durning said she was innocent, and told us where to find Davis. We went as directed to Swallow Street, next door to the Black Bull, where we found her hid in a closet. We took her, and as we were bringing her along, just by the new burying ground, she owned she had taken and pawned the cloak for a shilling, and where. We went and found it accordingly.
Q. to prosecutrix. Where is the cloak?
Prosecutrix. We found it, but I have not got it here.

Davis's Defence
I went to that woman's shop to buy some caps, and there was the cloak. I said I would buy it, thinking she wanted money; so I went and pawn'd it, in order to get money to pay her for it, she being a poor woman.

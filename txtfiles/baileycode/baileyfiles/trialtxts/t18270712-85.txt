, and live in Vigo-street, Regent-street

            . I was sitting in Mr. Kelly's back parlour, and saw the prisoner going out of the shop with these two parcels - I had not seen him come in; I ran to the door, called Stop thief! he was pursued, and brought back with the parcels, by Mr. Skinner, who was passing.
Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you know him before? A. No; I was about ten yards from him - he looked round, and I saw his full face - it was in the morning; I saw him distinctly.

            . On the 25th of June I was passing Mr. Kelly's door, Mrs. Kelly stood at the door and alarmed me - I turned, and saw the prisoner running with the paper; I pursued - he threw it down; I secured him without losing sight of him, and my wife, who was with me, took it up; I am sure he dropped it.
Cross-examined. Q. Did not somebody run before him? A. No; Mrs. Kelly did not say he was not like the person.

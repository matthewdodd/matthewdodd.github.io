James Dodd.—2nd COUNT. For uttering the same, with a like intent.






JOHN CAMPION
. I am an officer of the Court of Requests. I know the prisoner, and used to employ him occasionally—I dealt with Mr. James Dodd, for shoes.





JAMES DODD
. I am a shoemaker, and live at Woolwich. I supply Mr. Campion with shoes. On the 17th of October, the prisoner came and brought this order, and I let him have the shoes, (read)—"Oct. 17, 1834. Sir, You may let the bearer have a pair of shoes, and I will see he pays you.
Yours, J. Campion."


MR. CAMPION. This is not my writing, nor did I send it.





THOMAS PACEY BIRT
. I am a pawnbroker, and live at Woolwich. I took these shoes in pledge from the prisoner.

Prisoner's Defence. I pawned a pair of shoes at his shop, but I know nothing about the order—I was never in Mr. Dodd's shop.




GUILTY

Transported for Seven Years.

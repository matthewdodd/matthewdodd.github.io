            . I keep a shop in the chandlery line. I saw the prisoner with this carpet on his shoulder on the 24th of December, at half-past seven o'clock in the evening - he threw it down; I showed the same carpet to Rogers, who took it up - I am certain the prisoner is the man; I followed him till the officer took him - I never lost sight of him.
Cross-examined. Q. Where is your shop? A. No. 3, Conduit-court, Long-acre. I was at my door, and called Stop thief!

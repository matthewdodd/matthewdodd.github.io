            . The Prisoner attended my wife in a fit of sickness, and during that time she took these goods and pawned them, she told us where she had pawned them. I went to the pawnbroker's, and there were two frocks and a shirt, he delivered one of the frocks, but would not deliver the other things without the money, and I paid him 5 s. for them.

            . Last March I was taken ill, and sent for this woman as a nurse. I missed these things and charged her with them, she acknowledged she pawned them, and at the pawnbroker's she said, she stole them out of the house, the petticoat she sent me by

            . The Prisoner pulled Mrs. Bainbridge's petticoat off her own back and gave it me to carry to her, - she was not taken up then.

Q. How came she to deliver Mrs. Bainbridge's petticoat to you?
Bugden. Mrs. Bainbridge said, she believed the Prisoner had her petticoat, and she sent me for it, and she pulled the petticoat off her back and delivered it to me.

            . The Prisoner came to Mrs. Bainbridge's house, and owned the taking two frocks, a shirt, a cap, a handkerchief, a petticoat, and a flannel waistcoat, and pawning them; my master said, if she would tell him where they were, he would go with her and get them. Accordingly she did, and the pawnbroker delivered a frock to my master, but would not deliver the rest without money; and my master paid him 5 s. for them. - The pawnbroker lives in Plumbtree street, St. Giles's.
Prisoner . I was three weeks with this gentlewoman, I know nothing of taking the things, as to the handkerchief she lent it me to put over my head.

            . I lent her a cloak but not the handkerchief, and the cloak is now in pawn at that pawnbroker's.

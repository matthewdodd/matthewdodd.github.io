JOSEPH DELWARTE
. I am servant to John Grant, a pawnbroker, in the parish of Allhallows, London-wall. On the 20th of July, at a quarter past eight o'clock in the evening, after putting up two or three shutters, I heard the window break, turned round, and saw the prisoner come from the window—I stopped him, took him into the shop, and took this gold watch out of his hand, which had been on a tray in the window, against the broken pane.





GEORGE FEW
 (City police-constable, No. 143.) I took the prisoner in charge, and produce the watch.

Prisoner. I was going past the shop; a man put it into my hand, and ran away; I did not steal it.






JOSEPH DELWARTE

re-examined. There was nobody passing at the time—it is Mr. Grant's watch—he rents the whole house.




GUILTY
.* Aged 63.—


Transported for Ten Years.

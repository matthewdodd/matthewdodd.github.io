On the 17th of November I saw the prisoner enter the shop, take a piece of flannel, which was a yard and a half wide, from inside the shop, and run out—I ran after him and caught him—the watchman stopped him and I took the flannel from him.

The prisoner pleaded poverty.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

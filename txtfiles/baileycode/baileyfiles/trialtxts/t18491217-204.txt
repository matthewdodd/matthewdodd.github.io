ELIZABETH SURRIDGE



; stealing 1 half-crown, 2 shillings, and 2 sixpences; the moneys of 



Thomas John Ash, from the person of 



Elizabeth Ash: having been before convicted.






ELIZABETH ASH
. On 2d Dec, about twelve o'clock at night, I was in my passage getting my husband out of a quarrel—his name is Thomas John Ash—I received information, and missed my money, a half-crown, two sixpences, and some coppers.





MART PACXER
. I saw the prisoner hanging about Mrs. Ash—she had her

hand on Mrs. Ash's side, under her dress—I said, "You are not wanted here; you do not belong"—she directly ran off—I told Mrs. Ash.





PATRICK RIORDEN
 (policeman). I went after the prisoner, and took her to the station—she put her hand in her pocket and took out one shilling and fourpence three farthings—I took it out of her hand—the female searcher searched her, but only found a latch-key—while we were waiting in the passage at the police-court, a man came up and she gave him her handkerchief I took it from him, and found a half-crown in it.

Prisoner's Defence. My cousin gave me the half-crown; the person who took the money gave Mr. Ash one shilling of it; Mrs. Ash said, if I would give her five shillings she would not come against me.

MRS. ASH
re-examined. A party came and offered me the money, but I would not take it.





HENRY TYLER
 (policeman, A 412). I produce a certificate—(read—Emma Surridge, Convicted Jan., 1847, of stealing money from the person, and transported for ten years)—I was presents—she is the person—she got off transportation owing to her good conduct.




GUILTY
. Aged 16.—


Transported for Ten Years.

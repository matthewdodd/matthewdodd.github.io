            . I live in Orange-street, Bloomsbury, and am a book binder
. I was returning home on the 17th of June, and was in Whitechapel


 - I had passed the church, and Savage gave me information; I felt and missed my handkerchief - I left a lady who was with me, went after the officer, and met him with the prisoner; this handkerchief is mine - it was produced to me; it had had J. E. on it, but part of it had been taken out - it had been given to me by an acquaintance.

             (Police-constable H 50). On the 17th of June I was in Whitechapel, about half-past three o'clock - I saw the prisoner and four others - he was close to the prosecutor; I saw him quit him, and run off - I spoke to the prosecutor, and then ran after the prisoner down Essex-street; I saw him put this handkerchief into his pocket - I pursued him into Wentworth-street, and from there to George-street; I observed the corner of this handkerchief out of his pocket - I stopped him in George-street, and took it from him; he said he had picked it up - I then met the prosecutor, and he claimed it; the prisoner sells wood in Whitechapel; I never knew any harm of him.
Prisoner's Defence. I picked it up.

            . On the evening of the 2nd of August, about eleven o'clock, I was passing through Lombard street


, I felt a person's hand in my coat pocket: I immediately seized the wrist with one hand and collared the prisoner with the other hand; immediately I collared him he passed his hand two or three times and his companions went off with it; I secured this man and put him in the watchhouse. I lost my handkerchief.
Q. You did not see it I suppose - A. I am confident that I had the handkerchief two or three minutes before, because I used it; the prisoner was searched at the watchouse; there was a duplicate found on him of two or three handkerchiefs.

            . I was constable of the night; the prisoner was delivered into my custody; we found nothing on him but a duplicate for two handkerchiefs pledged by a young woman the day before.
Prisoner's Defence. I was going home up Lombard street; this gentleman collared me; he said he caught my hand in his pocket; I might touch the gentleman's pocket to be sure, but with no intention to pick his pocket.

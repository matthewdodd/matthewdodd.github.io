             sworn.
On the 21st of October, about half after eleven o'clock, as I was coming along the Old Bailey, at the top of Fleet-lane, Stevens and Davis spoke to me, I cannot tell what they said, I shoved them from me: I went down the lane to the Elephant and Castle to speak to a young man; Stevens and Davis came into the house; I called for a glass of gin: Stevens and Davis immediately said that they wanted a glass of gin, and Stevens blasted my eyes if she would not have a glass at my expence; I called for a glass; I condescended to pay for the three glasses; they went out before me: I came down the street slowly, and Stevens put her hand upon my collar and pulled me upon a door cell; the door was shut and a candle immediately produced at the stairs, and I was told that was the way: I condescended to go up stairs; I then said I would have nothing to do with them, and desired them to let me go; Stevens said she would be d - d if I should go out of the room without I gave her a shilling; I condescended to give her a shilling; some shrub was produced, and they wanted me to drink, I would not; they then said I should have connexion with them if I would not drink; I said I was a man that had a family, and desired to go about my business; Stevens said I should not go without I would give her another shilling; I went to the door, and Stevens put her hand immediately to my throat, and said,
"blast your bloody eyes, if
"you make a noise or stir, I will cut your
"bloody soul out;" Davis then took me by the head and held it back, and said to Stevens,
"D - n your eyes, go it then:" I saw Stevens pull my purse out of my pocket with the money in it; I laid hold of her wrist, and said
"you have got my purse;" she blasted my bloody eyes, and said, "what purse?" I said, my purse, and I should be ruined; one of them called Jem! Jem! and the prisoner, Ingleston, came up, and the candle was put out; I saw the purse in Stevens' hand; I insisted upon having my purse again, and she pretended to faint upon the bed, and called for some water; I said that would not do for me, I had lost my property, and should be ruined: I got to the stairs, and then the candle was blown out again, and I received a blow upon my head, I thought with more than a fist; I got to the door and called the watch, and gave charge of the prisoners: I never found any of my money again.
STEVENS's DEFENCE.
The prosecutor said he had been in a coach with two women before he came to the Pitt's-head in the Old Bailey


.
DAVIS's DEFENCE.
The prosecutor asked us if we would drink any thing; we went and called for a quartern of gin; he changed half a crown and paid for it; we wished him a good night, and went away; he came after us and came up stairs, and asked what we would drink; I said I did not want any thing, and then he sent me for a quartern of shrub; then he wanted to be free with Stevens; she resisted him, and went in sits on the bed; and when he found he could not get his ends of her, he said we had taken his money.

INGLESTON's DEFENCE.
I happened to be in the house at the same time; I went to see one Mr. Hill, who was bad in the house: I heard a noise in the house; he desired me to go and see what was the matter; I came to the door and saw them coming out of the room, and lighted them down stairs, and the wind blew the candle out.
Jury to the Prosecutor. Was you in a coach with two women before? - It is false, I never was.

RACHEL HART
. I am servant to Mr. George Glenny Anderson, of Dulwich-common, in the parish of Camberwell. On the 80th of Jan. I went out of the kitchen into the pantry, and while there heard a noise of the plate in the kitchen—I had left some silver forks and spoons on the dresser, amounting to between 8l. and 9l.—I went into the kitchen, and saw the prisoner with the plate in both his hands, all out of the basket—I pushed him back to the dresser, and he dropped part of it in the basket, and part out—I seized hold of him, and asked what brought him there—he said he wag doing nothing—he said after that he was begging—I gave him into custody.

Prisoner. I went into the kitchen to look for some bread; I happened to knock against the tray, the servant came in, and said I had taken the plate; I had not touched it. Witness. He had moved all the plate from where I had left it—I had not known him before—the boy had just gone out for a can of water, and left the door open—the plate was in a little, deep black tray, which I used to keep the knives in—I had put it there to wash it—I did not knock any of it down on the ground—I am positive he had it in his hand.





CHARLES SIMMONS
. I am a policeman. I took the prisoner into custody—the prosecutor's house is in the parish of Camberwell—we have only got one spoon here, the lady would not let her bring the rest—I saw it at the time.




GUILTY

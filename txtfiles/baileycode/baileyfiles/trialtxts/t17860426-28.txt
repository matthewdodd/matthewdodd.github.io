Court to Mrs. Wiley. When you came to the house, what observations did you make as to the doors and windows? - I examined the windows, and both sides of the glass had been broken of the back kitchen door, the casement side was broken, the bar was fast on that side and I imagine the other side had been broken, the casement had been opened; I suppose they had got in at the casement, by lifting up the bar; there must have been some instrument, or else they could not have done it.

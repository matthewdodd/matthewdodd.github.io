Charles Rogers. I am a milk-man
. I hired the prisoner, as servant
 on the 6th of January. I filled ber belly, and put her to bed to my children. In the morning she was gone, and the things mention'd in the indictment. Some time after she was taken, and upon my charging her with taking the things. she confessed she took them away, and had pawned some of them, and told me for what money, but would not tell me where. I never had any of the things again. She had the apron and petticoat on when taken, and own'd them to be my property.

            . I am wife to the prosecutor. On the 18th of last February I was coming through Thames-Street, and met the prisoner, and laid hold of her; then I accused her with robbing me on the 6th of January. I took her into a house; there she confess'd, and said she would help me to my things, saying they were pawn'd somewhere in Thieving-Lane, but would not tell me the person's name. She had my apron and petticoat on, which she own'd to be mine.
Prisoner's defence. I know nothing of what they lay to my charge.

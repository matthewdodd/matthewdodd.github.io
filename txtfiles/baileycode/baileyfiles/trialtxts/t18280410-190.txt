JAMES SQUIRES. I live with a tailor in New Kent-road. On the 2d of March, between three and four o'clock; I was looking at the ruins of the Brunswick Theatre


; there were a great many people there; I felt the prisoner's hand coming out of my waistcoat pocket, where I had this money; I caught hold of him, and asked him for my money: the officer got it from him. I lost a half-crown, a shilling, and two farthings: the shilling dropped; I took it up, and gave it to the officer.

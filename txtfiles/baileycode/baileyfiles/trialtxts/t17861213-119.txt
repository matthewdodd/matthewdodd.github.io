                   HUNTER
               



             sworn.
My partners are as described in the indictment; I was sent for to look at some goods at the public office in Bow street; two pieces of printed callico; they were supposed to be stolen from a vessel that was working at Yarmouth, bound to London; these goods were our own property, manufactured by one of our own partners at Glasgow, and consigned to us in London; there were marks upon them.
Court. But how did these marks come to your knowledge? - The name of Stirling was upon each piece.
Stirling or Stirlings? - Stirlings; I have never seen these goods before.
Then by what means can you with certainty say these were part of the goods consigned to you from Scotland? - Unless the name was forged, it could not be any other; besides it is a particular pattern which no others use to my knowledge of this print but ourselves.
Is there no other house of the name of Stirling? - Not that I know of.
Is the captain of the vessel here or any other person that can speak to the goods being shipped? - No.
Nor any of your Glasgow partners? - No.

                   DAWSON
               



             sworn.
I found part of these goods on Thursday, the 16th of November; I was sent for by a woman, she shewed us Hobson, and he acknowledged he had offered it to sale to her; I took him into custody; he said, he picked it up; it was part of a ship's cargo that was wrecked in Yarmouth-roads


; I asked him then what ship he belonged to; at first he hesitated, and afterwards told me that he belonged to the Diligence; I went down and found she was there; and that Hobson and Richmond both belonged to her; when we came up again, Hobson acknowledged to me that the piece of cotton came out of a bale of goods that were shipped from a wreck, on board the Diligence; there was no promise or threat made use of; he said, it was the Glasgow that was wrecked; then he told us that they had taken several pieces out at Yarmouth; and that some they had disposed of; and some they had left at his habitation at Yarmouth; he told me the master was concerned; he said, he was to be found somewhere in Shoreditch; in the morning I took the mate into custody on the Diligence; his name is Blythe.
Court. What persuasion was used to make this prisoner Hobson make this full confession? - The prisoner Richmond began first to justify himself, and laid the blame on Hobson; then Hobson finding that, said, he could tell more than he could; then he began; we found nothing on the mate; Richmond said, that Hobson began it, that he had a piece then in St. Catherine's, which he had left the over night.

Did Richmond ever say he had any hand in it? - Yes, they all confessed; the confession was not taken in writing; I was present when they all acknowledged it; and Mr. Hunter likewise.
Mr. Garrow. You know nothing with respect to Blythe? - No.
Then when you say all you do not mean him? - He confessed nothing that is in this indictment, nor did not appear by the confession of the others to have any hand in this.
Court. Did Richmond acknowledge having anything to do with this particular piece? - Yes, he did; he confessed that Hobson was selling that to the woman who gave the information for him; and that he had left a piece in St. Catherine's to dry; it was wringing wet when we found it; the other piece was dry.

             sworn.
I was with the witness Dawson; I know nothing further than what he said: I recollect no promises made them to my knowledge.


                  PETER
                   MAYNE
               



             sworn.
The morning following I received this piece of goods from 
               
                  Mary
                   Riley
               



            , on Friday the 17th of November.


                  MARY
                   RILEY
               



             sworn.
Of a Thursday night, (I do not recollect the night, but it was the night before I gave it to Mayne) two seafaring men came and asked for a bed; I had only room for one; the other went on board.
Do you know the man? - I do not know that I should; there is a great number of seafaring men about.
Did you attend to the oath that you took just now? - Yes.
What did you swear to do? - To tell the truth of whatever I know concerning this matter.
But you swore something more, you swore to tell the whole truth; so that if you spare any circumstance that you do know, or if you deny any thing that you do know, you are guilty of a breach of your oath; I ask you again, whether you know the persons that came to your house with these goods? - I have seen one of them, but the other I do not know.
Do you know him you have seen? - I may have seen him among seafaring men at a public house facing me; but I could not take my oath that I have seen him; I thought I knew him when I saw him at the Justice's; the man's name is Smith.
Now, look round the Court, and tell me whether you see him here or no? - The furthermost man, if I know any of them.
Are you sure that is the man that lodged at your house that night? - I am sure that that is the man, if either one is; he had a bundle.
What did he do with that bundle? - He kept it in his own possession till morning; when he was going out about five, and he desired he might leave it with me; and I said, he might.
Was that bundle the same that Mayne had afterwards of you? - It was.
Hobson to Dawson. Whether I did not ask when I was before the Justice, to be an evidence, as they promised me if I told the truth I should get clear by it? - He wanted to be an evidence, but I do not know the reason why they would not admit him; I had never promised him any favour, upon my oath.
Court to Hunter. Did you hear Blythe say any thing with respect to these particular goods? - No.
Was any promise made by you, or the Magistrate, or any other person to your knowledge, to Hobson or to Richmond, of any degree of favour, if they told the whole truth? - No promise at all; he wished to be admitted an evidence when the room was clear, but he told a story which was not believed; on that account the Magistrate did not admit him an evidence; he asked to be admitted an evidence when he was by himself, and he would discover the truth, but when he began to tell his story the Magistrate did not believe a word he said.
But suppose he had told the truth, did the Magistrate give him any expectation that he would admit him an evidence? - He did not absolutely say that he would; but I suppose it conveyed such an idea to his mind; Dawson was not present then.
Dawson. I believe Mr. Hunter will recollect it was after the parties were bound over to prosecute.
Court to Hunter. Was that so? - It was; this is the piece marked Stirlings; the other is cut off from it.
Dawson. That part that is marked, is the part that the woman brought to me that Hobson offered to sell to her.
Court to Hunter. Was that the usual mark to your goods? - It is; there was no other ever upon it.
Court to 
               
                  Mary
                   Riley
               



            . What did Hobson tell you when he left the bundle with you? - He said, it was part of some goods he had smuggled, and he was obliged to sink the rest along side the ship.
PRISONER HOBSON'S DEFENCE.
After we had taken these goods in at Yarmouth, we came to London, and delivered the whole cargo; there were several people that worked at stowing them about; the boxes were very much damaged, and afterwards we were cleaning a hole out after the goods were all out, and we found these two pieces laying together there.
PRISONER RICHMOND'S DEFENCE.
We found this piece as he has said.

STEPHEN WILLIAM NEW
. I am a musician, and live in Upper Mary-lebone-street—the prisoner it the daughter of my laundress—I misted a number of articles from my sitting-room, part of them on Sunday evening, the 1st of Jan., and part on the Monday—I missed a gold watch-chain, seals, key, and ring from the corner of the piano, in the sitting-room—I afterwards missed the pearl cross, the scarf, and other things stated—this is the chain, scarf, cross, purse, gown, shawl, and bonnet—they are my wife's, and were in my sitting-room.





HENRY FOWLER
 (police-constable E 111.) I took the prisoner on the 3rd of Jan., in Tottenham-court-road—she had this scarf, shawl, gown, and bonnet on, and this chain and cross was round her neck—I took her to the station—she said, "Let me go, and take off the things, as I have got my own things under them"—they were taken off, and she had her other things under them.

Prisoner. They belong to Mrs. Hollis.





STEPHEN WILLIAM NEW

re-examined. I kept this chain and cross in a drawer at the top of a cash-box—it was not locked—these are my wife's property, who is here—her name was Hollis before she was married.





ROBERT ADAMS
 (police-constable 109 E.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office.




GUILTY

             were indicted for that 


               they on the 4th of May
 about the hour of 2 in the night on the same day the dwelling-house of 
                     
                        
                           Thomas 
                           Garret

                  Thomas 
                  Garret 
               



            . I am a hosier
 and live in Cheapside


, the prisoner Coffield was once my servant
. I never saw the other prisoner till after he was apprehended.
Q. When was you robb'd?


                  Thomas 
                  Garret 
               



            . My house was broke open in the night between last Thursday and Friday.
Q. Who fastened the doors and windows over night?


                  Thomas 
                  Garret 
               



            . I did the doors about 10 o'clock; the maid got up first and found the house had been broke open, then she call'd me, I got up and found the cellar-door had a hole cut in it, that a person could put in an arm and unbolt a bolt, and also unskrew a skrew that fastened down the bar of the window; the hole was in the middle, so that by turning the arm up and down the fastening could be undone. It appear'd to be done by some body that knew the fastening without-side. The compting-house door was burst open, and the desk broke; and I am positive there was more money taken out of the desk than I have laid in the indictment. I chose to lay the indictment rather less than more.
Q. Was there 9 guineas and a half?


                  Thomas 
                  Garret 
               



            . I am very positive there were.
Q. Was the desk lock'd over night?


                  Thomas 
                  Garret 
               



            . It was, and the stockings and the silk pieces were in the shop.
Q. When was the prisoner Coffield discharged from your service?


                  Thomas 
                  Garret 
               



            . He was discharg'd in the year 1755.
Q. How long had he liv'd with you?


                  Thomas 
                  Garret 
               



            . He had liv'd with me two or three months.
Q. Did you ever find any of the goods again?


                  Thomas 
                  Garret 
               



            . I had a search-warrant from justice Fielding, and found the goods in Coffield's lodgings: the pieces of silk were for breeches and waistcoats. His wife shewed us where he had concealed some money, where we found 16 l. 14 s. 6 d. The particular pieces mentioned in the indictment makes that sum.
Q. How came you to have a suspicion of him?


                  Thomas 
                  Garret 
               



            . I was informed Edmonds's wife offer'd a pair of silk stockings to sell to Mr. Maschall, near Aldgate.
Q. How came you to go to Justice Fielding, as there are so many magistrates in the city?


                  Thomas 
                  Garret 
               



            . We took the prisoners out of the city; we took two women also, one was wife to Edmonds; Edmonds and the two women went voluntarily along with us. Edmonds at first said he bought these stockings that his wife had offered to sell of a sailor in Smithfield, his wife said, she had had them some time before they were married: but after the justice ordered a pair of irons on his hands, then he confessed the prisoner Coffield gave them to him on Sunday last; then we went and took up Coffield in St. John's street; he got away from us twice, going to the justice's house, but we took him again.


                  William 
                  Maschall 
               



            . The day before yesterday, after dinner, two women came to my shop and ask'd me if I would buy any silk stockings, (producing a pair.)
Q. Where do you live?


                  William 
                  Maschall 
               



            . I am a hosier, and live at Aldgate, they shew'd me this pair; the prisoner's wife asked me 16 s. for them, which is 4 s. more than what they are sold for in the shops: I asked her, how she came by them? she said her husband had bought them, and that she thought the money would be of more service to them. I asked her if she would give me leave to keep them till the next day, when she should have them, or the money. I had heard that morning of Mr. Garret's shop having been broke open, then I went and shewed him the stockings; he said, he believed they were his stockings.
Q. to Garret. Look at these stockings, do you know them?
Garret. I will not pretend to swear to these, one pair may be like another; I can swear to the parcel of stockings that were found in Coffield's possession; the paper in which they are has my hand-writing upon it.
Maschall. Upon this, Edmonds was taken up; he desired to be admitted evidence, and said he would say all he knew; he said he had no hand in breaking open the house, only would declare how he came by the stockings.


                  William 
                  Williams 
               



            . After the prisoner Coffield was taken last night, he made his escape from the officer in St. John's street; the officer had got him in a coach, he jump'd out on the other side; I pursued him down St. John's lane, and catch'd him in St. John's square, we carried him to the coach again, and to justice Fielding; when the constable and another man to assist him came out of the coach, the prisoner made his escape out at the other side again, but was soon secur'd.
Q. Did your hear his examination there?


                  William 
                  Williams 
               



            . No, I did not.


                  Mary 
                  Condiet 
               



            . I am servant-maid to the prosecutor; I got up in the morning last Friday, I heard somebody go down stairs, and found the door open, and saw no body, but I found the shop broke open; I went and told my master of it, who came down and miss'd the goods and money.


                  Michael 
                  Sanders 
               



            . I am the constable; I had a search warrant to search Coffield's lodgings, we found this box of stockings ( produced in court); when we secur'd Coffield and had tied his hands, he got them almost loose; he offered me 10 l. if I would let him go; we call'd a coach; when it was at the door, the minute the door was opened he push'd the man on one side, and ran away, and was gone half an hour before they brought him again; when we got him in the coach, there was his wife and my friend in the coach with us, Coffield told us both, he would give me 10 l. if I would let him go. We drove to the justice's door; when we went out on the left side, to go into the justice's house, he jump'd out on the other side and ran away, the people call'd stop thief; and this witness that took him before, being behind the coach, ran and took him again in a cellar. Upon his examination he said, that the goods and money were left him by a soldier that was gone abroad. Here are some tools that we found in his house (producing an iron colt-chissel about 14 inches long, a tinder-box, matches, flint and steel, and two gunlets). When I was searching the house, the woman said, her husband had brought home some money, and it was in a little box; we went and found in it about 16 l. and a receipt of his landlord, for rent he had just paid.
Coffield's defence.
A soldier came and left these things with me, and said he was to have them when he came back.
Edmonds's defence.
Coffield gave me the pair of stockings on Sunday, my wife carried them to Mr. Maschall's to sell; that is all I know of it.
Coffield 


               guilty of single felony
            .
Edmonds 

               acquitted
            .

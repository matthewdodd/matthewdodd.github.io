JAMES CHRISTIE
 was indicted

 for a misdemeanor.






HENRY THOMAS
. I am in the employ of Messrs. Benjamin Overbury and another, woollen-factors, at No. 19, Cateaton-street. They had customers of the name of Lewin and Halston—on the 20th of February the prisoner came—he was a stranger to me—he said he came from Messrs. Lewin and Halston to match a piece of drab kerseymere, which he produced—I believed that, and trusted him with a piece of kerseymere—it was 40 yards, and worth 14l.—it has been lost to the firm.

Prisoner. You gave it to me without any writing. Witness. Yes, I did.





HENRY LEWIN
. I am one of the firm of Lewin and Halston; we live in Brewer-street, and are mercers. I do not know the prisoner at all—I did not authorise or instruct him on the 20th February to do any thing or go any where.





WILLIAM WHITAKER
. I confirm the evidence of the porter respecting the prisoner's coming to our warehouse and having the piece of goods—I was present at the time he had it.




GUILTY
. Aged 19.—


Transported for Seven Years.

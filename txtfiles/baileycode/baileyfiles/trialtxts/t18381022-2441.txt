CHARLES MILLER
. I am a private in the Royal Veterans. I was in Royal Hospital-row, Chelsea, on the 12th of October, looking for a lodging—the prisoner came up, and said, if I wanted an honest lodging, he would get me one—I went with him to the Cheshire Cheese—we went on to the College-walk, and a man came up with some apples—I wanted to buy some, and pulled out my purse—the prisoner snatched it from ray hand, and ran off—it contained a sovereign, four half-crowns, a shilling, and some halfpence.





JAMES BRADLEY
 (police-constable B 134.) I saw the prisoner and prosecutor speaking together, and watched them—they had not got fifty yards from me when I heard a cry—I went after the prisoner—I did not take him then, but I did a little before twelve o'clock the same night.





PATRICK HAMMERSLEY
 (police-constable T 53.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the man.




GUILTY

Transported for Ten Years.

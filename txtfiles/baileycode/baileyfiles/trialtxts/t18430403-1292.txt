WILLIAM PESCOTT
, was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
20th of March, 6 worsted shirts, value 24s., the goods of 



Edward Day; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






WILLIAM KEYS
. I am shopman to Mr. Edward Day, who lives in Rupert-street, Commercial-road. On the 20th of March, about seven o'clock, I was in the counting-house—I saw the prisoner come into the shop and take a bundle—I pursued, and he dropped it—a young man picked it up, and gave it me—I overtook him after he had been stopped by a stranger—I had never lost sight of him—this is the bundle—it contains six worsted shirts, which are my master's.

Prisoner. He was writing in the counting-house at the end of the shop, and how could he see me? Witness. I saw him, and never lost sight of him—the counting-house is in a line with the shop—there is no partition.





HENRY STAMMERS
 (police-constable K 315.) I heard a cry of "Stop thief," and took the prisoner—he wanted to know what I collared him for—I told him to stop a bit—I produce this bundle.





HENRY ALLEN
 (police-sergeant N 21.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 19.—


Transported for Seven Years.

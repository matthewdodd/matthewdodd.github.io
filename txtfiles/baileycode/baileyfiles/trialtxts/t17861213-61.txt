I live at the prosecutor's at Cock-hill


; I am a post-boy; I was about my master's business; the prisoner and another came in and had two pints of two-penny; they kept hanging about the pot rack; and I went into the room, and I saw the other man take a pint pot off the rack where they were drying, and give it to the prisoner, who put it in his pocket; I told my mistress: she was going to stop him; I went after him and taxed him, and he came back and took a pint pot, and a quart pot out of his pocket.
- POPE sworn.
I was called into the tap room, and informed of the matter; the prisoner went out, and the boy called him back; he said, he had nothing in his pocket but a knife; then I saw him take out a quart pot, and then a pint out of his pocket; he was taken into custody.
(The pots produced and deposed to.)
Prisoner. I had no pots.

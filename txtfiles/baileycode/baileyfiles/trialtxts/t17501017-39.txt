To prove 
               
                  Robert 
                  Clark 
               



             was a prisoner in the county goal of Newgate, the copy of his indictment was read, for not surrendering himself, according to the king's order in council; which was dated Sept. 8, 1747; under the hand of Justice Fielding.
Mr. Ackerman. 
               
                  Robert 
                  Clark 
               



             was committed by Justice Fielding, as an outlaw'd smuggler; upon this commitment he was put into a room in the Press-yard, which I thought to be as well secured as any place in the goal; there were double bars at each window. He escap'd from me the 23d of August last. When we came to be alarm'd of it, about 2 o'clock in the morning, we found the bars of the window cut; one of them was produc'd in court; it seem'd to be done with a watch-spring saw. Clark and the prisoner at the bar were both gone; we found the machine fix'd with two wooden screws to the window where they got out; the machine were pieces of wainscot about nine inches long; each piece fitted with a half round into the next, where was a hollow to receive it, as the edge of a folding table, screw'd together through plates of iron, with four nuts on the opposite side, so secured as to make it stiff and stronger than a solid plank; the other end of it had a cushion fixed to it, so lowered down upon a neighbouring house; then they tied some sheeting and blanketing cut in long slips together, and fastened them to the window-bar, and carried it quite over the top of this house, so let-themselves down by it into Phoenix-Court, which comes into Newgate Street. Mr. Ackerman paid the reward for the re-taking the prisoner.
Prisoner. I don't desire to give the court any farther trouble, I am guilty of it, I assisted in putting the machine out of the window, and cut the sheets and tied the pieces together.

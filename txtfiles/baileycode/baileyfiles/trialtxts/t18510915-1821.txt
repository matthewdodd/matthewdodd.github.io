Thomas Miller.






RICHARD EVANS
. I am in the employ of Thomas Miller, of Bermondsey, who deals in rags. I was with him when he purchased twenty-five tons of

rags of Mr. Hollingsworth—they were damaged and wet—Mr. Miller hired a marsh at Marshgate-lane, Stratford, to dry them on—on 15th Aug. there were a quantity drying there, and on 16th Aug. I missed about 21/2 cwt.—I taw them again the same day at Bow station, in the possession of Storey—these are them (produced)—I know them by their being burnt, and smelling of cheese they were burnt in a fire, and there was a chese-floor underneath—I packed and sorted them myself.





WILLIAM STOREY
 (policeman, K 149). On the morning of 16th Aug., about 6 o'clock, I saw the prisoner and three other men coming from Stratford to Old Ford, and about a mile off from this marsh—the prisoner was carrying a sack, but dropped it as soon as he saw me, and they all ran away across the fields—Holden, who was with roe, took one of them, and gave him up to the sergeant, but he got away from him, and the others escaped—I took the prisoner on the 20th, in company with Holden, at his mother's house, in Old Ford-lane—I am quite sure he is the man who was carrying the sack—I knew him before—I took possession of the sack—these rags are a portion of its contents.





JOSIPH HOLDEN
 (policeman, K 427). I was with Storey on the morning of the 16th, and saw the prisoner and three others carrying the sack—I am quite sure the prisoner is the man—I know him well—he threw down the bag, and they all ran away—I was present on the 20th, when the prisoner was taken.

Primer's Defence. The three men asked me to carry the bag for them.




GUILTY
. Aged 19.—He was further charged with having been convicted, at Maidstone, on 15th Oct., 1850, and at this Court, on 25th Nov., 1844: to both of which he pleaded Guilty.—

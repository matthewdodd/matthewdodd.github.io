            . I am a watchman. Mr. Kirkley is a livery stable-keeper
, in Cumberland-mews North


, near to Williams'- mews; I received information a quarter before seven o'clock on the morning of the 11th of January, and saw the prisoners two or three hundred yards from the mews; I took the glasses from Smith, and said,"You are the very lad I am looking for;" I gave him into custody, then pursued Hilbert, who had run away, and took him.

            . I saw the prisoner in Williams'-mews, Adam-street, not far from Mr. Kirkley's premises. I gave information to the watchman.
EDWARD KIRKLEY. I am a livery stable-keeper -These four glasses are mine; I can be quite positive of two of them, by some lace on the frame, which matches the lace on the chaise - I had lent my chaise to Mr. 
               Martin
             the day before, and they were on his premises, next to his chaises: they are worth 8l.

I am the sister of the last witness; I know the things were missing, and I saw them when brought into the house, the patrole brought them.
PATRICK FLINT sworn.
I am a patrole belonging to the parish of St. Giles's; the 31st of December about half past nine I and my partner were coming up Great Russel-street, we were met by a gentleman who informed us that No. 19, had been robbed of some wet linen, we went in pursuit of the linen, we went into a house in New-street, a private house, I found the prisoners and the linen in the rooms, it might then want a quarter to ten, Tobin sat on the bed side close by the fire, the other sat at another seat facing the fire, when I opened the door Tobin threw himself flat on the bed; I told my partner to stand at the door, I had a great suspicion that the things were in that room; I went into the room, and Stanson he had two handkerchiefs and a pair of pockets in his hand, and he immediately attempted to put them under the fire place; I went to him and clapped my hand on his shoulder and stopped him before he got them under the place; I saw no more of Tobin than throwing himself on the bed, andthe rest of the property lay under the bed on the floor that he lay upon; I brought away all I could find at the time; I produce all I brought away; I have put nothing with them.
Mr. Garrow. This room you searched was Stanson's? - So I understand since.
Q. This young man Tobin lived at his father's at another place? - I don't know.

             sworn.
I am a patrole; I and my partner were coming down Russel-street, and we met a gentleman in the street who informed us of this robbery; my partner and I went to three or four different houses, at last we went to the house in New-street, and were informed by the man that keeps the house, we went up stairs, and went into a room, my partner went in before me, Tobin was on the bed, and the other was by the fire, and then my partner goes and stoops under the bed and took out a parcel of wet linen, and gave it to me; I put it under my arm, and then we tied them both together and brought them to the watch-house, we took them to No. 19 first, where they took the linen from, and two ladies came down and said, it was their property; from that we took them to the watch-house; my partner kept the things all the time; I don't know the things, my partner does.
Mr. Garrow. Do you know whose room it was? - The house belongs to one Carrell.

(The things produced and deposed to.
Prisoner Tobin. I know nothing at all about them.
Prisoner Stanson. On Monday night this young man and me went up stairs together, and the two women that were in the room had gone out, we met a man and woman on the stairs when we went in, we had not been in above five minutes before these two patroles came and took us both, they said, they wanted to look for a man; I asked them if it was either of us; they said, no; I was sitting by the fire and he was laying on the bed at the same time; the room does not belong to me, that man has sworn false as God is true; the room belongs to a woman that is on the town; there is always somebody or other coming into it; I am innocent of the affair.

            ; I am a pavior, my son is a pavior and lives at home with me; I live in Crown-street, Soho.
Q. Had he any thing to do with the apartment in New-street? - I don't know; he asked me Monday night what work he must go upon the next morning? I told him and said, that he must go and seek for a labourer to help, accordingly he went and met with a man in Oxford-road; he wanted a man to wheel the barrow and throw stones; this was about seven o'clock; he went and found this man Stanson; he had never laboured for us before; it is usual to seek for strangers for labourers.
Q. With respect to his meeting with Stanson and going to New-street, do you know any thing morethan you have told? - No, I don't; he is going of twenty years of age; he is a good son and an honest lad.
The prisoner Tobin called two more witnesses who gave him a good character.

In my coat pocket behind—I fancied I felt my pocket picked—I turned round, and saw the prisoner—he ran—I pursued, and caught him—I found the purse on him, and handed it over to the policeman—this is my purse—(looking at it)—the sovereigns and all in it are safe.





WILLIAM HAYING
. I am a policeman. The prosecutor handed this purse to me—I have had it ever since, it is in the same state as I received it.

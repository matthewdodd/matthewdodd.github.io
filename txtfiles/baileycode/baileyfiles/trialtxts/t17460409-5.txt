            (to 
               
                  Hugh 
                  Spence 
               



            .) What have you to say against the Prisoners?
Spence. They liv'd the next Door to me; they broke a Party-Wall and stole these Things from me when I was out.
Q. Where is your House?
Spence. In East-Smithfield.
Q. What were these Prisoners ?
Spence. They were Lodgers next to me.
Q. When was this ?

Spence. It was, to the best of my Knowledge, the 7th of February they took an Opportunity to break the Party-Wall.
Q. How do you know that they broke through the Party-Wall.
Spence. Very Well, my Lord, for I found the Goods upon them.
Q. Did you find a Hole big enough for them to go through?
Spence. Yes, and I miss'd five Candlesticks, three Shirts, three Aprons, &c. but I found nothing but two Shirts upon them.
Q. Upon which did you find the two Shirts?
Spence. I found the two Shirts at a Pawnbroker's in East-Smithfield.
Q. How do you know the Prisoners had them? I thought you said you found them at the Pawnbroker's.
Spence. Yes, the Shirts, but the Brasses I found upon them, the five Candlesticks.
Q. What did Bayly confess?
Spence. That 
               
                  Anne 
                  Bayly 
               



             brought them home.
Q. How did she say she came by them?
Spence. She own'd she took them out of my House.
Q. But what do you know against

                  Bayly 
               



            ?
Spence. She was Confederate with her I have Reason to believe.


                  Mary 
                  Spence 
               



            . I was out when these Things were stole, when I came home both my Doors were open, the Street Door and the other, and the Prisoner at the Bar, 
               
                  Anne 
                  Darby 
               



            , said Bayly broke the Party Wall with a Handbrush.
Q. Was this said in the Hearing of Bayly that she had broke the Wall?
Spence. Yes. But Bayly denied it; the Prisoner at the Bar said she gave her Share of two Pints of Purl, and she would have had her took all our Pewter besides, but 
               
                  Anne 
                  Darby 
               



             said she had enough.
Q. What Reason did Bayly give for coming with Darby?
Spence.

             is a vile fort of a Person.
Q. How long have you known her?

                  Q. 
               


            (to - Thawer) What do you know of this Affair?
Thawer. I know nothing of this Affair. But the young Woman that liv'd next Door to Mrs. Spence, had the Misfortune to entertain this 
               
                  Anne 
                  Bayly 
               



            . She was out of the Way all the Day, when she came home she heard of this Robbery being committed.
Q. Do you know any Thing of your own Knowledge ?
Thawer. The next Morning this 
               
                  Anne 
                  Bayly 
               



             was pump'd.
Q. What do you mean by pump'd.
Thawer. She was pump'd.
Court. I suppose you mean examin'd.
Thawer. Yes.
Q. Do you know any Thing of your own Knowledge ?
Thawer. I took 
               
                  Anne 
                  Bayly 
               



            . I cry'd, Hip, you had better come Girl, or I will charge the Constable with you, and then we carry'd her before Justice Dennis, but Bayly would not own any Thing.


                  Q. 
               


            (to - Porter, Constable) What do you know of this Affair?
Porter. I had a Warrant to take up these People. I said to Darby, are you in the Warrant; I ask'd her about it; she said 
               
                  Anne 
                  Baily 
               



             took a Handbrush and beat a Hole in the Wall and handed these Things out to her. I said if she was not in the Warrant I would take her, and I did, and carry'd them before Justice Dennis, and the Girl swore it before him.


                  Q. 
               


            (to the Prisoner) Have you any Witnesses.

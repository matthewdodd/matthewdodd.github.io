            . I am a watchman of Aldgate High-street market.
Q. Do you know Mr. 
               
                  John
                   Matthews
               



            ?
Webb. Yes. On the 13th of this month I was looking about the goods and saw the prisoner go in where the goods hang to cool in the night; I went to him; he had a sheep off of the hook; I said what are you going to do with this; he threw it down and ran away; I pursued him and took him immediately, in about the space of twelve yards from where I saw him first; I took him to the watch-house; there he fell asleep; I examined his coat, and there was grease upon it of a carcase.
Prisoner's Defence
I am not the man that took the carcase; I had no grease on my clothes.

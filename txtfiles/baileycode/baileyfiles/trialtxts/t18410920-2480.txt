ALLEN PIPE
 (police-constable H 51.) On the 11th of September I saw the prisoner in High-street, Whitechapel, carrying a bundle—I watched him—he opened the bundle and looked at its contents—it appeared to be a great-coat doubled inside out—he doubled the right side outwards, and tied it in the handkerchief again—I went and asked what it was—he said, a great-coat with ten capes, and he was going to send it to his father, who lived at Barking—I said, "I will accompany you to the coach, if any one there knows you"—he said, "No one knows me or my father"—I took him to the station, and there he said a countryman gave it to him.





BENJAMIN PLUCK
. I am a wagoner. This great-coat is mine—I lost it from the fore-part of my wagon, between four and half-past four o'clock in the morning, in Crispin-street, Spitalfields—my wagon was standing there while I was gone to deliver my lading-bill—I have seen the prisoner

in the market before—I gave a guinea and a half for this coat—I have lost two coats from the same place in the course of nine months.

Prisoners Defence. A countryman gave me 9d. to take it to Leaden-hall-street; the reason I said it was my father's was, I did not know the officer was going to take me to the station.

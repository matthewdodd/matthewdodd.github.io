John Powell, and stealing 1 razor, value 1s., his property: also 1 handkerchief, 1 dress, 1 brooch, and 18s., the property of

SARAH GRAY.
 I am housekeeper to John Powell, who keeps the Crown and Anchor, at Staines—the prisoners, who are navigators, lodged there in the name of York and Punch. On 28th April I left a handkerchief, a purse, and 18s. in silver, in a drawer in my bed-room; and a brooch on a pincushion on the table—my bed-room door was locked—on the afternoon of 29th, I went up stairs to dress, found my things scattered about the room, and missed the handkerchief, purse, the silver, and the brooch—the door was cut away with a knife, and the bolt of the lock thrown back—the prisoners had been up into their room between one and two on the Saturday—they came down about two o'clock.





WILLIAM GIBBON
 (policeman of Windsor.) On Sunday, 30th April, I saw the prisoners come out of George-street, Windsor—I found this handkerchief on Webb—this razor was given to me three days after by a person who picked up on a green, by which the prisoners passed.





SARAH GRAY

re-examined. This is my handkerchief—this razor is Mr. Powell's.





JAMES DOBSON.
 I produce a certificate—(read—"John Moore convicted Oct., 1845, at Aylesbyry, of robbery, and confined three months")—I was present at the trial—Munday is the person.

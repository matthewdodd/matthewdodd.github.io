WILLIAM HARWOOD
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
25th of July, 1 handkerchief, value 3s., the goods of 



Jacob Phillips; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






JACOB PHILLIPS
. I keep a clothes shop in the Back-road, Shadwell. Between one and two o'clock on the 25th of July I was standing talking with a man—a woman told me something—I went to Bluegate-fields, and saw the prisoner there—I took hold of his waistcoat, and said, "You have got my handkerchief"—he took it out of his pocket and gave it me—this is it—I am sure it is mine.

Prisoner. He said at the office that he saw me steal it. Witness. No, I did not—I said I missed one, and then went after you—this is my handkerchief—it was fastened to some trowsers, and was safe five minutes before.

Prisoner's Defence. A young man asked me to buy a handkerchief, and I bought it—the prosecutor came, and said, "Have you got a black silk handkerchief?"—I said "Yes," and he gave me in charge—I had had it a quarter of an hour.





JAMES JONES
 (Thames police-constable, No. 29.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 19.—


Transported for Seven Years.

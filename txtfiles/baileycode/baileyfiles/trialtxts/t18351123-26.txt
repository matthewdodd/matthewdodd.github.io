JOHN RANDS
. I live in Ann-street, Waterloo-road, and am a carpenter. I was at work at the Swan Tavern, Westminster-bridge—I left these tools on the bench, in the room over the tavern where I was at work—when I came the next morning at six o'clock they were gone—these are them.





WILLIAM PLUMB
 (police-sergeant F 6.) On the 29th October I was on duty in Drury-lane, and met the prisoner—he had the two planes now produced, one under his arm, one in his hand, and this chisel and hammer in his pocket—he said they were his own, and he was going to work in Wych-street—I went with him there—he the said it was further—I said I did not believe his story, and took him to the watch-house.





RICHARD GORRILL
. I live in Granby-place. I was at work at the same place—this hammer is mine; I left it there—I did not miss it till the policeman told me it was gone.

JURY. Q. Was the door locked? A. No, there was no door to the room—the win windows were out—there was a hoard outside—they had got in by a ladder, which was placed against the scaffold of the next house.

Prisoner's Defence. I have two brothers in the Refuge—I earned sixpence the day before; I went to them, and gave them fivepence—I had no lodging to go to—I met my brother, he gave me the tools to mind, and told me he would meet me next morning at a public-house—I have not seen him since.




GUILTY
. Aged 21.—


Transported for Seven Years.

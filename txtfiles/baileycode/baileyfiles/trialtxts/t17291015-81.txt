It appear'd by the Evidence, that the Prisoner came to the Prosecutor's, and order'd to send a full Pot of Beer to one Mr. Burcher's, about a dozen Doors off, and likewise Change for Half a Crown; that the Boy carrying the Drink, and 2 s. 3 d. the Prisoner took the Money, and said he should have brought a Pennyworth of Tobacco too, bidding him run back for it, and when the Boy was return'd, the Prisoner was gone away with the Money.

               guilty to the Value of 10 d.

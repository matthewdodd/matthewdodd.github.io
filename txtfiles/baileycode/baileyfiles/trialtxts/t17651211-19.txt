: the prisoner come to lodge in the house where I lodge, as a single man: on the 18th of October he lay with me: I got up, and left him in bed the next morning. I never had seen him before: when I came back, the woman of the house asked me if I had been doing any thing with my box: I went up, and saw it was broke open in my bedchamber, and the things laid in the indictment taken away, ( mentioning them by name) I had the things advertistised on the Monday, and on the Tuesday he was taken, with my coat, waistcoat, and breeches on; the rest of the things were found at the pawnbroker's.
Mr. Clay, the chief constable, deposed he saw the coat, waistcoat, and breeches mentioned, taken from off the prisoner; and Mr. Sawyer, a pawn-broker, deposed he lent the prisoner 26 s. on the rest, the 19th of October.
The prisoner in his defence said he was a taylor
 also, and the prosecutor delivered the cloaths to him to alter, as they were too big for him, which the prosecutor denied to be true.

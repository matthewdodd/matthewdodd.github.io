            . I am Servant to Mr Monk; I saw the Prisoner come out of the Drinking-Room at my Master's, (the Horshoe in Blowbladder-Street


 ) with this Chamber-pot under her Apron: I suspected she had stolen the Pot, and run into the Room, locked where it used to stand, and found it was gone. I told my Fellow Servant of it, and he went after her, and took it from her; this is very much like the Pot that was taken out of the Drinking-Room.

             told me, the Pot was gone, and believed such a Woman had it under her Apron: I run out directly after her, and took it out of her Hand, opposite to Cheapside Conduit .

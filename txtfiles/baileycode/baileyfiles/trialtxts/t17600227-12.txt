Mrs. Murry. My husband's name is 
               
                  James

            . I lost a pair of sheets and a shift, from off my line in the yard.
Q. Where did you find them?
Mrs. Murry. I found them on the prisoner. I was told she was just gone out of my yard, so I went and took her with the things in her lap.

            . I met the prisoner with something in her lap, coming out of the prosecutor's entry; I told Mrs. Murry, and we pursued and took her with the things upon her.

I know nothing of what she charges me with; I have no witnesses but the Great God and your Lordship.

             - he lives in Ivy-lane, Hoxton. On the 31st of March I was sent to the Strand to take some clean linen, and brought the dirty linen away in a basket; when I came near the mews I saw the prisoner, who was a stranger - he hit the basket; I said, "You have no occasion to bit my basket" - I did not talk to him, but he followed me to Charles-street, City-road


; he asked me to let him carry my bundle, and he took the shirt out of it -I saw him take his hand from the bundle and put on his hat; the bundle then felt not so large - I said, "Be so good as to let me look into your hat;" he would not, but said he was going to the saw-mills - I said, "You shall not go without my looking into your hat;" he said he would go and let my master see what was in his hat - he then said he was going to a cheesemonger's shop opposite, and ran down a street; a lady stopped him; he got from her, and two gentlemen caught him - his hat was taken off and this shirt was in it.

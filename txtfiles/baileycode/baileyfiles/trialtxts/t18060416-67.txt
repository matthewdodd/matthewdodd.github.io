             sworn. I am in partnership with Richard and 
               
                  John 
                  Carey
               



            , I live at No. 14, Great Saffron Hill


, we are shoemaker


s. On Monday February 24th, Trott the officer came to our house, and asked us if we had a person of the name of Tiller or Lake that worked for us; I did not miss the shoes till I saw them; the prisoner was both shopman (commonly called a clicker) and seatsman
, he worked for us at his own home and in our shop; he worked for us near eighteen years.
Q. How did he behave himself before you found him out. - A. He was the most useful man that we had, I treated him more like a brother than a journeyman, there was not a man that worked for us that had the same liberty, I believed him to be an honest man; when he was detected he fell down upon his knees, and said he was sorry for what he had done and hoped I would forgive him.

             sworn. I am a pawnbroker, I live in Liquorpond-street. On Monday the 24th of February, 
               
                  Mary 
                  Tiller
               



             brought some shoes to my house to dispose of; I have two shops adjoining each other; I was called out of one of the shops to look at them, I discovered there was some marks scratched out of the toes of the shoes, I told her they were not a kind of shoe that I wanted; I left the shop without saying any thing further, and went to Hatton Garden to give information to some officer, Trott was at the door of Hatton Garden office, and seeing me running, he to come meet me; we went up Hatton Wall, towards Leather-lane, and we saw 
               
                  Mary 
                  Tiller
               



             coming from my shop, we then watched her into Mr. Armstrong's, in Baldwyn's Gardens; Trott took her into custody.

             sworn. I am an officer. On Monday the 24th of February, as I was standing at the office door, I saw Mr. Page running towards me, I went up to him, he told me there was a woman that he suspected had got some stolen-shoes, I went with him the way he has described till we came to the pawnbroker's in Baldwyn's Gardens; I was behind 
               
                  Mary 
                  Tiller
               



             there, and heard her offer these shoes for sale; Mr. Page had informed me that some of the shoes had something scratched outof the toes, that made me look at them; I asked her who made the shoes, she said her husband, but by something that fell from her conversation I found where the prisoner lived, he lived in a court in Saffron Hill, where I found a person of the name of Tiller lived, a hackney coachman, and the prisoner occupied two rooms on the ground floor; I knocked at the prisoner's door, the prisoner opened it himself, I asked him if he had any wife, he said no, I asked him if he knew a woman that went by the name of Tiller, I told him she was in custody on suspicion of stealing some women's shoes; I asked him if he had sent her with any, as she had said her husband was a shoemaker and had made them, and she was sent by him; he said that she was sent out by him, but they were his own making, and that he had done so frequently; I then left another person with the prisoner, while I went and enquired if this shoemaker worked for any one on Saffron Hill; there I found Mr. Carey almost immediately, he said this person had worked for him as foreman for eighteen years; Mr. Carey returned with me, immediately as Mr. Carey and I returned to the prisoner he seemed very much agitated, I told him I should search his apartment, we looked over the front room where we were standing and found nothing; in his back room (the bed room), there was a box, I asked him for the key, he said he had not got it, 
               
                  Mary 
                  Tiller
               



             had got it, I told him that was impossible, I was so particular in searching her, I begged him to get the key, but I could not persuade him, nor could I find the key till after I had broke the box open; in that box, among other shoes and new leather, I found three pair of women's shoes, I then brought him into the front room and told him he must go along with me as a prisoner; the master told him he was a bad man, he was sorry for him, he never thought he would have robbed him, he could have trusted him any where; the prisoner went down upon his knees, after bursting out a crying, and begged his master would forgive him; his master was going to speak to him, I told the master not to go near him I would not suffer it; I told the prosecutor not to make him any promise or to threaten him, but to let him alone and go to the magistrate, and let it be settled there. (The property produced, and identified by the prosecutor's workmen, who had made them.)
Prisoner's Defence. The prosecutor has work brought in from them men regularly every day, and he sells them regularly every day; he cannot tell whether he has sold these shoes or whether he has not.
Court. There is very good evidence for the jury to say they are his property, if you bought them you must know where you purchased them.
The prisoner called five witnesses, who gave him a good character.

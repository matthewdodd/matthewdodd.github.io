            , a weaver
; we live in Old Nicholas-street, almost facing Holloway-lane, Shoreditch. The prisoner lodged in our house, and worked for my husband about a fortnight. On Friday the 6th of April, I went out between seven and eight in the morning, and left him working in the shop. I went to fetch some bobbins of silk, and had them in a large basket. As I was returning, I met the prisoner coming pretty fast; I asked him, where he was going? he said, to meet me. He took the basket of bobbins out of my hand, pretending to carry them for me. He walked with me across Moorfields


, and stopped to make water by the side of the Tenter-ground. I walked along; when I looked back, I could not see him. I went home, but he never came. When he was taken up, before Mr. Alderman Kirkman, he said, he had lost the bobbins.

            . My wife came home, and told me the prisoner had got the bobbins. He never returned. I took him up on Easter Monday, and charged him with the bobbins. He said, he set them down to ease himself; and in the mean time somebody stole them. When my wife was gone for the bobbins, he asked me, which way she was gone? I told him. He went out, and did not return again.
Prisoner's Defence.
I met Mrs. Hall in Moorfields; she gave me the basket to carry for her. I came as far as the Tenter-ground; there I staid to make water; then I wanted to ease myself. I went and set my basket down on a dry place, searing the water should get through the basket, and went about five or six yards off to ease myself; and I never saw it more. I never touched it, or saw it since.

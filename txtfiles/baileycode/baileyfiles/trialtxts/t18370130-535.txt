EDWARD CALLAGHAN
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
11th of January, 2 yards and 3 lengths of woollen cloth, value 1l., the goods of 



Edward Cahan.






EDWARD CAHAN
. I am a tailor, and live in Little King-street, Holborn. I saw this piece of cloth safe at a quarter before four o'clock on Wednesday, the 11th of January, hanging inside the shop door—I missed it in two or three minutes—I went out immediately, as a man told me I was robbed—I am sure it was the prisoner, but I lost sight of him when I came to Great Queen-street, and he got away—in an hour and a half I went to a pawnbroker's, and found him there with the cloth—he had been to several pawnbrokers—I saw he was frightened—I asked him what he had brought in, and took his hand—he could not speak—I asked the pawnbroker what he had brought—he said, "A piece of cloth"—I sent for a policeman and he begged to be forgiven—this is my cloth.





ROBERT ALLEN
. I am shopman to Mr. Sayers. On the 11th of

January, about five o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner offered this cloth to pledge—I asked who it belonged to—he said his father—while we were questioning him, the prosecutor came and claimed it.

Prisoner's Defence. I was going down Drury-lane, a man said, "Pawn this for me, I will give you 6d."—I went in to pawn it, and this gentleman came in and said it was his—I was not near Queen-street the whole day.




GUILTY
. Aged 16.—


Transported for Seven Years.

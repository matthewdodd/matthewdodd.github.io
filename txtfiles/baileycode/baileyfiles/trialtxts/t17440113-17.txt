            . I keep a goldsmith's shop in Southwark, on the 3d of Dec. about 9 o'clock at night the Prisoner offered me this spoon to sell, I saw a crest upon it, which gave me some suspicion. I asked him how he came by it ? he gave me but a very light account, such as I could not depend upon . I told him I must stop it till I could get farther information, upon which he was a little rude to me, so I sent for a constable and had him before Justice Hammond , and he committed him to Bridewell for further examination . I advertised the spoon in the daily advertiser, and on Monday Mr. Drake came to my house. I shewed him the spoon, and he owned it to be his property.

            . The prisoner was accidentally at my master's house (Mr. Drak's) on the 3d of Dec. and went away between 8 and 9 at night - the spoon was in the kitchen, and he was in the kitchen; he confessed before Justice Hammond that he took it out of the kitchen.
Prisoner. I have drove Mr. Drake's coach, and Mrs. Bell said if I would call there at any time, I should have a bit of broken victuals; she gave me some broken victuals, which she put into my bag, and the spoon was among it.

            . I am an officer. I met the prisoner running up Regent-street, towards Piccadilly, about six o'clock in the evening of the 7th of December, with a box coat; I asked how he came by it - he said he found it at the corner of Hemmings-row; I took him to Jermyn-street, and gave him to Lack. Adams claimed it in about two minutes.
JOSEPH ADAMS. I drive a glass-coach
 - I was ordered to Jermyn-street


, two doors from Regent-street. I got down, and left my coat on the box; when the gentlemen were gone in, the servant left the door open, and I saw there were some hats and coats in the passage, and while I stood to watch the door my coat was taken from my box - I did not miss it till the officer came and asked if it was mine.(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I found it by the hackney-coach rank, and was going to find an owner.

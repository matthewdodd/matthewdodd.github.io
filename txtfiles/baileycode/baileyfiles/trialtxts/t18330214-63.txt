            . I am an oilman
, and live in Church-street, Bethnal-green


. On the evening of the 20th of January, about twenty mistress after six o'clock, I was between Cornhill and the New London tavern; I was perfectly sober- I had my handkerchief in my outside coat pocket; I felt it being taken - I turned round, and saw it in the prisoner's hands; there was a little boy with him, who passed on - I laid hold of the prisoner, and gave him to the Policeman in five minutes - I took the handkerchief off the ground: I saw him drop it; he begged my pardon, and wished me to excuse him, before I accused him of it; he told me the little boy had taken it - I saw it in the prisoner's hands, and saw him drop it; I went back, and found the boy.

Prisoner's Defence. The gentleman was three or four yards before me - he all at once turned round, and charged me with taking his handkerchief; a boy ran before him - I asked if that might not be the boy; he said No: it was never in my hand.

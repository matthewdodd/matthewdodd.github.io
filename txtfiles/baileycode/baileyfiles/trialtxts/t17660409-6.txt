            . I live in Aldersgate-street


, and am a cooper
; the prisoner worked for me: I was constantly losing iron. My boy told me he saw the prisoner put an iron hoop, which he had doubled up, into his breeches; I let him go away, and followed him, and charged him with it, and took it out of his breeches (produced in court doubled up.)
Prisoner's defence.
I acknowledge I took it, in order to make the bottom bars to a grate, that I had at home.

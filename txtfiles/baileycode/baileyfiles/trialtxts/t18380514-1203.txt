ELIZABETH KING
 was again indicted

 for stealing, on the 
7th of March, 2 packs of playing cards, value 3s.; 2 towels, value 1s.; 1 handkerchief, value 1s.; 6 patty pans, value 1s. 6d.; 2 printed books, value 2s.; the goods of 



Barbara Dommenget Lewis, her mistress.






BARBARA DOMMENGET LEWIS
. The prisoner lived with me month—it was understood she was to go at the end of the month—she went without her wages the day after her mouth expired—I missed a great number of things while she was with me and after she left I went after her with an officer, but she was not at home then.





WILLIAM GLASSCOCK
. I found the prisoner al eight o'clock at night in the passage leading to the area—there were several boxes there—she said they were not hers, but when I was about to break them open the key, and said they were hers—I found in them two peakes of cards,

two books, six patty pans, one neck handkerchief, and a duplicate of two towels.





HENRY THOMAS
. I am a pawnbroker in Upper North-street. I have two towels which were pawned, I believe, by the prisoner—this is the duplicate that was given for them.

Prisoner. These are all my own property, except the cards, which were lying about the kitchen—the neck handkerchief is my daughter's—the towels are very old, and darned in many places—I pledged them to get victuals for my child and myself.

MRS. LEWIS
re-examined. These things are all mine—the books are mine—this handkerchief is mine, I have the fellow to it here off the same piece—it is my mother's hemming—I swear it is mine—these two towels are mine—I hemmed them the contrary way—I chopped a hole in this one day, and my mother darned it.

Prisoner. It is false—I darned it myself—it was not that book that was taken from my box, it was a larger one.





WILLIAM GLASSCOCK

re-examined. Those are the same books I took from her box.




GUILTY
. Aged 45.—


Transported for Seven Years.

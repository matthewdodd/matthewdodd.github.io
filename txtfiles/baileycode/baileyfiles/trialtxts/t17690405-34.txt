            . On Sunday night, the 19th of March, coming through the crowd near St. Dunstan's church


 I had my pocket picked of a handkerchief, but another person detected the prisoner in the fact. I had my handkerchief five minutes before. He dropt it down as soon as he was taken, said it was the first time, and hoped I would forgive him.

            . On the 19th of March, being just come out of church, I saw the prisoner make several attempts at the prosecutor's pocket, and at last I saw him take his handkerchief out. I told the gentleman he had lost his handkerchief; he felt in his pocket, and said he had. I had the prisoner by the collar. He pulled it out of his bosom, and dropt it down. (The handkerchief produced and deposed to by the prosecutor.) The prisoner confessed the fact, and begged mercy.
Prisoner's Defence.
As I was going out of the mob, the gentleman came up and charged me with taking his handkerchief. I never touched it. He said he would let me go, if I would give him half a guinea.
His mother appeared to his character, who said he was as good a child as ever mother had, and that he worked hard for his bread.

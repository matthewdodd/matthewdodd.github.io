            . I was sitting in the back parlour of the prosecutor's shop - I saw the prisoner walk in and take the bacon; I followed, stopped her, and brought her back.
Prisoner. Q. Did you not say at Hatton-garden that you did not know where it fell from? A. It was under your shawl, and you dropped it; I believe the Policeman took it up.

Prisoner's Defence. I went to buy some cheese; I waited some minutes - no one came; I went out, and got four doors off - this man asked me to go back, which I did, and this bacon fell off some butter-flats in the shop.

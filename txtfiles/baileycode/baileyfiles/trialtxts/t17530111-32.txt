            . I was coming along Snow-Hill on the 16th of December last about six in the evening, and at the end of a place called Ten Bells Court


 there were the prisoner and two other men came near me, I felt something tug at my pocket, so I looked and saw the prisoner's hand in it, he snatch'd my handkerchief out and gave it to the other two, and they both ran away. I secured the prisoner immediately and took him to the sign of the Swan and sent for a constable, who took him to the Compter, and from thence before my lord mayor, who committed him to Newgate.

Prisoner's Defence
I was on the other side of the way going down to Field lane, and the prosecutor called after me and said, kip, so I turned about and asked him what he wanted with me; he said I had picked his pocket.




               Guilty 10 d

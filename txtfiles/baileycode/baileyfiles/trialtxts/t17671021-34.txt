            . I live in Little-Britain


, the prisoner lodged in the same room with me; on the 13th of last month I went out, and left her in the room; I went out about ten in the morning, and did not return till about seven in the evening; then the prisoner had absconded, and I never saw her after till she was taken, which was about three or four days after; I missed a silk gown and a linen apron from out of my drawers.
Q. Was your drawers left locked or open?
L. Letter. That I cannot tell.
Q. How did you find your door when you returned?
L Letter. I found that fast, and the key left as usual at a neighbour's, where we often left it.
Q. Have you found any of your things again?
L. Letter. I have found my gown; when she was taken she was brought to me in Broker's-row in the Fleet-market; I charged her with my gown and apron; she offered me sixteen shillings for the damage she had done; I would not take that for the gown.
Q. How much did you demand?
L. Letter. I valued my gown at forty shillings.
Q. How much did you say you would take?
L. Letter. I did not say I would take any thing, I chose to have my things again.
Q. What did she say she had done with them?
L. Letter. She said she had sold the gown for sixteen shillings to Mrs Cain, at a public-house; she said nothing about the apron.

            . I am a shoemaker, the prisoner used to bind shoes for one Mr. Day at Holbourn-bridge; he gave her three shirts to repair, and four pair of upper-leathers to bind; and at the time of this robbery she went away with the whole; she wanted me to let her have sixteen shillings to redeem the gown of the woman that bought it, and so to deliver it back to the prosecutrix; I said I would not lose sixteen shillings by her; this was after she was taken.

            . I am the constable, I was ordered to go to the Anchor and Crown in Fleet-market, where the prisoner owned she had sold the gown; I told the man of the house what I came about, and his wife delivered the gown to me, and I carried it to Guildhall.

            ; the prisoner said in my hearing she had taken and worn the apron, and carried it back again, and put it in the drawer, but it was never seen after; she said she wanted to speak to me; I went into the yard with her; she said she was not the person that was left in the room, but she found the door open, and went into the room, and took the gown out of the drawer, and would tell me where it was sold, but did not till Mrs. Cain's daughter came; after that the prisoner said it was her own property, and she had sold it to Mrs. Cain, at the Anchor and Crown in the Fleet-market (produced and deposed to.)
Mrs. Cain. I live in the Fleet-market; a woman brought this gown to me on a Sunday night, about a month ago; I knew nothing of the woman; she asked me if I would buy a gown; I said, I did not want one; she said, it is Sunday night, and I cannot go to the pawnbroker's with it; said I, is it your own; she said it is not, it is the property of one Mrs. Morris, in Salisbury-court; she desired I would lend her 2 s. upon it, and said, she had not had a morsel to day; I lent her 2 s. I said, do you come for the gown to-morrow morning; she said she would; my maid said it is a pretty colour, she should like it, if I could get it for a guinea; I never opened it, nor looked at it; the next morning the woman came, and gave me the money I lent her, and said, if I had a mind for it, the price was 16 s. I said, if there is any dispute about it, bring me my money, and you shall have your gown again; that same day I saw the prisoner, who said it was her gown; I asked her if she had had the money; she said she had; I said, how came you to sell your gown; she said, she sold it for want.
Prisoner's defence.
I never knew that Mrs. Letter had such a gown in her house; the reason I quitted my lodging was, I owed her a little money, and could not pay.

            . I am a porter
. The prisoner was waiter
 at the White-Horse cellar, Piccadilly; we slept in the same room: I lost a blue silk purse and forty-nine guineas out of my box. The box was locked; I saw the money in it on Sunday, and missed it on Tuesday morning. The prisoner slept with me on Sunday night, and absconded on Monday afternoon about five o'clock. We found him at Westminster, at one Newman's, a private lodging house. He had nineteen guineas and a half upon him in a purse (the money produced by Wright) Here is one guinea particularly marked, I can swear to it; I had taken a deal of notice of it: A goldsmith was going to clip it with a pair of shears, I prevented him, and told him I would run the risque of getting rid of it.
H. Wright. I apprehended the prisoner, and found the money upon him, and a key; I tried the key to the box, the money was taken out of, but it would not open it.
Prisoner's Defence.
The money is my own, I came very honestly by it; I had saved it up in the different services where I lived.
Q. to the prosecutor. What did he do with his things?
Prosecutor. His things were tied in a handkerchief, and put under the stairs, in the way out of doors. He used to keep them up three pair of stairs.
The prisoner called eleven winesses, who had known him a great many years, and gave him a good character.

JOHN STEVENS
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
9th of February, one handkerchief, value 3s., the goods of 



Thomas Allen, from his person.






THOMAS ALLEN
. I am a pawnbroker, and live in Lower-street, Islington. On the 9th of February I was going over Blackfriars-bridge, from the City, and just as I got towards the Surrey side I felt a jerk, and my pocket was lightened—I felt and missed my handkerchief—before I could turn, a lad came across the road and asked me if I had not lost a handkerchief—I said I had—he told me he had seen the thief take the handkerchief from my pocket—I turned back and the prisoner was pointed out to me—I collared him—a person ran and told the policeman—the prisoner threw the handkerchief over the bridge, but it was found—this is it, it is mine—(examining it.)

Prisoner. Q. Did you see me? A. I saw you after I turned round—I cannot say I saw you take it—I was told you took it.





THOMAS BARNES
 (City police-constable No. 96.) On the 9th of February I was on duty, and a person named Griffiths came and told me something—I came and took the prisoner, and as he was crossing the road, he threw the handkerchief over the bridge—I called to a waterman to pick it up, and bring it to me—this is it—(producing it.)

Prisoner's Defence. I was returning from taking a walk—I saw three little boys—they looked very hard at me, and one of them threw down a handkerchief—a young man said to me, "There is a handkerchief—I took it up—he said, "You are not going to have it"—I said I had as much right to it as he had, and I would heave it away, and I threw it over—I had an opportunity of running away if I had thought proper—I am not guilty of the charge—the lad Griffiths, who was against me, there is no doubt that he committed the robbery—he was afraid of coming forward, as he thought he should be accused of it.




GUILTY
.† Aged 20.—


Transported for Ten Years.

Sixth Jury, Before Mr. Sergeant Arabin.

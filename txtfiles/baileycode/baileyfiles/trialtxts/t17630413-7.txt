            . On the 29th of March last a fire broke out near Wapping new stairs



, in the night, I carried what little things I had to a neighbour's house, and left them there, among which were eight guineas, a 5 s. 3 d. and half a crown; when they were missing, the boy at the bar was examined about it; he owned he had taken the money, and gave some of it to his mother, and said he told her he had found it at the fire; he is about twelve years old.

On the 6th of this instant the boy confessed he went into a room and took a handkerchief, and had got another boy to pawn it for 8 d. he confessed also he had taken a 5 s. 3 d. piece, a half crown, and a guinea, that was the property of my brother; after that he confessed to the taking three guineas, and soon after to the taking eight.
Q What do you know of the mother?
Montague. She has lodged in my house pretty near four years, she works very hard to keep the boy to school, but he has got into an ill habit.

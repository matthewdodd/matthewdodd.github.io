1748. 




WILLIAM QUINLAN
 was indicted

 for stealing on the 
22nd of June, 1 handkerchief, value 6d.; the goods of 



William Boggis from his person; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






WILLIAM BOGGIS
. I live in Waterloo-road. About eleven o'clock on the 22nd of June, the prisoner came in and maked if I wanted to buy some matches—he went out, and soon afterwards I missed my handkerchief—I ran out and saw him tossing up with some boys—I saw my handkerchief in his pocket—he drew it out and gave it me—this is it—I had it in my pocket when he was speaking to me.

Prisoner I found it by a wheel-barrow, and had it five minuter and then he came and said, "I understand you have a handkerchief of mine?"—I said, "Yes—is this yours?" Witness No—he solemnly denied that he had it.





GEORGE SMITH
. I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction from Mr. Clarks's office (read)—the prisoner is the person who went tried at Guildford.

Prisoner I was coming down the New Cut, and found this handkerchief lying by a wheelbarrow.




GUILTY
. Aged 15.—


Transported for Seven Years.

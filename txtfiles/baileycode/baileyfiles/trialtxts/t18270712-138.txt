            . I have a wharf at Greenwich


. On the 10th of May, about six o'clock in the morning, I saw some iron put out of some boats into one of our lug-boats; there was no one with it, but about six o'clock the prisoner and another person came to me, and asked me to buy it; I lent them a rope to get it in, and asked where they got it; the prisoner said he got it up in ballast-bags; it weighed about 9 cwt. 3 qrs.; I paid him 2l. 13s. 6d. for it; it remained in the scale till Dodd, our clerk, came; and on the 13th Mr. Thomas saw and claimed it.
Prisoner. Q. Did I bring it to you? A. Yes; you made the rope fast to it, and took the money.

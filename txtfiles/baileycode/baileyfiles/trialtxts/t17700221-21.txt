            . I live in Castle-street, Seven Dials


. I had been out, and going up to my room, about one o'clock on Saturday last, I met the prisoner coming down softly, with her hand on the wall. I mistrusted she had take something, and said, she had something that did not belong to her.
Q. Did you know her before?
M. Rail. No, I did not. This was on my stairs; my room is up three pair of stairs. I took her down to the two pair of stairs room belonging to Ann Mayner, and locked her in, while I went up to see what things were missing. I missed a shirt, a cardinal, and two caps. I came down to her, and

             delivered the things to me.

            . On the 17th of this month, Mrs. Rail pulled the prisoner into my room, and locked her in. I saw her drop this shirt and cloke in my room; and I searched her, and took two caps from out of her bosom. (Produced and deposed to.)
Prisoner's Defence.
I went up to enquire for one Mrs. Jones. I met the woman; she said, No Mrs. Jones lived there. I had these things under my arm. Then I said, it is a sad thing; for I had got a bundle that did not belong to Mrs. Jones.

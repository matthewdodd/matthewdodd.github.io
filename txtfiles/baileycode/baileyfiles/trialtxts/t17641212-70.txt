Hezekiah Philips. About six weeks ago, my son and I were coming up Cheapside


, between seven and eight at night; a young gentleman came to me, and said, Sir, I believe your pocket has been picked: I felt, and found I had lost my handkerchief; said he, there are three or four of them run towards the Mansion-house; my son saw four men run across the way, by the Poultry-compter; he took hold of the prisoner, and my handkerchief was soon produced to me. My son is obliged to be on business to day. so could not attend.

            . The prosecutor's son had hold of the prisoner; I being a constable, and just by, was directly charged with him; I took four handkerchiefs from him; and a master-butcher, in my presence, took this handkerchief out of the waistband of his breeches. (Produced and deposed to by prosecutor).

Prisoner's Defence.

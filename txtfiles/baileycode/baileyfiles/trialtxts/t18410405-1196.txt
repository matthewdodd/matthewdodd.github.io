HENRY SUTTON
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
6th of April, 5lbs. weight of pork, value 3s.; 3lbs. weight of dripping, value 1s.; 1 dish, value 8d.; 1 basin, value 2d.; and 2 plates, value 4d.; the goods of 



Elizabeth Ann Isherwood.






ELIZABETH ANN ISHERWOOD
. I am a widow, and live in Northalt-road, Paddington. On the 6th of April, at eleven o'clock at night, I saw

the articles stated, safe in the wash-house, a few yards from the house—I missed them a little after five next morning—the door was not locked—I gave information to a policeman, and told him to go to a public-house adjoining, as I suspected a party of men who frequented it—I have frequently seen the prisoner.





OTHO HENRY STEED
. I am a policeman. In consequence of information from the prosecutrix, I went into the tap-room of this public-house—I found the prisoner, with three others, putting some fat out of a blue pie-dish on some bread, and underneath the seat where he was sitting I found this piece of pork and these plates—the prisoner said he had eaten none of it—I took off his shoes, which I compared with, some marks on a flower-border, in the prosecutrix's yard, and they fitted exactly—I also tried the other men's shoes, but his were the only shoes that fitted—the other three were committed, but no bill was found against them.

MRS. ISHERWOOD
re-examined. I am sure this meat is what I lost—I cannot swear to the basin and dish—I believe them to be mine—I lost things of that description—the pork I can swear to.

Prisoner's Defence. I am as innocent as a child unborn; I only saw it on the table in the tap-room.




GUILTY
.† Aged 19.—


Transported for Seven Years.

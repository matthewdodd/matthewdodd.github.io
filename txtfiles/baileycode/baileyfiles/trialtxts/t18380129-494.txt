 was indicted

CHRISTOPHER SHOULER
. I am shopman to Thomas Winsted Green and others, of No. 88, Judd-street; they are linen-drapery. On the 13th of January I had a hearth-rug hanging inside the door—I am sure it was inside—I saw it in the evening quite safe, as late as nine o'clock—I saw the prisoner take it from the door at half-past ten o'clock—I ran after him, and saw him throw it down a gentleman's area—I followed him, called "Stop thief," and a gentleman came out of a public-house, and took him—I am sure I had not lost sight of him—I then went back to the area gate, and got it—this is it.





GEORGE SMITH
 (police-constable E 110.) I took the prisoner, and have the rag.

Primer. I was going up the street, and turned down the first turning to go to my lodgings—there was a cry of "Stop thief," and a boy ran past me, a person came out, and stopped me.

Witness. There was no other person in the street.




GUILTY
. Aged 17.—


Transported for Seven Years.

            . On the 1st of December, between nine and ten o'clock, I saw the prisoners at the Elephant and Castle, public-house, Camden-town, coming towards Battle-bridge. Knowing Cassimere, I followed them to the Wheatsheaf, they parted there. I missed them, they joined again - I lost sight of them, and in a few minutes they came down Maiden-lane - Cassimere had the coat under his arm. I secured them, and told them I had been watching them for half an hour. Cassimere said he knew nothing of it.
CASSIMERE'S Defence. I picked it up.
HOOPER'S Defence. I know nothing of it.

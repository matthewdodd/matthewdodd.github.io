The Prosecutor said, that he was in a Garden, news was brought him that he was Robbed, upon which he and his Servant ran, and a Porter seeing them run followed them, upon which the Porter overtook the Prisoner in Grays-Inn-fields, who threw down the things and would have made his escape, but however he laid hold and seiz'd him. The Prisoner denied the Fact, saying he did not Steal any thing, but found them in the middle of the Fields, but could not prove it or call any to his Reputation. The Jury thereupon found him 

               Guilty

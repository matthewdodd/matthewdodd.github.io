            . I am carman
 to Mr. Benton. On the 18th of January my coat hung on the railings at Mr. Sutton's, Rupert-street


, while I filled a rubbish cart. I missed it, and saw the prisoner running with it on his arm,about twelve yards off. Mr. Hall and I pursued, and secured him. I saw him throw the coat down, and am sure he is the man.

                  HALL
               



            . I am a cooper, and live in Lemon-street, Goodman's-fields. About five o'clock in the evening I was going along Rupert-street, where two carts were loading; Gobby hallooed out, and I saw the prisoner run across the road with the coat on his shoulder. I secured him in Great Prescot-street without losing sight of him - two others appeared to be in his company. He dropped the coat.

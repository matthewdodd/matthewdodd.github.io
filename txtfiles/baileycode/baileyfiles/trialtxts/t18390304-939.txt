ANN ROBINSON
. I am the daughter of Elizabeth Robinson, who keeps a cook's-shop in Brill-row, Somer's Town. The prisoner came on Wednesday, the 13th of February, and called for a quarter of a pound of beef, and 4d. worth of potatoes—I served him—he went into one of the boxes—during that time we went to have our dinner—I heard a noise in the shop, and the prisoner got up and said, "Mrs. Robinson, I am going"—he went out—we had seen him there before—my mother said to me, "Have you taken the money?"—I said, "No"—we missed the money from a small bowl from the dresser behind the counter—I had seen it there just before, and no one had been there but the prisoner—we lost three half-crowns, eight shillings, and five sixpences—the whole was gone—we have never seen it since—we took the prisoner on the Saturday following—he was not to be found sooner.





WYNN ROGERS
 (police-constable S 151.) I received notice of this on Wednesday, the 18th of February—I found the prisoner on the Saturday after at his father's house—I found his dress was altered from what it had been on the Tuesday, when I had seen him with old torn clothes, and on the Saturday he had got another suit of clothes altogether—he said he had bought them in Petticoat-lane on the Thursday morning—I asked him where he got the money—he said he was out bone-picking, and had picked up the money at the back of some houses.

Prisoner. When Mrs. Robinson was at Marylebone office, she said it was twenty-three.





WILLIAM WELCH
. I have a certificate of the prisoner's conviction, which I got at Mr. Clark's office—he is the person who was tried—(read.)

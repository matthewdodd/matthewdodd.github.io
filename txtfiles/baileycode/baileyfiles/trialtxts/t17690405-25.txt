            . I am a peace officer in the parish of St. George's in the East. On the 17th of March the prosecutor's wife stopt the prisoner with the things laid in the indictment. I went and asked the prisoner whether she had taken them out of the prosecutor's apartment as she had said, and the prisoner owned she had. I took her before Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            , and he bound me over to prosecute. The prosecutor's wife now lies in, and cannot attend.
Q. What is the prosecutor's name?
Hardin. His name is 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Ford 
               



            .
Prisoner's Defence.
I have no friend at all. I used to get my living by charing.

JOSEPH BALDWIN
. I am a coachman to Mr. John Ewart, brother to the Member of Parliament for Liverpool. On Saturday night, the 30th of April, about ten o'clock, the carriage was in Percy-street, Tottenham-court road—I lost a cushion out of the rumble behind, which was open—I did not miss it till the policeman came up to me—this is it (looking at it).





THOMAS TOFIELD
. I was a policeman of the E divison, but have resigned. I was on duty in Percy-street, and saw the prisoner standing on the step of a carriage—I saw him put his right arm over the rumble, push the cushion out, and throw it on the ground—he got down the took it up—I secured him, and he began crying—I went after the coachman and told him of it—I am now living with my friends.

Prisoners's Defence. I had been into Russell-square, and was returning home—the carriage was coming into Tottenham-court-road—I walked on and picked up the cushion—I ran back to the lamp-post, and saw a policeman—we went asked him if he knew who it belonged to—he said, "No"—I said I picked it up in the road, and had he not better go to the station-house—we went along, and this carriage came along—I said, "Do you think it dropped from this carriage?"—he said he could not say—the coachman said it was his, and the policeman said he could not deliver it to him unless he came to the station-house, and on the way he said, "Did not I see you on the carriage just now"—I said, "No"—he said he thought he saw me, and then he accused me of it.





THOMAS TOFIELD

re-examined. He did not come and ask me if I knew who it belonged to—I saw him throw it off the carriage, then take it up and go into a door way—he said nothing about taking it up—he began crying when I came up to him.

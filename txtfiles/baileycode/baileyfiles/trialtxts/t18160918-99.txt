PHINEAS MURPHY. In consequence of information, about four o'clock in the afternoon of the day in the indictment, I went out and saw the prisoner in my area; he appeared to me to be endeavouring to hide the butter-boat which was within two or three inches of his hand, among some broken bricks which were in the area; he must have got over the area rails, for the gate was locked; I had the key of the area, and on going into it, I found the spoon among the bricks. I took the prisoner, and went down to Bow-street, and brought the officers up.
JOSEPH AUSTEN. I saw the prisoner get over Mr. Murphy's rails and go down to his area; on my passing by, I looked down the area and saw some plate at the window. On coming back in about ten minutes, I perceived some of the plate gone out of the window; presently I saw the prisoner trying to get up the wall; I asked him what he wanted down the area, and he said he had dropt his handkerchief. He then stepped down again, and took the plate from under his coat, while I was knocking at the door, and concealed it among some bricks; and three persons who were standing by, and whom I suspected to be his confederates ran away.

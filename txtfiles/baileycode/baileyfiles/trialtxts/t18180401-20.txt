            . I keep the Vine Inn, Bishopsgate-street

            . I am porter to Frampton and Co., of Leadenhall-street


. Holdom's cart came to our house with some casks. I saw the prisoner get on the cart-wheel, take the truss out, and run across the street down St. Mary Axe. I followed him to Brown's-buildings, where he dropped it under the archway; I seized him, and brought him back. I attempted to take the truss in the other hand-he offered to carry it himself, I led him back, and gave him in charge. Holdom's man was in our back premises when he took it.

            . I am carman to Mr. Holdom. The truss was delivered to me about four o'clock. While I was at Frampton's, a man said it was taken out of the cart. I ran down St. Mary Axe, and met the prisoner in custody.

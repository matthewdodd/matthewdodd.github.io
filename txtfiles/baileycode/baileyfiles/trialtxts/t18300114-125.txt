JOHN PEACOCK WOOD. I am a waterman
. On the 17th of December my mother had taken the prisoner in out of charity, fed him, and lodged him; I lost my property, and found him at a public-house with my jacket - he said it was his own, and his father bought it for him six months ago, but his father died at Greenwich twelve months ago, with breaking a blood-vessel; I know it is mine by the buttons and a piece at the corner.
JANE WOOD. I am the prosecutor's mother, and took in the prisoner. This jacket is my son's - I have mended it many times. I am a widow. The other articles were taken from another room.
Prisoner. Q.You know you are only doing this out of spite, because my father owed you a little money? A. Yes, he owed me 4l. 10s., but I did not do this out of spite - I have had a very heavy loss by him.

            . I am an officer. I took the prisoner, and took this jacket off his back - he said it was his own.
Prisoner's Defence. If he says it is his jacket he says false - it is mine; I said my father bought it three years and a half ago.

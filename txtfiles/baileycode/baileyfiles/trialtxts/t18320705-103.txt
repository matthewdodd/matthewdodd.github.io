JOSEPH BAILEY. I am a warehouseman
, and live in Skinner-street, Snow-hill. On the night of the 28th of June, about ten o'clock, I was at the corner of Fan-street, in Aldersgate-street


; I wanted to use my handkerchief, and missed it - I turned and saw the prisoner between two others - they were attempting to escape - I seized the prisoner, and took him to the watch-house; I saw the officer take my handkerchief from his breast - this is it.

RICHARD YOUNG
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
18th of December, 4 pairs of shoes, value 10s. 6d., the goods of 



George Wood, his master; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






GEORGE WOOD
. I live in Ironmonger-row, St. Luke's. The prisoner was my apprentice. On the 18th of December I went into the room adjoining my work-shop, about one o'clock, to dinner, and left the prisoner in my work-shop—I went back in about twenty minutes, and the prisoner was gone, and four pairs of shoes, which I had seen safe about eleven o'clock—no one but him could have taken them—I have never seen them since.





JAMES WOOD
 (police-constable N 271.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got at Mr. Clark's office—(read)—the prisoner is the man.




GUILTY
.** Aged 14.—


Transported for Seven Years—Convict Ship.

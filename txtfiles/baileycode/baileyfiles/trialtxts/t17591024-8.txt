            . I live in St. Anne's Lane, Westminer, I let the prisoner at the bar a room ready furnished. The prisoner lock'd the door, and went away with the key. On the 27th of September I miss'd the goods mentioned in the indictment, part of the furniture let with the room, when I came to look into the room. She went away on the Wednesday, and I found her on the Tuesday following. She was carried to St. James's watch-house, and from thence to the Justice's there. Before me she confess'd she had taken and pawn'd the things to Mr Watson. I went to Mr. Watson's and found them accordingly.

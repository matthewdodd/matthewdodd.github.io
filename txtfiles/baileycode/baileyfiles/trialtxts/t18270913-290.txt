            . I am the brother of Richard Adams. of Broad-street, St. Giles.


 On the 16th of August, about eight o'clock, his wife missed three lamp pullies; and in a quarter of an hour the prisoner brought them to my own house, where I keep a small shop to sell them, and I detained her.

            . I am the wife of Richard Adams. I was at breakfast, and saw the prisoner standing at the door - I thought I saw her put something into her apron; she asked the price of a candlestick; and when she was gone I missed the pullies, I went to my brother-in-law's shop, among others, and desired whoever offered them for sale should be stopped.

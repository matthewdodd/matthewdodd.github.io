DAVID CAMPION
. I am warehouse boy at the "Punch" office. On 19th March, about ten o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner and another lad standing round a gentleman who looked into the "Punch" office window—the prisoner had an overcoat on, in the front pocket of which there was a hole—he pulled the handkerchief out of the gentleman's pocket with his hand in his own pocket—I, and another young man went and collared him—he dropped the handkerchief—I picked it up, went after the gentleman, but he refused to come back—this is the handkerchief (produced).

Prisoner. Q. Where were you? A. Inside, looking through the window—I gave the handkerchief to the constable, and have not seen it since—I believe this is the same.

Prisoner's Defence. It is my own handkerchief, and fell from my pocket.

             about the latter end of December, and the things mentioned in the indictment were in the lodging about two hours after I let him the lodging; the woman came, and they staid about ten minutes. I happened to be at a publick-house, and heard something there that caused me to suspect the prisoner; upon which I went home, and upon examining the apartments missed the things mentioned in the indictment.

            . I am shopman
 to Mr. Cleobury. On Sunday afternoon, about ten minutes after four o'clock, I was just under the pulpit of St. Paul's church


, coming out, I felt a twitch at my pocket, put my hand behind me, and felt my handkerchief in a man's hand - it was the prisoner. I laid hold of his arm, held it up, and took the handkerchief from him. I took him out of the church, and gave him in charge.

            . I am mate of the ship
 Martha, which lays at Limehouse. On the night of the 23rd of August I went with a girl named Allen, to a house in 
               Union-street
            ; I had two sovereigns in my left-hand pocket, 14s. 6d. in my right, and a watch in my fob; I did not take off my clothes, as I had to go on board early - I laid on the bed, and went to sleep; I told the prisoner to go away, I did not want her - the Policeman awoke me about half-past two o'clock.
Prisoner. Q. Did you not give me the watch and money to take care of? A. I did not - they were in my pockets when I fell asleep; I did not go to her lodgings at all.

            . I am a Policeman. I went in search of the prisoner, and found her at a house in Leming-street, Shakespear's-walk; she said if I would go down the yard she would give me the two sovereigns and watch, if I would keep the other girls from coming down - I went, and she gave me them in a piece of flannel; she took them from the privy - I said, "Are these what you took from the man?" she said Yes.
The prisoner put in a written Defence, stating that the prosecutor had gone to her lodging with her, and given her the property to take care of.

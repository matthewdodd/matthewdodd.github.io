RICHARD WILLIAM COOPER
. I live in Weston-street, Clerkenwell, and am a clerk to a solicitor. On the 22nd of Oct., at a quarter before twelve o'clock, I was in Fetter-lane—I felt a pull at my coat pocket—I felt, and missed my handkerchief—I know it had been in my pocket ten minutes before, when I left the office—I saw the prisoner close behind me—he had his hand concealed under his coat—I said, "I don't know, but I suspect you have picked my pocket"—he appeared indignant, and denied it—I requested him to let me see what he had in his hand concealed, which he refused to do, and asked me to go up a court—I gave him in charge—this is my handkerchief.





WILLIAM GOWLER
 (City police-constable, No. 264.) I took the prisoner—he took this handkerchief out of his pocket, gave it to me, and said he had found it.

Prisoner's Defence. The gentleman said, "You have got my handker-chief;" I took it out of my pocket, and said, "Is this your's?" he said, "Yes," and gave me in charge.





GEORGE WARDLE
 (City police-constable, No. 25.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got at this Court—(read—Convicted on the 3rd of March, 1845, by the name of Daniel Burm, and confined six months)—the prisoner is the same person.

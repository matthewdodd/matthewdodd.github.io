JOHN BOSTON. On the 3d of July, about half-past three o'clock, I stopped the prisoner in Upper Gower-street, about a quarter of a mile from Balls's. I saw two boys first; one of them crossed over and touched the prisoner on the shoulder; she then quickened her pace very much. I went up and asked what she had got; she would not answer. I moved her shawl aside and found the pot; she refused to say where she got it. The boys gave her nothing.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

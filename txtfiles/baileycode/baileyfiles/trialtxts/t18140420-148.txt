            . I live at 19, Chamber-street, Goodman's-fields


. On the 11th of March, the prisoner took a lodging in my house; he said, he was a single man; two other men slept in the room besides him. I found sheets for the bed the prisoner slept in. He took the lodging at three shillings a week; he did not come until the 15th of March to sleep there. He brought in a basket when he came to sleep; he slept at my house that evening: In the morning, about half after six, he went out; my wife went up stairs immediately, and from information I pursued the prisoner, and caught him in Rosemary-lane by the collar; I told him he had robbed me. I found my sheets in his basket These are the sheets; they are mine. They were on the bed that he slept in. They are my sheets. I have kept them separate ever since; they are worth fifteen shillings.

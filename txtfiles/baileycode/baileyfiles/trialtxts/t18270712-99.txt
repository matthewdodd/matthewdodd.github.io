            . I am the daughter of Samuel Strickland; we live in William-street, Westminster


. On the 15th of June, at eight o'clock at night, I washed these stockings, and hung them in our back-yard. I missed them next morning - I was in York-street, and met the prisoner; I suspected him, and had been looking for him - he was coming out of his father's house with some of the stockings in his hand. I asked him for the rest, he said he had no more - my father got an officer.
SAMUEL STRICKLAND. I found the stockings on the prisoner; he begged hard for mercy.

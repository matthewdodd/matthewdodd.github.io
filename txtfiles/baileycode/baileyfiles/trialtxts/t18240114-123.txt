. On the 30th of December a lady came into the shop, and informed me that some cotton had been loosened. I went to Green's shop opposite, to watch, and saw the prisoners pass the shop in company about ten times, loitering about, and at last I saw Webb take a cotton print off the iron at the door. Green stood just by him - both ran off. I ran and took them both fifty yards off, without losing sight of them, and saw Webb drop it.

            . I live at Mr. Green's, opposite Mr. Cousins. I was watching with Kirby, and saw the prisoners pass several times. Webb took the print from the door - I followed, and picked it up where he dropped it, and seized Green.
(Property produced and sworn to.)
GREEN'S Defence. The gentleman said at the office that it was inside the shop - it was outside. I think he put it there on purpose for people to take.
WEBB -

GREEN -

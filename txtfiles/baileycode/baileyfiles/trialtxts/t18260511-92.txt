            . I am a watchman. On the 2d of May, about twenty minutes before twelve o'clock at night, I was on duty in the New-road, near the Angel, at Islington, about two hundred yards from Mr. Ward's house. I saw the two prisoners - Williams, to the best of my knowledge, had the hamper, and the other was close behind him; I followed them, and he put the hamper into a sort of dust bin - they had not opened it. I found Mr. Ward's lad in pursuit of them - they did not say any thing about it.
Prisoner WILLIAMS. Q. Could you see me carrying the hamper? A. Yes, and I found him in the place.
RICHARD WARD. I am a cheesemonger
, and live in St. John-street-road


. This hamper was missing from my door; I had seen it a minute before it was taken; it stood on the grating in front of my shop, which I was white-washing, after my customers were all gone - the eggs were all smashed - he had thrown it down, without knowing what was in it.
WILLIAMS' Defence. I had never seen this man in my life; I went into this place, and slept ever since nine o'clock, on some straw.
FRAZER'S Defence. I was going up the road, and saw a disturbance - the watchman took hold of me, and said I was one of them.
FRAZER - 

               GUILTY
            . Aged 19.
WILLIAMS - 

               GUILTY
            . Aged 22.

JOHN PENN ALLEN
. I live in Wimpole-street. On the 22nd of July, between four and five o'clock, I was in the Strand—I received information, and missed my handkerchief—it was afterwards produced to me—this now produced is it—it is mine.





JOHN SIMS HANCOCK
 (police-constable E 38.) I was on duty—I saw the prisoners and another following the prosecutor seventy or eighty yards—I then saw Connell put his hand into the prosecutor's pocket, and take the handkerchief out—the prisoners ran up Ship-yard—I ran after them—Connell saw me, and threw the handkerchief down—I secured him—Lyons ran up a turning which was no thoroughfare—I secured him as he came out—he and the other were behind Connell when he took it, to prevent any one seeing it done.

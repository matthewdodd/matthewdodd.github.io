             sworn. - I live at No. 24, New-street, Fetter-lane: On the 4th of August, between eight and nine o'clock in the evening, going down Whitechapel


 in company with another, I felt a person picking my pocket, I turned suddenly round, and saw the prisoner, the handkerchief was in his hand, I attempted to catch hold of it and missed my aim; he immediately dropped it, and I seized him by the collar; he said it was his first offence, and begged for mercy, said he had a father with four children that he helped to support: I delivered him up into the custody of an officer.
Q. What is the value of your handkerchief? - A. I suppose one and sixpence; it is a linen handkerchief.
- WALLIS sworn. - Q. Were you in company with Mr. Nortzell in Whitechapel on the 4th of August? - A. Yes, I was walking down Whitechapel with him; I felt him all of a sudden snatch his arm from me; I immediately turned round and saw him take hold of the prisoner by the collar; the prisoner begged for mercy, and said it was his first offence.
Prisoner's defence. The witnesses have sworn all false; it is all for the sake of the reward.
Court. It cannot be for the reward; there is no reward.

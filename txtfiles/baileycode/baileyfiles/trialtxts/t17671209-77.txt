            , the prisoner was my servant
 a week or ten days; I missed a gold ring, a coral, a silk and a pocket handkerchief; I asked her if she knew of them; she said she did not: the next day she eloped; I accidentally heard of the necklace being sold, and the ring pawned; I missed my gowns and petticoats after she was gone; she was taken in George-alley about a month after; then she owned to the taking all the things to me and the constable, and where she had pawned some and sold others.

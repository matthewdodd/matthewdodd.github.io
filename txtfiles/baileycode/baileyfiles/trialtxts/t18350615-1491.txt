1491.




HENRY WILKINSON
 was again indicted

 for stealing, on the 
8th of June, 1 necklace, value 4s., the goods of 



John Tweed from the person of 



Mary Ann Tweed, the younger.






MARY ANN TWEED
. I live in Macclesfield-street, City-road, and am the wife of John Tweed. I had my little daughter in my arms on the 8th of June—her name is Mary Ann—I took her to the top of the street, in the City-road—she had a necklace on her neck—she was then playing by my side

while I was standing on the curb, as a man was going to jump in a sack—the child called, "Mother, the boy has got my beads"—I saw the prisoner run off, and he was taken in a ditch—they found the beads on him—but he got away, and made his escape—these are the beads.





WILLIAM CHING
 (police-constable W 61.) I took the prisoner—he was pulled out of the ditch by a brickmaker, who let him go, and he ran away, and got over the wall of No. 1, Colebrook-row—I watched for him an hour and a half, or two hours—I then saw him come out, and he was pursued and taken.

Prisoner's Defence. It is false—I know nothing about it.




GUILTY
. Aged 18.—


Transported for Fourteen Years.

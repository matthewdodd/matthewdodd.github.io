            , of St. Paul's Shadwell


 was indicted for 


               feloniously stealing 20 Iron Shot value 10 s.250 pound weight of Rope and an Iron Crow
            , the Goods of 
               
Gapt.
 Harrison


             on the third of April
 last. The Prosecutor deposed that he lost the Goods from on Board his Ship lying at Shadwell Dock


; that there was only a Boy on Board, who told him that the Prisoner took them away. Mr. Beason deposed that he bought two Coils of Rope of the Prisoner, and hearing that Captain Harrison's Ship had been robb'd acquainted him therewith, who swore to the Goods. The Prisoner in his Defence said that he lost his Boat, and found it again with the Ropes in it, and sold them to Mr. Beason. The Court thought that if it was true that he lost his Boat and had the Goods luck to find it again with the Ropes in it, he ought not to have sold them immediately, but have restor'd them to the Owner; and considering that the Boy who was on Board had told his Captain that the Prisoner had actually taken them from on Board, the Jury found him 

               Guilty

                  Black 
               



            . My Lord, about the latter end of March I had the honour to enter into my Lord
 March's service, and I found the prisoners at the bar, 
               
                  Ann 
                  Stubbs 
               



             and 
               
                  Mary 
                  Davenporte 
               



            , were intrusted with the care of linen, grocery

, and other things, together with the housekeeper. Some time after 
               
                  Mary 
                  Davenporte 
               



            's conduct was not approved of, and I was ordered to give her warning, which I accordingly did. Soon after 
               
                  Ann 
                  Stubbs 
               



             came to me, and express'd her dissatisfaction, and desired that she might be discharg'd; which I complied with, and paid them their wages; upon my taking an inventory of the linen, it appeared extremely thin, and in very bad order.
Q. You mean there was not found that quantity of linen you expected?
Black. It was merely according to the inventory they gave me, saying, here is the inventory we had; but, seeing no date to it, I was in some doubt whether it might be right; however, they pretended it was the inventory given to them; but when, they could not tell; the linen which they then delivered was in great confusion, and hardly sorted.
Q. When they delivered up the linen, did you check the inventory according to the several articles?
Black. Yes, and found it nearly agreed, but not exactly; this was late at night, at least ten o'clock. The next day, as I began to examine this inventory, great doubts arose, how such a family could be so extremely destitute of linen. About two or three days after they went away, a very considerable bill was presented by the linen-draper, and I was surprised that all those goods should be charged to my Lord, and so few or scarcely any of them to be found.
Q. What might the amount of the bill be?
Black. I believe, including a former bill, above a hundred pounds.
Q. What did you do in consequence of this?
Black. I inquired if any-body knew the hand of that inventory, but I could not get any satisfactory account; whereupon my suspicions increased, and accordingly, my lord, I determined to go to Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            's to get a search-warrant, in order to search their lodgings. It was with some difficulty I found out where it was; but at length I found it to be at one Anderson's in Blenheim-street: soon after I came in I acquainted 
               
                  Ann 
                  Stubbs 
               



             and 
               
                  Mary 
                  Davenporte 
               



            , that I was come there to search their lodging. They expressed great displeasure, that they had lived so long with Lord March, and that at length it should come to this. I told them I had a constable accompanied me, and they must submit to it. They opened several boxes, and I saw only a few things, viz. some sheets, which appeared too fine to have been their property: turning round I saw a box, and desired to know the contents of it. Upon opening it there were thirty or forty pounds weight of candles. This increased my suspicion, and 
               
                  Mary 
                  Davenporte 
               



             told me she had bought them of a person going out of town but a little before. - Looking round I saw a door with a brass lock to it, leading, as I thought, into another room; there were several things standing against it. I desired to know whether that room belonged to them. They said it did not. I asked who it did belong to. They said to a carpenter, who would not be at home till seven o'clock. I said I could not wait so long, he must be sent for. Upon this one of the prisoners went down, and soon after came up again, and said he would be at home between one and two o'clock. However, my suspicion rather increased, and I went down and asked the landlord's daughter whose room it was. Sir, said she, the room belongs to them, and they pay rent for it. Upon this I went up stairs, and desired 
               
                  Mary 
                  Davenporte 
               



             to see if she had not a key to open this door. She brought some keys, but none of them would open it. Upon this I ordered the constable to do it. The lock was on this side of their lodging - the constable therefore unscrewed the lock. I asked if there was any thing of theirs in that room. They said, yes, a box or two. Upon my entering the room, I found it to be a perfect ware-room, and contained such a quantity of things as one could scarce expect to be collected together. Pointing to a box, that appeared to have belonged to a coach. I asked if that was theirs; and they told me it was. Then I desired them to take the things out; and 
               
                  Ann 
                  Stubbs 
               



            , taking up one sheet, tore off one corner of it.
Q. Did you look on the corner that was tore off, whether there was any mark on it?
Black. I did, my lord, and there was.
Q. What mark was there?
Black. Several dots in dark-coloured silk; that are known to the laundress. I said, O fie, Ann, what are you doing? She then took out a couple of napkins, marked with M. R.. and a coroner, for E. of March and Rutland. I pulled them from her, and desired the constable to put them with the sheet which the corner was tore from. I did not then intend to make any farther search, and ordered a coach to be called, and took the bundle, the sheets and the napkins, to the justice's.
Q. Who went with you to Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            's?
Black. The constable and the prisoners.
Q. After you left the lodging, what became of the keys of the room in the mean time?
Black. The keys were lock'd up in the inside. When I came to Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            , he asked me what we had found, and I told him; but, upon looking for the napkins, they were missing - and Sir John told us, laughing, we were very bad searchers. I went back again with 
               
                  Mary 
                  Davenporte 
               



            , and the other staid at the justice's. I told 
               
                  Mary 
                  Davenporte 
               



             she had better have been quiet with the things I had already taken away, than give me farther trouble, and have more things found against them, and insisted upon her finding those napkins. She said, to tell you the truth, they are not here. Will you then, said I, tell me another truth, where they are? She told me she had thrown them away out of the coach.
Q. Did you find any linen sheets there with particular marks upon them?
Black. Yes, I believe there are ten or twelve of them that are properly marked with M. R. and a coronet, and some otherwise, and known be my lord March's laundress. There was also half a pound of coffee unroasted, directed for my Lord March.
Q. Did you find any keys in the room?
Black. We found in different places sixty-five keys.
Q. Did you try any of those keys upon the locks belonging to Lord March?
Black. Yes, and found five keys that will open eleven locks; four locks to rooms, and seven other doors. One of them the linen press, a library table, and other places wherein things of value are deposited.
Cross Examination.
Q. You say you examined the linen by the inventory, and they very nearly but not exactly agreed - Was either of the prisoners housekeeper at my lord's?
Black. No; but they were severally intrusted with keys, and things of value. 
               
                  Ann 
                  Stubbs 
               



             had been in my lord's house eight or nine years, and, I suppose, bore a very good character; and 
               
                  Mary 
                  Davenporte 
               



             had been there but about a year, and her character unsuspected.
Court. You say it was with difficulty you found her lodging; I am informed you had been there before, and dined there.
Black. I am amazed! I never was.


                  Thomas 
                  Morgan 
               



            . I went with Mr. Black to search the lodgings of the prisoners; and, telling them what business I came upon, they seemed to be a little out of humour. Mr. Black soon discovered a box, which he desired to be opened, and it contained a quantity of candles, which Mr. Black supposed might belong to my Lord. Soon after Mr. Black asked who that belonged to, pointing to a door that was locked? One of them said it belonged to a carpenter. He desired to see it opened. She said they had no key that would open it. Upon Mr. Black's order I unscrewed the lock, and we went in, where there were several things, which Mr. Black said belonged to my Lord.
Q. Did you go to Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            's; with Mr. Black and the prisoners?


                  Thomas 
                  Morgan 
               



            . I did; and they were asked for two napkins which had been found in that room; and upon their being missing. Mr. Black and 
               
                  Mary 
                  Davenporte 
               



             went back to find them, but they did not; she said she had flung them away. We went the next day and found keys and several other things.
Q. to Black. Was that paper containing coffee there?
Black. Yes; directed to the Right Honourable the earl of March.
[The laundress being called, the sheets and other things were produced and shown article by article, and she deposed they were my Lord's property.]
Q. to Mr. Black. Were any of these things so old and out of repair as to be usually given to servants?
Black. There are many of them so fine, and in such good condition, I cannot suppose that to be the case.

Counsel for the Prisoner, Observed, that the marks to the linen did not appear to be unquestionable, but such as might be mistaken. [A shirt of my Lord March's produced.]
Q. to the Laundress. How do you know that shirt?
Laundress. By an M R, that it came from Scotland, and was made by a person who did not know the coronet, and said positively she knew it to be my Lord March's shirt.
Ann Stubb's Defence.
My Lord, there are a great many things that are not my Lord's property, and they have done us great injustice in charging us with stealing them.

                  Davenport 
               



            's Defence.
My Lord, they have opened a box of mine that has not been opened these ten years, and belonged to my mother.
Q. What was your mother's name?
Davenporte. Her name was 
               
                  Mary 
                  Davenporte 
               



            , and always marked with an M.
For the Prisoners.
Mr. Willis. I am a gentleman, and I have known the prisoners several years, they were servants to Madam Cartes, where they were intrusted with very considerable property; they always bore an unexceptionable character; they have been frequently at my house, where there have been bank-notes and other things of value lay open to them, and I never had any reason to suspect their honesty.

            . I have known the prisoners these twelve years, they lived in a house in Bloomsbury opposite to me, where they were intrusted to a considerable value, and I never heard any person question their honesty.

            . I have known them a great while, and I believe they were never before charged with any dishonesty.
Mr. Anderson. I have known them about twelve years, and I always looked upon them as persons of good character.

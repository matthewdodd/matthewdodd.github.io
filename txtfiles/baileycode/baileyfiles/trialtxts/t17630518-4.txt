            . I live at Acton


, on the 13th of April my hen-house was broke open, which was fastened with two locks, and more fowls taken away then are laid in the indictments and on the next day I found the prisoner in his garret at Wallam-green, they were dead, he was picking the feathers from some of them; I believe them all to be mine, the cock and some of them I can positively swear to. He was carried before Justice Lamb, and there acknowledged stealing them, and diverse others about the country.
Prisoner.
I had them, what signifies talking any more about it; it is not worth while to make a dispute, what signifies denying it: I am only sorry I should rob such a worthy gentleman, had it been an old miser I should not have minded it of a farthing. I am guilty, and bad enough.



               Guilty

               T
            .
See him tried No 84 in Mr. Alderman Dickinson's mayoralty, for a crime of the same nature.

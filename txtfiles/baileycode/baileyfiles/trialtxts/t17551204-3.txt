Elizabeth West. On the 24th of September the prisoner came into our shop to buy some handkerchiefs. I shew'd him some; he did not like them; I shew'd him some others; he snatch'd some of them off the counter and ran away with them. I call'd stop thief and he was taken within a few yards of my shop, and brought back.

The prisoner came into my master's shop to buy some handkerchiefs; my mistress shew'd him some, he did not like them; she shew'd him some more, he took some up and said he'd have them for nothing; he ran out, I followed him, and had hold of his coat, when my master came and took him, and brought him back.
Prisoner's Defence.
I was coming home from work about 8 o'clock, and there was a mob. I went to see what was the matter; there came a dog and laid hold on me; then a man came and said you are the lad that stole the handkerchiefs.

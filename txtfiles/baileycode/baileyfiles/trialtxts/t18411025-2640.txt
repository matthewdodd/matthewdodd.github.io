BENJAMIN BRADLEY
. I live in Hereford-street, Fitzroy-market, and

am a carpet planner. I had a considerable quantity of carpeting on the landing of ray first floor, on the 8th of October, at five o'clock, and at half-past five I came home, and missed some of it—I went in search of the prisoner, but could not find him that night—the next morning he was within thirty yards of the door—I went, and took him—I said some children had told me that he had taken the carpet away, and the best plan he could do was to tell me where it was—he would not tell me, and I took him to the station—I had never seen him before—I found pieces of my carpet at three different places.





JOHN LANGUISH
. I am shopman to a pawnbroker in Cambridge-street, Golden-square. I have a roll of carpet taken in on the 6th of October, from the prisoner.





WILLIAM BRASHER
. I produce a roll of carpet, which I had of the prisoner on the 6th of October.





JOHN MONGSTON
 (police-constable S 227.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—he is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 25.—


Transported for Ten Years.

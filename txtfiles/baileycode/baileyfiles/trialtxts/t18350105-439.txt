JOSEPH BARNBROOK
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
20th of December, 1 watch, value 3l.; 1 watch-ribbon, value 3d.; and 1 watch-key, value 3d.; the goods of 



John Archer.






JOHN ARCHER
. I am a private in the 2nd regiment of Life Guards. The prisoner was pot-boy at the canteen in the barracks—on the 20th of December I missed this silver watch out of my box—I saw it safe at nine o'clock that morning, and missed it at two o'clock—I found it in pledge—in consequence of what the pawnbroker said, I fetched the prisoner to the pawnbroker, who swore to him, but the prisoner denied it—the next day (Sunday) he ran away with the money for the beer which he sold—I saw him again afterwards—I asked him what he had done with the money he got for the watch—he said he had spent it, and lost the duplicate—this is my watch.





JOHN ROSE
. I am a pawnbroker. I took this watch in pledge on the 20th of December, of a boy, who, I believe, was the prisoner.




GUILTY
. Aged 14.—


Transported for Seven Years.

            : Upon Tryal it appeared, that Brooks and other his Accomplices coming to the Hill Tavern in Westminster



, and calling for a Bottle of Wine, took the opportunity to step up into the upper Rooms, and braking open divers Trunks, took thence the Goods mentioned; but soon after the Prisoner being seized in attempting another Robery in Holbourn, the Coat and Hat was found upon him, which he alledged he bought of a Woman in the Street; but not being able to prove it, nor give any good account of himself, he was found 

               Guilty
             of the Felony.

            . I am a linen-draper
 on Tower-hill


. On the 4th of September, about two in the morning, there was a fire at the back of my house; people came into the house to remove the things: I know nothing of the prisoner.

                   Wyat
               



            . I am a surgeon: I went down to the fire: I think I saw the prisoner in the prosecutor's house; I went to another house, and there I saw the prisoner tear the lining of his coat and put something in; when he went out I followed him, and stopped him near the Postern; I asked him where he was going, and insisted on his going back, and being searched, he struggled to get from me; I got a watchman to assist me; we took him to the watch-house, and upon searching him, we found in his breeches two silver spoons and a pewter one.
The spoons were produced in Court, and deposed to by the prosecutor.
The prisoner said nothing in his defence.

                  Samuel 
                  How 
               



            . On the 19th of April the Prisoner came to my Shop and cheapened a Pair of Buckles, but did not buy any, and when he was gone I miss'd a Pair. He came again next Day to cheapen more. He look'd over a large Parcel, and desired me to weigh several Pairs, which I did; but having a Suspicion of him, I watch'd him narrowly, and at last I saw him put one Pair in his Trowsers. I let him go to the Door, and then stopt him, and charg'd him with the Theft. He deny'd it stiffly, but upon my searching him, one Buckle fell from him to the Floor; upon which he took out the other and gave it me. This was corroborated by William-Charles Hitchen, who was in the Shop at the same Time; and the Jury found the Prisoner 


               guilty to the value of 4 s. 10 d.

             sworn. - I am a waiter at the Burton alehouse, Henrietta-street, (produces the planes); the prisoner threw them down at the door; I saw him tucking something under his coat, and I called my master to ask if he was at work there, and he said, no; I followed him, and took him; he told me he had borrowed the planes of one of the men; this was about three in the afternoon of Thursday, the 20th of September.
Prisoner's defence. I went into the parlour and brought them out, and they followed me, I put them down at the door; necessity was the cause of it.

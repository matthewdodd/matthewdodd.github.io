            . I am an officer. I went, by Mr. Richmond's desire, into Holmes' room; Mr. Richmond, Jun. opened the prisoner's box, and in it were the articles stated in the indictment.
Cross-examined. Q. When was this? A. About two o'clock on the morning of the 2d of January - Mr. Richmond, Jun. had a pistol - I went there to inform them McKelvin was taken.
MR. 
               
                  JOHN

            . I am the prosecutor's son. I went into Holmes' room, and found these things in the prisoner's box.
Cross-examined. Q. Were you in the prisoner's room before the officer came? A. No - I did not present the pistol at the prisoner.
HENRY RICHMOND, ESQ. Holmes was in my service. I know this knife and fork - they belonged to my father-in-law - I know the plate as one of a set - the counters are such as we use - the value of the whole may be about 2l.
Prisoner's Defence. It was usual to put things into my box, as I have no drawers.

             sworn.
I lost an handkerchief the 21st of June, in Moorfields


, out of my pocket, about six in the evening; I found it on the prisoner immediately; I felt it in my pocket and wiped my face with it; in less than half a minute I felt something about my right-hand pocket, and I felt him take it; and I turned round and took him by the hand, with the handkerchief in his hand; and took him to the justices.
(The handkerchief produced and deposed to.)
PRISONER's DEFENCE.
I am an errand-boy
; I went into Smithfield for one Mr. Knowlys; and coming over Moorfields back, I picked up this handkerchief; and the gentleman took me to gaol: coming along he laid hold of another boy; and he said, if I would tell who was along with me, he would let me go; and I said, there was nobody with me.
Court to Prosecutor. Are you quite sure you did not miss your pocket, and drop your handkerchief? - Yes.
The prisoner called one witness who gave him a good character.
GUILTY,
Of stealing, but not privately.

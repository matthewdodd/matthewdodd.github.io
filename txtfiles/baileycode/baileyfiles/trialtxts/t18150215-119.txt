                  WILLIAM 
                  REDKISON
               



            . I am eleven years old, I live with my father and mother, my mother takes in washing.
Q. Be sure you say not a word less than the truth or more - A. My father and mother lives at Chelsea Common, near the Red house. On the 8th of January, I was carrying things home that had been washed; I was to take them to Mrs. Hawkins, she lives in Couzen street, May Fair, at the back of Piccadilly.
Q. How far had you got, before any thing happened to you - A. In Piccadilly. I got to Piccadilly about eleven o'clock on Sunday the 8th of January, I had these things in a bundle; I was alone, in Piccadilly, Kemp came up to me and said, do not you live in Sloane street, I was in Piccadilly near Hamilton place; I told him I lived at Chelsea Common, near the Red house; then he went on a little further and he asked me my name, I told him where I was going; I did not tell him at first, he stopped me, and asked me my name, there was nobody by him then, he then said, which is the way to Piccadilly, I told him to go round the corner, and go up there, he was not gone two minutes, he came back again, he was still alone, he said, can I go across the ParkI told him if he would go a little higher, he would see a street where he could go across the park; I told him where I was going, he said he would go down Couzen street with me. Then this other gentleman came up to me, that is the prisoner Renney, he said, is not your name Redkinson, and said, are not you going to Mrs. Hawkin's. I had told the other prisoner whose house, and where I was going to before this; he came down as far as Harford street, he said he had got to go as far as Harford street, in Park lane; he said, he had to go there for Mrs. Hawkins he would call there as he came back; he went a little way down Harford street, then the prisoner returned and said, never mind, I will call as I come back. I had my bundle still in my own possession he went as far with me as the iron shop in Park lane, he said, you can deliver the message to your mother as well as I can, that was the prisoner Renney, the man that came up to me the second time, the other man was gone down Cozen street; he went strait on, Renney said, tell your mother to come up, and to bring a large basket on Monday morning and she will recommend your mother to some more washing; he took my bundle, the shawl that the things were in, and said, your mother can have the shawl on Monday morning; my mother had put the things up in her own shawl; he took the bundle from my arm, and said good bye, that is all.
Q. Did you look after him to see whether he joined the other or not - A. No.
Q. When did you discover that you had lost the things - A. I went back, and told my mother what had happened, and delivered this message, my mother immediately said, I had been robbed of them, I have never seen the things again.
Q. Have any of the things been found since - A. No, I am sure these are the two persons that accosted me on this occasion; I am quite sure of both the prisoner's; I think on the week following, I saw them again they were walking together in King's Road, nobody was with them when I saw them again; there was a race in an open place, upon what they call Chelsea Common; I pointed them both out to Mr. Pell, in Chelsea Common, he said run and fetch your mother, tell her to come directly, my mother got a constable, Mr. Pell watched them, he is not here. Mr. Rouse the constable took them in China-row, I pointed them out, he laid hold of them I was present when Mr. Rouse laid hold of them; I charged them with having done this on a Sunday; they said they never saw me in their lives; I am sure they are the two men who came up to me. My father's name is 
               
                  Thomas 
                  Redkison
               



            ; I said I was quite sure these were the men before the Magistrate, and I was sure of them when I saw them upon the Common; I have never said I was not sure of Renney, I was always sure of them both.

            . I am the wife of Thomas Redkison; that boy is my son. On Sunday the 8th of January, I sent my son to Mrs. Hawkin's, Sun court, May Fair; I sent him from my house about ten o'clock, he returned at about half past eleven, he told me what had become of the bundle; I have not found the things again; I am to pay for the things on Tuesday the 17th of January; I saw the prisoner's, I saw them in the King's Road, near us, my son pointed out the two prisoner's as being the persons that were concerned in taking the bundle from him; Mayhew kept the prisoner's in sight. while I fetched Mr. Rouse the constable, I was present when the constable took charge of them in China row. Mr. Rouse charged them with taken the linen from the boy, they said, they had never seen the boy before the boy pointed out Kemp as the person that first entered into conversation with him, and Renney who took the things away, I have never recovered my own shawl. I carry on the washing myself.

            . I am a constable, I took charge of the two prisoner's in China-row, the boy charged them with taking the bundle from him, they denied it; the boy said, the man who spoke to him first, had got entirely out of sight before the other took the things from him, he said, at the time that Renney took the bundle Kemp had got out of sight.

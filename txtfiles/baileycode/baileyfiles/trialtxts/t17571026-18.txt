            . I live in White-Chapel


, and am a cheeesemonger
; the prisoner was discharged from my service on the 29th of September last, being Michaelmas-Day.
Q. How long had he lived with you?
A. Readman. Two months and about three or four days. On the 3d of October Mrs. Hill came and told me they had stop'd some cheeses, and asked me if I had been robbed. I said that I did not know that I had, and asked what sort of a person brought them; she said there were two men and a woman brought three cheeses and a ham to her house in Little-Britain, and described a man in such cloaths as the prisoner usually wore. I ask'd if he was cross-ey'd [the prisoner was such ] she said he was; I went there and saw the cheeses; they have been there ever since, 'till this day. [Produced in court.] As to the ham I can't swear to that, but these cheeses were bought for me by Mr. 
               
                  Robert 
                  Palmer 
               



             at Burton upon Trent in Staffordshire; by the look of them, I have the rest of the same dairy at home. Here is my mark plain on one of the Cheshire cheeses; and here is one of them a Gloucestershire cheese, of which I have some of the same at home, but cannot be positive to that. I cannot say when the prisoner took them: It might be while he liv'd with me for what I know, but whether he took them out of the warehouse, cellar, or shop, I know not.
Q. Do you ever sell cheeses in the cellar?
A. Readman. We take people there to look at them.
Martha Hill. On the morning after last Michaelmas-day a woman came to me and told me she had four cheeses sent her out of the country, and she wanted to dispose of them; the next morning my maid told me two men and a woman brought them after my shop was shut up.
Q. Where do you live?
M. Hill. I live in Little-Britain, I sell grocery ware, cheese, and other things; I thought it was a bad affair; so desired Mr. Prentice, a very large dealer near Smithfield-Bars, to come and look at them, to see whose mark was on them.
Q. Who brought them?
M. Hill. I can't tell that, only by what the prisoner said; he said to me he brought them. They were left in the passage, the shop being shut up.
Q. When did you see them first?
M. Hill. The next morning about seven o'clock in the passage: Mr. Prentice came and looked at the cheeses, and took the marks on a piece of paper, in order to shew amongst the trade in the afternoon. The woman spoke to me about buying them. I said to her here are not all the cheeses you mentioned to me; she said she had disposed of one. I asked her how she came by them, she said they came by sea, consign'd to her cousin Readman. I asked her if she had any letter of advice, and desired her to fetch it. She went and did not return. After that came a man with an order for us to deliver them, there was no name to it. A little after came the prisoner at the bar, and asked if a porter had not been for them; we said yes, he said why did not you deliver them, we said we had some reasons for stopping them; after that came a person from Thames-street and desired to look at them, he did, and said they were Mrs. Readman's cheeses.
Q. Did you stop the prisoner?
M. Hill. No; he went away again. We acquainted Mrs. Readman of it, and she came and owned them.
Q. When did you see the prisoner after this?
M. Hill. I don't exactly know the time, but when I did, I heard him confess he stole them from the prosecutrix.

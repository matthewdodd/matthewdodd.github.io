ANN SMITH
 was again indicted

 for stealing, on the 
25th of October, 1 sheet, value 1s. 6d.; 4 rings, value 3s.; 2 pinafores, value 9d.; 1 thimble, value 6d.; and 1 scent-bottle, value 6d.; the goods of 




Francis Harrison, her master.






FRANCIS HARRISSON
. I am a publican, and also deal in jewellery. On discovering the prisoner with the bottle, I saw she had a piece of rag, which was taken from her by the policeman—it contained three rings, a scent-bottle, a silver thimble, and three duplicates—the things were all mine, and were taken from a drawer in my bed-room.





JOHN GREGSON
. I am shopman to Mr. Ashbridge, a pawnbroker of Broad-street, Ratcliff. I produce a sheet, which was pledged on the 25th of October, for 1s. 6d. and a ring of the same date, in the name of Ann Smith; also three pinafores, pledged in the name of Whittey—I do not know the prisoner—they were pledged by a female—the duplicates found in the rag are the counterparts of these duplicates.





BARTHOLOMEW BRENNAN
. I am a policeman. I took the rag out of the prisoner's hand—it contained three rings, three duplicates, a scent-bottle, and a thimble.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

Prisoner's Defence. His daughter gave me the scent-bottle before she went into the country. I took the thimble to hem a handkerchief with, and put it into my pocket. I know nothing about the things at the pawn-broker's. I picked up the tickets.




GUILTY
. Aged 30,—


Transported for Seven Years.
(The prosecutor stated that he had lost 30l. worth of property while the prisoner was in his service.)

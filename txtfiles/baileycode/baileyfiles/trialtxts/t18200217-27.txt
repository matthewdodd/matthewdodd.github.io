WILLIAM KIERAN, ESQ. On the 1st of February, between two and three o'clock in the afternoon, I was near St. Giles's church


, in company with Mr. Dick - the prisoner rushed by; Mr. Dick exclaimed,
"You have lost your handkerchief! it is in that fellow's bosom, who has just ran by." I felt, and said,
"You are right." Mr. Dick seized him - he put his hand into his side-pocket, and threw my handkerchief down, I picked it up.

            . I was with Mr. Kieran; the prisoner passed, and I saw Mr. Kieran's handkerchief in his bosom - he had followed us a considerable distance - I seized him, his waistcoat tore, and he got off; I seized him again - he made a desperate resistance.

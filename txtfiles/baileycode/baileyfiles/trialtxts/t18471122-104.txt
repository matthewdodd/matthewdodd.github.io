MICHAEL HAYDON
 (City-policeman 274.) On 20th Nov., about a quarter past six o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoners together—I lost sight of them, and saw them together again at twenty minutes to seven, watched them, and saw Jones go into Mr. Tite's, a stationer's shop, in Cheapside—Nile went close to him—Jones took four reams of paper from the shop, and went away—Nile stopped, looked round, and then followed Jones—I followed, took Nile, and went on and took Jones.





JOHN WIDDOWSON TATE.
 I have examined this paper, and have no doubt of its being mine—I lost it from my warehouse.

Nile's Defence. I only spoke to Jones at the corner of Wood-street, and had nothing to do with stealing the property.

NILE—


GUILTY†. Aged 19.—



Confined Nine Months.

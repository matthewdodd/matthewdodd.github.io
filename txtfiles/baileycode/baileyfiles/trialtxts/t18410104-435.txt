MARTHA WILLIAMS
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
14th of December, 2 printed books, value 15s., the goods of 



John Watson; and that she had been before convicted of felony.






JOHN WATSON
. I am a stationer, and live at No. 869, Oxford-street. On the 14th of December the prisoner came to my shop, and wished me to purchase several trifling song books of her—I refused to have any thing to do with them—there were several cases of books on my counter—I observed her make a roll against the counter, and give her hand a swing—I went round, felt down her side, but felt nothing—I let her go, and thought nothing further of it till a policeman and a woman came in with this case, containing this prayer-book and church lessons, which had been safe on my counter, and had never been sold.





ANN FULLER
. I am single—the prisoner is my sister—her friends have tried all in their power to reclaim her, but all in vain. On the 14th of December she sent for me to take these books—I asked where she got them—she said she had taken them from Mr. Watson's shop—this is the third time of her being tried here and at the Westminster Sessions.





WILLIAM CHADWICK
 (police-sergeant T 2.) I went with Fuller to the prosecutor's, and showed him the books, which he said were his—I took the prisoner.

Prisoner. I am sorry it happened.





THOMAS PEGLER
 (police-constable T 148.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's conviction from Mr. Clark's office—(read)—I was present at the trial—she is the person.




GUILTY
. Aged 38.—


Transported for Fourteen Years.

. On the 7th of June I saw the prisoner in the hall, coming from the cupboard, where a basket of plate was kept, which I have the care of; I went and missed thespoons; I ran after him; he dropped them, and was taken - he said I was a pretty creature to mind chambers.

            . I was standing at my back premises, and heard a cry of Stop thief! I saw the prisoner running first, and a number of people after him; he was crying Stop thief! I let him pass, and he went down King's Mews, where there is a grating; I saw him stoop, and put something down the grating; I called to some men to stop him, which they did; I saw a man go to the grating, and take up something.

Prisoner's Defence. A young man told me a gentleman in that inn wanted a clerk; I went there, and saw a young man coming down with some papers: I went up, and knocked at a door, but could get no answer; I went on further, and saw this young woman: I said, "I have been knocking, and can't get an answer:" she then went away, and I walked down. As to my throwing down the spoons, I know nothing about them.

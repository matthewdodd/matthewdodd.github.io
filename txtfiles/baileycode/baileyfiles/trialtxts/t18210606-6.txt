MR. P. W. BROADLEY. I live in the Borough. On Saturday, May the 5th, between two and three o'clock in the afternoon, I was in Gracechurch-street


, I felt a fumbling at my coat pocket, and missed my snuff-box, nobody was near enough to do it but the prisoner; it was safe two minutes before; he passed and crossed the street - I followed, he turned round. I said,
"You rascal, you have got my snuff-box;" he ran, and I after him, crying, Stop thief! he was stopped without being out of my sight - I saw him throw the snuff-box down Mr. Myers, the fishmonger's area.

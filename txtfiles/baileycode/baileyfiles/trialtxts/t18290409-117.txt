. On the 6th of April, between twelve and one o'clock, I saw the prisoner walking by the shop - she stopped at the shop door, and snatched the stockings off a roll of flannel; I ran after her, and gave an alarm - she was taken in my sight, with them.

            . I am a watchman. I heard stop thief! called, and stopped the prisoner - she dropped these stockings in the kennel as she was running.(Property produced and sworn to.)
Prisoner's Defence. I was waiting at a public-house, with my children, while my husband went to Jermyn-street, to see about some work, and as he was gone a long time I went to see for him; I saw a woman in black running between the coaches, and I thought she was in danger- I ran as well as I could; my shoes were slip-shod, and my feet were blistered - the witness then came up and took me; I did not know what for till I got to the watch-house. - I have not heard of my husband or children since; I was not the person who dropped the stockings.

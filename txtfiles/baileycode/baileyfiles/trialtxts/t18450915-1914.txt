RICHARD GARDE

I saw the prisoners together, close beside one another—Hamilton put his hand into the prosecutor's pocket—I immediately ran up, and asked the prosecutor if he had lost his 1 handkerchief—he said he had—I pursued Watson, and took him—he tried to get away—I found the handkerchief in his hat at the station—he said he bought it in Field-lane for 2s. 9d.

Watson's Defence. I bought it in Field-lane, not ten minutes before—they took us nearly half a mile from the place.

It appeared that the Prosecutor hired the Prisoner to do business about his House, but that she went home at Nights, that she was with him about 10 Days, when having a Maid to come, he had no Furdier occasion for her; that after she has gone , a pawnbroker came to him and told him he believed he had some of his Goods, which proved to be so; and said also that he had them of the prisoner; whereupon he got a Warrant, and found several of his Goods at her Linings , some in the Cellar, some between her Bed and Bed-cloths, and some in other places, where she had disposed of them; all which plainly appearing by the Constable on other Evidences, the Jury brought her in 


               Guilty to the value of 4 s. 10 d.

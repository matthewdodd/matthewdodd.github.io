            .
JOHN COVENTRY. I live in Oxford-street


, and keep an umbrella shop
. On the 13th of February, about half-past eight o'clock in the morning, I was up-stairs at breakfast; I was sent for by King - the umbrellas were safe the evening before.

            . I live with Mr. Coventry. Last Tuesday morning I was cleaning the shop; I was behind the counter, and my back towards the door - I just saw the prisoner going out; these two umbrellas had been on the counter, six or seven feet from the door, and I saw that he had two - I did not see any body with him; I rang the bell for my master, and ran out, but could not find him - I saw him in about ten minutes afterwards in a public-house, and am certain of his person - he had not been stopped; my master went in with me; the prisoner had the twoumbrellas under his seat - I believe these to be my master's, because he had wrapped them up in papers, as these are - we lost four.

            . I attend at the bar of the public-house - I saw the prisoner come in with these two umbrellas, in a black bag, under his arm; Coventry came in, and claimed them in a few minutes; nobody but the prisoner was there.

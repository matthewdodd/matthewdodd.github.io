            . I keep a hosier's-shop
, at the corner of Crown-court, Soho


; the prisoner came to my shop the 28th of March, and asked to see a pair of blue stockings, with white clocks; I shew'd her some, and took notice how many pair there were; then she asked me to shew her a pair of white stockings with pink clocks; I said I had none such; then she wanted to see a pair of scarlet with green clocks. I turned myself about, and was going to shew her a pair, but said I had none such; she said then I need not open any more, and was going out. I looked at the stockings I had opened, and missed a pair, and went and stopped her just as she went out at the door, and found this pair in her apron (producing a pair) they are my property.

I am very innocent of the affair.

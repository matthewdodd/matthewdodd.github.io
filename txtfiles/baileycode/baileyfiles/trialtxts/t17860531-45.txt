             sworn.
On the 15th of May, we had a barge, left on board the ship all night; in the night the mate detected a man stealing the coals; he is here.

             sworn.
I was coming on board after ten; I saw the prisoner lay by the craft, and I suspected him, and looked after him; he made his boat fast to the craft, and began to hand coals out; I saw the prisoner on board this craft, and saw him take four bushels, or upwards; I went down to the craft, and took him directly.

             sworn.
I took the prisoner into custody; he acknowledged the fact, and said he had a family.
Had you or the mate told him you would shew him any favour? - No; nor he was not frightened; he confessed it voluntarily.
PRISONER's DEFENCE.
I went over the water, and as I was coming through the tier of ships, the lighter-man asked me to give him a cast over; he gave me about half a bushel of coals; there was not above half a bushel, between God and man.

 was again indicted

 for bigamy.


MR. CLARKSON
conducted the Prosecution.






SUSAN HUGHES
. I was in Shrewsbury in 1832—I knew the prisoner at Mr. Eaton's—the prisoner asked me to go to church—I said, "Ann Davis would rather go"—he was often talking of that marriage—the account I gave in the last case is correct.





WILLIAM BARNES
. I produce a copy of the marriage register, and it is correct—the prisoner called on me, and said he was married at St. Chad's, on the 16th of July, 1823, to Emma Fox, a dress-maker, by whom he had three children, that one was dead, and that he left his wife and two children in Manchester.





GEORGE TURNER
. I am parish clerk of St. Peter, Walworth, in St. Mary, Newington. I have the marriage register, in which there is an entry that on the "18th February, 1840, (No. 284) Richard Light and Hannah Butlin, of full age, widower and spinster, by trade a grocer, were married in this church. (Witness)
"GEORGE TURNER, ANN BAILEY."





ANN BAILBY
. I live in Upper Thames-street. I was present at the prisoner's marriage in 1840—he was married to Hannah Butlin—they lived at our house after that—they might have lived two or three months there.

COURT. Q. How old was she? A. I cannot say—I believe about twenty-five.

Cross-examined. Q. Did you know her very well? A. I knew her when she came to our house to lodge—she was a servant—I have not

heard that the prisoner got any money with her-—I have not seen her since she left our house, which is nearly two years.




GUILTY

Transported for Seven Years.

            . I am coachman to Mr. Brown, who had hired a carriage of Mr. Waller, of Long-acre - he has other partners. I live at Mr. Brown's premises, Gowermews, Bedford-square


. On the 29th of December, about half-past eight o'clock in the evening, I looked through the hay-loft window, and saw the carriage in the mews - the horses were in the stable; by the light of the lamp over the door I saw the prisoner inside the carriage; I thought at first he was the man who drove it - I came down, knocked at the carriage door, and said, "Is that you, Ned?" the prisoner looked out of the window, and said, "It is only me - I came to get a night's looking here - I am very much in distress - let me out;" I said, No,and called for assistance - he then got his head and legs out, and got away; I pursued, and took him - we found the cushions were cut, and the horse-hair taken out and put into a bag. I gave him in charge. The tuffs had been cut of the other cushions.(Property produced and sworn to.)

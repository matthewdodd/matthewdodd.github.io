             (police-constable R 141). I was in Whitechapel in plain clothes - I saw the prisoner and two others at the prosecutor's window - I went to the corner of Petticoat-lane - I watched them a minute or two - they went to the shop window and then to the foot path, and then to the window again - I went to the foot path, and saw the prisoner put his hand on the rail that goes round the shop, and take off this pair of boots - he came past me - Icaught at him - he dropped the boots - I took them up - he stooped - I missed my hold of him - he ran up the butchers' row, and there he threw off his own shoes, and ran into Somerset-street - I pursued and took him without losing sight of him.(Property produced and sworn to.)

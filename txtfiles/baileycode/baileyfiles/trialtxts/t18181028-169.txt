SARAH OLDERSHAW. I am a laundress, and live in Charles-street, New Kent-road


. I had Mr. Allen Williams's table-cloth to wash; on the 11th of September, about ten o'clock in the morning, I lost it out of the garden, where it hung to dry.
WILLIAM BLACKBURN. I am a pawnbroker, and live on Saffron-hill, On the 11th of September, between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning, the prisoner brought the table-cloth to pledge. I observed it was rough dried, and noticed his name was different to the initials. He said he lived in New-street, Shoe-lane, and his mother, who was ill in bed, had sent him to pledge it. I said I thought it was stolen - He denied it. I returned it to him, and followed to see if he went to where he said he lived; he put it under his coat as soon as he got out of the shop, and I gave him in charge.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

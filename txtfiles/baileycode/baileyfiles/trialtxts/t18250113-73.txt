JOHN NEWMAN. I keep the Sun public-house, in East Smithfield




. On the night of Tuesday, the 8th of December, I went up stairs, and found the roof untiled, and the lead taken off the gutters; I went to enquire about it, and one of the police-officers produced some lead, which I compared with mine; it fitted the place exactly; I had seen it all safe, about seven o'clock that evening.

            . I am a watchman. On the night of the 8th of December, about nine o'clock, I saw the prisoner going along Cable-street, with a bundle under his arm - I asked what it was; he dropped it, and ran away; I cried Stop him! - I picked it up, and followed him - I cannot say who stopped him; but this is the lead he dropped - I took it to the watch-house, and gave it to Cartwright.

            . I am the watch-house keeper. Sullivan gave me this lead - I took it down to the Sun, next day, and compared it with the lead on the top of the house, it matched exactly.

JOHN KEEPER
 was indicted

for stealing, on the 
19th of February, 1 shilling, 1 sixpence, and 6 halfpence, the monies of 



Ann Edwards, his mistress; and that he had been before convicted of felony.






ANN EDWARDS
. I am a widow. I keep a brick-cart, and am in the building line—the prisoner worked for the builders. On the 19th of February I gave him the money to pay for three loads of chalk rubbish—he was to get it at the lime-kilns—he went with my horse and cart to get it—I told him where to get it—I gave him 5s. 3d. to pay for it—it is 1s. 9d. a load—he brought back no load—he drew two loads to Mr. Rhodes's brick-field, which was all he drew there, instead of the three which he ought to have drawn; so that I lost 1s. 9d. beside the cartage—he gave me the account that he had drawn the three loads to Rhoders's.





JOHN TAYLOR HENDERSON
. I am clerk to Messrs. Thomas and William Rhodes. On the 19th of February there were two loads of chalk rubbish delivered by the prisoner—that was all he delivered on that day.





THOMAS BONFIELD
. I am manager of the coal and coke wharf, Hackney. The prisoner drew only two loads of chalk rubbish from that wharf on the 19th of February.

Prisoner. I had some chalk rubbish from the next wharf to his. Witness I know nothing about that.





JOHN JOHNSON
. I am a police-constable. I took the prisoners—he said he was going to pay Mrs. Edwards on Saturday night for the money he had kept back.





CHARLES COOPER
. I produce a certificate, from Mr. Clark's office, of the prisoner's former conviction for felony (read)—he is the same man.




GUILTY
. Aged 20.—


Transported for Seven Years.

JOHN POSFORD (Police-constable S 50). On the night of the 15th of April I was on duty in Pancras-road. I went after the prisoner, in consequence of what a gentleman told me; I saw a man with her; I stopped the man first - I found nothing on him but 1s. 1 1/2d.; I then followed the prisoner, and just as I got up to her, I saw her put her hand to the top of some pales, and drop these two pots over - I stopped her, and took the pots up; she denied doing it - the man got away.

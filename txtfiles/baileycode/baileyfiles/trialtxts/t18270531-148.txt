THOMAS KINNEAR. I am a packer
, and live at Edinburgh. On the 15th of May, about half-past four o'clock, I was in Bond-street


, and on getting near the corner of Clifford-street, a person called out that I had been robbed; I turned round, and saw George, who said I had lost my purse and handkerchief; the prisoner had just passed me; I ran and took hold of him till the officer came - my purse had been in my coat pocket, and contained some sovereigns and silver. George said she had seen the prisoner drop the purse, and another person take it up; I know it was all safe about two minutes before; he was not above a yard and a half from me.

            . I live in Stamford-street. I was in Bond-street, and saw the prisoner and another walking before me; I saw Mr. Kinnear put a green purse into his coat pocket - I saw the prisoner put his hand into the pocket twice, but he did not take the purse; he put his hand in a third time, pulled out the purse, and dropped it - the other took it up, and ran away; I told Mr. Kinnear, and he was taken. I am certain he is the boy.

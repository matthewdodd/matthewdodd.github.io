            . I am a watchman. On the 12th of March, about a quarter after twelve o'clock at night, I saw the prisoner against a door, and asked him what he was doing there? he said, Nothing. I said he must go to the watch-house. He dropped down on the pavement as we went along, and pulled the handles of three doors out of his pocket - we found several more on him, which were missing off several doors in the street.

            . I am a carpenter. On the 7th of June, between six and seven o'clock in the morning, I saw two persons looking into a ditch - they said they saw a a person take a piece of lead out - I asked which way they went, and followed - I found the prisoner with part of the lead, and gave him in charge. It was about twenty yards from the building.

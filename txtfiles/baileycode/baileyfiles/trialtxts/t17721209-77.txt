            . As I was going through St. Paul's Church Yard, on the 4th of November, in my way home, I met the prisoner and two more; I saw they were at a gentleman's pocket; I turned back and followed them; the gentleman went to an inn in Friday-street


; they stopt when he went in, and when he came out again, the prisoner picked his handkerchief out of his pocket; I pursued him and secured him with the gentleman's handkerchief upon him. The owner of the handkerchief had taken a place in the coach for Bath, and was to set out the next morning.

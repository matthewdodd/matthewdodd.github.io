WILLIAM KING
, laceman, New Church-street, Marylebone. About eight o'clock in the evening of the 4th of March, the prisoner came to my shop, and asked to see some rosettes—I showed him some—he did not like them—he wished to see some ribbon to make some—I showed him a drawer of ribbons—he bought one yard of three different colours—he then wanted to see some satin ribbons—I saw him take one piece of white satin ribbon form the drawer, slide it on the counter, then take his handkerchief from his pocket, take the ribbon up with the handkerchief, and put it into his pocket—I went round the counter, collared him, and asked how many pieces of ribbon he had in his pocket—I said, "I saw you take one piece, but I believe you have a dozen"—he said he had none at all—I called my brother-in-law, Henry Albin—I put my hand into the prisoner's pocket, and took hold of a piece of ribbon—he thrust his hand in and took it from his pocket with his handkerchief, and put it on the counter, with another piece of ribbon—I had not sold him either of these—there are thirty-three yards of it.

Prisoner. Q. Did you not pull them out of the box, and place them on the counter? A. No.

Prisoner to
HENRY ALBIN. Q. Did not you place this ribbon on the counter? A. I shifted this piece away, that there might be no mixture of them—I saw one piece of ribbon drawn out of his pocket and laid on the counter.

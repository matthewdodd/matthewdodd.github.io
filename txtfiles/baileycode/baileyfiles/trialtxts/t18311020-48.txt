HEZEKIAH WILLMER. I am a Police-officer. On the 29th of September I was in St. John-street, and saw the prisoner near Mr. Spencer's shop - he afterwards passed me, and I saw he had these three pairs of pattens on this stick: he was carrying them rather covered with a black apron, which he had on - he was afterwards brought back to Mr. Spencer's, and I took him with these pattens.

                  Taylor 
               



             thus deposed: The Prisoner was a Lodger in my House. I laid up Mr. Janeway's Watch in my Bed-Chamber; but having lost the Key of the Door, I did not let any body know that the Watch was in my Possession: But however, I miss'd it in two or three Days after, and had a violent Suspicion of the Prisoner, because she had been at Southwark-Fair, and brought home a Couple of Gold Rings, and other small Pieces of Plate. I searched her Room, and there found the Key of the Watch. The Chain she had sold to 
               
                  Richard 
                  Peters 
               



            , a Goldsmith, and told him that her Son gave it her; and the watch was pawn'd to Mrs. Morgan for 30 s.

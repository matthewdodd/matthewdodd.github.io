WILLIAM SMITH
 was indicted

 for stealing 2 sheets, value 4s., the goods of 




Emily Oliver, and that he had been before convicted of felony.






CHARLES ROSE.
 I am barman at the Globe tavern, Seymour-street, kept by Mrs. Emily Oliver. On the evening of the 27th of Sept. Harrison spoke to me—I went down stairs and found the prisoner in the water-closet, in the act of concealing these sheets under his coat—they are Mrs. Emily Oliver', and had no business there.

Prisoner. Q. Did you find any sheets in the water-closet? A. Yes—I took them from you.





ELIZA HARRISON.
 I live at the Globe tavern. On the 27th of Sept. I saw the prisoner go into a bed-room, and in a few minutes he came out with something rolled up—I told Rose of it, and he went after him and brought him out with the sheets dragging behind him.

Prisoner. Q. Did I not ask you for a cloth in the kitchen, and did you not tell me I could find one outside the door? A. No.

COURT.
Q. Had he been sleeping there? A. No—he had no business in the room at all.





EDMOND CHARLES GERMAN
 (policeman, S 169.) I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction at this Court—(read—Convicted 1st Feb., 1847, having been before convicted, and confined one month)—he is the person.




GUILTY. Aged 26.—


Transported for seven years.

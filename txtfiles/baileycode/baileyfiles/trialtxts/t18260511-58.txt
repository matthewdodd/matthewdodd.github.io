            . I am a Bow-street patrol. I was on duty in the Uxbridge-road on the 28th of April - I fell in with the prisoner about a quarter before twelve o'clock at night, near Acton; he was carrying a bundle; he said he got it from a friend, for whom he was taking it from town- I found it contained linen, handkerchiefs, and other articles; I had hand-bills posted up about Acton, and in two days I found the owners of the property now produced - this hammer was found on him.
ANN NORTH. I live at Acton


, with Mr. Baker, of the George inn. This property is all mine, except the hammer and frock; these articles were safe on the grass-plot, and were intended to be out all night; I saw them there about a quarter before ten o'clock that night.
Prisoner to JOHN BICKERS. Q. Which way was I going when you met me? Witness. You were coming from Turnham-green.
EDWARD WALKER. I live at Acton. This frock and hammer are mine - they were safe on Mr. Grant's premises, in the tool-house, the evening before - I missed them the next morning.
The prisoner pleaded distress.

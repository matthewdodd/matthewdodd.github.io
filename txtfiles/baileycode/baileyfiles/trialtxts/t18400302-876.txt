WILLIAM MASON
. I am the brother of Susan Mason, who keeps a book-shop in St. Giles's. I was in the shop on the 18th of February—the prisoner came in and asked for a print—he put down a shilling, and wanted change—I gave him 6d., and just stepped to the door to speak to a friend, and missed three books—I charged him with it—he pulled out one, and then another, and then the other—he said it was poverty drove him to do it—these are all my sister's books—(looking at them.)




GUILTY.* Aged 23.—


Transported for Seven Years.
(There was another indictment against the prisoner.)

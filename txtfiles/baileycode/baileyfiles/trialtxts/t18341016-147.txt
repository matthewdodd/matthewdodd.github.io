JOHN THROPP. I am an engineer in the Gas Company
. When this happened, I lived at Hoxton. On the 7th of September, I was going home, and this prisoner accosted me, and asked me to go with her - I said I did not want to go with her, and, that I had no money - she clung to me and insisted upon going with me - I told her she was drunk - she still insisted upon my going with her - I said,I was sorry to see a mere child, like her, in the street, and pushed her away - she came, and seized my arm, and took me to a dark part of the street - she kissed me, and ran away - I then missed my handkerchief, and followed her - I saw her with three men - I charged her with taking my handkerchief, and held her till the officer came - she then took my handkerchief from her bosom, and threw it down with another handkerchief - this is my handkerchief.

SAMUEL PARCEL
 was indicted

 for stealing, on the 
23rd of May, 1 coat, value 2l., the goods of 



George Smith Thornton; and 1 coat, value 2l., the goods of 



Charles Snell Paris.






ANN FISHER
. I am servant to Mr. Abraham, at No. 18, Bruton-street, Berkeley-square. Mr. Thornton lives in the house with us—on the 23rd of May, between eight and nine o'clock in the evening, the prisoner called at the house; he was quite a stranger, and asked me if Mr. Paris was at home—he was a gentleman living in the house—I said no, he was not—he said he came for an answer to a note which was left that day—he said a note was to be left in the drawing-room—I went up to look for it, and was hardly a minute gone when I heard the door open and shut—I ran down, and saw him cross the road with the coats on his shoulder—he was brought back with them soon after.





GEORGE HOPKINS
. I am servant to Mr. Cook. I was in Bruton-street, and observed the prisoner cross the road with the great coats, from No. 18—a young man came out and ran after him, and just opposite me he dropped the coats and ran away—I took them up and took them back to the house—he is the man.





GEORGE KIMPTON
. I am shopman to Mr. Abraham. I saw the prisoner go into the house and come out with the coats—I am certain he is the person.





THOMAS SCOTT
. I am a policeman. I heard the cry of "Stop thief,"

and saw the prisoner running—he was crying "Stop thief"—I pursued and overtook him in Cork-street—I produce the coats.





CHARLES SNELL PARIS
. I lodge at this house—this coat belongs to me, and I know that the other belongs to Mr. George Smith Thornton.




GUILTY
. Aged 21.—


Transported for Seven Years.

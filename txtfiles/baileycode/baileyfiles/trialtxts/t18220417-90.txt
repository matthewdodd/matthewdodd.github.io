            .
MR. ANDREWS conducted the prosecution.


                  JOSEPH 
                  RICHARDSON
               



            . I am a woollen draper
, and live on Ludgate-street. 
               
                  George 
                  Biggs
               



             was my servant
 for four years, up to the time of this offence. On the 5th of March, I sent him to Mr. Sterry's for 645 l. He was to take up a bill with it at Holts, in Broad-street. It was a bill I had accepted for Mr. Sterry, for goods sold me by him, and I was not provided to take it up. I sent the prisoner to Mr. Sterry a little before three o'clock; he had been informed in the morning, that he would have to go. I was sent for to Mr. Sterry's a little after four, and found the prisoner 
               
                  George 
                  Biggs
               



             there crying, and holding a handkerchief up to his mouth, Mr. Elton, the clerk, told me in his presence, that he, (George), had been to take up the bill, and had been knocked down and robbed of the money. I said I could not believe any thing of the kind, and said
"What have you done with the other money;" meaning 15 l. I had given him to take up another bill. He said that was in his waistcoat pocket safe, and gave it me. He persisted in his account. He said he was robbed in Austin Friar's. I cannot say whether that would be in his way. I knew he had a brother, but did not know his person.


                  WILLIAM 
                  ELTON
               



            . I am clerk to Mr. Sterry, of Basinghall-street


. On the 5th of March, about a quarter to four o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner, 
               
                  George 
                  Biggs
               



            , came to our warehouse. I saw the notes delivered to him, there was a 300 l. dated the 18th of February, No. 9319 - one 200 l. dated the 16th of February, No. 3876 - one 100 l. dated the 19th of February, No. 13817 - two of 20 l. each dated 5th of February, Nos. 17205 and 17593 - one 5 l. dated the 31st January, No. 16544 - all dated 1822. I saw them delivered into his hands to pay a bill, which Mr. Richardson could not pay. 
               
                  George 
                  Biggs
               



             delivered that message to us, and said he was going to Broad-street to pay it, (Looks at the 100 l. a 20 l. and a 5 l. note) these were among the notes delivered to him. He went away, and in twenty minutes returned crying, and said he had been knocked down in Austin Friars, by three people and robbed of the money, that he had taken it out of his pocket, with the notice to see where he was to go to; that as they met him, one of them struck him in the eye, mouth, and stomach, and knocked him down, and took the money from him; that they lifted him up, and put him on a step of a door, and left him. I sent for Mr. Richardson, and kept him there till he came, he gave the same account again. Austin Friars is not in the direct way to Broad-street; he should have gone down London Wall, Winchester-street, it could not make a minutes difference.

                  BIGGS
               



            . Q. Did you ever see me in company with my brother - A. Never that I know.

            . My husband is a hair-dresser, we live in Holyday-yard, Creed Lane. I know the prisoner George, and now know Richard. On Tuesday, the 5th of March, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, I saw them together in St. Martin's Court, Ludgate Hill. A girl of the town, (in appearance), was with them; they seemed in deep conversation together. I have since learnt they are brothers. I am quite sure of their persons, and that it was between three and four o'clock.


                  JOHN 
                  HOPPER
               



            . I am a waterman at St. Catherine's. I know 
               
                  Richard 
                  Biggs
               



            , but not George. I saw Richard in St. Catherine's-lane on the 5th of March. I drank with him at the Black Boy, public-house there, at seven o'clock in the evening, he shewed me a 5 l. Bank note, and wanted me to get change. I went to Mr. Austin's, the Ship; Mrs. Austin gave me change for it. I gave her the same note I received from him. He said nothing about how he got it. I am quite sure of his person.
RICHARD BIGGS. Q. Are you sure whether it was Tuesday or Wednesday - A. No, it was one of those days. Q. Did you not go to my father's last week. - A. Yes, I was informed his father was dying and wanted to see me. I did not ask him to be answerable for any money if I staid away.


                  JOHN 
                  AUSTIN
               



            . I keep the Ship. My wife gave me the note changed for Hopper, and I marked the name of Hopper on the note. I don't know what day it was.

            . Q. How long was it in your possession before you marked it - A. I think three days, but I had no other note in the house of any kind.


                  RUTH 
                  AUSTIN
               



            , (looks at the 5 l. note). I know this to be the note I changed for Hopper on Tuesday, the 5th March. I knew him before; I put the note in a bag, there was no other there; I gave it to Mr. Austin about nine in the evening, when he came home. It was in nobody's hands in the mean time.


                  JAMES 
                  HAYES
               



            . I had seen 
               
                  Richard 
                  Biggs
               



             twice before the Wednesday; I knew him by the name of John Brown; he lodged at No. 4, Joiner-street, Toolley-street, Borough, with 
               
                  Jane 
                  Somerfield
               



            , who is a loose girl. On Sunday morning, the 6th of March, I was passing through Joiner-street to work, and Jane and her sister called me up. Richard was not there; I did not see him that day - I saw him on Thursday morning at his lodgings. I whistled as I went by, and was let in by Jane's sister. I went up and saw the prisoner and Jane in the bed. Richard asked if I would have any thing to drink; he sent Harriet for gin and peppermint, and after it was drank Richard gave the bolster to Harriet, and asked her to give me the notes out of it. She was a long time getting them out. She emptied all the feathers out, and at last found them. He looked at them, and said
"It is all right; give me the bolster - put the feathers in, and I will put them where I can place my hand on them." He put them in again, and she sewed the bolster up; and after breakfast, at eleven o'clock, Richard, I, and Mason, went out togetherto go to Covent Garden. Richard gave Mason some sovereigns. I told him to walk on one side of the way, and we two would walk on the other, to avoid suspicion. We went to Govent Garden; and just as we got near the market, he met a young man named 
               
                  Bill 
                  Watts
               



            . We went into the wine vaults to have something to drink, and after drinking the liquor, Richard gave Watts something to drink.
Q. Did he at last give you any money? - A. On the Saturday morning I went up stairs - he gave me what he said was 500 l., and twenty sovereigns, to take care of for him, I said I would. It was in two bank notes, one was a 200 l. I saw him again on Sunday; and he told me that his brother went to borrow some money for his master to take up a bill; and when he had got the money he gave it to him, and said he had been knocked down and robbed of it. When Richard gave me the money, he said,
"They cannot hurt you, and besides you can get a good character, for you are at work."
COURT. Q. You seem about as bad as him, if this is true - A. It is all true. I live at No. 9, Union-row, Snow's Fields, Bermondsey, and am a colourer.

            . Q. Did I know where you lived at the time I gave you the money - A. No, he sent Jane with me to see that I took it home. She only went as far as Western-street; but no further, as she met a young man.
Q. What became of the money - A. I did not come home on Thursday, but on Friday morning, my parents did not know I had it; and I concealed it in the ceiling of the privy, and three men came and took it away. I only know this by what my sister told me.
Q. Do you mean to swear you do not know what became of it - A. I do not. I opened it, but did not see what the other note was.
Q. Were you in the habit of seeing me after you had the money - A. Yes, on Monday, at the Feathers, Waterloo Road. I never told him I lost it. It was not taken till the Friday following. He told me to take a pound or two when I wanted it, but not to take the notes. He put some rag over the notes, and then wrapped the sovereigns up in it.

            . On the 5th of March I was sent for - I and Mr. Richardson, the prisoner George, and Mr. Sterry went to Austin Friars, where he said he was robbed; he pointed out the spot where he was robbed; we could find nobody there that knew any thing of it. He said it happened about four o'clock. Next day I went after Richard, and found him at last, at Ingram's, the Sun, in Bedfordbury. I had very hard work to get him away. I was surrounded immediately I seized him, and unless I I had produced my fire arms, I should not have secured him. He made very great resistance. I was forced out of the skittle-ground into the tap-room. I found 24 s. 6 d. on him.

            . I am a dealer in coins, and live in Cornhill. On the 6th April I took the 100 l. bank note, numbered 13,817, produced. It was paid me by an elderly man, who brought one hundred and twenty Napoleons for it. I sent it to the Bank, and then it was stopped.

                  EWBANKS
               



            . I live in Austin Friars, about five yards from the spot where the robbery was said to have been committed. I heard of no robbery on that day, until the gentleman came at night to enquire. I was in doors at four o'clock, cleaning the kitchen, with the kitchen windows open, and must have heard if there had been any alarm. I was there from two till five. I am house-keeper to a Mr. Robinson.
MR. ELTON. (Looking at the 100 l. and 5 l. notes) These are two of the notes paid him.


                  GEORGE 
                  BIGGS
               



            'S, Defence. I have nothing to state only the manner I was robbed of the money. When the bill was presented to Mr. Richardson, I was not aware I was going to take it up. The direction was left, and about eleven or twelve o'clock, I took it to Mr. Sterry's, and told him the bill was due. He called afterwards, and said,
"Send somebody between three and four o'clock for the money." I was not aware I was going to take it up, till I was sent. Mr. Richardson sometimes took them up himself. I left Mr. Richardson's at half-past three in the afternoon; previous to that, about ten minutes before, I had to go to Thomas-street. I had met my brother in the morning, and went with him to have something to drink, at the Cock. He had a young woman with him, and said he was going to the Cock. The last time I saw him, was twenty minutes after three, and then I did not know I was going to take up the bill. When I returned, I was ordered to go to Mr. Sterry's I stopped there ten minutes before I received the money, which was given me from a parcel of notes. I went out of Mr. Sterry's front door, and along London Wall, up Winchester-street, to Austin Friars, and in the notes I had the direction of the bill. Not being sure of the number, I unfortunately pulled the notes out of my pocket, and looked at the direction; at the moment three very genteel persons passed me, and the moment I put the money in my pocket. I received a blow on the back of my neck; at the same moment one in my mouth, and one on the chest which knocked me down, and completely deprived me of speech; two of the persons lifted me up by the arms, and placed me on the step, and run towards Broad-street; the contrary way to that they were going when they met me. I was not able to call after them through the blow, but run as well as I was able, the way they went; but never saw them after they crossed the corner of Austin Friars. I run as fast as I could up Threadneedle-street, but could not see them; I returned the same way as I came to Mr. Sterry's, and several people asked me what was the matter. I said I had been robbed. I make no doubt but they would have gone with me if I had asked them. I then thought it most advisable to make the best of my way back to Mr. Sterry's, and endeavour, if possible, to stop the number of the notes. I stated to them the manner in which I had lost it, they asked me if I should know the persons again, if I saw them. I said I was certain I should know two of them; Mr. Sterry said I must come to the Mansion House. I went before the Lord Mayor, and stated the manner I had lost the money. Mr. Richardson and Mr. Sterry were sometime together with the Lord Mayor. We then went back to Mr. Sterry's, and staid there till near eleven o'clock; they then said they did not believe what I had said. Mr. Richardson, I believe, objected to my being taken into custody that night, and I was taken to his house, where I remained all night, and next morning proceeded to business as usual, and opened the shop, swept the door, and brushed the windows, andabout nine o'clock Mr. Richardson went out, and did not return till about eleven. He had told me previous to going out that I must go before the Lord Mayor, and undergo an examination. I said I was willing, and about eleven o'clock I went. I was not in custody, I had abundant opportunity to escape, if I had been guilty, but I knew I was innocent.

            'S Defence. I recollect being in company with my brother on the day in question, as I was in the habit of seeing him three or four times a week; the first time I met him was about half-past twelve o'clock, on Ludgate-hill, I was in company with a young woman, he said he was going to Holborn; I said, I was going to have something to drink at the Cock, and would wait there for him; he came there and went home; I waited there after he had left me, till about a quarter past three, and just as I was coming away he came there a second time. I asked him to sit down, and if he could stop; he said he was going to Thames-street and could not wait. We all came out together from the Cock, and stood a few minutes talking at the door; I went towards Temple-bar with the woman. I wish to make a few observations as to Hayes. He acknowledges I did not know where he lived; I leave it to you to consider whether it is likely that I should leave so much money in care of a person to whom I was a stranger. If I had counsel it would be plainer to your Lordship. On the first examination he swore it was a 300 l. and 200 l. - On the second, he said it was a 200 l. note, and the other might be a song for what he knew. He mentions likewise in his statement a third person named Harriet, who, if she was brought forward, could perhaps greatly corroborate his testimony. These witnesses, I submit, are kept away, because if they were questioned as to Hayes's character (for I know for many years it has been no good) he has been an utterer of forged notes. As to Hopper, the first I knew of him was his being procured as an hired bail for me at Lambeth-street, for which he received 10 s.; he went to my father and offered not to come against me for 20 l., and he sent into the gaol to say if I sent him out 2 l. he would not appear.

                  Somerville
               



             is in Brixton gaol I understand. I went to enquire for her to bring her as a witness here.

                  MASON
               



            . I live in Green Church-yard, St. Catherine,'s, and am apprenticed to a waterman; the prisoner's father lives in Little Macclesfield-street; I was there one night when Hopper came and offered to go out of the way for the sum of 20 l. His father said it was not in his power to give it him.
Q. Were you not taken up on this charge - A. Yes, but I knew nothing of it. I rowed them up to Waterloo-bridge, and he paid me the fare, the same as any other person. I don't know

MR. ELTON re-examined. When the prisoner came back and gave this account his lips were swollen, and he had blood on his handkerchief.

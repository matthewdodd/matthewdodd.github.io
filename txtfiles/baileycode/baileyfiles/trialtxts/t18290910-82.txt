            . On the morning of the 16th of August, about one o'clock, I was in Queen-street, Seven-dials


 - the prisoner came up, and solicited a penny to buy her a bit of bread; I said I had not a penny, but I would give her a halfpenny; I was pulling it out, and she picked my pocket of three half-crowns, a sixpence, and a copper farthing; I gave charge of her to the watchman - she turned away, and said, "I won't have your halfpenny; if you have not a penny, I won't have any:" she was taken when she had got about twenty yards from me - I was sober.
Prisoner. Q. Did you not say you dropped one halfpenny, and that I picked your pocket when you was stooping for it? A. I did not.

            . I am a watchman. I was in the Seven-dials; the prisoner was given charge of by the prosecutor- I found on her three half-crowns, one sixpence, and a copper farthing.
Prisoner's Defence. I was walking along; he came up, and put his arm round my neck: I asked him to give me something, and he put it into my hand; I did not know what it was - I thought it was copper; I said I should go and get something to drink, he said I could not; I then said Yes I could, at the watering-house, and he gave charge of me.

                  , from his person
            .
JOHN BRERETON. I am master of the grammar school
, at Bedford. On the 23d of July I was walking down Ludgate-street, about one o'clock in the day, and very near the Belle Sauvage-yard


 I was hustled by eight or nine persons - they jostled me and got round me; they came suddenly upon me; I felt myself suddenly in a crowd - my son was walking with me - I felt something touch my left hand breeches pocket, and found the prisoner's hand on my thigh - he ran across the way the instant I turned round - he was on my left side, just behind me - I put my hand into my pocket and my purse was gone- I found his hand on my thigh, near the pocket which contained my purse; he withdrew his hand and made across the street; his hand came from my pocket, but not from the inside of it - I pursued him and called Stop thief! Skillern came up and took hold of him - he had run up a court about one hundred yards off, but I never lost sight of him; I felt my purse and money safe five minutes before, and could not have lost it, for my pocket was deep; I put him into a hackney coach - he there said, he was the son of respectable parents, and requested me not to bring the case before a Magistrate; I said it was a public duty - I was certain of his person; he then said he would make up the sum to me if I would not bring the case before a Magistrate. There were seven or eight persons hustling me before, and one man behind me with a box, was looking as if to see if the thing was complete - I kept my eye on the prisoner, and do not know what become of the others.
Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Where had you received this money? A. I brought it from Bedford; I changed a sovereign at a booksellers in Ave Maria-lane - my purse was then safe, and I am certain it was safe when I got to the Belle Sauvage, as nobody was near me - I had not felt it after I left the shop; I do not remember a coach coming out of the inn-yard - there was one outside; that might have occasioned a stoppage on the payment; I think I told the Alderman of perceiving the man's hand on my thigh, or on my pocket - I know it was his hand by seeing his face; I cannot say what I told the Alderman; the prisoner stood on my left side, obliquely - none of the gang offered to obstruct me; he was taken about thirty feet down the court - I said he had stolen my purse; he said I might search him, for he had not taken it, or something to that effect; he was searched, and only a few shillings found on him - he might have conveyed my purse away by sleight of hand; he was not out of my sight - he might have given it away before his hand was on my thigh; when in the coach he at first said I might be mistaken in the man; I said it was not so; and when he found that would not do, he said rather than be taken, he would make it up to me - he said he would give me the money provided I would not take him before a Justice.
JURY. Q. Was your pocket turned out or not? A. No; I had buttoned it, but I found it open - the prisoner wore a dark coat and waistcoat.

            , JUN. I was walking arm-in-arm with my father. I perceived several men round us - we could not move; they hustled us - I had no idea they were going to rob us; I thought it was done intentionally; my father turned round suddenly, and said he was robbed; I then saw the prisoner about a yard from my father - he ran across the road, down a court, and was taken; I am certain he is the man who ran, for I saw him all the time. I was in the coach - he said he had respectable parents, and did not wish to be brought before a Magistrate, and afterwards said he would make good the money if we said nothing about it.
Cross-examined. Q. Were you walking nearer to the wall than your father? A. Yes; my father's left side was towards the street; I did not notice any stoppage of carriages; I tried to get out of the crowd as well as I could.
Q. Might not another man get out of it by crossing the way? A. If he wanted he might, I suppose - I will not say nobody was nearer to my father than him.
COURT. Q. Was the prisoner nearer to your father than you? A. We were arm-in-arm - my father was between me and him; we had got by the Belle Sauvage - there was no carriage to stop us.

            . I am an officer. I was coming up Ludgate-hill, and saw a coach at the inn; a great many people were round it, putting luggage up; I saw the prisoner go across the road, just on the trot; I heard a cry of Stop him! I ran and took him; I said, "You have robbed this gentleman;" he said he had not: I searched, and found 16s. or 18s. on him, which I showed to the prosecutor; I was in the coach with them - he there said his family were respectable people, and he would make up the money if we would not bring him into disgrace, but he knew nothing of the robbery.
Cross-examined. Q. Was the coach above or below the inn? A. Nearer to Temple-bar - it occasioned a stoppage;several people were round - there is a great traffic on the hill.

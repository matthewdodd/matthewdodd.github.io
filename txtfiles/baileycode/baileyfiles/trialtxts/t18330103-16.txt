JOSEPH GRIFFITHS. I am shopman to Mr.

, Poultry


. On the 24th of December, about twenty minutes before seven o'clock, I saw a man walking round the shop - I was cleaning up the board; we had lost several pairs of boots before - I concealed myself, and saw him take a pair of boots; I ran after him as fast as I could, and in turning to the right, saw him with the boots in his hand, and caught him about fourteen yards from the shop - it was the prisoner.
Prisoner. Q. Were not the boots in the road? A. No; I caught him round the waist - he struggled to get away, but could not, and then he threw them down.

            . I found a pawnbroker's duplicate of the watch upon the prisoner.
Prisoner's Defence.
I did not steal the watch: I was desired by the prosecutor, who wanted more money, to go pawn the watch for him; I went out with an intention to pawn it; it was too late that evening; I was in liquor myself; I did not return; I intended to give him the money; I went after him, and did not find him readily; then I spent some of the money, so because I could not make it up afterwards I was charged with having stole the watch.
He called three witnesses to prove he was at another publick house.

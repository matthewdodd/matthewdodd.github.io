FREDERICK MEREDITH
. I am the brother of Thomas Meredith, of Edgware-road, a corn-dealer. On the 20th of February I was at dinner in the parlour—I looked up, and saw something black behind the counter—I went and found the prisoner behind the counter, with the till open, and in his right hand were some halfpence—I laid hold of him, and he threw them into a meal-bin behind the counter—he was quite a stranger to me—I got an officer, and took him—I found the copper stated, which he threw into the bin, and at the station-house they found upon him a sixpence, which we suspect he took from the till, as there had been one put in just before, and it was then gone.

Prisoner. The sixpence was my own.




GUILTY

Transported for Seven Years.

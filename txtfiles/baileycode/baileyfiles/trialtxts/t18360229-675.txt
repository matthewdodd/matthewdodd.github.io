JOHN THOMAS DALLIMORE
. I live in Goldsmiths'-street, Gough-square. About a quarter past nine o'clock at night, on the 23rd of February, I was in Fleet-street, and just as I got on this side of Fetter-lane, I felt somebody at my pocket—I turned round and saw the two prisoners between two and three yards from me, and missed my pocket-handkerchief—I turned up a court to allow them to pass, which they did—I then followed them down to Anderson's coffee-house—there were two gentleman before them—one prisoner went before the other and put his hand to a gentleman's pocket—I spoke to the gentleman and followed them on, not seeing a watchman—I saw them join two girls of the town—I went across the road, called the watchman, and gave them into custody—they were searched at the station-house, and my handkerchief was found on James—they were both together,

and speaking to one another—they continued together till they met the girls.

Jones. He said nothing about his own handkerchief at the station-house. Witness. I did mention my own handkerchief.





WILLIAM GREIG
. I am a watchman of St. Bride's. I took the prisoners in charge for picking the prosecutor's pocket—he did not tell me what he had seen then to do another gentleman—he gave them in my charge for his own robbery—I found the handkerchief in James's bosom about two minutes after I took them.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

Jones. I do not know the other prisoner.

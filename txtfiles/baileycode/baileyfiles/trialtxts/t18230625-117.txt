             Laws; we live on Saffron-hill. On the 15th of March I left a table cloth at Mrs. Walker's, went for it in the evening, and it was gone; the prisoner boarded with me at the time; I did not send her for it; I never saw her again till she was taken.

            . This table cloth hung on my line; the prisoner said she would fold it up; she went away with it; she had slept at my house for two months before. I never saw her afterwards.

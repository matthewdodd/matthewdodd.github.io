            . I live in the passage going out of Butcherhall-lane into Little Britain. On the 27th of June in the morning, I went up into my shop and missed several tools; some time afterwards there was an advertisement of these tools being at a broker's shop in St. Giles's; I went and found them to be my property; the broker said he knew the person of whom he bought them; we went before Justice Welch, and he granted a warrant to take up the prisoner: I never saw the prisoner before he was taken.

            . I am journeyman to

                  Duck 
               



            . On the 28th of June in the morning, I saw three saws lying on the top of a book-case, that I was finishing; after that I saw a ripping chisel of mine that had not seen light a great while; then I went to my own bench, and saw three moulding planes lie there; then I went to my chest and found it open, and missed my planes, chisels, and other things; I found them again at Mr. Pickering's, a broker in St. Giles's; he advertised them.

            . I am a broker, and live in St. Giles's; I also keep a pawnbroker's shop; the prisoner came to my house the Thursday before the 27th of June; he asked me if I would buy some carpenters tools; I said I would, if I could get any thing by them; (I am a bricklayer by trade) he said his wife was dead, and his uncle had sent for him into the country; he brought two bags full, and six saws, on the 27th, (three saws produced in court) these are three of them; he asked 11 s. for four, I did not chuse to buy them; he went out of the shop, and left his bag in the shop; he told me he could sell them for more money than I would give for them, where he worked; he went out; I followed him unknown to him in the street; I attacked him by Berkley square, and said, I am afraid you do not come honestly by these things; he took me to his own father in Mount-street; his father said the saws were the prisoner's own; I said, I'll take the four saws and go to the shop you mentioned in Tyburn-road, and if they know any thing of them, I'll buy them; he was to follow me, but I could find no such carpenter's shop there, as he had mentioned to me; then I went to Justice Welch, and had the things advertised, and on the Monday morning Mr. Duck came and owned them; here is his name upon them; after that, the prisoner was taken in Smithfield by the description I gave of him; I believe there is a gang of them: (the other tools produced and deposed to by the respective owners.)
Prisoner's defence.
I never was in the shop in my life; I had an action out against me, and was obliged to go to the other end of the town; I met a man with these things on his back; I asked him if he could help me to a job; he desired me to carry them tools for him, and he would do what he could to help me to business; we stopped to have some lop in Holbourn, and while we were there he left me with all these things.

            . I am a broker; I followed the three prisoners in company together to three or four shops. I watched them for half an hour, they then went to Pilkington's shop - Bond stood against the door, Bensurilla stood against the window, and Stronic at the corner, watching. Bond bobbed in and out of the shop, and at last took the pigs head from the window, then went to the private door of the house, which is in Bedford-street, Covent Garden; the other two went up and joined him. Stronic put a handkerchief over the head, put it in his jacket, and went away - I followed and overtook him in Covent Garden with it under his jacket. Read took the other two.

            . I am a pork-butcher, and live in Chandos-street; I was out, and as I came home, I met the prisoners in custody with the head, they had taken it from the window, which was shut.

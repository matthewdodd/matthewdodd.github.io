            . On the 19th of January, about twelve o'clock in the day, I was walking down Holborn-hill


, and thought I felt something at my pocket; I immediately felt, and missed my handkerchief. I looked round, and saw the prisoner crossing the way; I pursued, and charged him with it - he denied it, but appeared so confused, and doubled his coat up, that I was induced to pull it open, and found my handkerchief inside. I immediately took him to the Compter.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

THOMAS LARGE. I keep a cart
. I missed a tilt, and part of a tilt, from my stable-yard, in Well-street, Oxford-street


; I missed them on Tuesday, the 2d of December - I know nothing of the prisoner.
ANN ACKERMAN. I bought this canvas of the prisoner on the Tuesday or Wednesday, the 2d or 3d of December;he said it was his own, and he sold it to get beer for himself and some men; I gave 1/2d. per lb. for it - I do not recollect how many pounds there were, but I think I gave him 18d. or 20d.; he came before he brought it, and asked what I would give a lb. for it.

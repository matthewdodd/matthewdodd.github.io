            . I am servant to Mr. Touchett. The prisoner Orroks, was at our house on the 23d of August; the candlestick was missing that day, between six and eight in the afternoon; we suspected her, and took her before Sir 
               
                  John 
                  Fielding 
               



            . She said she took it for want.
Lazarus Levi. I live in Carter-street, by Wool-pack-alley. At first, there came a shoe-black, and asked me, if I buy silver? I said, yes: he said, there was a man and woman had got so me silver to sell. I went with him to the two prisoners, in Hounsditch; they were standing in the street: I asked what they had to sell? the man said, do you live hereabouts? I said, just by: he said, will you go home with me? I went home with him, and he gave me this silver candlestick into my hand; he asked 5 s. an ounce for it, and said, the girl had a relation died, and left it her. I stopped it, and went and advertised it, by which means I came at the owner. (Produced, and deposed to by Pickford, as the property of the prosecutor.)
Orroks's Defence.
I did it for want.
Brooks's Defence.
I went over with her into Hounsditch, where we saw a Jew selling buttons; we asked him where we could sell the candlestick? he carried us to that gentleman's house, and he stopped it.

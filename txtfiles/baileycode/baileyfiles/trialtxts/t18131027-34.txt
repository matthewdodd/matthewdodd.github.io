            . I am beadle of the ward. I marshalled the constable this night. I gave the general order for each man to seize his man, and to be very particular with the man they seized, and to take the property from them. I seized one man, searched him, and found no property on him. The prisoner stood near me; from him fell this piece of cloth; I felt it fall: he was the only person that it could fall from. It fell from him. His waistcoat and coat were both unbuttoned when I seized him. The cloth brushed me all the way down, and fell on my instep. The prisoner was close to me. No other person was near me by a yard and a half. I have no doubt but that it fell from the prisoner. I had many offers made me by the prisoner to let him go. He offered me a pound note. I told him fifty pound would not let me do that. I searched the prisoner's lodgings, and found more cloth.
MR. STEVENS. The prisoner was a cutter
. That cloth has the King's mark upon it, the broad arrow.
Prisoner's Defence. I deny the charge. I had no property about me, nor did I drop any belonging to Mr. Maberley.
The prisoner called five witnesses, who gave him a good character.

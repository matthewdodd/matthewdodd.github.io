             sworn.
I am a servant to Mrs. Hall; about the 5th or 6th of February, these prisoners were in our house with two men with them; it was on a Monday night, between seven and eight; in the morning we missed the things in the indictment; the things had been in the stable the night before; the door was only shut to; the next morning I took a horse, and rode about to all the dealers about London, and I went to this gentleman's house in Aldersgate-street, Mr. Horsley's; I found nobody there.

             sworn.
I am a collar and harness maker; on Tuesday the 6th of February, about twelve, these two women came to my house and offered some things for sale; there were four bridles, a bradoon, a pair of strap irons and leather; one of the women had some of the bridles in her apron; I looked at them, and asked her what she asked for them; she said, she had some more in her pocket; she pulled them out of her pocket, and asked seven shillings and sixpence; I would not buy them; I thought they were not honestly come by.
Are these two the same women? - Yes, I took such notice of the women by looking at them, that I am quite sure they are the same.

             sworn.
On the 6th of February, this woman came to our shop; I work with the last witness, and they offered the bridles for sale; the prisoner Ault, had some of the property in her pocket; the other had some in her apron; the other woman said, if you have a mind to buy them, I have some more; she asked two shillings and sixpence for them; he would not buy them; in the evening I was desired to come down; I am sure these are the women.
A WITNESS sworn.
I did not take 
               
                  Sarah
                   Ault
               



            , I took the other with one bridle, which I tied up with a piece of pack-thread; I cannot say her name; it was between seven and eight; I cannot recollect the day of the month; I took no notice of it; I brought her away; this is the bridle I found upon her; I am sure of this. (Deposed to.) They madeSarah Ault a promise, that if she sent the property home she should not be hurt; the man that took her is not here.
PRISONER AULT'S DEFENCE.
This young woman and me were drinking in this gentleman's house some evening; I do not know which; coming along she picked up these bridles; I thought them rubbish, and they remained in the room till the next day; I took them to several places with this young woman to sell them.
Court to Horsley. Are these bridles the same that were offered to sell to you? - Yes, they are.

ANN JOHNSON
. I am a widow, and live in Tyler-street, St. James—I keep a shop there. I missed two rolls of flannel on Monday, the 18th of September, between one and two o'clock—there was an alarm given—I ran out to Broad-street, Carnaby-market, and saw the prisoner in custody, and my niece had got the flannel.





PRISCILLA ANN MOYAN
. I live with my aunt. Between one and two o'clock I was in the parlour adjoining the shop—I heard a footstep, and saw the prisoner going out of the shop, with some flannel under his arm—I ran after him, calling, "Stop thief," along Carnaby-street, into West-street—I saw him then running without the flannel—a girl stopped me, and said he had thrown it into the shop, where I found it.





PRISCILLA VAUGHAN
. I heard a cry of "Stop thief—I was in the shop in West-street, behind the counter—the prisoner threw the flannel into our shop—I went to the door—I am certain it was him—he had it under his right arm before he threw it in—I did not see him again till he was at Marlborough-street.





JOHN HARWOOD
. I heard the alarm given, and saw the prisoner running down Broad-street—I took him into custody—the flannel was delivered to me at Marlborough-street.
(Property produced and sworn to.)

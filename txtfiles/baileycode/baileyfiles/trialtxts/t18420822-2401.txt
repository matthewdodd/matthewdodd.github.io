SUSANNAH PRICE
. I am the wife of James Price, of Holloway-road, About eleven o'clock in the morning of the 17th of August, I was at the back of the house—I came into the shop, and there found the prisoner—I looked at the till—the bowl and silver were gone from it, and the empty bowl was under the counter—I had seen it shortly before—it contained some silver, I cannot say what, and there were some halfpence in the till.

Prisoner. The lady says she lost 4s. 6d. or 5s., and there was only 3s. 4d. in the till.





WILLIAM NATHAN
. I was going into the prosecutor's shop, and saw the prisoner lying across the counter, with his hand in the till—I saw him take his hand from the till, and shut it—he said he had been knocking some time, and could not make any body hear—I said, "You must wait till we do make somebody hear now"—he dropped the bowl—I went for a policeman.

Prisoner. I had no bowl in my hand; I was only leaning over the counter, knocking, as nobody came; I went in to buy some bread and cheese; I did not have my hand in the till. Witness. I am sure he had, and the bowl was in his right hand.






EDWARD PRICE
. I was sent for—I found two shillings, two sixpences, and 4 1/2 d. on the prisoner.

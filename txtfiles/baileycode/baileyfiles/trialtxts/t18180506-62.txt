            . I lodge with 
               
                  Robert 
                  Butters
               



            , in Fetter-lane


; the leaden sink was fixed in the kitchen, under ground. On the 11th of April, about eleven o'clock at night, I was coming out of the back-parlour, and heard somebody coming up stairs - I saw the prisoner with the sink on his back, going out of the passage-hearing me, he threw one of the shutters down; I followed him to the street - door, and Mr. Rawlings ran out; I went into the kitchen, and found the leaden sink gone-it weighed 50lbs. Rawlings secured him, and took him to the watch-house. The lead was afterwards fitted to the sink. I am sure the prisoner is the man. The door was left open.

            . I rent the shop of 
               
                  Robert 
                  Butters
               



            , who lives in the back-parlour. I heard the shutter fall. Garland said a man had run out; I went out, and collared him with the sink on his shoulder.

            , who lives in Fenchurch-buildings



. Last Monday week, the prisoner Larkin came to the house for the linen, and said, he was going to take it to the cart, which stood in Fenchurch-street; I did not know him before. I gave him a bag of linen, which was made up ready for the carrier. I followed him, and found him in about ten minutes, in Fenchurch-street; and asked where he was going to take the linen - he said, to the cart; I was not satisfied, and he stopped Wickers, another carrier - who said, he was Larkin's son, who is our carrier; he threw the linen into Wicker's cart, and I went home. He is Larkin's son.

            . I am a hackney-man. I was on the stand in Mark-lane, about three o'clock; Smith came up, and asked the fare to Westminster. I asked if there was any thing to carry - he said, a bundle; I said 4 s., and he told me to follow him; he overtook Larkin with a bundle, which was put into my coach; they got in with it, and just by Westminster-abbey, they told me to go to the public-house over by Dean's-yard, and have something to drink; they both got out, leaving the bundle in the coach. I went into the public-house with them, and had a pot of beer - Smith went out, Foster joined them, and soon after Smith returned, and paid me. Foster carried the bundle from the coach.
SMITH. Q. Did I not go away before the bundle was taken - A. I think not; he paid me my fair.

            . I am watchman of the Abbey. On Monday, I was at the Coach and Horses, public-house, about half-past three o'clock, and saw Larkin and Foster with Bell the coachman, having a pot of beer. I went out, and took the number of the coach, then went to lock up the Abbey; and on returning, saw Larkin, Smith, and Foster together.

            . I am an officer. On Monday afternoon, the 17th February, I went with Larkin's father to Bureau's house, in the Almonry - he and his wife sat there at tea. I said,
"Where is the bundle of linen which was brought in this afternoon - he said,
"There has been none brought in here at all;" both declared that none had been brought in. I said, a person saw it brought in - he said, I was welcome to look round the room. I asked where his bed-room was - he said, that was it; I said,
"There is no bed here." I went to the back-room, on the ground-floor, where I knew that he slept; I pulled the curtains back, and saw linen strewed all over the bed; I called for a light, he muttered something, and seemed unwilling to give me one, my brother got par. Bureau said,
"Mr. Popls, I will tell you where it is." I said, I had found it; he followed me into the room, and the linen laid there - the woman went out of the house, I asked the man how he got it, he said, it was left there for him to purchase, and that he opened the bundle to uncertain the value. I sent him to the office, and afterwards apprehended his wife. Next day, I apprehended the other prisoners, and found the duplicate of two shirts upon Smith.
Cross-examined by MR. PARNDERGAST. 
               Q. 
            Is the person here who saw the bundle taken in - A. No; I only heard that it was seen. I think he said, he did not know who left it; he keeps a sort of eating-house - the bedroom is only divided from the shop by curtains; he positively denied having it three different times - he did not ask his wife any questions about it; she said at the office, that a tall man with sandy hair brought it.

            . I was with my brother. Bureau and his wife denied all knowledge of the property. I took him to the Hoop and Grapes public-house - he said there, that a short man in a light jacket and trowsers, brought the linen, that he came to him at a public-house; and asked if he would buy them - that he told him to take them to his house, and if he liked them, he might call at seven o'clock, and he would pay him.

            . I live in Dukes-court, Westminster, two doors from Bureau. On Monday afternoon, about half-past four o'clock, I saw a man go down towards his house, with a large white bundle.
(Property produced and sworn to).
LARKIN'S Defence. I went for the linen for my father. I met Smith, and asked him to get me a coach to take it to Chelsea, as I had missed the cart. I took him to the Coach and Horses, public-house to drink, and asked him to lend me the money to pay for the coach. I borrowed 5 s. of a young man, and being obliged to make up the money, I took the bundle to Bureau, and asked him to let me leave it for half an hour, then took out two shirts and pawned them to get the money for the coachman - intending to make them good the following week. I was going to fetch it, but hearing that Bureau was apprehended, I was afraid.
SMITH'S Defence. I have the same to say - he said, if I called him a coach, he would give me a ride to Westminster. I met him on Tuesday, and he gave me the duplicate of two shirts.

            'S Defence. I did not deny having the property, but as soon as he came, I gave him a candle, and said, I believed somebody had left a bundle,

with him from time to time On the latter end of January or the beginning of February he came to our warehouse we were both together he said Gentlemen I have got a gentleman come from Quebec in partnership in a very good house they are people of very great eminence and will be very good customers he has very large orders with me and for the friendship and favours that I have received at your hands I intend he shall deal as much with you as possible therefore I should be glad you would send half a score pieces of velvets Mr Paterson is to see them at my house that was the name Paterson he said was the gentleman come from Quebec Paterson M Randall and Grant he said were the partners we were unacquainted with them then but we enquired their characters of divers people that came from Quebec before I sent the goods in Mr Cook owed me at that time upwards of 500 l it was this house not his character that induced us to send in the goods we sent in ten pieces of Manchester velvets of different colours to Mr Cook s in Sife-lane this was either the latter end of January last or the beginning of February we entered them down in a pocket memorandum book when we delivered them out that book is in the hands of our assignees I sent Please to receive ten pieces of Manchester velvets as under for Mr Paterson to look at then followed the numbers On the 24th of February he sent his servant John Rice with a bit of paper whereon was wrote the numbers of 7 of the pieces and underwrote at the bottom for Paterson M Randall and Grant these were the seven pieces Mr Paterson had chose out of the ten Q Whose hand-writing was it Hodgson That I cannot tell Rice was apprentice to the prisoner then I believe the numbers did not tally with ours we sent it back again to have the mistake rectified imagining he had put down some numbers of other people he brought 7 numbers a second time which then were not right he went back again and came a third time with 7 numbers then they were exactly right they were 7 of the pieces we had sent in he desired we would make out the bill of parcels and send it in I made out the bill of parcels and to the best of my remembrance I delivered it to Mr Cook himself that he might sign it and deliver it to Mr Paterson that is the usual method I made my bill upon Messrs Paterson M Randall and Grant I believe that afternoon or the next day I asked Mr Cook for the other three pieces Mr Cook said he had had an order from Amsterdam and he had sent them and I must put them to his account they suited him for another order he had from Amsterdam he said he himself was to be made debtor which very reluctantly I did I told him he was so much indebted to us that I did not chuse to go any farther and I thought he used us very ungenerously he said he would soon make it up to us and pay us every farthing I was to give credit two months when it wanted about a week or ten days of two months I went to the New-York coffee-house and enquired for Mr Paterson I was answered by Mr Clark the master of the house he had been gone almost a fortnight for Quebec I was a good deal surprized and immediately went to Mr Cook and told him of it and asked him how he could take up goods for such a person when he was sensible to himself he was gone out of the Kingdom he said he was sure it was a mistake it was an oversight he must have forgot it he was a very good man a very punctual man and I need not be the least uneasy about my money and to the best of my remembrance he said he certainly must have left orders with either Mr Bond or Mr Vanderhagen to pay that money for he imagined something called him away sooner than he intended to go for he had not paid him his charges and he was not the least uneasy about it Mr Cook called upon me a few days before he became a bankrupt and shewed me a bill for 530 or 531 l or thereabouts drawn by Thomas Cook and Co payable to their own order at 3 or 4 months I am not quite clear in that he desired I would get it discounted for him and he would pay me 300 l to account I told him I believed it was impossible to get it done but I would try and accordingly I took the bill he said how much do I owe you let me see said I that you shall soon see I opened the ledger and drew out to the best of my remembrance an account of the different sums and debts as I was going to cast them up said he you have been uneasy about Paterson M Randall and Grant you talked of sending full powers against them I should be sorry to have them affronted for I am certain they will pay and perhaps next packet or a packet or two may bring remittances but I ll tell you what If you will discount me this bill and give me the difference which will set me at liberty add Paterson M Randall and Grant to my account and I ll pay you Q What did he mean by liberty Hodgson He was a little necessitated for cash at that time Q What was the difference Hodgson The difference was about 130 l which would have been coming to me I under-wrote at the bottom to the best of my remembrance Paterson and Co or Paterson M Randall and Grant 101 l 3 s 9 d the value of 7 pieces of velvets he went away with this account and the next day he called upon me again I had the bill with me I immediately went with the bill to a merchant to ask him to discount it he said he did not like the parties but if I was urgent upon him he could not refuse me to discount it but had rather not for some particular reasons I did not urge him any more to do it but brought the bill back Mr Cook came to me the next day I think and asked me if I had discounted the bill I told him I had not and believed it was not in my power just then he said he had got a friend that would do it immediately one Mr Aderly a person I did not know he desired me to let him have the bill and said if I would go with him to the Rainbow coffee-house Cornhill I should not come out of the house till I had all the money I went with him there to the best of my remembrance he enquired if Mr Aderly had been there he was answered no he desired me to stay a bit and he would be back again immediately and I should be sure of my money before I returned home I staid he took the bill and went out but never came back to me again I saw him but once after that before he became a bankrupt that was at the Queen s Arms in St Paul s Church yard then he promised me certainly that I should not lose a farthing by him Q How long did you wait for him Hodgson I waited there I believe 3 hours I told him at the Queen s Arms of his behaviour to me and likewise that he would ruin me he went from thence to his brother s I apprehend but he was a bankrupt that night or the night following One Lyon a foreman of his came to us I think the day after he was a bankrupt I am not quite clear to the day and gave us an account by order of his master of what was become of the number of goods he had had of us I told the prisoner in the King s Bench we had made application to have recovered these goods back again by virtue of Lyon s information but we could not come at them I told him what Lyon had informed me he made this answer D - n them all a pack of villains they have ruined me meaning the people into whose hands he had put the goods which were Levi Norden Joseph Jacob Moses Levi and Abraham Abrahams four Jews he said he had been obliged to send them there to support himself and that there were all the goods that he had bought of us formerly in all twenty-five pieces of velvets he said they were in the hands of Abraham Abrahams for an account of Levi Norden we immediately applied to Mr Alderman Nelson for a warrant we found these very goods that should have gone to Quebec were in their hands in that manner We had a warrant granted against Cook and I endeavoured to take him before he was surrendered into the King s Bench but could not He was I think the next day sent to the King s Bench in discharge of his bail he surrendered himself My partner and I applied to Mr Abraham Abrahams with Mr Young an attorney but did not get the goods Q Did you see them there Hodgson No we did not I saw the prisoner in the Borough and told him he was a very great rascal and ought to be made an example of I saw some of the goods at Guild-hall at the finishing his examination he was asked in Guild-hall what he did with all the goods he had of us said he there is an account of them all in my examination he was asked more particularly what he did with those 7 pieces which he had in the name of Paterson M Randall and Grant his answer was they were in the hands of the Jews I asked him Did Mr Paterson ever give you such an or der to buy them goods he answered no I heard him say this several times that they were in the hands of the Jews and that he had no order from Mr Paterson to buy them He sent to me once from the King s Bench to come over to him to pay me part of the money he offered me 30 l and said he should be glad to make it up saying why should there be any animosity between us Q Have you any account of the numbers and qualities of the pieces Hodgson He produced a book This is my day-book This is my hand-writing dated the 27th of February the day that John Rice brought us the account He reads the numbers colours yards and prices of the pieces which amount to 101 l 3 s 9 d The other three pieces I entered to his own account On his cross examination he said he never looked upon the prisoner as debtor for the 7 pieces which he had charged to Paterson M Randall and Grant and that the prisoner was debtor to him above 600 l exclusive of the 101 l 3 s 9 d Thomas Roebuck I was in partnership with Mr Hodgson He confirmed the evidence of Hodgson with this addition that three or four days after the prisoner had discovered the 7 pieces were not gone abroad that he came to the prosecutor s warehouse and pulled out a bundle of papers among them were the particulars of all the velvets he had had of them that he saw the particular paper of the ten pieces that they were at Abraham Abrahams s a Jew s house in Poor Jury-lane and that one Lyon the prisoner s servant had that paper delivered up again to him and at the same time the prisoner produced the bill of parcels which was wrote by them for Paterson M Randall and Grant at which time he plainly saw he was tricked out of the velvets upon which he applied to Mr

from the Prisoner Did you say when you first came in that you did not know me Bonham No Mr William Gines This draft was brought to me about the day of the date of it by John Sibley The purpose for which it was brought was that it might be entered on Mr Bonham s book he kept cash at our house I refused to do it and told him that this Winnest the pretended drawer of this draft was a person unknown to me I never had any account or connexion whatever with any person of that name nor do I know that there is any such person existing I was present at Sir John Fielding s when Mr Keeling officiated for Sir John at the examination of the prisoner Mr Bonham was sworn A number of persons were brought into the room I believe not less than twenty that Mr Bonham might fix on the culprit and Mr Bonham did so he very calmly and sedately looked round the room from man to man and he did deliberately fix upon the prisoner and said That is the man Mr Bonham s servant who stood by did not at all interfere but some time after his matter had thus fixed upon the prisoner he spoke an said That is the man I perfectly know the man At the second examination the prisoner said You little jeweller how should you advertise that I had defrauded you of a diamond ring of twenty-seven pounds value and eigh guineas Know there is a balance of money due to me You know you owe me the odd shillings upon the balance Don t you know says the prisoner that I was to call upon you for the balance To which Mr Bonham replied Aye but you knew better things than to call upon me Sir John said I thought you was going to ask Mr Bonham such questions as might induce us to believe you innocent Don t you know you are confirming your own guilt Q from the prisoner You seem to be so exact in every thing that passed pray can you recollect how many odd shillings I mentioned to Mr Bonham were owing to me Gines I can t recollect exactly Court Prisoner that sort of behaviour will not be of use to you conduct yourself with decency becoming your situation Prisoner I know myself innocent therefore I hope your lordship will permit me to ask such questions as I think necessary Court You may ask any questions that may be of service to you but don t be so flippant Prisoner When Mr Bonham was desired to pick out the man whether he did not say he could not swear to the man as it was six months ago Mr Gines Mr Bonham did not say that he walked round Sir John s office with great caution he said it was six months ago and after he had deliberately walked round from man to man he fixed upon the prisoner Prisoner Did Mr Bonham intimate that he said no more about it because I cleared it up so plain this Davis would have been a material witness with regard to my innocence I will call a witness to prove that one Humphreys paid away drafts many times my name is Gumpay Humphreys Eliezer For the Prisoner Jacob Eliezer Q What did Mr Bonham declare before Sir John Fielding Eliezer The justice desired us all to walk into the room every man that was there I was present I stood next the prisoner at the bar Mr Bonham then after looking some time looked very hard at me that I was thinking he would say I was the person he said he did not know the man and it was six or nine months ago this was the first time of the examination he said he did not know the man being six months ago Court Tell me the very words Eliezer He did not know the man being six months ago perhaps the man might have altered in the time one Mr Bureau standing next to him and Mr Bond Sir John Fielding s clerk pointed with a pen at the prisoner when he pointed with a pen Abraham Bureau made answer That is Mr Humphrys he made answer to him in Hebrew that he should not be afraid for he would come through it Q Before that had Mr Bonham fixed upon Humphrys at all Eliezer No he was looking all round the room and could not see the man and looked very hard upon me being of the same size Q He had not challenged the prisoner as being the man till Bond pointed with the pen to him and Bureau said That is Mr Humphrys Eliezer No he did not say he knew him till Bureau said That is Mr Humphrys Q Then he had not fixed upon Humphrys till after Bureau said That is Mr Humphrys Eliezer No Q How did he fix upon him then Eliezer He said he believed it was him but put on his spectacles at the same time and said that being six or eight months ago he could not be sure as to his person he said a man might alter in six or seven months Q Is that all that passed Eliezer All that passed at that time Q Upon the first examination did Mr Bonham speak positive to Humphrys or not Eliezer After Bureau said it was him he said the same that it was Mr Humphreys Q You told me just now that he believed it was but it was six months ago and a man might alter his face Eliezer He said so and that a man might alter his speech too twenty people were present The Jury This witness I believe was in court during the examination Q Was you in court Eliezer Yes I was in court Mary Emanuel I have known the prisoner from a boy Q What way of life is he in Emanuel I don t know any further than that he is a very sober honest young man I never heard any thing amiss of him Court If you don t know how he gets his living I shall ask you no more of his character Emanuel His father was a tea-merchant in Angel-alley Church-street Prisoner s Defence It was a piece of malice I was ordered last sessions to be admitted to bail Mr Gines and Mr Benham desired them not to bail me that I might not go about to get my witnesses myself Guilty T

t17911207-46  47 JORDAN WAINE was indicted for obtaining money by false pretences from Mary Yostus to procure a pardon for Joseph Yostus her husband The case opened by Mr Garrow May it please your Lordship Gentlemen of the Jury Gentlemen you have very lately heard from the Clerk of the Arraigns the stress of the indictment against the prisoner who comes before you for judgment on the state of an indictment for misdemeanor only and Gentlemen in the course of some experience in this place attended very often with painful circumstances I have never been called upon to lend my poor assistance to a prosecution in which I have contributed my aid with so much satisfaction as on the present occasion because you have before you as the evidence will prove a man carrying on one of the most prostigate and abandoned systems of imposition on a person the last in the world on whom such a system should be practised I am most perfectly sure that when the facts are laid before you that you and the whole Court and every man that hears me will be of opinion that banishment from this country does not reach his offences and that all that the Court can do falls short of doing justice to him Gentlemen having laid hold of a poor woman of the name of Yostus whose husband had been convicted at this place for a felony he pretended to her that he would prepare a petition in order to obtain the extension of the Royal mercy to that husband he afterwards pretended he had prepared such a petition and had laid it before his Majesty that it had had its effect and was then laying in the office of the noble Secretary of State and all that was necessary now to be done was to obtain a sum of money to carry that petition from the office One would hardly believe that depraved human nature would furnish a man with pretences to strip a miserable widow deprived of her husband and to strip five miserable orphan children of every rag they had to cover them to support himself in his vices by amusing them with the hopes of obtaining this pardon Besides Gentlemen if one considers the nature of a crime like this there are circumstances in it that make one shudder suppose there had been any favourable circumstances in this poor man s case if he had fallen into honest and honourable hands his case would have been presented to the worthy Recorder and if there had been any favourable circumstances it is a libel for the first time uttered by the prisoner that it is necessary to grease the wheels of government as he calls it that it is necessary to give a fee to the Clerk of the Record the officer at the Secretary of State s office and to all the various hands in order to procure the extension of the Royal mercy Gentlemen it is right it should be stated it is perfectly well known to us that there is nothing necessary to obtain that mercy but that there should appear to the Judge who tries favourable circumstances and if there is any department of the Government more chastely or more honourably administred than another it isthat of extending the Royal mercy to persons who are suitors for that mercy but if this man had any favourable circumstances which could have been made appear the prisoner was preventing the application of them by deluding her with a fallacious hope therefore I am warranted to state that a more complicated misdemeanor cannot come before any Court Gentlemen the day after the poor man had been convicted of stealing coals to the value of 5 s the prisoner applied to him he told him he should be able to procure a pardon if he could raise two guineas one guinea of which was to be delivered into the office of the Secretary of State a most impudent and audacious libel The poor man locked up in that strong house sent to his wife she was anxious to get her husband home he told her the business would be presently done - stealing a few coals - no difficulty He prepared a petition shewed it to the poor woman who approved of it and gave it to her to get it signed by a number of her friends then says he some of my friends shall sign it and he hinted some parliamentary interest another audacious libel Thank God in this country the Royal mercy is not dealt out on such terms He said I have several names and among the rest two members of parliament so he took her to Whitehall and went into some office which he said was the Secretary of State s there was somebody ready to attend on this gentleman now says he I shall attend on this day by day till the petition is considered and as soon as it is you shall hear from me upon which the poor woman went home for that time at least happy Gentlemen in the course of a few days Mr Waine found his way to her again says he here is sad news you have been talking about this to somebody and we shall be defeated the poor woman said no nobody could have heard of it from her says he there is more difficulty than I expected I must have more money that was the first application then somebody had got scent of this that she had enemies that her husband had enemies then there was an anonymous letter sent to Mr Recorder at last he found two gentlemen very respectable men to answer for his good behaviour but they must have a guinea a-piece so he went on not to fatigue you with the variety of frauds this man practised upon her taking the miserable pence out of her pocket and pretending that indeed more was wanted but he in charity and kindness would make up the rest at last he told her - says he now I have good news to tell you I saw my Lord Grenville last night and these people are always very intimate you know with great men and Lord Grenville said Waine your business shall be settled immediately says he I do not like to come into this house you have some enemies they are always writing to the Recorder about it I will tell you when your husband will come home the poor woman began to be very uneasy why the convicts are to be removed from Newgate on board the transport says he they will not remove him for I saw my Lord Grenville and he told me the thing was all in a train at last he came says he well I could do nothing better I have got a conditional pardon for him to go for an East-India soldier this did not suit with the poor woman says he why so downcast the serjeant for a guinea will let him go any where you please says she I have some friends at Windsor first oh says he that is the best place in the world still more money was procured then the petition lay in Lord Grenville s office nothing was to be done without money well Gentlemen at last the husband is sent down to Portsmouth to the transport ship the poor woman now began to suspect there was something very wrong indeed she said Sir this is sad work says he do not fear I have been down to the ship myself and left a shilling for him and really the smell of the ship has made me so sick though I did not see him cannot you lend me a trifle to get something to drink to make me better In short Gentlemen not to pursue this wicked story the sequel is that the poor man is now on his voyage to Botany-bay and the poor woman is now come here before you Gentlemen for a resource and restitution very inadequate indeed to the great-loss she has sustained Gentlemen this case reminds one of a story that we crown lawyers hear very early in the opening of our profession of an attorney who used to practise in this place formerly and had undertaken the defence of a prisoner the man was indicted and he sent cash to this attorney to take care of him but when his trial came on he found himself deserted without either counsellor or solicitor he sent in great rage for the attorney and told him his situation he sent him word not to fear for the Court would not try him however he was tried and convicted he then sent with double haste oh says he there is a flaw in the indictment they will not pass sentence upon you however they did pass sentence upon him with the other convicts then he was frightened indeed and he sent to his friend the attorney well says he you have brought me into a dreadful situation indeed here I am in the condemned cell says the attorney who kept out of the way all the while himself all is safe do not be uneasy they will not venture to pass sentence on you however sentence was passed upon him with the rest of the convicts then he sent again all terror and alarm oh says the attorney they will not put you in the death-warrant all will be safe however in a few days Mr Recorder s warrant came down to Mr Akerman for the execution of those convicts and this poor man among the rest then the poor creature whose situation I pretend not to describe sent to this unfeeling wretch of an attorney again says he for God s sake come to me do something for me I am very much alarmed for Mr Akerman s people tell me we are to be hanged on Wednesday next to which this unfeeling attorney for the last time replied Never fear says he they dare not hang you but I wish I could see them do it for if they hang you I will punish them very severely so it was with Mr Waine Gentlemen of the Jury now comes the pleasant part of the picture thank God Almighty there is no situation however abject and miserable and distressed in this country which when that distress comes to be known by their superiors is not protected the case came to be known to the late sheriff Mr Alderman Macaulay who immediately directed the poor woman to apply to Mr Shelton who was instructed to submit the case as it is properly submitted to you Gentlemen thank God whilst the office is in such hands and in such a succession of officers there is no great danger that these things will pass with impunity this is the first case that modern iniquity has presented to us for judgement I know very well that it will be made a terrible example to those who have been preying but too much on the miseries of their fellow-creatures you will feel considerable satisfaction in pronouncing on his guilt if he is found guilty and the Court will take care to punish that men of the like description may not fancy in future that they are to sport with the feelings and miseries of the distressed The judgement of conviction proved by Mr Shelton Wednesday the 13th of April 1791 before Lord Kenyon Mr Baron Hotham and Mr Justice Heath &c Joseph Yostus for receiving six bushels of coals to be transported fourteen years MARY YOSTUS sworn Mr Garrow You are the wife of the unfortunate man who was convicted for stealing coals - Yes a man left a direction for the prisoner in consequence of which I went to him and he promised to procure a pardon for my husband in a few days he said he had great intercession with somebody at the Secretary of State s and that he was not in the least afraid but he should soon have a pardon for my husband I was very earnest to have it done and willing to submit to any thing that he told me hewas to have a guinea for the petition and a guinea to give in with the petition at the Secretary of State s office he was to call on me the next day with the petition and I was to get my friends to sign it he would try my friends but he did not care whether I had any or not as he had plenty of hands to sign it he called on me the next day and brought me a petition which some of my friends signed and some were not at home then I went with him to some of his friends and they were willing to sign it then he said there were sufficient hands and two members of parliament he had the two guineas when he brought the petition which was the second day then I went with him to some office I cannot tell what office nor what part of the town he gave it to some gentleman then he said it was all right I was very much unacquainted with the town at that time Prisoner You had better state to her the situation of Lord Grenville s office and then she can know Mr Garrow You may do that on cross examination Mrs Yostus I never was there in my life I do not know the situation of the office He was to solicit this petition every day - Yes Mr Garrow Now my Lord I will pass shortly over all the rest till I come to the pretensions upon which the indictment is founded Mrs Yostus He said he would take particular care to do my business at length my husband was removed from Newgate to the ship I met him somewhere near Patten-court in Fleet-street I was quite distressed and was looking for him he said he was seeking for me I told him I thought my husband was not to be sent away he said they did not dare to send him away but he was sent in the room of one of the men who stabbed himself and he was sent to make up the number he said it would be very easy to fetch him back from the ship and then Mr Akerman s fees on being discharged would be all saved so that it was better than if he had not he said he had called on Mr Akerman and he was very angry because he had wronged him of his fees the next time I saw him he bid me have good spirits for it was easy to fetch him away and he said he must see him and at night he came and said he had been within four or five miles of Gravesend but he could not see him he said he was very ill at the smell of the ship and had left a shilling for my husband he came again and said there was a pardon lying in the office for my husband but it could not be got out without having two men to be bound for his good behaviour for two or three years and that he had two men of property but they would not be bound under two guineas and then there would be nothing more to do I gave him two guineas for that purpose the next day then he came and asked me if I was ready for him and I gave it him with all the pleasure in the world How did you get the money together - By pawning my clothes and the bed from under me I have six children all boys he knew my distress and saw all this one of my boys had the misfortune the very day I went with him to go to the ship to fall down an area and break his thigh when I returned I found my child under the doctor s hands the pardon was to come in a few days a few days after this I called at his lodgings again he said he was doing my business neglecting his own as if I was his sister but he could not get the pardon from the office at last he came to my apartments and said I have good news for you I have a conditional pardon for your husband to go for an East-India soldier and he said our labour is all lost and the expences all thrown away he had better have been as he was I was of the same opinion I asked him if there were any means of getting him off he said yes there were but he knew I could not stand the expence as I had been so much distressed before and I asked him what it would be at the outside he took a pen and ink and wrote down something for 4 l and then he could get him off from being asoldier could arrest him or something of that sort Mr Garrow What did he get by this last lie - He got the value of 4 l I sold my bed for two guineas and pawned my buckles and sold and pawned every thing I could make money of but I could not raise the 4 l I could only raise about 3 l 17 s or thereabouts he said he would make up the rest for me You never got a pardon - No Nor never would in such hands till the day of judgment certainly Prisoner My Lord being deprived of counsel I should esteem it a favour to be permitted to examine the prosecutrix Court Certainly you may ask her any questions you please Prisoner My Lord I wish to ask Mrs Yostus how she first became acquainted with me - A person came and wrote his name down Did not you come to the Red-lion in Old-Bethlehem and apply to me to get a petition drawn in order to get your husband a pardon - Yes I did it was somewhere by Old Bethlehem I do not know the sign Was not it then agreed on for me to draw a petition for that purpose - Yes After I had drawn that petition and carried it to your house and read it over to you whether several of your friends and particularly your husband s master refused to sign the same - Some refused it because they did not know him because he had been in town but a short time Whether or no I did not get several of your friends to sign this petition - Yes After that whether or no you did not go with me to several respectable people the first was Mr Evans the wine and brandy merchant the corner of York-street - I said so before Did not you give me one guinea not two - You had a guinea for writing the petition and a guinea to give in with the petition At that same time - Yes Recollect yourself - Yes Did not I desire you to meet me at the Prince William Henry s at Charing-cross the next day to Good-Friday when I brought you the petition - I do not recollect the sign I did meet you by appointment and went with you to the place Now Mrs Yostus we went into the Treasury as I call it and I went up a great number of stone stairs till we came to the top of the building to a green door do you recollect going up a large flight of stairs - I do not remember any thing of the door I remember going up a sight of stairs but I do not know what office it was Do you recollect after that my drawing a petition to the worshipful Recorder - Yes You went with me and saw me deliver it in to his lordship s servant - Yes Do you recollect another petition being also drawn up to Baron Hotham - Yes and you dropt it down the area as a person said my lord was not at home Do you recollect my taking a letter to Lord Grenville s house in St James s-street with you - Yes I went with you with all the three letters that you have mentioned Now Mrs Yostus I shall be glad to know at what time the 3 l 17 s was paid to me when was that - You had it of me and you know you had it of me It is amazing to me that you cannot recollect the day if I pay any money I can recollect the day - It is not surprising considering the state of mind I was in After this supposed time of receiving these different sums did you employ me any further in the business respecting your husband - You know I did Court Then you continued to employ him afterwards - Yes Prisoner I think another circumstance but you speak so low but only I gain information from the learned counsel it was when going to the side of the ship that I came up and told you I could not see him and you said you would go yourself - Yes and indeed I did go but you had never been there Will you swear that - They told me you never had been there But telling will not do good woman Court If you ask the question you must take the answer Prisoner Did I represent to you that I was acquainted with Captain Manning of the Pitt and did I go with you - I went there with him Did not I use every endeavour in my power to prevail on the Captain to let you go aboard to see your husband - Certainly you did but it was a false pretence you made to him I am not talking about a false pretence or what pretence it was was not the Captain s orders that he should be on board on the Friday following and if I would send a letter by you to him you should be permitted to go on board - That is very true I think you said that Captain Manning should tell you if your husband was so unfortunate to go out in the ship Pitt he should be liberated from his irons and assist the cook - Yes he told me so Do you recollect a petition presented to the King - As you said Likewise another to the Queen - As you informed me Have not you before and since that time expressed that you was fully satisfied with my conduct that I had done every thing to serve you - It was all a pretence for you got me no pardon Have you not said so - I was not satisfied Court Have you ever said that you was satisfied with him and that he had done all he could - Never any thing of that kind all I said was that he should bring my husband to me and I should be satisfied that was what I gave him the money for if I had had ten times as much I should have given it him he said he would bring my husband to me and he would forfeit his life if he did not Have you any other witnesses to prove the payments - No he always wished me to keep it as a secret and so I did or else I should not have done as I have if I had let my friends know it Prisoner My Lord I am in an aukward situation here this is a matter between party and party WILLIAM POLLACK Esq sworn Mr Garrow You are so good Sir to attend from the Secretary of State s office - Yes If there had been any pardon for William Yostus it would have come to your knowledge - I cannot possibly charge my memory they all go through my hands I have carefully perused my book which I have with me there is no reference to the Judge which is a previous step to the ordering of a pardon Therefore of course no pardon could have been applied for - Certainly not If by any accident such pardon had been there no fee whatever would have been taken with it but it would have been sent to the Judge who tried the prisoner in the regular course of office - Undoubtedly I mean the Secretary of State s letter - It is the sign manual directed to the Recorder of London and in the country to the sheriffs Court With respect to these pardons I may have been misinformed but I wish to know whether any person is not intitled to take that pardon out of your office - Yes they do When these are taken out is not there a certain fee by act of parliament - Yes by the established fees of the office there is a fee of 1 l 7 s 6 d that does not occur three times in a long period Mr Garrow Could it have been true that a pardon for this man Yostus had been laying in the office and might be fetched away for paying the fees - No Of course it is equally untrue that there was a conditional pardon - Certainly Court Supposing there had been a pardon there and this man had paid the fee would not he have been entitled to have it delivered to him - Certainly Sir Mr Garrow But in this case neither was there any pardon any sign manual or any reference to the Judge - No there is no pardon whatever granted unless there is a reference to the Judge and it appears from my book that there was no reference and consequently could not be any pardon PRISONER s DEFENCE My Lord the prosecutrix Mary Yostus came to me to endeavour to obtain his Majesty s royal pardon for her unfortunate husband who from the circumstances and the nature of the case she laid down I thought there might be a probability of obtaining the same accordingly I made use of every method not only by my own knowledge but those that knew and drew the petitions and with care and trouble got them signed in the next place those different sums of money she has already charged me with it is impossible where there are only two people concerned in any matter of business for one to confute the other I may say I have not received that sum she may say I have I cannot clear myself any further than in denying absolutely the charge before stated the sum of 8 l 8 s which sum I received at different times on account of the different services that have been carried on in that business now my Lord in the next place this woman knew where I dwelt the last time of that business was on the Whit-Monday had she been agrieved any way I should rather have supposed she would have called to know how I had succeeded in the business Lord Grenville at this time went out of the home department into the foreign department and the Right Hon Henry Dundas came in it was the mode of proceeding to petition she did not come being disappointed next it is very evident on her own information that there was business carried on by me after these supposed charges and she tells you she has employed me afterwards now is it competent to your reason and understanding to suppose that she should put any further faith or confidence in a man to carry on any further business of that sort it is a very clear matter to me this is a piece of business brought with intent to answer some private purpose and she has got some person to inform Mr Shelton of it he as a gentleman undoubtedly took up the matter to prosecute that I admit to be very right and just but those accusations have no ground it is party against party it is morally impossible where two people are concerned and where the business is directly between party and party she might have as well have assured the Court that she paid me 50 l it was out of my power to confute her My Lord I have acted throughout this business with no intent either directly or indirectly to take advantage of this woman whatever I did every thing as far as lay in my power in the business and in consequence of which I must observe that my wife was the person who got the petition to the Queen into the Countess Dowager of Effingham s family it was sent by her and presented whether it had any effect I cannot say she got a violent cold by so doing and has never since been able to do the domestic duties of the family I have three children and one of them blind I have only to say that upon this charge only were I this night summoned before the great tribunal of the awful seat of God to answer for the deeds I have done in this life and had no other charge to answer for I am sure I should be perfectly happy I am totally innocent I never received any sum or sums of money on those pretences whatever I have received sums of money as necessary for a person acting for six weeks going here and there backwards and forwards from Shoreditch to Charing-cross to meet this good woman at different public-houses undoubtedly her mind was very uneasy I put her to no expence on that account she has often declared she was fully satisfied with my conduct I now address myself to your candour and benevolence in this business I am perfectly satisfied that I have done every thing to serve the woman Gentlemen of the Jury I trust to your discrimination and candour in this affair I hope you will see this prosecution like to a man that builds his house on the sand without any foundation GUILTY Transported for seven years Tried by the London Jury before Mr RECORDER

Yes Are you a stock-jobber - I am Did you sell this again - I have and been paid for the whole Do you know who received the dividend - I do not I sold it as a jobber GEORGE GIBBS sworn I witnessed this transfer and the receipt likewise I saw Mr Shaw sign these two several instruments I am clerk in the 3 per Cent office if any person transfers stock there is a person who inspects the ticket and the books to see if the money is there in July 1791 he made two different transfers Mr Shepherd Do you not know jobbers to buy and sell the same day is it a singular thing if so how came it not to be noticed in the year 1790 - I have not inspected accounts so I do not know but ten years ago when I inspected accounts I remember that to have been done when the books shut the 1st of December and were opened the 19th of January For what purpose are the clerks put - To assist paying the dividends I believe Mr Shaw has bought and sold - I have seen an account in the 5 per Cents Mr Garrow What happened ten years ago was the selling some stock that had been bought the same day - It was it is not against all general orders it is in cases of legacies and on some particular occasions when a person will not be in town the next day WILLIAM SLADDEN sworn I live at Kensington on the 17th of January I had a visit from Mr Shaw I never saw him before that day he asked if my name was William Sladden if I had not property in the 3 per Cent Consols I told him yes I had he then said that owing to the multiplicity of names and the hurry of business there had been a mistake that a person had received a dividend of 400 l stock of mine but had given him the money to pay me with if I would accept of it I told him no if there was any mistake I would chuse to have it rectified at the Bank tomorrow says he it is a holiday and no business done come on Thursday I told him yes if nothing particular happened he then told me that his name was Shaw he had been some years in the 3 per Cent office and that he was very well known on Thursday I went to the Bank I found out the broker and went to the 3 per Cent office and saw the chief clerk who informed me that my stock stood right in the ledger but the dividend-warrant was made out for 250 l only Mr Vicary was the chief clerk Mr Knowlys Prisoner s Counsel This conversation was on the 17th you did not come till the 19th he told you his name and that he was a clerk of the Bank and exceedingly well known - Yes ABRAHAM VICARY sworn I am one of the chief clerks in the Bank on Mr Sladden s coming to the office I looked into the state of the ledger and found 650 l to his credit In what manner is the preparation for the dividend-warrants - The books are shut at a certain time when no transfers can be made or paid then of course the several stock-holders stocks had to the ledger balances are taken on those stock-accounts and dividend-warrants prepared on those balances from the balance-sheet the clerks in general do that one takes the ledger the other the slip Mr Shaw appears on the ledger to have over credit for 400 l a false credit which if taken from that improper place Mr Shaw s and put in its proper place Mr Sladden s it would have made Mr Sladden s just 650 l on the balance-sheet the 400 l being in addition to his 250 l which he had there 650 l andthen Sladden would have his whole dividend on the 650 l Mr Garrow to Vicary Was there a person of the name of Hands in the 3 per Cents - There was Do you recollect seeing Mr Shaw and Mr Hands after Mr Sladden came to the Bank on the 19th - I did Was that before or after Mr Shaw was apprized that he must be examined by the Directors - Before in that instance it appears that 250 l was called out to the name of Sladden Mr Shaw had nothing to do in making out that bill - None in the least Had any thing passed between you and Mr Shaw - I went and asked Mr Shaw what mistakes had happened in the office and what occasioned him to go to Kensington on the Tuesday he muttered something and attempted to speak to Mr Hands and did speak as it appeared from what passed I am not positive because I was at a distance soon after that Mr Shaw was sent for I don t know that any intimacy has subsisted between Mr Shaw and Mr Hands he has absconded and is advertised for that and other offences Mr Shepherd I believe no clerk in the Transfer-office does business in his own letter - No except he is in the place Are they never placed in the letter where they have stock - It is not particularly attended to I believe he was not placed in letter S The ticket that is put into a box a clerk takes it out and compares it with the stock in the box - Yes Was this balance taken by Mr Shaw - I don t know Do you not know that often mistakes have happened by people who job - Certainly there have Do you know that it frequently happens that a man buys and sells stock in the same day - I cannot say I don t know except in cases of necessity Is it not frequently done by a gratuity to the clerk - It may be but I don t allow it Mr WALSH sworn I produce the ticket of the transfer in this particular instance passed by Mr Hands whose duty it was in this particular instance to pass it -

He was Mr Garrow On the 19th of January had he any cash - He was over-drawn 400 l by a draft at which time before the coming in of that draft he was over-drawn I believe about 40 l the draft was 360 l HENRY STUBBS sworn I am clerk in the house of Snaith Sykes and Co I paid Mr Moxley s draft for 132 l 6 s 3 d FRANCIS WALSH sworn I am a clerk in the Bank I have an extract from the ledger of the Bank On the 16th of November had Mr Shaw 200 l 3 per Cent Consols - No Sir Had he any money at all - No Now I would ask you whether on the 30th of September he had the sum of 200 l or any other sum in the Consols - No The department in which Mr Shaw was engaged was clerk in the Transfer-office - It was no part of his business to deal in the payment of the dividends it was the first or second day and I believe the last is dated on that day Was it his ordinary business to pay dividends - No his regular business was to transfer except for the first day or two ofpaying dividends when we send the clerks in to assist and I believe Mr Shaw went in From the 18th of May 1789 till this time had he ever had more than 20 l in his account in the Consols - No and that was there only to the 6th of August there was none remaining more than a day Do you permit that transaction to take place of buying and selling on the same day - Not except in particular cases Mr Shepherd addressed the Jury on the part of the Defendant CHARLES DICKSON sworn I live in Gerrard-street I am a brush-maker and turner I have known Mr Shaw nineteen years one of the most exemplary characters I ever heard of ANDREW ABBOTT sworn I live at No 82 Fleet-street I am potter to the Prince of Wales I have known him six or seven years I have intrusted him with many thousand pounds in the stocks JANE POOLE sworn I live in Camomile-street I have known him ten or twelve years he has had very nigh 2000 l of my property he has an honest character in every respect -

t17970111-4  65 LAUNCELOT KNOWLES was indicted for obtaining money under false pretences The indictment was opened by Mr Abbott Mr Garrow May it please your Lordship Gentlemen of the Jury The prosecution which you are now called upon as Jurymen to decide appears to me from the facts which I shall shortly communicate to you to be one of the highest importance that can possibly come for consideration in the shape of a misdemeanor It has been thought by those entrusted with some of the highest departments of the administration to be their duty to submit to your protection a class of persons who can in no other way be protected who are unable to protect themselves and who appear to have been the objects of the most abandoned and profligate plunder that I think I have ever seen stated in any Court of Justice You have collected from my learned friend who has opened the indictment to you that the charge against the prisoner and probably you will agree with me in thinking if I prove the facts to you and which can only subject him to the punishment of a misdemeanor I own for one I wish it was a higher offence the charge against him is that he has obtained at three several times a sum of money amounting in the whole to six guineas by pretending that he had interest with the very respectable persons named in this indictment to procure a pardon for an unhappy person who had been attainted of felony You will find Gentlemen that a man of the name of Saunders who was confined in Newgate under a conviction for felony had a mother naturally extremely anxious to relieve him from the consequences of his conviction she was introduced to the prisoner who without the least difficulty stated that if the pardon she wished was all she desired a remission of the capital sentence and to enter into the navy he had such interest with his Grace the Duke of Portland with Mr Baldwin and a very respectable Magistrate in my eye Sir Watkin Lewes that that was a thing to be obtained without the least difficulty and he thought she might expect a free pardon very soon Such was his interest with those respectable persons but it was not to be done without money and if the money could be procured the pardon would follow of course You may easily believe if a mother could obtain four five or six guineas for such a purpose she would strain every nerve to do it at first she could only raise three guineas part of this to the knowledge of the man at the bar she borrowed for the purpose of advancing he then gave her encouragement that it would very soon be done but he must have more money she was to come next day with more money she had none but he was so importunate and above all gave her such hopes that the pardon would arrive that she by borrowing got two guineas more she saw no more of him for a month From that time in suspense dreading every day the execution of the law upon her son and anxiously expecting the effect of this man s interest upon a subsequent application he obtained another guinea and he had now got all the poor creature was able to raise by any means she hoped the pardon would now soon arrive indeed he told her then it was actually accomplished and only waited for some forms but those forms must likewise be attended with a further advance of money and he put it to her how much more she would give if he compleated the contract she said she would endeavour to make the six ten guineas she would give him other four guineas but she had it not she would give a note for it Oh no he said that would not do at all how should he get paid when the son was discharged - The poor woman had it not and therefore she could not advance it this man with a ferocity and brutality that degrades him beneath the character of man immediately replied d-n her blood he would do no more for her then nothing could satisfy him and though she had advanced all this money he would leave her after having raised her hopes he would leave her in that state of despair and despondency In this situation the poor woman had an opportunity of representing the matter to the persons who have sent me here The pretence is that he had great influence with his Grace the Duke of Portland You know Gentlemen that that Nobleman is at the head of the Administration you know too that it is the province of his Majesty alone to dispense pardons and that this unhappy woman s son could only obtain it from that fource and it is the most important and I believe I may take the liberty of adding the most pleasant prerogative of his Majesty and I am sure I ought to say that none are treated with greater mercy than through the medium of the noble personages whom I have stated it is extended in all proper cases without influence or interest and it is not to be bartered for money there is no interest no influence that can obtain it I shall be under the necessity of troubling his Grace to state merely for form s sake whether he had any such influence as he pretended in order to prove the allegations in this indictment I shall put the same question to the other persons and I am sure when the charge is proved you will be happy to protect those unhappy persons who are too often the prey of men in his situation CLAUDIUS STEPHEN HUNTER sworn - Examined by Mr Fielding - Q Have you the record of the conviction of John Saunders - A I have I have examined it with the original it is read dated 26th of June 1796 ANN KEYS sworn - Examined by Mr Garrow Q Had you a son of the name of John Saunders - A Yes Q He had the misfortune to be convicted and was confined in Newgate - A Yes he was Q Do you know the prisoner at the bar - A Yes very well Q When did you first become acquainted with him - A There was a woman of the name of Sells who was related to the smugglers that he cleared out of Newgate and she persuaded me to let her go to him Q When did you first become personally acquainted with the prisoner - A The first was he came to me I think the second of July he had directions where to find me from sells either the first or second of July I cannot tell which Q Do you recollect what day of the week it was - A It was on a Saturday he came to my house I did not see him when he came I was out at a day s work the first I saw of him was on the Sunday afternoon the first word he asked me was if I had not a son in trouble I told him I had he said he could be of great service to him but it would be attended with a very great expence I told him I was but a poor woman but I would give all that lay in my power he said he was a poor man at times himself sometimes a gentleman sometimes a poor man sometimes a room-keeper and sometimes a house-keeper and he told me that he was serjeant under Sir Watkin Lewes in the City militia he asked me what I would agree to give him to get my son on board one of his Majesty s ships to serve on board of a man of was I told him I could wish him to serve his Majesty as he had been in that glorious engagement of the 1st of June and had received a wound I should wish him to serve his Majesty again he told me he could do it with a great deal of ease he said he had cleared the smugglers which was a great deal harder than to clear a criminal because they were against government and if I would give him five guineas he would make no doubt that he could clear him in a very little time to serve his Majesty I agreed to give him the five guineas and he told me if he did not clear him to serve his Majesty on board a man of war he would return me every halfpenny of my money again but he made no doubt he could do it and that in a very short time he said he had such an influence with Mr Baldwin and if he went to the Duke of Portland s and knocked at the door he was introduced when many that came in carriages were sent away he told me he would not ask me for any more money till he was cleared on board a man of war Q You have told us of his Grace the Duke of Portland and Mr Baldwin did he mention any other person - A Yes the groom of his bed-chamber he mentioned him a great many times I told him I had but three guineas by me then but the next day I would give him the remaining two the next day he came for the remaining two he had three on Sunday and two on Monday he said he did not doubt but he could do it and very soon and if his free pardon came down I must not be surprized I did not see him again for about a fortnight he said Sir Watkin Lewes was a very good friend of his as he served him in capacity of serjeant in the City militia he called after that and told me he wished me joy all was settled and shook hands with me Q Did any thing more material pass at that second meeting on the Monday - A In the course of a fortnight he wished me joy and told me all was finished he asked me if I would let him have a couple more guineas I told him it was not in my power I had not got them by me and he said would I meet him in Newgate on the Sunday and let him have one I did and one more he had of me I gave it him in the condemned room in Newgate a gentleman went with me to see my son he shook hands with him and wished him joy of his friend his pardon was coming down in the course of a week nothing more passed at that meeting I came away and left him in about a fortnight or three weeks he called upon me again he told me all was settled and asked me to let him have two more guineas I told him it was not in my power to let him have it I told him my agreement was five guineas and he had extorted another from me and I would give him no more he put himself in a very great passion and said d-n his blood if he would do any more for him and would stop what he had done for him he told me that he had saved his life I said no he had not for Sheriff Liptrap saved his life if his life was saved for he had presented a petition then he said it was the smugglers affair they had promised him thirty guineas and he had had but thirteen and he saw I meant to do the same he asked me what money I would give him of my own generosity if his pardon should come down I told him six guineas he had had and four more I would give him which would make ten guineas what is ten guineas he said a great deal says I for such a poor woman as I am and he asked me how he was to come at this money the remainder I told him I would give him a note of hand for he said that would not do says I if I sell mybed from under me when his pardon comes I will give you the remainder of the ten guineas he did not make a great deal of reply to that Q Did he accept it - A No he said that would not do it was not enough Q You were not in a condition to raise any more money - A No and I was sure then he was a defraud because he was so very fluent with the names of so many great people Q What use did he say he should make of that five guineas - A He said it went through so many different channels that he should not have a halfpenny left for himself Q And how was he to deal it out - A Through different channels Q It was not all to go in one channel then - A No in different channels Q Did he tell you how much was to go in one channel and how much in another - A No but that it was to go in different channels Q Then I take it for granted this broke off your treaty - A I did not see him any more for some time Q About how long might it be before you saw him again - A I cannot say how long a time it was but it was before the sentence passed for transportation I believe it to be about a week or ten days before he wrote to me after that Q Have you that letter - A I gave it to Mr Raven Q Did you see him after you had received that letter - A No not till I saw him at Bow-street Q How long was it from the first to the conclusion of the treaty - A It was when sentence was passed for transportation Cross-examined by Mr Knapp Q You stated just now that it was in consequence of a recommendation from Mrs Sells that the prisoner was first introduced to you - A Yes Q And he was first introduced to you in consequence of his having been the means of some smugglers having been liberated from Newgate upon a charge against government - A Yes that he could clear a criminal better than a smuggler SARAH HACKETT sworn - Examined by Mr Fielding Q You live in the same house with Mrs Keys - A I do Q Whereabouts is that - A No 6 Buckler s-alley Q Look at the prisoner at the bar - A That is the same person Q Do you remember his coming to the house of Mrs Keys on the 2d of July - A I cannot say but it was on a Saturday in the month of July Q About what hour of the day - A I cannot be positive it was in the afternoon Q What did he come there for - A He asked for Mrs Keys I told him she was not at home she was out at work and he asked me if Mrs Keys had not at that time a son in trouble and I informed him that she had he told me his wife - Q You mean the wife of Saunders - A Yes that Saunders s wife had made application to him for relief I told him she would be at home tomorrow he said it would be attended with a great deal of expence he seemed to be dubious that Mrs Keys being a poor woman she could not pay it as I had informed him she was out at work Q What more did he say then - A He told me he would call on the morrow and that was all that passed at that time Q When Mrs Keys came home you had a conversation with her - A Yes on the morrow he came and I was not there I saw him on the Monday there Mrs Keys called me down to see the money paid I saw two guineas paid I did not see the three guineas paid that was paid before when I was not there Mrs Keys said that made five guineas she had then paid him he gave her his hand and word that he would fulfil the promise he had made her she said get my son on board of a ship and he assured her it should be so he told her she must not be surprised if in a very short time she heard that he had a free pardon Q Did Mrs Keys mention her situation in life to him - A Not that I heard Q Did you ever see the prisoner after that time - A I have met him coming out at the door Q Mrs Stubbings was likewise there I believe - A Yes Mr Fielding We will save your Lordship the trouble of hearing her evidence it is only to confirm the other Cross-examined by Mr Knapp Q Mr Knowles said it was in consequence of Mrs Saunders desiring him to come to Mrs Keys that he had done so - A Yes His Grace the Duke of PORTLAND sworn - Examined by Mr Garrow Q I would just ask your Grace whether the prisoner had any influence with your Grace to procure pardons - A Certainly not Mr BALDWIN sworn - Examined by Mr Garrow Q Had the prisoner any such influence with you as the evidence has represented - A Certainly not Court Q What is the office which you hold in the Duke of Portland s office - A It is a confidential one matters that are referred to his Grace go through my hands with such observations as occur to me upon them Cross-examined by Mr Knapp Q In the course of your situation with his Grace which you have stated is a confidential one have you seen Knowleswith you at the office - A I have seen him before Q Was it upon the subject of obtaining pardons or soliciting for a pardon - A I don t know whether it was for the purpose of soliciting but I think he was the man that brought a petition to me for Gee and Richards and I think he said he brought it from Sir Watkin Lewes Q Gee and Richards I believe afterwards received his Majesty s mercy - A They were imorisened some time but being represented as good seamen they were sent to sea soon after this man I think brought another petition whether it was for Saunders or not I don t know but the moment he brought that second petition I asked him how he came to have any thing to do with such things I then began to suspect that he was improperly employed in that business and I then told him that any petition that he should bring after that would not be attended to because I had great reason to suppose that he was acting improperly I forbad him coming to the office upon any such business notwithstanding this I believe a day or two afterwards I met him coming from Burlington-house I then asked him how he could have the assurance to come upon any such business there after what had passed between him and me and I can venture to affirm that he never had any influence or chance of succeeding with me after that time Mr Garrow I will now ask you as we find from my learned friend s examination that this man had seen something of the way in which pardons are obtained could he state truly that in order to obtain a pardon money should go from one channel to another - A It is very fit the Court should know and it is very fit the public should know that there is not one farthing expence attending it and whenever a pardon is granted it is without one farthing expence Sir WATKIN LEWES Sworn - Examined by Mr Fielding Q Do you know the prisoner at the bar - A Yes Q Has he a post of any kind with you - A He was recommended to me as a serjeant in the London militia and I told him he appeared to be too old for that service but afterwards I mentioned that I would make him a temporary serjeant and that was the way in which I came to have a knowledge of him Q Had you any further knowledge of him or he of you than that - A None antecedent to that time subsequent to that time he was in the regimental employ Q Had he any influence with you so as to have carried any influence that you might have had in any other channel with respect to procuring a pardon - A Not the least on the contrary he desired me to give a letter to the Duke of Portland or Mr Baldwin and I positively refused I told him that I never did write to the Secretary of State for favour of any prisoner unless it was upon a petition signed by respectable people certifying as to the conduct of the man antecedent to the offence committed Mr Knapp May it please your Lordship Gentlemen of the Jury In the course of the little experience which I have had in this Court a case of more importance to the interests of the public and of much importance to the prisoner at the bar I have never yet had the honour of defending Unfortunately for the prisoner at the bar it has fell to my lot to defend him upon this occasion opposed to one at least or two of my learned friends who in this Court for many many years have practised with honour to themselves and advantage to the public men who have conducted prosecutions and conducted defences too with equal honour to themselves and to the public and have had more experience considerably than the person who now has the honour of addressing you but satisfied I am that not with standing I have powerful opponents not with standing my learned friend has been able to excite your attention and to raise your passions against the prisoner at the bar you will as honest citizens not give a verdict against the prisoner from any eloquence that may have belonged to my learned friend to state nor any observations he may have made unless they are warranted by the evidence which afterwards comes out Gentlemen after making an apology to you for the inexperience with which I am possessed in conducting defences of this fort I hope I shall not be considered as trespassing upon your time in making some observations and those observations at some length in favour of the prisoner at the bar Gentlemen first of all my learned friend has stated to you that this prosecution is of importance to the public certainly it is of importance to the public that the poor wretches in Newgate and who are soliciting pardon by any means should not have their money taken out of their pockets by fraud or any thing like what is charged in this indictment Gentlemen at the same time give me leave to make an observation upon the statement of my learned friend although it is of the importance which I have been just stating to you there is no labourer but what is worthy of his hire and if he is employed it follows as a necessary result of that employ that he should be paid for it My learned friend has stated this to you to be a most abominable plunder a most abominable plunder indeed it is it that plunder has been made by the defendant at the bar from persons in the situation of the prosecutrix without procurement or employment of theirs without any solicitation on their behalf to those persons who had the power to interfere with his Majesty as well as they could by representations to his Majesty to obtain mercy of the King certainly it follows that if he made that solicitation to those who were in the consisience of his Majesty then I say he would be entitled to something for the labour he had been at and then he would not be liable to the observations my learned friendhas made upon that part of the case My learned friend says what I was very much surprized to hear him state as prosecutor for the public that he should wish the penalty in this case to be other or higherthan it is why he should wish it to be other- Mr Garrow I mean to say I wish it was such a case that he could be hanged for it Mr Knapp Gentlemen I wish to impress that upon your minds my learned friend has now stated it broadly and for which I am obliged to him Gentlemen the question upon this record is first of all whether this person pretended that he had any influence with the three personages whom he represents to have had influence with Now unless the prosecutor is able to make that out I apprehend subject to the correction of his Lordship you will not be able to find a verdict of guilty against the prisoner for the indictment first of all states that he was acquainted with the Duke of Portland that he had influence with the Duke of Portland that he had influence with Mr Baldwin and I think that he had influence with Sir Watkin Lewes Now from their own state of the case how is that made out Is it not clear that he must have had some fort of connection sufficiently to use his endeavours to solicit that which was the object of the person who employed him The Duke of Portland nobody could doubt it if he had not been here I would have admitted it the Duke of Portland could not be supposed to hold any sort of conversation with a man of the description of the defendant But Gentlemen does it follow from thence that because the Duke of Portland himself has had no conversation with this man upon the subject of pardons does it follow from thence that the statement of the defendant at the bar that he had influence with the Duke of Portland was itself a false representation if the prisoner at the bar and I put it in this way had been at the Secretary of State s office for the purpose of soliciting pardons the Duke of Portland being Secretary of State for the Home Department and the business of pardons coming within his jurisdiction and subject to his controul in that officer then I fairly ask you this question whether it might not be perhaps wrong in terms to express it that he had influence with the Duke of Portland But I put it to you fairly whether a man having solicited pardons at that very office and succeeded might not have some reason to suppose that he had some sort of influence which he might exert for the purpose of obtaining that for which he was employed If that observation made as it is by me has the good fortune to be attended to by you look then at the next subject matter in the indictment and see whether it applies to a very honourable friend of mine who was at the bar but has lately seceded from it that gentleman has stated himself to be in a confidential situation in this office under the Duke of Portland Has the man stated that to be a falsity which is stated upon the record to be a falsity Had he no influence with Mr Baldwin Mr Baldwin says upon bath he had not but what one man may consider to be an influence having been successful in making the application and what another may suppose is a widely different thing Mr Baldwin is a person to whom applications of this sort are regularly made why then Mr Baldwin is applied to it is not a story made up by this man and no solicitation used upon the occasion but Mr Baldwin applied to by the prisoner at the bar for what He is applied to by the prisoner upon a petition presented at the instance of two persons who were in Newgate at that time charged with an offence against the revenue laws of the country and that petition was attended to at this presentment at his solicitation Why then Gentlemen really when once you have got so far as that is it not fair to make this observation that he had a reasonable ground to hope and expect that an application of a similar nature not exactly similar because one was a criminal offence and the other an offence against the smuggling laws had he not reasonable ground to expect a similar petition would be in a similar manner successful Then is not that a negative of the second statement upon the record or might not he reasonably suppose that an application of a similar nature would be attended with equal success whether he was right in that supposition or not is not the question but if he uses endeavours to do so I should argue and I hope you will be of the same opinion that he had ground to believe that he should succeed he makes application to Mr Baldwin who would represent it to the Duke of Portland why then we have got as far into the record as his Grace the Duke of Portland and with respect to Mr Baldwin Now it was asked by the learned gentleman who conducts this prosecution and was pressed upon Mr Baldwin in consequence of a question put by me my learned friend is counsel for the prosecutor and I am counsel for the defendant sorry I am that I put questions that the prosecutor takes advantage of but gentlemen that is an assertion that cannot be made against me in the present instance I asked Mr Baldwin that which it was my duty to ask him in order to know whether this man had made any other application than that that I have now stated to you the smuggling one Mr Baldwin states that he did make another application but in answer to my learned friend he says he forbad him to make any more and it is meant to be inferred that this man afterwards must know that any application of that sort must sail and that therefore he had taken the money knowing it must fail Now is that a fair argument to be used against a prisoner standing in the perilous situation in which he stands there was an application Mr Baldwin thinks in behalf of a man of the name of Hill certainly it was so and Mrs Hill has indicted the defendant for a similar offence and I suppose that will by and by come before you Well there Mr Baldwin said he forbad him to come any more but when Saunders was in Newgate does it follow that because he said he forbad him to come any more that through any other channel he might not succeed in getting himself introduced to persons in confidence with his Majesty who might with his ministers consider whether it was a fit case for mercy or not therefore I hope that last observation of my learned friend will not have the effect it is intended to have Now gentlemen it has been pressed upon you that this poor person in Newgate or at least the representative of the poor person in Newgate has been cheated and defrauded of money by the false representationsthat the defendant has made use of upon this occasion Gentlemen subject to the correction of the Court hereafter I will state to you as far as I have been able to collect from the Crown Lawyers upon the subject what I apprehend to be the offence that must be made out agreeable to the statement of the offence in this indictment I will state it from an extremely well-known case to all my learned friends the case of the King and Young in Mr Leech s cases 406 and also in the third Term Reports 98 I will cite it to you from Mr Leach s cases which I believe is a pretty faithful report of what is to be found in the Term Reports Gentlemen that was a case upon the very statute upon which this indictment is framed and there gentlemen it is stated that this statute had for its object to further the ends of justice by making that which was not the subject of a common law offence an offence within the meaning of the statute for previous to the passing of this statute it was not an offence at common law there was another statute indeed upon the same subject made by one of the Henty s against false tokens but as this was insufficient another statute passed upon the subject and Lord Kenyon I don t mean to say that that case was similar to the present upon the facts of the case but I cite it more to state to you what was the opinion of the Judges sitting upon cases of fraud Lord Kenyon says it seems difficult to draw the line and say to what particular cases this statute shall extend and therefore we must see whether each particular case as it arises comes within it therefore according to this learned Judge s authority it seems difficult to construe the meaning of this Act of Parliament as applied generally but you must apply it to each particular case as each particular case shall arise Mr Justice Buller in giving his judgment upon the same case says thus Barely asking another for a sum of money is not sufficient but some pretence must be used and that pretence must be false for the intent is necessary to constitute the crime Then Gentlemen you must find out as well as you can upon the statement of this case what was the intent of the party at the time he was so employed - You must find out likewise whether that intent was by false representation to get into his hands and possession by that false representation the money of the prosecutor it is essential that it must be false Is it false with respect to the observation I made before that he had influence some how or other with the Duke of Portland that he had influence with Mr Baldwin that he had influence with Sir Watkin Lewes all these things have been proved on the part of the prosecutor first that this is the office to which he was to apply secondly that Mr Baldwin is one of the channels to Whom he was to apply thirdly is it false with respect to Sir Watkin Lewes he tells you that he put him into the City of London Militia in the place of a serjeant and if he had not had a good opinion of such a man he would not have placed him in that situation he found that he was too old and therefore he put him merely as a temporary serjeant Then there is evidence before you that Sir Watkin Lewes had some good opinion of this man or he would not have put him in that situation but Sir Watkin Lewes it may be said has nothing to do with the government of the Country or granting of pardons I expected Sir Watkin Lewes when my learned friend put that question to him would answer it as he did that he has no power nor influence over the granting of pardons but does it follow that because Sir Watkin Lewes had no influence or authority that a man placed in a confidential situation with a person known and notorious for every thing that we must admire in Sir Watkin Lewes to the public might not by some application that he might make on the occasion might he not reasonably suppose that Sir Watkin Lewes would be induced to do that for him when he had been inclined to do so favourably for him in his regimental capacity then if I have made myself understood he cannot be said to have induced them to part with their money under a false pretence for if you find that he has made applications where pardons might come through different channels down to the delinquent if he has done that there is an end to the intention charged in this indictment then Gentlemen the case will rest upon the other circumstances which have been stated to you by my learned friend Gentlemen Does the defendant come voluntarily into this business Does he offer himself to the person he is said to have defrauded On the contrary you have it in evidence from two of the witnesses for the prosecution from the character the man had and from the influence he was supposed to have and which he indeed had for he succeeded in it in one instance - he was applied to because he had succeeded in it at the desire of the wife of Saunders Saunders sending to him and be going in consequence of that solicitation why then it is not like this case which I might put-if a man meaning to defraud another of his goods or money was to come to me and say he could get an official situation for me because he had an opportunity of getting it and that he knew he could get it and he offered to do it voluntarily and comes to me in the first instance when in fact he knew at the same time he could not get it But here Gentlemen I wish to impress it upon your minds it is by the desire of a third person by the solicitation of the persons themselves and when he comes to ask for a compensation they throw in his teeth that he has not succeeded and that perhaps is the gift of this business that when gentlemen high in office find that pardons may be had by the representations of any body for that man certainly has made such a representation as has been stated to Mr Baldwin that Mr Baldwin believed him because with respect to the smugglers it certainly did succeed Where then is the intent on the part of this man originally without solicitation to do the things alledged to him by this record it appears that he was employed by the persons who had a right to employ him and to conside in him because he had succeeded before Gentlemen what I have just been stating to you seemed to catch the ear and the attention of my learned friend who sits next me and if he supposes that for one moment I as an advocate for any defendant in any Court of Justice can mean by any argument or any observation I could state to a Jury to cast the least shade of any thing like reflexion upon the honourable Gentlemen that I have seen upon the bench to-day I hope they will give me credit for saying I mean nosuch thing but no pardon can be obtained but by petition therefore that they could have it no otherwise than by a petition which must be drawn by somebody and which was in this instance drawn by the gentleman at the bar Gentlemen it does seem as I stated in the outset that this is not only a case of very great importance to the public otherwise the great and distinguished characters whom we find in this Court now and the very eloquent and powerful opponent which I have upon the present occasion would not have been brought down here to address you upon the subject but it is also of the last importance to the defendant what verdict you shall hereafter give for by the statute upon which this indctment is framed you will learn that the prisoner at the bar is liable to be transported for the term of seven years Therefore gentlemen bearing that in your minds you will weigh these circumstances and weight them with great caution before you proceed to give that verdict which in the end if you believe the witnesses on the part of the prosecution and that the intent of the prisoner was to defraud will certainly be the occasion of his being banished from the friends that he has in this country and from society Gentlemen if I have the good fortune to make myself understood I think that the whole of the offence attributable to the prisoner stands upon these few observations and when I have made those few observations I shall leave him to that justice and also to that mercy that he will be entitled to at your hands Gentlemen I charge as I said just now no one person with any abuse of office but all offices from the highest to the lowest at all times have had abuses creep into them and perhaps the inferior avenues to that office may be open to the solicitations of persons in the situation of the prisoner Gentlemen the prisoner instructs me to say to you that in the Secretary of State s office there were persons in inferior situations very inferior indeed who might make false representations to the prisoner I think there was a person of the name of Noble who he is I know not I think I have read in the papers of a Mr Noble having been examined but I believe the situation of Noble was something like that of an inferior servant or groom in the Duke of Portland s family That person be he whom he might the prisoner was acquainted with and also another servant of the Duke of Portland s what influence they may have I certainly cannot state but it will be sufficient for me that the prisoner supposed that by the influence of the servants of a great man he would probably meet with success in the application which he fought for Now it seems from this statement to me that he made application to Noble what Noble did upon it I cannot state to you because he is not here to be examined but Noble certainly might have been found to be examined upon the subject and the other person also at the Duke of Portland s house to have stated what passed upon the subject but it is quite sufficient for me if he supposed from knowing the inferior parts of that great man s family that he could have such influence by such means if he did suppose that he could not have the criminality intended to be attached to him by this indictment Gentlemen if that observation makes any impression upon your mind it will be a strong thing in favour of the defendant because added to his application to those persons who were likely to be of use to him in his solicitation his statement of a knowledge of those persons of one of whom Mr Baldwin he certainly had a complete knowledge couple them together and then see if you can where is the criminal intent on the part of the defendant and you must be satisfied that that criminal intent is to be found first of all stated upon the record and afterwards proved as it is stated Gentlemen my learned Friend has stated to you that when he represented that he could get a pardon he must know he could not get it why we all know it if you or I were to apply at the Secretary of State s office neither of us could get the pardon but the question I put to you is this Could I by presenting a petition put it in a situation in which it might be presented to his Majesty - Has that been done - It was done in one case as was stated by Mr Baldwin Then was not that a reason why the defendant should hope it might be done in another - If it was then the man has used his endeavours to do that which he set out with and it is not because the pardon was not had that he is guilty of the offence it is quite sufficient for me that he has used his endeavours to solicit that pardon where it was to be had and the only way to do that was by applying to my friend Mr Baldwin and then by his representation to the Duke of Portland and then by his Grace the Duke of Portland to the fountain of mercy in this country Why then if that be so is it not a strong point in favour of the prisoner Is that any thing like a man coming with the prosessed design to cheat and defraud Or is it not at the solicitation of somebody else that somebody else connected with the dearest interests of the person he applies for and then couple it with the means he takes to obtain it and see where is the false representation stated in this record Gentlemen I shall concluded the observations I have been endeavouring to press upon you as well as I was able Feeble I am afraid my efforts have been but my wishes for my client have been strong I hope therefore you will not think it necessary for me to apologize for taking up such a portion of your valuable time when you consider the weakness of the advocate on the one side and the powerful eloquence of my opponent on the other with all the ability that the Crown could procure upon the occasion Gentlemen I have had disadvantages to struggle with upon this subject till this morning never did I see the indictment not that I wish to be understood by any means to cast a shadow of blame upon the prosecutors whose liberality has furnished me with a copy of it since I came into Court But my attention was directed to another indictment against the prisoner and upon which probably hereafter you will have to find your verdict one way or the other I was really induced to believe that indictment might have come on first however I have now seen the indictment that is before you I have made my observations as well as the time would permit me upon the record I have stated the law as laid down by the first Judges in this land I have stated the observations which I think are forcibly applied in behalf of my client and having done that I must submit with cheerfulness though with considerable confidence that your verdict will be such as not to intrench upon the valuable interests of the public but at the same time I hope that if you find it will not intrench upon the dear and valuable rights of the public it will be such a verdict as will give the defendant his liberty again and prevent his being banished this country for the term of seven years Gentlemen I shall sit down perfectly content with the observations I have made and perfectly satisfied with the wisdom and the justice of the Jury One of the Jury To Mr Baldwin Q Are applications of the kind that are said to be made when presented by individual persons in the family or office of the Duke of Portland likely to meet with success earlier or later than if they came from another quarter - A I never recollect one being presented by any body in the office Q Then persons in the family of his Grace have no reason to suppose that petitions coming through their hands will be attended to more speedily - A I rather think that petitions coming in that way would not meet with so good a reception as coming from any other person For the Prisoner HENRY O NEAL sworn - Examined by Mr Knapp I have known the prisoner 20 years I never heard any thing against his charactir but what was very honest NATHANIEL STREET sworn - Examined by Mr Knapp I am a painter in Giltspur-street I have known the prisoner twenty-four years I never heard any thing amiss of him before Prisoner My Lord and Gentlemen my counsel has said so very much in favour of me that I trust the clemency of the Court will hear me a few words After the smugglers had been enlarged and that I had the honour myself of accompanying Mr Kirby whose veracity this Court as well as the public in general can have no dispute or doubt of in a few days sometime after this my Lord and Gentlemen I was going up from Sir Watkin Lewes s being a very wet day with an umbrella in my hand I met Mr Baldwin near Cockspur-street I saluted him as I had a very just right at the same time Mr Baldwin was pleased to ask me what became of the smugglers I told him I believed they were on board a ship at the same time I had a petition for Sylvester Hill and for this John Saunders I mentioned that I had gone with Mr Kirby on board the Tender with the smugglers they had entered into a bond and Mr Baldwin took their recognizances as Mr Baldwin had expressed that some tricks sometimes are played by those people who have a pardon by getting themselves arrested and prevent their going on board of ship My Lord I have solicited for three different persons to go to sea his Majesty s service I had at heart when I was in my younger years and now I am in my older years Mr Kirby happened to be in view and I said to Mr Baldwin there is Mr Kirby himself when Mr Kirby came up I saluted him we walked on as far as Mr Drummond s banking house door it rained and I begged the honour to hold the umbrella over Mr Baldwin s head he said Knowles I wish you would step down to the Treasury-gate and desire my carriage to come up I went down to the Treasury-gate I saw no carriage I returned and met Mr Kirby with the umbrella when he told me Mr Baldwin had seen his carriage and desired him to meet me we walked to the Adelphi and I parted with Mr Kirby I shall only appeal whether this is true or not to the testimony of those worthy gentlemen Mr Kirby and Mr Baldwin JOHN KIRBY sworn - My Lord what he has said is a fact that Mr Baldwin and I met and he came up Mr Baldwin came up and asked me who he was and I told him that he had procured a pardon for the smugglers and who was to have some money from them and he reprobated his conduct Mr Baldwin I dare say it is exactly as Mr Kirby has stated and that brings to my recollection that that circumstance was the cause of my suspecting him Summing up Court Gentlemen of the Jury The prisoner at the bar stands indicted for a fraud and the indictment charges in the first place that a person of the name of John Saunders was a prisoner under judgment pronounced against him for a felony whereof before that time he had been convicted Next that the prisoner represented himself to Ann Keys to have great interest with certain persons namely the Duke of Portland Sir Watkin Lewes and Mr Baldwin and that he could and would procure his Majesty s most gracious pardon to be granted to John Saunders and that in order to procure that pardon he must have a certain sum of money entrusted to him to be paid away by him one guinea into one channel and another guinea into another channel and that no part of it was to go to himself that she gave to him three guineas at one time two at another and one at another Now Gentlemen the necessary ingredients to constitute a crime of this nature namely the obtaining of money under false pretences under the act of the 30th of his late Majesty are that the party shall represent himself in some situation that he is not or as it happens in most cases shall represent that something has happened which has not happened or is to happen which he has no reason to expect will happen The next ingredient is that he shall have money and the third is that it shall be with an intent to defraud Now I caution you in the outset in this stage of the business to refresh your minds keep them cool andkeep out of sight for the present the detestable nature of the offence if it should be committed for it is most undoubtedly of the utmost consequence that the avenues to the Royal mercy should be neither obstructed nor corrupted and by such means to torture the feelings of persons who suffer much by reason of their relations lives being in jeopardy and the most valuable and sacred thing of all is that the public opinion should be perfectly confirmed in the persuasion that the matter of showing Royal mercy is a matter that flows in an easy and in a pure channel because otherwise see what a situation we shall be in the price that we pay in this country for fixed rules of criminal law is this that cases must necessarily arise that one would wish did not fall within the exact and precise rule If therefore we are perpetually to go by an exact and precise rule many of those cases must be attended with circumstances that one s good sense must regret What is the remedy Place the avenues to mercy in such a channel that it becomes easy of access and the moment there is that easy access which I will describe to you then all is right we may afford to have a precise system of criminal law and yet that inconvenience will not happen which is the case with every steady and fixed rule unless there be an obvious and easy remedy What then is the case here You know that every subject has a right to petition it is not a matter of favour it a matter of right those petitions go into the office which is appointed for that purpose there they are fisted and a sort of primary judgment formed upon them to make the access more easy for the Secretary of State himself to represent it to his Majesty that is the regular the ordinary and the common course of the thing Now Gentlemen stripping your minds entirely at present of every other consideration except the great importance to the public on the one hand and on the other the great importance also that a man should not be improperly convicted you will attend to the evidence deliberately reviewing this evidence without any view to consequences ask yourselves the question whether these allegations in this indictment are or not proved entirely to your satisfaction Here the learned Judge summed up the evidence to the Jury Gentlemen it has been stated that this man having succeeded in the business of the smugglers might lead him to suppose that he had some influence You have heard from Mr Baldwin and Mr Kirby what passed and Mr Baldwin tells you that was the cause of his suspecting him The question therefore will be whether the sort of influence that he spoke of was that kind of influence which merely arises from having handed petitions to the office or being acquainted with some person who might be ministerial or whether he was to be the virtual party who was to carry forward the petition or stop it if he thought proper With respect to the defraud five guineas were first stated as the necessary expence three are received two more are given afterwards one more is extorted and after all there was to be something left to her own generosity which answers the observation that a servant is worthy of his hire for he represented that no part of it was to go into his own pocket and the rest was to be left to her generosity Now in answer to this charge you have two witnesses called to you who tell you they have known him one of them twenty years the other twenty-four and who give him a good character Gentlemen you will take the whole into your consideration and consider those three points that I stated in the outset whether he represented himself to be in a situation by which he had influence to carry forward a petition or to stop it at his pleasure Secondly whether the intent was that of defraud and Thirdly whether he did in fact receive the money he is so stated to have received You will likewise take into your consideration the inuendos in the indictment of the Duke of Portland there can be no doubt that he is the person intended of Mr Baldwin I think there can be but little doubt and of Sir Watkin Lewes there can be no doubt at all about his being the person intended If you are of opinion that all these points have been proved you will find the prisoner guilty if however for any reasons that occur to yourselves or any that I have stated you entertain any doubt upon those points it will be your duty to acquit him GUILTY Aged 65 Transported for seven years

they selected two after which Clark pulled out a quantity of papers and said they were coming into large property from the death of Mrs Catherine Prussia Farrington and asked if I had heard of her Q Who spoke - A Clark but he always said we He selected several papers among which was a copy of her will and pointed out a clause in the first part of it in which Rachael Trickey was left 100 l a year during her life He read it this is it - looking at it - he also pointed out the latter part of the will which is scored under with red ink and which declares Rachael Trickey to be her heir at law and next of kin which he said was false that she was not anything of kin and if she was the 100 l a year for her natural life was a bar to her inheriting He said We have found out the heir at law He produced another paper containing a list of funded property amounting to between 60 000 l and 70 000 l this is it - looking at it - it was a notice of a distringus being lodged on the property from the Exchequer I asked their address Clark gave me this address - Abraham Farrington Esq Greenfield-street East as the address of Dawson He read a paper to me as being a distringus and said they lived in the house of the deceased in Green-field-street East On the 20th or next day he gave me a paper containing a list of the legacies stating the dates of the will to be the 20th of May proved on the 26th and that the funeral was on the 29th The legacies amounted to 3 500 l He read an extract from a letter purporting to be from Messrs Blunt and Bowman that they were satisfied of Abraham Farrington being the rightful heir of Catherine Prussia Farrington and that they would be ready to transfer the property in a few days He said they were solicitors to her executors Clark said he wished me to be perfectly satisfied and referred me to Mr Robins who was the solicitor in their cause He produced several papers and referred to a letter written by Robins to Blunt and Co containing an account of the stock He gave me Robins s address No 36 Leicester-fields andasked me if I knew him I said No He said he was a respectable attorney a man of great business and that his country house was at Wandsworth I sent my man to Mr Robins and afterwards went myself - I saw Clark there sitting on a bench in the hall he said Robins was engaged After waiting about twenty minutes I was asked to walk into Mr Booth s office the managing clerk I told Booth I was come to enquire relative to Abraham Farrington being the heir at law He shewed me a copy of the will and said that the 100 l a year was an effectual bar to the claim of Mrs Trickey that they had discovered that she was not of kin and it was singular that if the executors had not been legatees they would have taken the property if an heir could not have been found I asked Booth if he had any doubt of Abraham Farrington being the right heir - he said none whatever remained in his mind - no doubt existed Q Did he state why no doubt remained - A He said from documents and affidavits in their possession and I think he said received that day He said he had been down in the country himself a week on their business and Mr Robins had expended a considerable sum of money on their cause already at this time Mr Robins came into the office and looked over some papers turned round and asked Booth if I had business with him He said He is waiting to see you I said I was referred to him by Mr Farrington relative to the cause I understood he had in hand for them He appeared very indignant at being referred to and said he allowed no person to refer to him - he would not permit even the Bank of England to refer to him he however said as far as human foresight could see the party Farrington were intitled to the property and any order for payment of goods they might give on him he would discharge on the property coming into his hands I returned home and in about half an hour the prisoners came in Clark said Mr Robins and I have been talking about your application and he recommends Mr Farrington to give an order on him for payment of what goods he might want and on the 21st he gave me this order - looking at it - it is signed Farrington Clark delivered it to me in the presence of Dawson - Read - To Mr L T Robins - Sir please to stop the amount of money for Mr Nock s bill for guns &c which I have had of him when the money comes into your hands from the will of Catherine Prussia Farrington which property is now in the Bank under distringus from the Court of Exchequer Q Did you give him credit entirely from what passed - A Certainly I delivered them on the 21st goods stated in the bill producing it the amount is 111 l 15 s 6 d On that day they said Mr Nock you will be paid a great deal sooner than we expected for the executors are much alarmed at our proceedings and wish to compromise Farrington then said to me I will not lose 1 d by them I advised him to close the business even if he lost 500 l it was better than litigation Clark joined in my advice and said it was better to settle it soon for the lawyer s bill would be 1 500 l They then referred to the hasty and indecent manner in which the will had been proved and gave me a list of the legacies Clark said there was a good deal of money in her hands at the time she died and at the time of her funeral there was not enough found to bury her They took the goods away themselves in a coach They called afterwards and dealt largely with me They said they bought the goods to go and have some shooting in the country somewhere in Suffolk They had borrowed two guns on the 19th till I could get two finished When they came on the 21st they said We have tried your two guns yesterday and the double one we have given to our keeper and said they were determined to have a week s shooting before they turned to any more business and at the end of the week I was to be paid I afterwards received orders from them by post and about the 2d of October I made further enquiry as they did not fulfill their engagements I went again to Robins and had still further assurances and sent my man to discover the executors * * The prisoner Clark put several questions to the witnesses but their answers were precisely to the same effect as on their examination in chief RICHARD COOK I am servant to Mr Nock On the 19th of September I saw the prisoners at the shop they looked out some guns and represented that they had considerable property left them by a person named Farrington they always said we Clark produced a paper from a number of others and said it was a copy of the will of Catherine Prussia Farrington and pointed out to Mr Nock a clause by which Mrs Trickey is named as her next of kin and heir at law and another clause which left her 100 l a year He said that being left her did away her title to the residue of the property He produced a list of the property in the funds and asked where Goslings and several bankers lived and said they were going to different bankers to enquire about the property in their hands Mr Nock asked for the address of some respectable person and Clark said that Mr Robins of 36 Lincoln s-Inn-Fields was their solicitor in this matter I went to Robins but did not see him I saw Booth his clerk I found the prisoners in the office with him Booth said Robins was not at home I informed him my business in their presence and said they had applied to Mr Nock to purchase guns and referred to him as their professional man Clark corroborated my statement by informing Booth that they had been to purchase guns Booth immediately turned to me and pointing to Dawson said That is Mr Farrington and Dawson said Yes - my name is Farrington Booth said Robins did not like to have his office made a place of reference but from the papers and documents in their possession he had no doubt that the property was coming to them I asked when Robins would be in the way he said in about three quarters of an hour and as I left the office Clark desired me to have every thing ready as he wished to leave town by the coach that evening and we need not be uneasy about the money for there was plenty I went home and told my master he went to Robins and about ten minutes after his return they both called Q Whether they had goods or not then I do not enquire but when did they call again - A On the 21st They talked about the property as before and bought goods to the amount of 111 l Mr Nock had lent them a double and a single-barrelled gun on the 19th till he could finish them two and on this day Clark said theyshould keep the double one for their game-keeper and return the single one On the 2d of October I went to Robins s again and made further enquiry about them I saw Booth he tried to satisfy me but did not They were at last apprehended CHARLES STUBBING I am clerk to Messrs Matthews pawnbrokers On the 21st of September Clark pawned a gun between four and eight o clock for 12 l in the name of Joseph Clark Haydon-square it has the name of Samuel Nock on it He said he gave 40 l or 45 l for it EDWARD HALE I am servant to Mr Barker a pawnbroker who lives in Aldgate On the 22d of September Clark pledged a gun with me for thirteen guineas in a case quite new he said he gave somewhere about 80 l for it but previous to that he had pawned another for 30 s and redeemed it when he pawned this it is a double barrelled one and has Mr Nock s name on it MR NOCK re-examined The guns are mine and those I sold them on the 21st Prisoner CLARK Q Have they ever been fired -

I had never seen him before He said he understood we were manufacturers of flannels blankets and woollen goods and if we could do those articles well for him he should become a very good customer he gave me his card and said he was Colonial purveyor - this card is like the one he gave reads J White Colonial purveyor 28 Bow-lane Cheapside He said he had obtained the appointment through the interest of the Duke of York the person who last held the appointment having died and saved something considerable - he then took from his pocket some papers among which was a printed letter folded up he opened it to show me the manner in which his orders came it was dated Chatham and signed Harris and addressed to J White it was similar to this looking at one This letter was here read and purported to be a circular dated from the King s yard Chatham and ordering a quantity of articles to be delivered at His Majestys Stores Chatham marked Colonial Service JOSHUA ALDRON This was filled up with the quantity of things wanted it appeared to be an authentic Government order I observed to him that goods for government orders were generally contracted for - he said this was quite a different thing altogether that these orders came from the Colonies to his Majesty s depot Chatham in too small quantities of each article to make it worth while for government to contract for them - that they were put together and sent up to London for him to furnish He then shewed me an invoice of linen goods bought of Townsend and Brown Cheapside I do not exactly recollect the amount he said if he bought any of our goods he should refer us to them He then said he had retired from business some years was unacquainted with woollen goods and would send a person to look at them that he had taken the warehouse in Bow-lane for the purpose of receiving and packing the goods for Chatham - he left and in a day or two a person called and looked at the goods on account of White - he did not select any but a written order came afterward signed John White in consequence of which I went to Messrs Townsend s and afterwards saw White I told him of the person who had called and that I had been to Townsend s and told them I was referred to them by White who had ordered goods to the amount of 150 l or 160 l and that Mr Brown said White had been introduced to them by a person who had before furnished them with a valuable customer who had told them of his appointment and they had sent him 300 l or 400 l worth of goods supposing all was right but that they knew nothing about his property but relied on the representation they had Q When you saw White what passed - A He came to see if I was satisfied with his reference I said I had been to Townsend s and told him what passed but that they could give me no information of his property he said As to property it is of no kind of consequence these goods are sent down to his Majesty s depot at Chatham I send my accounts down to Chatham every quarter they are there examined and passed in two or three days and then I receive a bill on Government which will enable me to pay you and all my engagements I considered this a very safe account - I sent him in goods to the amount of 151 l to Bow-lane entirely on the representation he made I sent twenty-two pieces of flannel eighty pair of blankets and eighty rugs they were all the property of Messrs Turners Cross-examined by MR BRODRICK Q Had you seen Birch who looked at the goods before you saw White - A No Townsend and Co are persons of great respectability their recommendation had weight certainly Q Did it not have such weight as to induce you to trust him - A That depends on circumstances I do not say it would as they stated he was not a man of property I should not think him worth credit unless he held the appointment under government I would not have let him have them unless I understood from him that he held the appointment - it might have influence added to his representation - his producing the circular had weight I recommended him to another house for hosiery goods MR ADOLPHUS Q Did you believe he held the appointment in consequence of what they said - A Of course I suppose they believed he held the appointment I would not have trusted him from what they said if it was not in consequence of his having the appointment Prisoner Q Did you not say it was a maxim with you to trust no person unless you know where they dealt - A I do not recollect - it might pass MR ALLEY Q After the prisoner had the goods did you see him - A Yes he acknowledged receiving them and said the inspectors had found fault with the blankets and he had been obliged to make some little allowance on them but in future it would not take place for he had been to Chatham and given them a dinner which cost him 10 l and they were good friends MR JAMES CHAPMAN I am chief clerk in the Colonial department secretary of state s office The prisoner had no appointment in the Colonial department If he had an appointment as Colonial-purveyor by the secretary of state I must have known it Goods sent to the Colonies are supplied by the Commissariat department Government appoint no Colonial purveyor Cross-examined Q Purveyor is merely a dealer -

I had frequent conversation with him on the subject He stated that he had an uncle Colonel Miller who resided at Bethnal-green but with whom he was then at variance - but it was his own fault for he would not stoop to ask his uncle s pardon or he would have forgiveness he represented that Colonel Miller had been a late Director and proprietor in the India House - and that he could make great interest to obtain a situation in that house and asked if I should object to one I said I should be very glad of one Soon after that one morning in May or the beginning of June I think he asked if I was particularly engaged that day and if I had any writing paper - and if I would put some in my pocket we could take a walk together in the afternoon I did so and we took a walk up Church-street towards Bethnal-green - went into a public-house which he said a friend of his kept We went into the parlour where we were alone he asked for my paper and wrote out four or five memorials before that he had said that he could get me a situation as messenger - and asked if I should object to wear livery I said not He then drew out some memorials and wished me to make a fair copy of them he had said as we walked along that he had had some conversation with his uncle who thought from my hand-writing and the situation I had held I had been in the Custom House that the place would be too low for me and he would use his influence to get me a situation as clerk He drafted out four memorials looking at them these are the drafts of them These memorials were here read they were addressed to four Directors soliciting their interest on behalf of the prosecutor Q Were these memorials copied -

he said a complimentary letter ought to be written to Mr Hudson the clerk at the India House he drafted one out I went up to a private room and copied it came down and shewed it him He said it would do very well I gave him the 5 l note to convince him it was one - he returned it me I folded it up in the letter in the presence of him and Holcroft sealed and directed it to H Hudson Esq East India House by his direction and he had told me to fold the note in it He said he did not wish to be seen further in it but as my friend Holcroft was with me he had better take the letter to the India House and that would be proof that it did go and he would go as far as the India House with him - they went out together for that purpose and returned in about ten minutes he said he was going to meet a party at his uncle s and left On the 4th of October when I got to my lodgings Mrs Dowling the landlady gave me this letter looking at it No 1 it is in a diguised hand but I believe it to be the prisoner s writing - I told him I had received it One evening Mrs Dowling gave me another letter this is it looking at it No 2 I believe it to be his writing but the hand is disguised In consequence of this letter I went into the country to see my friends but before I went he told me that on a clerk being appointed it was customary on the appointment being delivered to give a dinner to the other clerks - I said I had not the least objection to it if it was customary He mentioned the dinner once or twice I went to Lewes to see my friends and while there I received this letter - looking at it No 3 - it is his writing and a day or two afterward I received another No 4 in consequence of which I went to the Bank at Lewes paid in 14 l and got this bill - looking at it - which I inclosed in a letter to the prisoner the receipt at the back of it is in his handwriting After this he came into the country on a visit to my friends I saw him there frequently he said every thing was finally arranged and settled and that the dinner was at the Ship Tavern Leadenhall-street A cheque upon Sir John Esdaile and Co drawn by the Lewes Old Bank for 14 l the receipt signed by the prisoner was here read - While I was in the country I received another letter - it is in a disguised hand but is the prisoner s writing - looking at the letter No 6 - this is his writing I afterwards discovered that it was entirely false and that I had no appointment whatever Q How came you not to enquire at the India House sooner - A I trusted entirely to him and he always wanted me to avoid making enquiry he said every thing was perfectly right From the time he left Lewes till the 27th of September last I never saw him I took every pains to find him Cross-examined by MR ANDREWS Q What age are you - A Thirty-seven I have had a situation in the Customs nine years I did not get it by purchase I first became acquainted with him at Blewitt s-buildings our business was mostly conducted at public-houses I might not be quite sober sometimes when I was with him I have a perfect recollection of all our meetings Q As you have lost two sums of money be so good as to tell us what false pretence obtained the 5 l - A To pay fees for the situation he said he had obtained for me None of the letters came till after that I believed Mr Miller to be a Director and that he was a Colonel and expected it was by his interest only I was to obtain it Q When did he first tell you not to go to the India-House to make enquiries - A In June 1819 he told me so repeatedly it never occurred to me that the letters were fabricated but after the deception was discovered I compared one with the other and find they are his writing I took out a warrant to apprehend him on the 27th of September 1819 but could never find him The letter dated the 21st of August obtained the 14 l from me I found the prisoner in Robinhood-court Shoe-lane on the 20th of September 1822 I took an officer with me and he was apprehended I am not to pay the expense of the prosecution MR WALFORD Q You presented a memorial to the India Company and they took up the business - A Yes COURT Q Did he lodge in Blewitt s-buildings at the time he came to visit your friends in the country - A Yes I could not find him there after I discovered the deception The letters referred to in the evidence were as follows - No 1 signed H Hudson dated East-India-House 4th of August 1819 informing the prosecutor he was appointed an extra clerk the appointment to commence on the 25th of September and desiring him to appear before the Directors on the 22d to receive his instructions and till then his appearance would be dispensed with and desiring the payment of the fees of office No 2 dated the 11th August signed H Hudson informing the prosecutor that every thing was settled that he would be entitled to his seniority from this date and acknowledging the payment of fees No 3 dated the 18th of August from the prisoner to the prosecutor at Lewes stating that the dinner was to take place next day and desiring an answer by return of post saying in what manner the bill was to be discharged and proposing that a bill should be drawn for it No 4 dated the 20th of August from the prisoner to Curtis informing him that the dinner had taken place last night and out of sixteen invited thirteen sat down to dinner some of whom were the most respectable in the house That it was understood to be Colonel Miller s entertainment that the bill was 12 l 16 s 4 d and with 1 l to be given to the waiters made 13 l 16 s 4 d and desiring the prosecutor to go to the Bank pay 14 l in and forward an order for the cash No 5 addressed to prosecutor dated East-India-House 7th of September signed H Hudson informing him that as a special ballot was appointed for twenty-two the Court of Directors had postponed his attendance from the 22d to the 29th when he must not fail to attend No 6 dated Bethnal-green 14th August addressed to J D Stone Esq Comptroller of Customs signed Miller Douglas of Stone and Webberly-park congratulating him upon the appointment of the prosecutor JAMES HOLCROFT I live in Alfred-terrace Stepney I have known Mr Curtis since 1814 I and he met the prisoner at the Crown and Thistle public-house Billeter-lane several times and recollect meeting there when he asked the prisoner how his business went on at the India House I had met him before when the subject was respecting the appointment of a clerk s situation in the India House the prisoner said every thing was settled except the fees of office being paid Curtis asked him the amount of them he went out to ascertainand returned in fifteen or twenty minutes with a slip of paper with the fees on it amounting to nearly 5 l Curtis went home to fetch them Douglas wished him to bring one note instead of small ones Curtis fetched a five-pound note and asked how he was to convey it to Mr Hudson whose name had been mentioned before in the conversation the prisoner said You had better send Mr Hudson a complimentary note a form for which he drafted out Curtis retired and copied it enclosed the five-pound note and sealed the letter addressed it to H Hudson Esq East-India House The prisoner said I had better take it and he would walk with me which he did to the corner of Lime-street and as we went along I said I was a stranger in the India House and did not know where to deliver it he said I was to deliver it to the messenger in the lobby at the left hand entrance - which I did - and joined him at the corner of Lime-street We returned to Curtis and in about twenty minutes lie apologized for leaving us saying he was going to a party at his uncle s Colonel Miller s at Bethnal-green and left Curtis went into the country about the middle of August and while he was there I saw the prisoner at the Crown and Thistle public-house he said the gentleman at the India House had had the dinner the day before he had told me nothing about the dinner before he said they were the principal clerks in the house he said the dinner was at the Ship public-house in Leadenhall-street that the bill amounted to 14 l altogether and he was anxious that it should be paid I said I made no doubt if he wrote to Mr Curtis he would send the money by return of post He wrote in my presence and said he had left room for me to write what I chose I said I had nothing to say - but wrote this postscript looks at the letter Cross-examined Q Were you present when the prisoner told him not to go to the India House - A Yes several times I do not know what reason he assigned as I paid very little attention to him I have seen Curtis in liquor two or three times but not often He was not particularly addicted to liquor Q Did you hear Curtis swear at the Mansion House that he wrote the paper with the amount of fees - A I believe he did but he wrote it from a copy which Douglas shewed him It does not appear to me to be his writing The prisoner did not ask for the 5 l Curtis said it might as well be paid at once He was not drunk when this business was transacted HENRY DYMOND I am a messenger at the India House In the summer of 1819 the prisoner was a good deal about the India House he came frequently after one of the messengers -

I gave it to the landlady The prisoner had access to the passages and lobbies Letters brought for the clerks were left in the left hand lobby but since this matter has been discovered an alteration has been made I never saw the prisoner in that lobby -

he asked me to take a letter to Curtis his fellow lodger at Blewitt s-buildings to meet him in the City I gave it to Mrs Dowling looking at it this is it If a letter was brought for a clerk three years ago it would be received by a messenger and laid in the lobby window or put into an open box Anybody who knew the messengers or a stranger at the lobby might take them MARY DOWLING I keep the house in Blewitt s-buildings The prisoner and prosecutor lodged with me In September 1819 two East India Company s messengers brought two letters at different times which I delivered to Curtis The prisoner left my lodgings to go into the country -

t18300916-312  First London Jury before Mr Recorder 1795 GEORGE SMITH and JOHN LEWIS were indicted for a misdemeanor MR PHILLIPS conducted the prosecution BENJAMIN JONES I am a slopseller and live at No 10 Glasshouse-yard Minories I had known the prisoner Smith five or six days before this transaction I had advanced him money - I am in the habit of advancing seamen who come into port money or clothes before they receive their wages and selling my goods at a profit as others do - on the 19th of July the two prisoners came to my house I was not at home when they came but when I came in Smith said Jones I promised you if I should fall in with any of my shipmates I would bring them to you to let them have clothes till pay-day - he said Lewis was Thomas Morgan I am sure of that and sure that Lewis is the man - he introduced him as wanting clothing till pay-day which I gave him - I knew Smith belonged to the Lady Melville an East Indiaman according to his own account and I wrote to Mr King to know if any body named Thomas Morgan was a seaman on board that ship I was satisfied that there was - Lewis put his mark as Morgan to the order for clothes in the presence of Smith I have it here - in consequence of Smith s representation I believed Lewis to be morgan and furnished him with a jacket waistcoat and trousers two pairs of shoes a cotton shirt a black silk handkerchief a bat and a cotton handkerchief Smith said to Lewis Tom you owe me a pair of shoes on the voyage and while you are here you may as well let Jones give me a pair and put them down to you - I am sure he called him Tom he had them and I put them to Morgan s account - I had a few days before advanced Smith 30s which he repaid me afterwards at the India-house I have never been paid for these clothes Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q From your manner of detailing the transaction I take it for granted the prisoners were the only persons present A William Smith the poulterer of the same ship was present - the prisoner Smith introduced him also as a customer- Henry Solomons and John Emanuel were also in theroom transacting my business Smith paid me the 30s about the 22nd or 23rd I am not a crimp and do not know what is - I should like to have it explained I always understood it to be a recruiting serjeant for the army - a person who sends his servants on board ships to sell goods before the sailors have their wages is not a crimp - I know Daniel Price he was not present I swear - not in the apartment I was transacting business he was down below - he went before the Justice of his own voluntary - if it had not been for him I should not have known that Morgan was Lewis the Lord Mayor said there was no occasion to take his recognizance - he was examined and sworn I cannot say whether what he said was taken down Emanuel is a person who comes to transact business with me and he at times does business for me he at times brings a man to fit him out and he received a benefit from it - he is not in my employ he did not go on board the Melville on my account - I never sent him I know he was at Gravesend but to what ship he went I cannot say - he was not there on my business he did not advance money to the prisoner for me - he is not in partnership with me nor my agent Smith borrowed the 30s of me about the 10th or 12th of July but I have not my book and cannot tell the date - it is entered in my book it was paid three or four days after the 19th when the prisoners came I was out at Leaf Son and Cos Old Change purchasing goods Solomons and Hart keep my books William Smith had 1l in money and a suit of clothes on the 19th of July and paid on pay-day Q You was not at dinner when this happened A No a pot of porter was sent for while the order was made out for Morgan to send to King the agent of the Melville to ascertain if money was due to Morgan and on receiving the answer I gave him credit I have the note here - no more porter was drank to my knowledge I sent for no more I do not know Pesman and Quicksey- I have heard of them and went to school with them I know where one of them lives but was never at either of their houses William Smith s debt was between 5l and 6l - Lewis signed the order on the first floor in the room where he received the clothing it was in an open room not in a corner - Smith stood over him and saw him do it Solomons wrote the name of Morgan and Lewis put his mark to it William Smith and the prisoner Smith were both in the room during the transaction but whether William Smith went down afterwards I cannot say Q Do you remember William Smith calling to either of the defendants after going down A Not going down but in the room he told Lewis not to take any clothing as he did not want any - he did not call him by any name he did not call them when he was down stairs - he did not call out Smith are you coming to my recollection Q And was not the answer Yes directly I can get Lewis A Never the name Lewis was not mentioned or I should not have transacted the business nor did Smith afterwards say Lewis are you ready no such words passed - I have made loans to perhaps twenty or twenty-five of the Melville crew I cannot say exactly - I am sure there were not fifty I had no dinner that day - I never mind dinner if I can get money - they all three went up stairs together to be supplied with clothes Lewis was sober he put his clothing on when I gave it him - he had the same jacket shirt and trousers on when before the Lord Mayor MR PHILLIPS Q Lewis did not appear as he does now almost naked A He had a frock on Solomons saw him sign the paper as Morgan - the advances made to you came to 5l exactly Lewis Q Was I ever in your house before this occurrence A Not to my knowledge but I have so many seamen I never sent an agent on board the Melville who advanced you 10s I did not authorise King to advance 10s to him on my account HENRY SOLOMONS I was at Mr Jones when the prisoners were there I wrote the order and read it out to them - this is it looking at it - the name of Thomas Morgan was written first and Lewis then put his mark to it Jones appeared sober and so did both the priprisoners - the order was read out to Lewis I then asked him to put his name to it - he said he could not write but could make his mark I then asked his name - he said Thomas Morgan I accordingly wrote Thomas Morgan he then made his mark to it - I am certain he did that in Smith s presence Cross-examined Q Who was present A Mr Jones the two prisoners Emanuel myself and Smith the poulterer I am not acquainted with Emanuel s business - I believe he has business with master at times - I know nothing of his being master s agent for the Melville I saw him assisting in taking out the goods the men were to have - I cannot say whether he had any profit from them I never saw Lewis before the 19th - I never knew Emanuel advance money on master s account I never heard so - I saw Daniel Price there on the 19th before the prisoners were served with the clothes he was not in the room but down stairs - he was before the Lord Mayor I cannot say who took him there - he gave some evidence I do not know what crimp means - I understand it is a recruiting serjeant I do not under the term bumboating Lewis Q Previous to that day did you not accompany me from Jones to King s with a note to check 10s off my account which was paid me by Jones on board the Melville A No I never did I never saw any Thomas Morgan at Jones but yourself - Price was at the house on the 19th but I cannot say whether it was at the same time as you if any thing it was a few minutes before - I was there when you first came in I do not remember Jones being at dinner - I think he was at home when they first came but I cannot speak with certainly MR PHILLIPS Q In what part of the house were you when you were called down to the prisoners - were you in the same room with them when they came A Yes I do not recollect whether Jones was there I was not at all intoxicated CHARLES MORRIS KING I am agent for the Lady Melville I knew Thomas Morgan a seaman on board neither of the prisoners are that man both the prisoners performed a voyagein that ship and came to England - they knew Morgan he performed the voyage with them I never knew Lewis by the name of Morgan the ship arrived on the 10th of July and I paid Lewis that very day 16l 1s which were the wages due to him in full - an order was sent to me respecting the wages due to Thomas Morgan - there was above 5l due to him then he was a quarter-master - Lewis is a common seaman I know he can write for I produce a power of attorney which he signed in my presence - I am the subscribing witness to it he signed John Lewis this was on the 10th of July - there is no resemblance between Lewis and Morgan Morgan is an infirm old man Cross-examined Q How long have you known Smith A Six or seven years I know nothing against him I knew him in the Princess Charlotte and another vessel - I know Emanuel I cannot tell whether he was agent to Jones - neither he nor Jones received any part of Lewis wages Lewis Q Was not Emanuel on board the vessel before it came up to Gravesend with Jones direction on pieces of paper A Emanuel was sent on board the ship by me and advanced Lewis 10s to pay his expences ashore - he came to me subsequently and received the balance Jones had nothing to do with it - Emanuel was there as my servant Q Was I put to bed drunk in your house A No you were perfectly sober and the moment you had the money you left and said you were going to take the Bristol coach to go to Ireland - I met him a few days after he said he had lost his wages and I gave him half a crown Lewis I was put to bed drunk at his house and can prove it I was robbed of every farthing of my wages in the house - King and Jones are partners - Jones notes mention his name and address he said his practice was that part of what he advanced should be spent in his house Witness I keep a public-house at No 55 St Mary-axe he never complained of losing money there he left directly he was paid - when I met him afterwards he did not say he was robbed in my house JURY Q Which of Jones young men brought you the order to obtain the money belonging to Morgan A That I cannot tell this slip of paper was produced to me to ascertain what it was due to Morgan not for me to pay it I turned to the ledger and sent an account of the balance HENRY SOLOMONS I wrote this inquiry note about the wages - I did not take it to King read Sir - Please to deliver to bearer my note for balance of wages due to me for services on board the Honourable Company s ship Lady Melville T MORGAN X his mark MR KING Morgan can write - his receipt for wages is in Court he received his wages at the India-house on the 22nd - I was not aware till that time that he could write and it frequently happens that seamen are disposed to write and at other times to make a mark - I have no doubt Jones cards were on board the Melville I do not know whether Emanuel distributed them - there are cards of a great many slopsellers distributed as soon as a ship arrives RICHARD COOPER I am witnessing clerk in the pay-office at the East India-house on the 22nd of July 18l 9s was paid in my presence to Thomas Morgan of the Melville - he signed the receipt in my presence - he was quarter-master there was no other Thomas Morgan on board - Lewis is not that man Lewis Q Who received my wages A John Wright by power of attorney - Lewis had had them before MR PHILLIPS Q The company pay on a particular day A Yes the agents may advance it before MR KING I paid Lewis 16l 1s on the 10th of July by virtue of the power of attorney - the persons advancing it would receive it on the 22nd at the India-house MR CLARKSON addressed the Court and Jury on behalf of the prisoner Smith Lewis Defence Before I came ashore King and Jones agents were on board and each man thought proper to accept of 10s on condition that they were to leave their things in their custody till pay-day I was one of the unfortunate number - I gave my clothes hammock and bag to Jone s man and never saw a stitch of them again - I went up to Jones the very day I went about this and spoke about it - there were eight Jews in the house they knocked me down tore my things off and locked me in the room - I went out for an officer and then they ran out I spoke about my clothes and they gave me in charge when pay-day came I never received a farthing except 3l which I received from King - I got drunk in his house that morning and had but 5s I have not received a farthing more though I have been away nineteen months not even the clothes I brought ashore WILLIAM SMITH I was on board the Lady Melville the prisoners were in the same vessel - I did not see a man come on board at Gravesend I went on the 19th with the defendants to Jones Lewis was drunk - Jones was at home up in his room when we got there Smith told Jones he had brought him two men that wanted money and clothes - a crimp is a man who comes on board on purpose to take poor sailors in Jones said he was very much obliged to him - some porter was sent for it was about three pots - I am sure there was more than one we all partook of it Jones and all - Jones said he could not wait on us just then for he was going down to take his dinner he took us down with him into his room and then he sent for the porter - I did not see Emanuel there I saw Daniel Price and Solomons we were all in the room with Jones while he dined and then I and Jones went up we did not all go up together - I had a jacket trousers waistcoat hat and a sovereign which came to between 5l and 6l I paid him when my wages became due and as I came down stairs I met Smith Lewis and Price going up into the room I had left Jones and Solomons in the room - I went up in about half an hour and called out Jack Smith are you ready he told me he was coming as soon as Lewis was ready - that was loud enough for Jones and Solomons to hear I went down then went up again called Smith and he said he was coming as soon as Lewis was ready - it was loud enough for any body to hear I heard Lewis tell Smith he owed him a pair of shoes to take a pair and he would pay for them - I was on the top of the stairs Emanuel is now outside the Court- I did not see him in the house I went before the Magistrate one day - Price was there MR PHILLIPS Q You are Smith the poulterer A Yes - I know Thomas Morgan he was gunner s mate not quarter-master - he is an old man there was only one Thomas Morgan on board - Lewis was quite drunk whenhe went to Jones Jones told him several times to hold his tongue for he did not know what he was talking about Q Was he so drunk that an honest man would not like to make a bargain with him A No I should not - he staggered about the street when we first came out Jones investigated who I was before he gave me money - he did not inquire if any money was due to me Lewis recollected about owing Smith the shoes drunk as he was COURT Q Did you tell him he was too drunk to make a bargain A No nor did Smith say so - he was sober MR PHILLIPS Q Did you not on the pay-day at the India-house say to Jones I hope you don t think I had a hand in the business A I did not Jones said Smith I don t want you I think you are an honest man MR CLARKSON Q Did Smith in your hearing call Lewis Morgan A I did not hear him I was present when he introduced him - he did not use any name Lewis Q Did not both you and Smith call me by my own name while Jones was at dinner A Both of us did SMITH - GUILTY Aged 30 Confined Six Months LEWIS - GUILTY Aged 38 Transported for Seven Years

t18301028-16  Before Mr Justice Park 1856 RICHARD PHILLIPS was indicted for that he having in his custody and possession a certain receipt as follows Received 6s 6d S Stone did afterwards feloniously alter the same by inserting the figure 5 to denote pounds and adding the letters £ and s over the figures to denote pounds and shillings with intent to defraud William Houghton Flintan and Michael Joshua O Hea SECOND COUNT for uttering and publishing the said receipt as true SIX OTHER COUNTS varying the manner of stating the charge MR JONES conducted the prosecution WILLIAM HOUGHTON FLINTAN I live in Berwick-street Soho and am in partnership with Michael Joseph O Hea - we are provision-agents On Saturday the 25th of September I saw the prisoner at our shop I saw him at his own house on Monday the 27th and saw him the same day at our house - I then showed him three separate parcels of ham all of which he agreed to purchase - after we had weighed them I said Mr Phillips it is usual as you don t pay for them to leave a deposit he was a perfect stranger to me - he said it was not convenient to give me a deposit then but that before eleven o clock next day he would send 5l and then I agreed to send him the first draft which was thirty-four hams weighing 3 cwt 13lbs which came to 5l 6s 6d - he was to send the 5l first and pay the porter the 6s 6d I never received the 5l from him - I afterwards discovered that the hams were sent to him about eleven on Tuesday the day they were sent I met him in Lombard-street I said Mr Phillips have you sent the money for those hams he said I have not but I am now with a gentleman who is to let me have the money and I will send it on immediately I said You had better send the money for the whole as it will save us a journey we can send them all at once he said he would if he could get it in consequence of information I called at his shop that day and said Mr Phillips have you sent the money for those hams he said I have not but I have got the hams and paid your porter or man 6s 6d and I will send the 5l in less than half an hour I went to his house and saw him again next day about three o clock in the afternoon and asked for the 5l as he had not sent it he said You d-d rascal I paid you the 5l at the time I purchased the hams you d-d rascal I owe you nothing I then told him he was a swindler that he had not paid me and he shoved me out of the shop - I again repeated that he was a swindler that he had obtained goods fraudulently and then refused to pay for them he then struck me a blow over the month which induced me to apply at Bow-street for a warrant - he was brought there on a charge of assault and there produced the receipt in the altered state purporting to be for 5l 6s 6d I had received 6s 6d from my man but nothing from the prisoner whatever Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q Are you quite certain he never paid you the 5l A Certainly - I told my porter about nine o clock on Tuesday morning that Phillips was to send 5l and then he was to take the hams and receive 6s 6d he was not to take them till the 5l was sent - I went out for five or six hours my partner was in lreland at the time SAMUEL STONE I am in the prosecutors employ On the 25th of September I saw the prisoner at master s and on Tuesday Mr Flintan desired me to take thirty-four hams to the prisoner to receive 6s 6d as I understood him and that the 5l was to be sent to the shop afterwards- I took thirty-four hams to the prisoner s shop he came in just as I had delivered them and paid me 6s 6d but no more I wrote a receipt for the 6s 6d at the bottom of the bill - looking at it this is my signature at the bottom of the bill I wrote Received 6s 6d S Stone and that is all I wrote - I did not make the figure 5 or the £ over it the 6s 6d has been smeared over since I wrote it- when he paid me the 6s 6d he said he would send the 5l to my masters I never received 5l from him Cross-examined Q Am I to understand that you put the 6s 6d with s and d over it A I did not put the s - I might put the d the s there is not mine - the d is I understood master the 5l was to be sent after but it was a misunderstanding of mine - he did not say he had already received the 5l THOMAS FORD I am gaoler of Bow-street While the prisoner was at the bar there he produced this receipt- I received it from him and took it to the Magistrate he said Mr Flintan had done this merely because he should not come on him for giving this receipt on unstamped paper GEORGE WOOD I am a serjeant of the Police On Tuesday night the 28th of September about ten or eleven o clock I was going my rounds and on looking into Ship-yard Temple-bar I saw a number of people round the prisoner s door - I went up and there was a dispute in the shop between Flintan and Phillips lad seventeen hams were counted down by the door - the lad said Policeman do you allow master s shop to be stripped of these hams as my master is not present the shopman showed me a bill and it was signed for 6s 6d and no more - it was a similar bill to that produced but on the 30th the prisoner himself showed me this bill and said it was the bill which had been shown to me on the Tuesday night I am sure the one I saw on the Tuesday had only a receipt for 6s 6d on it Cross-examined Q When he showed it you on the 30th was it in the state it is now A Exactly he showed it me in his shop - it was Thursday the 30th the day he was brought to Bow-street for the assault COURT Q Were you at Bow-street A No I do know when he was there THOMAS FORD It was on Thursday the 30th that he came to Bow-street - the warrant was granted on the 29th ROBERT BOWDEN I live on Holborn-bridge and am in the employ of Mr Carr a grocer and oilman The prisoner showed me this receipt on the 29th of September looking at it at that time the 5 was apparently very recently written - the 6s 6d was blacker then and blacker than it is are now the 5 was then much paler than the 6s 6d by which I inferred it had been more recently written - I saw it between nine and ten o clock in the morning Cross-examined Q Did it appear to have been made three or four days before A No it appeared muchmore recently done - it might have been done the day before for what I know Prisoner s Defence written I am now a hundred and forty miles from my native place which prevents me producing that number of respectable persons I could have done had my trial taken place in Herefordshire but not withstanding the few I have to speak to character will I hope satisfy you that I am not that fraudulent person my prosecutor would make you behave I came to London only four months since with a capital of 300l with which I went into business in my present shop - my returns being from 30l to 40l per week therefore it is not probable that I could be guilty of so paltry a crime and yet serious charge had I been guilty of such offence should I have placed the document in the way of the man who has tried every thing in his power to blast my character and reputation - I have a wife and seven children I solemnly declare before my God and in your presence that I am innocent WILLIAM BALL I am the prisoner s servant I remember the carman bringing thirty-four hams and after delivering them he asked for the money - he said he wanted 6s 6d I said master had just gone out and I had not taken enough to pay him - he made a great noise and said he must take the hams back if he did not have the 6s 6d a man who I was serving with soap asked him to take some hams for him and when he returned Mr Phillips gave him 6s 6d - he wrote the receipt in my presence for 5l 6s 6d he did it in my presence MR PHILLIPS Q Did he say whether his master had received the 5l before he had come there A He said he had only just come out and did not know but he believed it was paid - looking at the receipt that is what he signed COURT Q Do you swear that the 5l is the handwriting of Stone A Yes MR PHILLIPS Q Can you give the Jury any reason why the 5l is in darker ink than the other A Yes we have an ink-stand with very bad ink and there was a leaden ink-stand - the leaden one writes very bad he said Your ink is very bad - I said Dip down there it is darker and he did so Charles Handley was there and saw him write - he was employed to clean down the house Cross-examined Q What are you now A Why I live with Mr Phillips wife in Ship-yard -

t18310630-291  Second London Jury before Mr Recorder 1479 WILLIAM HAYLEY was indicted for a fraud MESSRS ADOLPHUS and BODKIN conducted the prosecution JOHN CHANNON I was secretary to the Potosi La Paz and Peruvian Mining Association which was established in London I have not belonged to it this four years - the object of the Association was to work mines in Peru the capital was divided into shares which were bought and sold in the money-market - this paper looking at it is a genuine share there were printed receipts for the scrip but this is the instrument on which divedends would be payable Cross-examined by MR ALLEY Q You have neither Charter nor Act of Parliament to authorize your proceedings A No the Association may consist of one thousand persons or two thousand for what I know the office is in Great Winchester-street - the Association is governed by twelve directors self-elected and the money was paid to the bankers on account of the directors the amount collected was 60 000l as near as I can recollect - I do not think it was 100 000l I should say between 70 000l and 80 000l - the sums were subscribed in 1825 no dividend has been paid - there is no money remaining at the bankers that I am aware of there are deeds - I do not know where they are as I am not now connected with the Association I believe the shares are still circulating on the Stock Exchange - the mines are at Potosi I understand there was no deed of Association MR ADOLPHUS Q Was it ever given out that there was a Charter or Act of Parliament establishing the Company A Never great expence was incurred in sending out vessels - the money was entirely spent in the necessary expences of the Company share-holders would certainly not be benefitted by fictitious shares in the market SAMUEL HILL I am a member of the Stock Exchange- I believe the defendant is also a member I have known him transacting business there for five or six years - I knew him transact business in the shares of public companies I have bought and sold shares in the Potosi La Paz and Peruvian Mining Association - they were the subject of bargain and sale in the market in May last On the 7th of May I received from the defendant fourteen parchment instruments constituting fifty shares in that Association - four represented ten shares and ten one each I gave 10s per share for them and paid him a cheque drawn on Sir James Lubbock and Co by James Flynn for 1l 10s and four sovereigns and another cheque of Jones Loyd and Co my own bankers for 19l 10s here is is one of the parchment instruments I received - it is No 3126 here is a figure of 10 on it which I think is my own writing - it forms no part of the instrument I have also written on it Hayley for Costello Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q Are you the prosecutor of this indictment A It is not carried on at my expence - I do not know at whose expence it is done I have heard that it is at the expence of Mr Measam time bargains have been done with these shares but not on the Stock Exchange now - they were some time back that is buying and selling a given number of shares to be taken at a stipulated future day - I am not aware of more being agreed for than can be delivered because many bargains are almost immediately closed again and the differences are paid this may be called partly gambling Q On the day you agreed with Mr Hayley for these shares were you not obliged to wait some time till he could get them from other persons A I waited some time for him to produce them but not long enough to constitute a time bargain - I should think any thing beyond a day would be a time bargain but if they are delivered the day the bargain is made I think it is a ready money transaction - time bargains are sales made foran account day I agreed with a Mr Costello for the shares - he referred me to Hayley who was to produce a portion of them they were delivered about four o clock on the day I agreed for them - I swear that positively it was a regular money transaction I stated this at the Mansion-house - what I said was taken down my deposition was read over to me but all I said was not taken down MR ADOLPHUS Q Has Mr Measam any fabricated shares in his possession A I have not seen any - this transaction was not a time bargain the money was paid the same day when I received the shares I received them as bona fide shares - I produced the cheque on Messrs Jones and Loyd which I paid him MR EMANUEL LOUSADA I am a merchant and one of the directors of the Potosi La Paz and Peruvian Mining Association Looking at the document my name which is signed here is not my handwriting it has been put there without my knowledge or permission - the shares are signed by three directors and countersigned by the secretary no other can be genuine - J B Lousada is my first cousin and brother-in-law I know his hand-writing perfectly well - this is not his signature he was a director at the time JOHN CHANNON Mr C A Thesselton was a director - I know his hand-writing and do not believe this to be his signature the name John Channon is not my signature JOHN WEBSDALE PEEL I am a letter-press and copperplate printer and live in the New-cut Lambeth I have known the defendant about two years when I first knew him he gave the name of Smith In March last when I came home one day I found him at my house - my young man had taken an order from him and entered it in the name of Spicer and Co - the prisoner then ordered me to engrave a plate like a copy which he had got - looking at a share it was as near like this as the engraver could do it he said the former plate was lost that Mr Ellis the engraver had offended the gentlemen and there would be a great many other things to be done - I was to engrave this as quick as I could it had the name of Ellis as the engraver and was dated 1827 - I said it was copper-plate he said Yes but the plate was lost and I was to do another I got one engraved - a proof was thrown off which I showed to him on paper at my house he ordered one hundred to be engraved on parchment - I gave the plate the whole hundred engravings and the original they were copied from all over to the defendant - I was paid 7l for my trouble I gave a receipt for the money in the name of Spicer and Co and delivered it to the defendant as my young man entered the work to be done in that name - he made not the least objection to the receipt being in that name - looking at nineteen impressions I have no doubt these are all impressed from the same plate Cross-examined by MR ALLEY Q Have you been a speculator in these shares at all A No I never saw Mr Measam till about May nor did my wife to my knowledge - I was taken into custody about these plates it was then I saw Mr Measam - I was in custody four or five days till I could find the defendant I was not in prison but in a lock-up house at night and went out with the officer in the day-time to find him - I was never in prison in my life I was at the office about disposing of indecent prints and paid the 20l penalty for it - one of my apprentices was a witness against me I have not been in trouble about any thing else - I go to Ascot races you may have seen me there - I kept a une deux cinq table I never said Mr Measam employed me to engrave these shares -Barker who superintends my business when I am out was present when the defendant came I did not say at Unionhall that nobody was present - he had spoken to Barber but when I came in and took the business Barber left and was at a little distance in the office when I took the order Q In the same room No the office is divided - there are two rooms the press and composing-rooms he left me with Mr Hayley - he might have heard our conversation if he had paid attention to it I do not know whether he did he might have heard part of it - my wife was at home - she works in the business and saw the defendant I believe she was in the kitchen - she was about the premises I cannot say whether she was in the office or not but she saw him - she was backwards and forwards he was dressed in a very dark olive or black surtout coat and wore glasses - I do not know any thing about Mr Measam MR ADOLPHUS Q I think I prosecuted you about the papers A Yes I never saw Measam till he took me into custody in May I never did any work for him - all the while I was in custody I was about with the officer by direction of the Magistrate looking for the defendant and my wife went about at different periods the defendant pointed out Ellis name to me on the engraving JURY Q Are you certain the defendant is the man A Certainly - he did not tell me where he lived COURT Q When did you first know the defendant by the name of Hayley A The day he was taken he gave that name - Mr Measam called him Hayley when he took him I never knew him by that name before CHARLES FREDERICK BARBER I am journeyman to Mr Peel I first saw the defendant in March last - he came to the office to have a plate engraved for the Potosi Association Mr Peel was not at home when he came in- he showed me a copy on parchment similar to this looking at one I declined giving him an estimate of the price till Mr Peel came in as I did not know the price of engraving - I asked if he would leave his name he gave me Spicer and Co our office is in the back premises below and as I was shewing him up stairs I met master - the conversation between them was not exactly in my hearing for the office where we work has a deal of bustle in it I did not bear what passed - I saw him leave in about ten minutes as far as I can recollect he wore a frock coat and wore glasses - I saw him again four or five days after when he came to our house to see a proof of the plate I was not present when it was shown to him nor did he say any thing to me about it - I know the engraving had been done then I saw him again on the Saturday in the same week when he came to fetch them away - I think it was the same day as he saw the proof he took away the impressions which were on parchment the plate and the copy it was engraved from - I did not see him pay any thing and did not see him again till he was apprehended I am quite sure he is the person Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q Can you give us the day of the week that he first came A No - I know it was Saturday that he saw the proof as there was a chimney on fire opposite I cannot say which house - I have no other reason - it was about four or five o clock I have lived with Peel about nine months - I did not notice the colour of the defendant s glasses he had a dark coat inclining to brown - I know his features but did not examine him all over I cannot say what cravat he wore - there were two more men at work in the office about four yards from master but you cannot hear while the press is going what persons in the counting-house are talking of unless you chose to be inquisitive and listen I cannot say how long these men had been in master s employ nor recollect their names - they merely came to work a job off there is a small partition to the counting-house but still they might see the defendant - he did not pass them to go out I did not ask the defendant where he lived but it was asked because I was desired to put down Stangate - I have the book here I asked Mr Peel if he had left his address - he said Stangate master said he had told him where he lived - if he has said he did not ask him he must have said an untruth to me or to the gentleman who asked him if he did Mrs Peel was going backwards and forwards in the office - I cannot say how near she was to him she passed him I believe - as far as I can recollect this was in the morning it might be ten o clock or it might be three - the order was given and executed in March but I cannot tell the day of the month MR ADOLPHUS Q Were the two men in the office at press or composing A They were at press that day it makes a great noise and engages their attention - the counting-house is separated by a partition the men were not in our constant employ - I saw the defendant at Unionhall and had a doubt of him till I heard him speak on account of his not having spectacles but had not the least doubt then and have none now SOPHIA PEEL I am the wife of Mr Peel I saw the defendant at our house in March last several times in in that month and I had seen him about two years ago - he then left us the name of Smith we then lived further up in the same street - he came to have some printing done I did not see him again till last March and recognized him as the person I had seen - he came to know if my husband could engrave a plate for him and brought a proof with him Mr Peel not being at home he asked Barber if Mr Peel could engrave a plate like that copy he told him Yes - I saw the copy he produced it was like this and printed on parchment - Mr Peel met him as he was going out in the passage I afterwards saw him when he came to see a proof of the plate - I told him it was not ready then and he was to come on Saturday I know that he came on Saturday and waited a quarter of an hour till Mr Peel came in - I sent our lad for the proof I took the proof from the lad who brought it and Mr Peel came in - I gave it to him and he showed it to the defendant I saw him when he came the same night and took them away - I put them up in the kitchen and just as Mr Peel came to the door the defendant came in and had them my husband was taken to Union-hall on this charge and detained six days - while he was detained I went out by direction of the Magistrate with Pople the officer to find the defendant I went to the Change and several places - I at last stationed myself on Londonbridge and while there the defendant passed I pointed him out to Pople and said I was confident in my mind he was the man but I would not swear to him till I saw him full in the face - I went up and spoke to him directly he saw me he put his handkerchief up to his face - I asked if his name was Thompson or Thomas - I hardly know which I was in such a state of agitation it was the first name that came to my mind - he told me that was not his name I said my name was Peel and asked if he did not know me - he said No he did not he had no knowledge of me whatever I said I was confident he did know me for Mr Peel had done some work for him - he said No he did not know me but when he first saw me he thought me very much like a servant that lived with him I left him and went to speak to Pople - I told him I had not had a sufficient view of his countenance but we would watch him see where he went to and Mr Peel should come and see him we followed him up Gracechurch-street - he went up and down several courts and when he got to the corner of Bishopsgate-street he looked round to see if I was following him he had looked round several times before and not wishing him to see me I went into a shop when I came out both him and Pople were gone- I saw him before the Magistrate the same afternoon I am confident he is the person for I answered the door every time to him Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q You answered the door the first time and all A Yes - I think it was three times it was not to me he spoke about the engraving - he asked me if Mr Peel was at home I asked him down to Barber - I cannot tell the date on which he first came I rather think it was the beginning of March and I think between three and four o clock - we had dined Barber dines with us - I think we had dined but I do not recollect such a trifling circumstance as near as I can recollect we had dined - I am confident he did not come so early as one o clock the apprentice was in the office and so was I part of the time - I cannot say how long I staid there was nobody else in the lower office -Barber was at work I do not remember whether the presses were going - I paid no attention to the conversation between my husband and the defendant I was in the office in which the presses were - my husband and Hayley were in a small place a sort of counting-house it is not a regular counting-house but only some boards placed across - it is one room I do not think any body else was at work in the office Q How came you to call the defendant Thomas A I had asked the officer what I should do to see his face but he kept his handkerchief up over his nose and mouth all the time - I do not think any body was at work at the presses when he was there but I am in and out so many times I do not take notice sometimes we are busy and take extra men - my husband was once taken to Unionhall through a person informing against him his apprentice s indentures were cancelled - I was never taken up - yes I was at Union-hall MR BODKIN Q Do you mean that an officer took you into custody or were you desired by any writing to go to Union-hall A I never was taken up by an officerany where a man had come into the house after this trouble of Mr Peel s and insulted me - he struck me and I slapped his face because he used improper language to me that was the subject I went there about - I was never in custody one of our presses makes a great noise when it is at work COURT Q You speak of the office and counting-house - they are parted off by a board A Yes as high as my shoulder - a piece is cut out so that you can see who comes into the office the defendant and Peel were in the counting-house and I even with them but not in the counting-house - it is too small to hold three I cannot say whether Barber was in the counting-house any part of the time RICHARD POPLE I am an officer of Union-hall In May last Peel was in my custody with liberty to go out with me to look for a person supposed to have uttered a forged instrument - Mrs Peel also accompanied me at times Peel had described the person to me - I was on London-bridge with Mrs Peel when the defendant came in sight Mrs Peel was standing some distance from me she ran to me and said There I think is the man there he goes I accompanied her and followed him to about the centre of the bridge about a hundred yards and then she spoke to him - I did not hear what she said he had a handkerchief holding up to his mouth and when she spoke to him he kept it a little way off but still kept it before his face after she had done talking to him I followed him with her - she requested me not to lose sight of him he went up Fish-street-hill through White Hart-court and several other little courts in and out till he came to the Cross Keys coach-yard and into Gracechurch-street I had him in sight the whole time - he did not call at any place but kept looking back he went quite out of the way - it was a bye way to get round he looked back several times and I suspected he saw Mrs Peel - after he got across Cornhill into Bishopsgate-street he got a little way down then crossed over the way - Mrs Peel passed me and got into a gateway I saw the defendant go into a hosier s or draper s shop and come out again at the same door in an instant - I saw no more of Mrs Peel I followed the prisoner into the Stock Exchange - the turnings he took were quite out of his way having nobody to assist me I went for Peel brought him over with me went into a court at the back of the Stock Exchange and there Peel identified the defendant as the man - he was in the court among other persons not alone he said he was the man the moment that he saw him without any doubt whatever- I took him into custody and told him I wanted him for forgery - he said he did not understand or know any thing about it I got into a coach with Peel him and two gentlemen Cross-examined Q How long had Peel been in your custody A Four or five days MR ADOLPHUS Q Had he been employed in that time looking for the defendant A Day and night THOMAS CHARLES MEESAM I am an agent and deal occasionally in Mine shares I have done a great deal in the Potosi shares I know the defendant he has dealt very extensively in such shares - I have got into my possession seventeen forged shares which are here and more than that friends whom I have bought for have a great many more - I never saw Peel till he was in Pople s custody I never ordered him to engrave a plate for me Cross-examined by MR ALLEY Q You are the prosecutor of this indictment A Certainly I have never been a member of the Stock Exchange but have a clerkship in the house and am privileged to be a member if I like nothing has been produced from the mines - the money received by the directors has not been accounted for I consider the shares worth something till that is done- I am not a proprietor I am not connected with the Puno Mining Association Q Is not your name on this handing him a paper A Yes I can account for that Puno is in South America- my name is put here by desire of the jobbers the dealers wished me to sign them that they might know a good from a bad one MR ALLET addressed the Court on behalf of the defendant and called JOHN BERNARD JACOBS I am a jobber and dealer in foreign shares I live in Bevis-marks I have known the defendant two or three years - he sold me forty Potosi shares shortly before the 7th of May they were to be delivered to me on the 7th of May and on the 7th of May he bought seventy of me I have the memorandum which I took out of the jobbing book I had to deliver him thirty to balance - I did not deliver them but told him to take twenty of Mr Knight and ten of Mr Old he paid Mr Old for them I believe and I had to pay the difference which was very considerable MR ADOLPHUS Q Has the prisoner always been a dealer in mining and speculating shares A Yes very largely - I dare say he has dealt to the amount of thousands of pounds I have dealt with him for some hundreds - mine was a time bargain I did not deliver shares to him but referred him to gentlemen in the market - I believe he had them I paid him the difference in money - I do not consider it gambling COURT Q Can you tell the number of any one share that passed from you to Hayley A No many hundred shares pass through our hands in a day - I cannot take the numbers GEORGE KNIGHT I am a watch-maker and live at No 64 Goswell-street On the 7th of May by direction of Jacobs I delivered to the defendant two Potosi shares each being for ten shares I cannot say in what year they were dated Q Look at this share A We never endorse them - my name is on this it is not my writing - persons sometimes write on the back the name of the person they buy of I cannot say whether I sold him this share - I sold him several tens on the 7th of May some notice was taken about some shares being understood to be had and I think Hayley applied to me about it but I know nothing of any bad shares - I gave them as I took them I said I passed them on in the way I took them and would not take any back - I never suspected him MR ADOLPHUS Q Is Knight for Jacobs on this his hand-writing A I do not know his writing - we keep books but never let each other see them WILLIAM OLD I am a stock-jobber and live in New North-road I have known Hayley about three years- referring to a book on the 7th of May I believe I delivered him ten Potosi shares for a person named Jacobs I cannot say how many tickets they were in MR BODKIN Q Will you show me the entry A You must look at Friday the 29th of April - the entry is D P Jacobs 10-15 for next week which was the 7th of May they were sold for the following Saturday - D P means double Potosi - 10-15s ten shares at 15s there is no other entry to show it was for the 7th of May- next week means the last day of the next week COURT Q Can you tell us the number of any shares sold to Jacobs A No sometimes ten or fifteen hundred pass through our hands in a week RICHARD GRAYDEN I am a brick-maker and live at Lambeth The witness Peel is my brother-in-law I would not believe him on his oath MR ADOLPHUS Q Did he marry your sister or you his A I married his - I do not live with her I allow her a maintenance I married her in 1818 - I live with no woman now a woman lives with me COURT Q How long have you been on bad terms A I have not spoken to him for nearly two years I do not know where my wife lives - I pay the parish 3s 6d a week for her and I have my six children at home to maintain I think I heard Peel examined in a Court of Justice on the 30th of June 1830 - I did not contradict what he swore ISAAC LATIMER I was apprenticed to Peel - I would not believe him on his oath MR ADOLPHUS Q Have you heard him examined in Courts of Justice A I have once at Union-ball about obscene prints and once at the Court of Requests where he recovered a debt HENRY SEWELL I was apprenticed to Peel - I would not believe him on his oath MR ADOLPHUS Q Did you serve out your time with him A I left him by the Magistrate s order my indentures were not cancelled - I heard him examined on his oath about an assault which he charged me with committing on his wife I was fined 10s JURY to J W PEEL Q Did you engrave the plate A No Mr Club the name of Ellis was put on it according to the copy I took the order and gave it to Club to engrave GUILTY - Transported for Seven Years 
t18320105-169  462 HENRY CLEASBY was indicted for a misdemeanor MR PHILLIPS conducted the prosecution SAMUEL JOHNSTON My place of business is in Addle-street I am a woollen-factor On the 8th of June the prisoner called and told me that old Mr Kohlbeck the tailor of Castle-street Leicester-square was in want of a cloth and kerseymere and upon that representation I gave the prisoner a cloth and kerseymere to take there -I did not know Mr Kohlbeck s person but knew him to he a tailor and a highly respectable tradesman I saw the prisoner a few days afterwards and spoke to him about the goods - he said they were gone to the clothworkers and the lengths were not settled I saw him frequently and at last pressed him to bring me the particulars of the measure of the cloth - he brought them making a deduction for short measure and damages which he said the cloth-worker had deducted and I gave him a settled invoice amounting to 24l 17s 6d and a bill for Mr Kohlbeck to accept for that amount he returned me the bill and said old Mr Kohlbeck had accepted it - I am certain he said that I believe he never named him without calling him Old Mr Kohlbeck I paid it away - it has never been paid - this is the bill which I drew and which he brought me back accepted looking at it Cross-examined by Mr STURGEON Q You have been here before on this case A No - I prosecuted one Sykes last Session for talking out my goods and unlawfully pawning them he was not convicted - I did not ask for my expences I took the prisoner to Worship-street and he was dismissed - I never trusted him with goods after that I lent him 2s at Worship-street on the 5th of November out of humanity - I have no recollection of being in the same public-house with him he did not drink with me - I know Pope a tailor I did not go to Pope with him since this - I sent a cloth there by a porter I believe I have never been in his company since - he appointed to meet a person at the Woolpack in Hart-street and I took him there I cannot say whether I drank out of the same pot as him there but should think not as I gave him in charge - I told the Magistrate at Worship-street that I occasionally employed him on jobs as a porter looking at some letters these are my hand-writing I never pawned any goods in the prisoner s company nor has he pawned any by my direction - I have goods in pawn which were pawned by him without my consent Q Was not this an accommodation bill A No I gave value for it - I got the acceptance probably five or six weeks after parting with the goods I was promised a bill for them - I visited the prisoner in the Compter as Iwas repeatedly sent for and it was called an act of crnelty that I did not go he said It is no use keeping me here you will get nothing out of me I did not ask him for money COURT Q Was the bill drawn for the amount of the goods and no more A Exactly - I drew it on Mr Kohlbeck I only knew the prisoner as a porter and would not have trusted him - I never divided profits with him GEORGE KOHLBECK I am a tailor and live in Castle-street Leicester-square - I have lived there ever since 1772 with a innster and since 1792 on my own account I am eighty years old I never sent the prisoner to Johnston for any goods and never accepted a bill drawn by Johnston for cloth - I did not know Johnston till this trancaction the acceptance to this bill is not my writing - it was presented for payment I did not pay it - I did not know Cleasby Cross-examined Q I believe your son robbes with you A He has resided with me but he is not always there his Christian name is Charles Henry - I do not think the signature to the bill is like the hand he commonly writes I do not think he honours a bill if he gives one - he is about thirty years old I never paid a bill accepted by him to my knowledge JOHN WILKINSON I produce the bill it was paid to me by Johnston the drawer The bill being read was dated the 6th of August at three months after date on Mr E Kohlbeck Castle-street Leicester-square but the acceptance was G Kohlbeck JOSEPH HORTON I am an officer I apprehended the prisoner at the Woolpack charged with forging this bill he seemed very much affected and said he had been made a dupe of by a man named Sykes - he has been in custody ever since he traversed this indictment last Session MR STURGEON addressed the Court on the behalf of the defendant and called WILLIAM SCHOFIELD SYKES I was tried here last Session for stealing two pieces of cloth from Mr Johnson - his Lordship stopped the case and Mr Phillips I believe threw up his brief I have instructed my attorney to bring an action against Johnston respecting that indictment but he advised me to stop till this prosecution was over - that was three weeks ago no writ has been taken out as I had not got the money Johnston stated to me that he had received a bill from Cleasby drawn on Koblbeck and it was not paid - this was at the corner of Bunhill-row Q At any other time did you hear any thing A I saw the prisoner and Johnston at the Bird Cage where the bill was drawn I was reading the paper at the time and heard them talking about a bill on Mr Kohlbeck - it was not mentioned whether it was young or old Kohlbeck I did not hear it COURT Q Then you do not know whether he described it as drawn by old or young Mr Kohlbeck A No I do not MR STURGEON Q Did Johnston use any expression about the bill A So many expressions have taken place between Johnston me and Cleasby that I really cannot recollect our business was altogether - Johnston has said I don t want this person to know this - and the other to know that he employed me and Cleasby to sell his goods in different parts of the town for cash as there were so many bills coming due and he took care never to have any body present but us COURT Q Did you ever know him deliver goods to Cleasby to bring him the money for them A I have known him deliver him goods to sell where he could for cash or bills he has sold to different people at Shadwell and I have seen them divide the profits - I know the goods in question were at Read s the cloth-worker in Dudley-court Silver-street Cleasby told me they were pawned there - I never knew him employed as a porter if he was going to the west-end of the town he has brought a cloth for Johnston and I have done so for him these letters are addressed to me - Cleasby got orders for goods and sometimes Johnston let him have them on sale or return - he used to deal with me in the same way I have seen them divide the profits MR PHILLIPS Q Where did they divide the profits A At the Bird Cage Wood-street I had a good opinion of Cleasby Q If he has said you made a dupe of him should he be believed A Certainly not if he said so it is a deliberate falsehood - I always acted honestly to him and the prosecutor I know Johnston so well he is capable of any thing MR WILKINSON Johnston has not paid me the bill but he has given me security for it The following are the letters which were read September 18 1831 MR SYKES - Now pray do your best to-morrow I am sure you would if you knew how much depends on it - if we can but retrieve the mischief Cleasby has done this time another chance of living will be left - return as soon as you can for I am all anxiety see that Cleasby is provided with the amount of the cut he bought yesterday as also the black so long standing you know it is not only the Basinghall-street concern but another bill will return to Leeds on Tuesday unless you provide part of the money -

Church-street Bethnal-green At the latter end of February Thomas Fitzgerald came to my warehouse and produced a letter purporting to be from Mr Parton of Chatham—I read it and returned it to him—it stated that he was a buyer of soap—I inquired of him as to Mr Parton—he stated that he was a most respectable man and he had done a great deal of business for him he wished to recommend him to us—he advised me to send him some samples and prices—I furnished him with four samples—he called again in three or four days afterwards—he produced a little memorandum-book from which he read an order which he said he had received from Mr Parton which he said was to be sent in the course of the week to Cole s Upper Wharf to be sent to Chatham—I directed sixteen hundredweight of soap to be packed up to his order which came to upwards of 30l —he returned again on the following Wednesday afternoon—he was in a hurry to have the soap sent off as he said the barge would be going—the soap was then packed and sent—while it was being packed he came to me and said he wished me to send it in his own name as he had other goods which were going at the same time and he wished them to be sent in one invoice—he produced a bill of exchange drawn by a Mr Ormsby—I did not accept or consent to accept that bill for the payment of the goods—I expressly refused it—I then went to the warehouse and met Merrell at the door—I told him I had agreed that the soap should go in Mr Parton s name alone and he was to make the bill in that name the prisoner then said it was the last time he would take any orders for soap—I told him he should have the usual commission which is one shilling per hundredweight—the soap was then sent off in the cart and Thomas Fitzgerald left about the same time—he left the bill of exchange on the desk—I did not see my clerk make the invoice but I saw the bill of parcels which our clerk sent it was in the name of Parton—our clerk afterwards addressed a letter to Mr Parton—here is the letter and invoice which were sent—on the 7th of March James Fitzgerald came to the counting-house we had in the mean time received a letter from Mr Parton—I asked him how it was that Mr Parton had not ordered the soap which we had sent down—he stated that they found upon going down that Mr Parton was in bad circumstances he had called his creditors together and he did not think proper to deliver it—I sent Merrell to Chatham and in consequence of what I heard I took James Fitzgerald into custody Thomas Fitzgerald Had I not had several transactions with you previous to this Witness You had bought several parcels of butter and grease—I did not tell you to look out for certain lots and buy them and what I could not use you might sell in the trade—you said there was a quantity of butter at the water-side which you could purchase advantageously if I could advance the money—you did buy some butters and sell them again COURT Q Had you any profits in your hand that were his A I hold in my hand a copy of the transaction by which I am minus 3l 13s 7d —I owe him nothing on account of the butter Thomas Fitzgerald Q Did I not bring you an account of five lots more which were to come to 60l Q You spoke of such a transaction but I saw nothing of it—I might say that I would take 2s a ton less for the soap—I never heard of Parton till you mentioned him—I put the bill into my safe after you were gone—I do not recollect when the bill is due—I do not recollect whether you presented me the bill before the soap was sent—I said I would not take the bill Q Did not the Magistrate desire you to hand me over some money and you gave me 2l and said you had no more about you A I gave him 1l 15s at the Magistrate s suggestion as it appeared there was something coming to him—I never sent to inquire whether the bill would be paid—I sent while the soap was being packed to a neighbour in Shoreditch to inquire as to the respectability of Mr Ormsby and they did not know any such person—I did not take the bill for the soap—we did not make the invoice in the prisoner s name—the transactions I had with him previously were all correct MR CLARKSON Q Up to the time he showed you the letter did you know there was such a person as Parton A No James Fitzgerald My brother told me this at Chatham—I came up and went to Mr Sturtevant—he said he had heard that Parton did not order the soap at all—I asked him to send to my brother and he said he had a Bill of Exchange for it but he did not know whether it would be paid or not Witness I do not remember it—I have no recollection of telling you to come at three o clock and I would tell you whether I would send the order or not—you appointed to come at three o clock and I expected our clerk back from Chatham by

Sturtevant told me he had taken a bill he wanted me to see what it was and I took it down to Shoreditch—I came back and told him not to take it—I heard Mr Sturtevant then say to Thomas Fitzgerald that he would not take it—Fitzgerald told me to make out the certificate in his name and I refused to do so—I directed the carman to put Parton Chatham in full on it and the prisoner said P Chatham was quite sufficient—I wrote a wharf-note with P Chatham on it and gave it the carman—on the 7th of March I saw James Fizgerald at my master s—he was given in charge when he came a second time—I had been to Chatham the day before—I had made inquiries and received information—I told my master on the Saturday before James Fitzgerald came the second time—this is the order and here is the entry in the

loaded I asked him if he had got the receipt and he said All right —he did not accompany me all the way from to factory—he went as far as the corner of Leadenhall-street—we there met James Fitzgerald—they then went on together and when I got to the wharf I found them there James Fitzgerald Q Did I speak to you about any soap A No HENRY PARTON I live in High-street Chatham and am a

Godfrey —in consequence of this letter I went to Thomas s wharf the day following which was the 6th of March and made inquiry—I saw the two prisoners there—Thomas Fitzgerald was looking into the barge and I heard Mr Thomas the proprietor of the wharf say to him Do you own this soap —Thomas Fitzgerald said Yes I am waiting to pay the freightage —I said How came you to order this soap I never gave you any orders to that effect —he said I know that I was going to take it down to your house —I think James Fitzgerald could hear that—I said I had a letter from Mr Sturtevant making a demand on me for the amount and that a person would call upon me for it—he seemed rather to doubt it but said Well I can get rid of it in the towns I can dispose of it —alluding to the three towns Chatham Stroud and Rochester—I was close to the barge and I saw the ends of two of the chests of soap—I saw this paper which I took off and read—it contains the weight of the soap and has my name upon it—I had not compounded with my creditors nor called them together—I have been in business fourteen years and am in good circumstances JURY Q Had you had dealings with Thomas Fitzgerald before A Yes twice—I had

for five chests to be delivered to his order—he came afterwards and withdrew that note saying there were only three chests and he substituted another note for the three—he then went down on the wharf and in a few minutes he came back into the counting-house and said The goods are now come Thomas Fitzgerald Q Was I not in the habit of shipping small packages of goods there A Yes HENRY HAWLEY I am a carman and live at Stroud On Friday the 6th of March at ten o clock in the morning I was on the wharf at Rochester-bridge and was called by Thomas Fitzgerald and his son—he wanted to know if I had a horse and cart—I said Yes —he said he wanted one to take three chests of soap weighing about three hundred-weight to Gravesend—I got my horse and a four-wheeled truck and went to the wharf—I saw the

Mendicity Society and visit persons who apply for charity In September last I viisted the prisoner at No 10 Portland-street Soho in consequence of an application by him to the Bishop of Landaff—the letter sent to the Bishop was signed Henry Steele—I showed the prisoner that letter and asked if it was his writing—he said it was—I asked him his name—he said Steele and if his lordship had read the letter he would have referred to the War Office and be would take a pistol and blow his brains out sooner than be exposed—the letter had the seal on it which it has now—I have had one other letter from him since the Bishop of Landaff s Cross-examined Q What was the number he gave you A No 10 Portland-street Soho—he did not give me that as his address—he never verbally told me where he lived—I have been above five years in the Mendicity Society s employ—I am not in the habit of giving informations—I was not one of the persons employed in taking up the gleesingers the other day—I saw this man a few days after—I never met him or addressed him by the name of Steele—he never told me his name was not Steele—I swear that most positively—I now recollect certainly being sent to the New Prison by Sir Frederick roe to see if I knew him—I then accosted him by the name of Steele and he said his name was not Steele—I thought you meant in the street—I did not recollect it for the moment—I only addressed him once after by the name of Steele I forget that MR BODKIN Q In the prisoner he said his name was not Steele A Yes I am quite sure that on a former occasion he told me his name was Steele—when I went with this letter I found him living at the house—I went to Portland-street—I cannot swear it was No 10 it was a house in Portland-street on the first-floor MARTHA SAIPY I live at No 438 Oxford-street it is a receiving-house for general post letters I have seen the prisoner there about half a dozen times at the latter part of the summer—he asked if there were any letters directed to Captain Steele—there were no such letters at that time—I gave him letters afterwards when he came to ask if there were any letters for captain Steele in consequence of his saying that I gave Cross-examined Q How long have you been in this office A About two years and a half—it is not uncommon for one person to call for another s letters or for a servant to call for his master s—it is not usual to give out letters unless they are directed to our care—I do no know whether the General Post office know that a person came and said If there should be any letters come for Captain Steele will you be so kind as to take them in—he did not say that to me but he came to my aunt—she is not here—she is ill NICHOLS PEARCE I am inspector of the A division of the police By direction of the commissioners I went to No 12 Portland-street Soho—I went into the front room on the first-floor—the prisoner was not at home—I searched the room and found a writing-desk and bank notes in box NATHANIEL NORRIS I keep the house No 12 Portland-street The prisoner lodged in the first floor front room—he came about the 7th of August and continued till he was taken into custody on the charge—I do not remember seeing Sturgeon coming there—I saw him at Bow-street Cross-examined Q You were the landlord of this gentleman A Yes his wife was living with him—he always went by the name of Hasker—I had directions from her to take in letters for a person of the name of Steele—he said that captain Steele was a friend of his who was in prison for debt NICHOLAS PEARCE re-examined I found in that lodging bank-notes in a box to the amount of 35l —I saw bishop find a seal—some of the bank-notes were given to the policeman and the rest are in my possesion—there were about nine sovereigns besides the notes—I have given the prisoner all but 15l —I took him custody at No 12 Portland-street—he came in while we were there—I said I wanted him—he said What do you want with me —at that moment I caught hold of him and there was a struggle and the prisoner and another person tried to get me over the stairs—I got him into the room—he asked what I wanted him for—I said for attempting top get money from his Grace the Duke of Wellington under a false pretence—he said he knew nothing about it—I addressed him by no name—the name of Steele was mentioned by a person lodging in the house who came to the door—he said his name was Hasker—the Mendicity Society had no knowledge of my going at the time I went—he was taken to bow-street on the charge of the Duke of Wellington and I was directed to go the Mendicity Society Cross-examined Q I suppose you had a search-warrant to go into this gentleman s room A No I took the money before I saw Sir Frederick Roe—there was no charge of felony against him—Mr Mayne my superintendant was the first who spoke to me about it—I went to his lodgings more than once—I saw Mr Mayne before I went to his lodgings Q Do you mean to state that Mr Commissioner Mayne directed you to go to his lodging and take money without a warrant A I had no warrant and there was no information of felony at that time against him—I had no directions to take the money out of his house more than I have stated—I thought it consistent with my duty to take his money and I have 15l of it now—I rummaged his papers—I had no warrant either general or particular—he and his wife were there the first time—he did not remonstrate with me in fact he unlocked his box for me—he did not tell me to take his money nor say whether it was agreeable to him or not—he said he should like for me to count it—I have been many times specially employed by the Commissioners to apprehend persons and if the nature of the case requires a warrant I apply for one—in this case I could not do so—it would not do for me to delay—I took a great many papers—I was directed by Sir F Roe to go and take all papers that might throw any light on the subject—I took his wife s marriage certificate Q Did you threaten his wife with confinement A No Sir I never uttered a threat to her not lock her up—she asked me whether I should take her up—I said no—that was before the prisoner came home—I took the papers the day after I took the prisoner—I think I went there more than twice—I saw his wife at the penny post-office—I did not take her into custody from there to his house—I said I should go and she went—she appeared reluctant—I was not in uniform HENRY BISHOP I am sergeant of the A division I went with the last witness to the lodgings in Portland-street—I found this seal in the desk and this card-case with two cards in it with Captain Henry Steele 12 Portland-street on them CHARLES GOODWIN ESQ I am Secretary to the Queen s Treasury I know the prisoner—he was an applicant for relief to the Queen s Treasury rather more than four years ago under the name of Hawkins—he got up a case in the name of Elizabeth Lock—I have seen him write—this letter No 1 is unlike those I have had from him Cross-examined Q Have you seen him write more than once A Only once—this does not bear upon the similarly at all—it was not like what I saw him write HENRY BISHOP re-examined This is the

is written in pencil A Yes—the body of it did not appear to be Mr Ross s handwriting—the signature appeared to me to be a different hand—the body of the order was writ ten in a shaky hand—upon his saying it was Mr Ross s and seeing the address on the back I considered it to be authentic—I know this to be the same paper as was presented to me by Hill by my initials on the corner which I put when I received it back at Union-hall—I had put no mark on it before MR CLARKSON Q This endorsement on the back T Ross Esq Bl induced you to think it was genuine A Yes THOMAS ROSS I live at Blackheath In

s—I did not charge Murray but the Magistrate held him to bail Cross-examined by MR BODKIN Q Was Adams a labourer or did he work on his own account A He had so much a ton for laying the lead down and he was to employ whom he pleased to assist him—Hill was no servant of mine but his—Adams had applied to me for money shortly be fore this occurred on account of the contract on the Saturday night previous I refused to give it him—he had no other person in his employ but Hill that I am aware of—I do not know Williams—I deposed before the Magistrate what I said when I saw Hill come with the cart

my master Mr Adams who is at the public-house at the comer MR CLARKSOK Q Were you in the habit of writing your requests on the backs of letters and so on A It is very likely I write sometimes in ink but mostly with a pencil—this order is not my writing—I have never used 81bs lead—I should certainly say Hill knew that—I did not authorise Hill or Adams to get lead from Mr Bloyd and carry it to the stable of Murray DANIEL HENNESSY police-constable L 171 On the 22nd of August Hill was brought to the station-house—I afterwards took Adams into custody from the Crown public-house Stanhope-street

account—he was in bed at the time—he said he had been out the over-night but he would get up about twelve o clock and send me a cheque up—I left him and left the clothes—I went the next morning with Mr wood with the rest of the clothes—we found him at the Saracen s Head—I told him he had not kept his word as we had received no cheque—he said he had quite forgotten it but it did not matter he would give a cheque for the a whole amount—Mr Wood asked him on what bank it would be—he said on a bank at Liverpool—Mr Wood said that would be no payment at all and objected to appeared much offended that his word should be doubted—I had some conversation with Mr Wood and the result was that on the prisoner giving his word as a gentleman that he had effects there either 105l Mr Wood took the cheque—he gave his word that he had either 105l or 150l at the Northern and Central Bank at Liverpool—on receiving this cheque the clothes were left—this is the cheque— looking at it —read— August 18 1838—To the Manager of the Northern and Central Bank Liverpool Pay 34l 17s 6d William Beardsworth —I saw him write that cheque—from information I received I went the same night to the Britannia at Limehouse— the clothes were not delivered till we got the cheque except the first suit —I found at the Britannia a box which is here and in it part of the goods which were delivered to him but the most expensive clothes were gone—I remained there and about eleven o clock on the Sunday night the prisoner came to the house—I caught hold of him and told him he had proved a great villain towards me—he begged and prayed me for God s sake not to give him into custody and said he had no intention to defraud me—I told him that it had every appearance that he had and told him there was no such bank as the cheque was drawn on—he said he merely gave that because his friends would take it up—he was taken to the station-house—I did not notice what he said—on the Monday as he was going before the Magistrate he said he merely saw the name of the bank in the Directory and that he had no money there Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q Did you first mention the goods or did he ask you to make the goods A I asked him if he wanted any thing—I first spoke to him—I had known him some years before but had lost sight of him—I told him my name—on his telling me he was going to Jamaica I said I should be very happy to make the outfit—I did not at all press him to take more goods than he ordered—he got the prices before he gave the order and told me he must have them at as low a rate as he could—some of the articles were light and some were of cloth—when we hesitated about the cheque he said we might keep the things until they were paid for if we doubted about it—they were made to fit the prisoner—he was measured for every article he ordered—he begged me not to give him into custody and asked me to take him to Mr Wood—I did not understand him to say that his friends would have money paid into the bank to meet the cheque— looking at a letter —I cannot say whether this is his handwriting—I never saw him write anything but this cheque—I should say it was not myself—I told him that at the time he wrote the cheque he knew the bank had stopped payment—I mean to swear that he said he knew the bank had stopped payment—I had transactions with him about seven years ago—he paid me honourably then MR BALLANTINE Q Have you had a farthing of this money paid to you A No JAMES WOOD I am the master of John Goodman I went with him to the Saracen s Head to see the prisoner on the 13th of August in consequence of receiving a letter—he said he wanted an outfit as he was very shortly proceeding to the West Indies—he chose his patterns and ordered a quantity of clothes of each sort—on the following Thursday evening he came to my house and said he wanted one suit of clothes to go down Gravesend to a party of friends and I sent them next morning—on saturday by appointment I took the goods in a box to the Saracen s head—he asked me for the bill I gave it him—he asked me if there was any discount—I said No it was contract price and no discount —he said he would pay me a cheque—he drew a cheque—I saw it was on a Liverpool bank and I said a cheque on a Liverpool bank was no payment to me unless I was perfectly satisfied he had effects there—he said he never had his honour disputed before and had travelled all over the country and had paid cheques—he said he had from 105l to 150l in the Northern and Central Liverpool Bank he could not be certain which—I called my foreman out to question him on his previous knowledge of him—I took the cheque after about an hour s consultation and left the clothes—the prisoner said I should find it all right—I would not have left the clothes without having the cheque—I immediately went to the Bank of England and got information—I afterwards went to the Mansion-house then to Grote and Co —the cheque was then sent down to Liverpool by post by the inspector of the police—I traced the prisoner down to Limehouse and found a box with some of the clothes in it but the greatest part of them taken away—I aw the prisoner on Monday evening going to Lambeth-street—he said Now Wood would it not be better for you to get the money than to prosecute me —I said I have nothing to do with it I will not compound a felony with you Cross-examined Q How long before the clothes were delivered was the arrangement for payment made A They were left immediately on his giving me the cheque—I let him have them in consequence of his telling me he had money in the Bank—I never saw him before MR BALLANTINE Q Unless you had believed the cheque to have been a good one you would not have given him the clothes A Certainly not nor if I had supposed there was no such bank—I have received no money from his friends on the cheque WILLIAM BUTLER police-constable K 80 I took the prisoner into custody at the Britannia on Sunday night—I searched him and found four duplicates one sovereign and 9 1/2 d —I found the box and clothes in it there—at the station-house he told the inspector he had searched the Directory and found no such a bank as the Northen and Central Bank at Liverpool and if there had been such a bank he had no money there THOMAS EELEY I lived with Mr Walker a pawnbroker in the Commercial road Limehouse On the 18th of August two coats two pairs of trowser and a waistcoat were pawned at our shop for 4l 10s in the name of John Edwards by the prisoner between two and three o clock in the afternoon—the things are not here—I have since left my employ—I showed them at the police-office to Mr Wood and they were die same goods JAMES WOOD re-examined The goods produced at the Mansion-house were part of mine and those found at the Britannia were also part of them JOHN SYMONS I am an inspector of the K division I was at the station-house on the Sunday night when the prisoner was brought there—I heard Goodman charge him with having committed a forgery—the prisoner said Goodman it is no forgery it is my own handwriting —I showed him we cheque which I had received from Goodman he said it was his handwriting—I asked him if he had any effects in that bank—he said he had no effects there he merely took it from the Directory—I saw him searched—one duplicate found on him was for goods pawned at Walker s for 4l 10s—I have been down to Liverpool since the last sessions and made inquiry as to the existence of the Northern and Central Bank and cannot find any such bank in Liverpool—there is no number or street on the cheque—I produce a certificate from the Northern and Central Bank at Manchester—I made inquiry there and found there was no such bank as that in existence at Liverpool Cross-examined Q Did you understand there had been a branch at Liverpool which had stopped payment A I understood so—it stopped payment in January 1837—I found the name in the Directory—I produce the box of clothes found and the property in it GUILTY * Aged 27 — Transported for Seven Years The prisoner has been three years in the Penitentiary which he left in March last

Dover-road—my son is in partnership with me—the prisoner was in my employ very nearly two years—in May lost I called his attention to something in the books—after that he did not attend to the business as before—he left about the latter end of May without notice—I had paid his wages up to the Saturday before—I saw him several times after that—I cannot exactly say when—he was taken on this charge about a month back—he had not returned to my service in the mean time—he had no authority to receive the sum of a guinea in August last of a customer of the name of Sanderson—he never communicated to me that he had been to apply for that money or to receive it—I received this letter by the post looking at it —I have seen him write and believe this to be his handwriting Cross-examined by MR JONES Q Do you mean this is like his handwriting A Yes I believe that to be his—I would not swear positively—it is unlike his general writing certainly—I can swear I have seen letters of his handwriting which correspond with this—I do not mean to swear that I have ever seen him write like this—he had been in my employ about eighteen months—I cannot tell whether he had had any quarrel with my son shortly before May last—I never heard of such a thing—he did not leave in consequence of having words with my son—he never said any thing to me nor to my son about leaving—I left the management of the business to the prisoner and my son who was in the habit of having more communication with him than I had—I cannot tell how often he called at my house after he left—I might have seen him two or three times—I knew where he lived for some little time after—I did not know for a month or three weeks because he was shifting about—I called on him repeatedly to ask him to return he did not refuse—he did not return as my servant but was at my place several times—I often asked him for explanations as to my books money paid and so on—he did not always give me an answer to my satisfaction—before I took him on this charge I charged him with behaving improperly as my servant—the last time that I called on him before I took him was the latter end of May or the beginning of June—I believe it was after that that he called on me but I had no communication with him—I believe my son had not—he and my son superintended the books in my absence—I sometimes made entries—there were not frequent irregularities occurring from my interferences—I never called on him to account for monies that I had received—my son was in bed when I left home this morning at half-past eight o clock—he is not able to come here he has just come off a journey—he is under the necessity of going to a physician this morning—after the prisoner left my service in May I might have spoken to him about the outstanding accounts—I have not spoken to him frequently since he left my employ about getting orders for me nor about getting the money for orders he had procured for me MR BODKIN Q You do not think this like his ordinary writing A No—he is capable of writing different hands—on looking at this I discover some letters which induce me to think it is his writing—after he finally left on the latter end of May I had no communication with him on business—I called his attention to some irregularities in the books about a fortnight before—he then came occasionally—he sometimes stopped away one or two days or a week—the latter part of May was the last time I had any communication with him on business—he called early in June but I had no communication with him then—my son returned from a journey on Tuesday evening MARTIN SANDERSON —I am inn-keeper and coach-proprietor at the Boar and Castle Oxford-street I am a customer of Staff and Son—I had an article of them in January last—it came to a guinea—the prisoner called on the 24th of August and asked for further orders and was very pressing for them—I wanted a cover for a provender-van—he went into the yard and said he knew what would do—I gave him the order—he asked me if it would be convenient to pay that little account and I gave him a sovereign—he wrote this receipt for it in my presence—the bill had been previously left looking at a letter —I did not write this or authorise it to be written—I asked him what would be the price of it and how long it would take to make—he said we should not fall out about the price and he could not promise it under about six weeks Cross-examined Q Have you any partners A I work coaches with several people—this tarpaulin was used for some of the coaches—I paid for it but it has since been charged to the general account—when the prisoner came in August I knew at once who he was—he was very solicitons for orders—he said anything in our way —there was no mention of the name of Staff and Son that I can recollect—one of my servants brought him and said Here is this person from Staff and Co —the prisoner was within five yards and must have heard it MR BODKIN Q You bought this yourself individually A I did not absolutely buy it at all—he left it—I paid for it out of my own funds COURT Q Did you receive any orders from your partners to buy it A No I should have appropriated it to my use — Receipt read Martin Sanderson to Messrs Staff and Son —One imperial yellow coach-cover £l 1s Received 24th August J GRIFFIN Letter read To Messrs Staff and Son —Please

t18390408-1219  1219 THOMAS MERRITT was indicted for feloniously knowingly and without lawful excuse on the 26th of March at St Anne Westminster having in his custody and possession a certain plate on which was engraved part of a promissory note purporting to be part of a promissory note for the payment of money of a certain company of persons carrying on the business of bankers under the name and style of the Cornish Bank —2 other COUNTS varying the manner of laying the charge MESSRS BODKIN and DOANE conducted the Prosecution FREDERICK JOHN WHITEMAN I live with ray father in Princes-street Soho and am an engraver On Wednesday morning the 20th of March the prisoner came to our shop to have a plate engraved exactly hike the pattern of a bank note which he produced—this is it— looking at it —he said he wanted a fac-simile of that engraved—I said we could do it—he said he wanted an exact copy of that with the stamp at the back—I told him it would require two plates to do that—I asked him how many he should want and he said 3000—he wanted them that week if it was possible to get them done—I told him we could not and Monday was named—I asked him if he wanted a fac-simile of the signature—he said We will do that ourselves —he left 10s with me as a deposit—he asked what the printing would be—I said I did not exactly know and asked him what he had been in the habit of paying—he said About 8s a hundred —he then went away and in about an hour I gave the note to my father and told him what had passed—the prisoner wanted to know if I could do one while he staid to see if it was correct—but I told him is must be engraved Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q Did he tell you he was employed by another person to get it done A Not to me nor in my presence—he did not mention the name of Gribble COURT Q Did he desire you to engrave a fac-simile of the stamp at the back of the note A Yes JOHN HENEY WHITEMAN I am engraver On the 20th of March I received this note from my son with 10s —on the following day the prisoner came and I saw him in the presence of my son—he wished me to engrave a plate as near as possible to correspond with the note in question and also wished the government stamp at the back of it done—Iundertook to do it for him and asked him for a further deposit—he asked me how much—I told him at least I should require 5l —he pulled a bag of sovereigns out of his pocket and threw down four sovereigns and a half which made 5l deposit—he wanted the plates to be done by the Monday following—that was the understanding and 3000 impressions—they are £5 notes—he said he thought the first note he had brought not sufficiently legible as to the stamp on the back and left me another country note not of the same bank but on which the stamp at the back was more legible—I have parted with that note by mistake since—I went the same day to Praed and Co the London agents of the Cornish bank and made a communication to them and also wrote a letter by post to the firm to Tweedy and Co of the Cornish bank—On Saturday the 23rd the prisoner came again and asked how I got on with the plates—I showed him one to show that it was in progress—I then required a further deposit from him and he gave me 10l in cash—the plates were then pretty well perfect—I asked him on that occasion if he was employed by the Cornish bank and he said Yes —I said I presume you are a son of one of the firm —he said No I am a clerk of the firm —I then proceeded to finish the plate and struck off about a dozen impressions—this is the plate and these are the impressions I gave him— looking at them —I think I gave him ten—I delivered the plate to the prisoner my self and was present when my son delivered him the impressions on Tuesday the 26th—about five minutes after I saw him in custody of two officers—I had suggested to him on the Saturday to go to Praed s the agents of the bankers for another note—he objected to that and said it was too far—I went with him to Lubbock s opposite the Mansion-house but did not succeed in getting a note there Cross-examined Q Had he ever mentioned to you a person named Gribble as having employed him A No I am quite sure of that—he paid me 15l in cash and three £5 notes altogether MR BODKIN Q The three £5 notes were for the purpose of making the plate A Yes—he gave me the third note on Saturday after we came out of Lubbock s MR PHILLIPS Q Was that one of the Cornish bank A No I only had one of the Cornish bank—the other was a note of the Union bank and the other a Miners Company note—I have kept them all except the one which I changed away by mistake—at the time I was receiving this money from the prisoner I was in communication with the bank—I have kept the money MR BODKIN Q Where is the third bank-note A I have it in my pocket—it was given me to engrave the government stamp by which I partly executed COURT Q You got three notes from the prisoner on what day did you receive the second A On the Thursday the day after my son received the first—the second note was of the Union bank—I did not strike off the whole 3000 impressions only about a dozen—I am not prepared to say what I should charge for making the plates and striking off the impressions—I lost a great deal of time with the prisoner—I should say the charge would be 15l or 20l —I should imagine the government stamp could only be wanted for a fraudulent purpose DANIEL FORRESTER I am a police-officer attached to the Mansion-house In consequence of information on the 26th of March about twelve o clock in the day I went with Keys to Princes-street Soho where we could command a view of Mr Whiteman s shop—about one o clock I observed the prisoner come out—we followed him into Piccadilly—he turned into the White Bear gateway and got as far as the tap when we took him into custody—I took this plate from his hand and said What have you got here —he said It is mine —I asked him what it was for—he said it was for a bill—he had two parcels in his hand— I had seen him open it in coming down Princes-street and I looked over his shoulder and saw it was copper —I asked him who gave him authority to get it made—he said Mr Williams of Truro —I asked him what Mr Williams was—he said A grocer —I saw the prisoner write his address—I could not understand the name of the place the prisoner said he himself lived in and got him to write his own address and Mr Williams s too—I have the paper on which he wrote them— read — Thomas Merritt Hull Luggin Pool Cornwall—Mr Williams Truro Leman-street grocer FRANCIS KEYS I am an officer I was with Forrester when the prisoner was taken—I took the parcel from his hand and produce it—it contains nine of the notes—the other I gave up—I went to Cornwall to the address given by the prisoner but could not find any Mr Williams a grocer there at all—I then went to the address he had written down as his own residence—I searched there and found these papers which I now produce and some loose type—some part of which will make the word Cornish Bank in the same kind of letters as is on the note—there is type enough for the whole word Cornish Bank —I have teen them tried—they are German text letters Cross-examined Q You found he had given a right address down in Cornwall A I found it near there by making inquiry—I did not search for any body else there—I made inquiry for a man named Gribble and found he lived next door to the prisoner but had gone away MR BODKIN Q What made you inquire for Gribble A One of the partners suspected he was concerned but I did not think so and should not have taken him if I could have found him WILLIAM MANSEL TWEEDY I am a banker in Cornwall in partnership with William Tweedy and others The style of our bank is Cornish Bank Truro—this is a genuine note of our house— the one first presented to Mr Whiteman —the stamp on the bank is affixed by the Government—we pay for each stamp as it is affixed by the Government—it is a 15d stamp—I have only known the prisoner since his apprehension—he had no authority to have a plate engraved to strike off impressions of our notes—I am not aware of any grocer named Williams at Truro—I have lived there about thirty-four years Cross-examined Q About what is the population of Truro A About ten thousand—there may be such a person as Williams but not in Leman-street—my father directed Keys to search for Gribble—I did not know of him—I have heard of him only since this transaction—we have been on the look-out for him but have been unable to find him as I understand MR BODKIN Q What was your reason for searching for him A In consequence of his being a bad character and living next door to the prisoner my partner suspected he might be concerned with the prisoner GUILTY Aged 22 —Recommended to mercy by the Jury believing

paper looking at one and said this John Freeman had 75l pricemoney to receive—he read the paper to me and asked me whether I would oblige the sailor with the loan of a sovereign until the 12th of December when he was going to receive his money and he would be sure to return it to me again and he would give me 10s for the loan of it until the 12th—he told me the sailor s name was John Freeman which was on the paper—he read the paper over to me and told me it was quite right for he Young had been to Mr Goode s No 15 Surrey-street to see the books and it was quite right—I gave Young a sovereign which he passed to the sailor—I parted with it believing the account which he gave me to be true—he said he had to pay 2s 6d or 2s to see the books—the paper was left with me—I saw Young two or three times in the course of the week and he said it was quite right—I have never got my sovereign—the sailor came afterwards and drew 13s more on the same paper—I made inquiry and caused the prisoner to be apprehended Prisoner Q Previous to the 1st of December had anybody asked you to advance anybody a sovereign A No—Davis told me the sailor wanted to borrow some money on a paper and that he had some pricemoney to receive—he did not ask me to lend any one a sovereign—I had seen you two or three days before—I did not send Davis to you to say I wished to advance money on the paper—Davis told me you said the sailor did not want to borrow money on the paper but that you were very much in want of money and if the sailor would borrow it you would be very glad as you could have it then—he told me the sailor was in work and did not want any money—you did not come to me about it before the 1st of December Q Who did you lend the money to A I gave it into your hands and you passed it to the sailor—I first put it on the shop-board— ——said Don t be too fast take the money up again —I took it up and put it into your hand—the sailor did not say If you cannot lend me a sovereign a few shillings will do —he asked me to lend him another—I had been told I should have 10s interest but I did not ask for it—I did not send any body to your house after you were in custody—a young man a carpenter lodges in my house—he it not here—he has nothing to do with this—I did not authorise him to go to your house nor do I know that he went—Davis was not to pay me back any part of this money—he proposed to pay me back but I told him I did not want it—that was after you had been at Worship-street—he offered to pay me because I might think it was through him the money was lost but I would not take it of him because I knew he had no work at the time—the Magistrate had said he considered him as bad as the rest which made him offer me the money back JURY Q What induced you to lend the money A He told roe he was very much in want of money and had none to bay him victuals—I expected 10s for it Prisoner Q Is it likely I could tell him I had paid 2s to search the books when he says I told him I had not 1s in the world A You did not say you had paid the 2s —you said it was stopped out of the pricemoney—you did not tell me yourself that you had not 1s to get victuals—the money I lent was my brother s—it was given into my hands to lend to you—I do not recollect your saying you had no interest in the money—I did not tell the policeman that you laid so Paper read — This is to certify that John Freeman has served as able-seaman on board Her Majesty s Brigantine Bonnett from the 25th day of September 1836 to the 4th day of November 1839 The said John Freeman is 5 feet 4 inches and is of a fresh complexion and is entitled to share for all captures made during that period Given under my hand this 26th day of November 1889 WILLIAM ROBERTS Commander Names of vessels captured Slaves Incomprehensible 700 Delourens 300 Cibra de Africa 210 Providentia 190 Total 1400 Payable at Frederick Goode Esq Agent 15 Surrey-street Strand Dec 12 1839 JAMES MOLE I am the prosecutor s brother and live with him—I am a shoemaker On Sunday evening the 1st of December I was present when the prisoner produced this paper to my brother—after the prisoner had read the paper he said it was quite right because he had been to see the books at Mr Goode s office and had paid 2s or 2s 6d I do not know which to see them and he said if we went to see the books we should have to pay the same—he said he and the sailor wanted some money on the paper—my brother said he had no objection if he knew the paper was quite right—he put a sovereign on the board and the prisoner took it up—my brother did not know the prisoner before only he came to see Davis who lodged in the house—the prisoner and the sailor went away together—the prisoner said the sailor s name was John Freeman—the prisoner handed the money over to the sailor—in consequence of not getting the money back I watched the prisoner and bad him taken into custody on Wednesday the 11th—when I was at the station-house he asked if my brother would take the sovereign to make it up Prisoner Q Where were you when I came into the house A I was in the house getting tea—you and the sailor together asked my brother to lend the sovereign—you took it up and passed it to the sailor—I understood it was to be lent to you and the sailor together—my brother looked to the sailor for payment of the money—he was to wait until the l2th for it but he went to see if it was correct and found it was not—I saw the sailor on the Saturday and Monday too after the money was lent—he was along with the tailor on Saturday—he staid at our house all night—my brother lent him 12s that afternoon—he asked him to lend it—I was not present then—my brother went out with him on Sunday afternoon for a walk—they were about two hours together—the sailor remained in company with my brother and Davis the whole afternoon—my brother lent him another 1s on Monday morning—the sailor did not drink away the 12s at our house—he slept there on Sunday and went off on Monday morning saying be was coming back but we never saw him again—my brother did not authorize any body to settle this affair—he never sent a carpenter to your house—the carpenter lodged at our house—I understood the money was for you and the sailor together—the sailor said you had 8s of it—you did not to my knowledge tell my brother you had no interest in the affair after he lent the sovereign FREDERICK GOODE I am a navy-agent and live at No 15 Surrey street Strand I am agent for the Dolphin which made a capture of other vessels in the slave-trade the Deloureusand Incomprehensible—there is nobody named John Freeman entitled to prize-money for those seizures—the Bonettais not the vessel which captured those vessels but the Dolphin—I do not know William Roberts as a commander at all—there is such a vessel as the Bonetta but I am not concerned for her—the prisoner did not examine my books—if he bad examined them he would not find this certificate correct—William Robarts had not the command of the Dolphin but a man named Roberts and this is not his signature—I know his hand-writing—the prisoner did not at any time make any application to me on the subject of this certificate LAMBERT WILKINSON I am a policeman I was on duty in Goldenlane on Wednesday evening the 11th—the prisoner was given into my custody by John Mole—he said he was innocent but sooner than there should be a piece of work about the sovereign he would make it up and give it him—I received the certificate which has been read from the prosecutor Prisoner I have twice requested a person to serve a subpoena✗ on the carpenter and Davis and they tell me they have endeavored and cannot do so—they will not tell him the carpenter s name and I do not know it JOHN MOLE re examined The carpenter s name is Richard Bate—he still lodges with us but is at work a few miles out of town at present Prisoner s Defence I had not seen the sailor above once or twice previous to the transaction he came round to my house I never saw him but once and we were separated for twelve months When we last met we saw each other a day or two and he told me he had a certificate of prize-money to receive I asked him what the money was he was entitled to he said from 70l to 75l I saw him a few days afterwards in company with Davis who was present when the sailor produced the certificate out of his hat and asked me if I knew any respectable person who he could leave the certificate with and would lend him a few shillings to maintain himself till he could get his money I said I did not unless my own father would Davis said Well you can go and ask your father and I will ask my landlord if he will lend the sailor a sovereign The sailor accompanied me up to my father s and I only ask if it is at all likely that I should be such an ungrateful scoundrel as to go and ask my father to lend a sovereign on it if I meant to rob him I had not the slightest idea the certificate was not good I had never seen such a thing in my life I had no object whatever in serving the man further than considering he was in difficulties and to advance a trifle if it would help him As to my saying I searched the books and paid 2s Mole and Davis well knew that I had not a shilling to bless myself with I had been from home twelve months I had been in trouble that twelve months and it is not likely I could go and pay that money to search the books I have a witness to prove I never saw the man till that time I never asked Mole to advance him the money but Davis came to me and said Have you done any thing with that certificate I said No my father will not advance the money He said I have asked my landlord and he made me no reply I said I shall not trouble further about it but in the evening the sailor asked me to mind the certificate for him as he was going out Next day Davis came and asked me if I had done any thing with it I said I had not and could not he said There is a young man in our house to whom I have named it he says he shall be glad to lend the sailor a sovereign or two if he would give him interest I said if I saw the sailor I would let him know Davis came to me next day I said in all probability the sailor had got work and if so to let it rest Next day I saw the sailor who had been at work down at Shadwell and I said nothing to him about Davis having offered to lend the money He went away and on Saturday Davis came to me again I told him the sailor had got work On Sunday the 1st of December Davis came to me again and asked me the same thing I told him very likely I should see the sailor that day and if he chose to lend him money he could I saw the sailor in the evening and told him a person in Davis s house would lend him money he said Well I only earned 3s 6d yesterday and I will go to him He asked me to accompany him I handed the certificate to him and we went to Davis s house into a front room on the third floor Mole was called up Davis said This man wishes you to lend him a small sum of money and he will lay in your hands a certificate entitling him to prize-money He asked him if he knew what sum it was he said he did not and asked me the same I said I tell you what would be your best plan it would be to go down to the office where he says the certificate is payable and ascertain if it is correct he said There is no occasion for that and immediately laid a sovereign on the shop-board whether I touched it I cannot say but I know I never had any money out of it I saw Mole frequently afterwards and so depressed was I in circumstances that I asked him to purchase a duplicate of a brooch of me which he did and I believe on the following day I asked him to buy the duplicate of a gown-piece I do not deny accompanying the sailor to his house but I did not make any false representation about the certificate WILLIAM MOLE re-examined I redeemed a brooch for him three or four days before I gave him in charge—it might be the Tuesday after I I lent the money and he asked me to try to sell the duplicate of a gownpiece but I could not JANETTA LEWIS I live in the same house as the prisoner I recollect a sailor coming to him—he took a certificate out of his hat showed it to the prisoner and wanted a sovereign on it — The witness here detailed a conversation which took place which the Court ruled was not evidence —Davis came four times to the house to see Young—after the prisoner was in custody the prosecutor came and said if the prisoner would pay the sovereign he would be satisfied WILLIAM JUST On the night the prisoner was taken into custody I was in his house—I heard a person come and ask to see his wife—I saw Davis watching and listening to all that was said—the man wanted to make a forcible entrance up stairs—before that Mr Mole came himself to the prisoner s house and said If you can make up the money it will prevent the prosecution —I believe the prisoner was incapable of making it up—Mole said It will be a compoundfelony if I take it but yet I will take it —he asked the prisoner s wife if she had not got a silver watch or other property to the amount WILLAM MOLE re-examined I did not make any proposition about taking a silver watch—I know nothing of it—I neither sent any body nor went myself—I never said I would compound the felony and if they could make up the money there should be no prosecution nor any thing of the sort—I never saw that man till he was at Worship-street—the woman came to me on the Saturday and told me Mrs Young wanted to see me—I went and she asked me if she was to make the money up whether I would not appear against him—I told her I would let her know in half-an-hour—I did not send any body to her nor to the prisoner—it is all false—they asked me to make it up—I said I dared not because I had gone too far with it—I have tried all I can to take Freeman into custody Prisoner Q You said before the Magistrate although you knew he frequented houses about Shadwell you had gone to Westminster to look for him A I said I went up that way thinking I might fall in with him there—I do not know what houses he frequents—I did not go to Shadwell with him on the Saturday night after I lent him the 12s nor did he spend the 12s in our house—he was out three or four hours on Saturday and went out again on Sunday morning—he came back to dinner GUILTY *Aged 30 — Transported for Seven Years

came to lodge at my house—I never knew him before—he represented himself as a ship-chandler that he had taken a warehouse and said he should be a permanent lodger for many years he hoped—he was to pay me 15s a week for board and lodging—he has not paid me one farthing and he is my debtor for 75l as a loan—I had a Spanish certificate from a debtor named Newton who bad been engaged in the Spanish war—I got another certificate from Mr Clark of the Spanish Commission in exchange for it—the one I got from Mr Newton was for 27s 6s 5d —it was a transfer similar to one I hold in my hand—I was in September last showing the document to a friend—the prisoner was at my house at the time my friend called—there was something stirring respecting this certificate—he thought there would be some interest likely to be paid—the prisoner said Have you got a Spanish bond Mr Smith —I said I have a transfer or certificate as they call it —he said I should like to see it —I said I can let you see it —after my friend was gone I showed it to the prisoner—he said giving it me back again If you like I will take it to my banker s to ascertain the value of it for you as it may be useful to you at any time —he said Messrs Coutts in the Strand were his bankers—I told him I did not want money just then nor want to part with it but I said Whatever you do do not take any thing on it —I gave it to him again and cautioned him not to make any thing on it—I would not take 19s 11d in the pound because it would be paid some day but he might inquire the day price on it if he liked—he took it and said he should be going up to his banker s in the course of the day and he would inquire—he afterwards said that if I liked if I doubted it he would give me cash for it—I said No my own document is what I want —he said any time I wanted 100l or 1000l I should have it that he had 2000l standing at his banker s—I was out when he came home—I did not come home till the evening and did not see him that night—I believed him to be a respectable person—I never asked him for his board and lodging up to that time but I have latterly—two or three days after I gave him the certificate I said Respecting that transfer that I gave you to ascertain the value of you have not given it me again —he said Oh dear I did not see my banker he was not within but at any time you shall have it —we were to go to his banker s but we could not go then—he said If you are afraid I will give you the cash —I said no I wanted my own property—he said I will go and inquire about it — I have never had it since —I went with him to Coutts s about a month after the transaction—he said he was going up Leadenhetll-street and asked me to take a walk with him—I went and he went up and spoke to one of the clerks at Coutts s—I thought it was on business—that made me contented thinking my document was safe at Coutts s—he was not apprehended on my premises—he was taken on another charge Prisoner Q Did you give me the certificate or did your wife hand it over to me A I did—I know a gentleman named Miller—I have not seen him in this Court—I never offered him this bond to raise 20l on—I gave it you to ascertain the value and bring it me back—I sent my wife to two of my relations to borrow money on my own account—I never intended to raise 20l on this bond COURT Q Did you give him this bond or allow him to have it in order to raise any money on it A No by no means Prisoner Q Did you in presence of your wife request me to raise money on it or not A No—I have asked you for it a score of times—I did not want 30l

did not tell you not to tell my wife—I took 10l to Francs—you paid one days expenses and I the other—I swear that I never offered this Spanish certificate to any one to raise money and never showed it

Ratcliffe-highway I only know the prisoner by his coming once or twice to my house—he called in company with a person who he called William Bouch on the 20th of December—the prisoner said I have a claim here for you Mr Hart for a man that wants to sell I know this man to be correct I have brought him down to you he is going to sea as steward of a ship he has a claim of 64l odd shillings I think

88 14s 2d Balance 73l 16s — I then asked him whether he knew the man to be William Bouch—he said Perfectly well for I was out with him myself in the war of liberation I was a comrade of his —a friend of mine named Joseph happened to be sitting in my shop and said in the presence of Leslie and Bouch If I was you I would have a proper identity as to the man as the money must be lying some time Q What identity A That the man was William Bouch—he said I should have a certificate from some of the officers—the prisoner then said You can easily have that as Colonel Williams is in town I will go and get a certificate for you from him to show that this man is William Bouch —I said After I get the certificate we will then talk the thing over —they went away that night—this was Monday—they both came together next day Tuesday —Leslie gave me the paper produced — read —No 3— 21st December 1841 I hereby certify that William Bouch went out in the Edward barque with me 14th of December 1831 in the Portuguese service The date of his discharge I do not know as he went on board the fleet ROBERT WILLIAMS late Colonel P S — I said I did not like the appearance of the thing I did not want to purchase—there was no time fixed for the payment of the money—I asked what they wanted—the prisoner said 40l —I said I did not want it and asked what they wanted for it—the prisoner said We will take 40l —I said That is a great deal too much to throw away at present it is quite a speculative thing —Bouch said I will take 35l for it —after we had talked the thing over some little time I agreed to give them 30l 12l of which was to be in clothes and 18l in money—this was on the Wednesday—they went away on the Tuesday night after producing the certificate—on Wednesday they came again both together—some part of the conversation about the 40l was on the Wednesday and some on the Tuesday—it was on the Tuesday that it was said 18l was to be given in money and 12l in goods—they went away after that—I did not say any thing before they went away—they came again on Wednesday because we had not come to any thing we had not arranged—on the Tuesday the prisoner said Bouch wants to borrow 10s of you but he does not like to ask you and he will leave the papers if you will let him have it to-night —that was after the 12l in goods and 18l in cash was talked of—I advanced the 10s and the papers were left—nothing more was said on Tuesday—on Wednesday they came and the agreement was closed at 30l —I said before I parted with any more money I must have an office power of attorney and likewise I should expect Bouch to execute a bill of sale to me a power of attorney—the prisoner pulled out a printed form from his pocket and said Here is one of the office powers of attorney ready for you and gave it to me—Mr Josephs was present at the time and he began to fill up the power of attorney—it was a blank which the prisoner produced it—Mr Josephs said I cannot go any further with it to-night I find it must be certified by some housekeeper who knows the man to be William Bouch and likewise by a Magistrate —the prisoner then said If you will leave all that to me Mr Hart I will get that done for you —I said Very well you had better do that and come down to-morrow night and they then went away—they came again on Thursday together and when we got into the parlour the prisoner pulled out the power of attorney from his pocket and handed it to me—it was the same thing I have been speaking of the office power— looking at paper No 4 produced by Mr Barrow —this is it—it has Mr Joseph s writing on it which he was filling up—it purports to be signed by a Magistrate and also by a housekeeper Paper No 4 read — Claim No 254 received 19th October 1841 The Commissioners appointed by the Governments of Great Britain and Portugal respectively to be a mixed British and Portuguese Commission for investigating and adjudicating on the claims of British subjects employed in the naval and military service of Her Most Faithful Majesty in the late war of liberation Whereas I William Bouch formerly a petty officer in the Donna Maria Secundo have appointed and constituted and do hereby declare Michael Henry Hart as my agent and attorney in all matters connected with my claims on the Portuguese Government of whatsoever kind on account of my services in the late war of liberation I hereby authorize and empower the said Michael Henry Hart of Ratcliffhighway in the county of Middlesex slop-seller to appear before you the said Commissioners and on my behalf to settle all manner of accounts in respect of my claims and to receive from you all such titulos documents or other certificates of debt pay arrears gratuity pensions for wounds compensation or awards as you the said Commissioners shall after finally investigating my claims adjudge to me and I hereby empower and authorize the said Michael Henry Hart to exchange receipts and acquittances for the same and to do all other acts in relation thereto in as full and authentic a form and in as binding a manner in all respects as if I were present and personally consenting to the same In witness whereof I have hereunto subscribed my name on the 23rd December 1841 Signature WILLIAM BOUCH residing at No 12 Church-street Lissongrove I hereby certify that I personally know the above subscribing and have seen him sign the above declaration Signature of housekeeper ROBERT THOMAS butcher residing at No 146 Edgeware-road I hereby declare the above parties have appeared this day before me and signed the above declaration Signature of the Magistrate for the metropolitan police district said to be like Hardwick MICHAEL HENRY HART continued When the prisoner produced that paper to me he said I have got it done for you nicely now Mr Hart —I looked at the Magistrate s name at the bottom and asked him who was the Magistrate that signed the paper—he said he thought it was Mr Maltby—I then said See what things you want and we will get this business settled —speaking to the prisoner and likewise to Bouch—they were both present—Bouch went into the shop returned in three or four minutes and said I want money very badly I can t take more than 10l worth of clothes —I said I won t alter the agreement I agreed with you to take 12l worth and I won t give you more money than I arranged for —the prisoner and Bouch then went into the shop together and after they had selected what things they wanted they came back into the parlour and the prisoner said We hare taken very near to the amount you must not stand hard with the man for a few shillings because he wants money —he said they had taken to the amount of 11l or 12l a few shillings short of 12l —I said Now how much money do you want to-night because I shall not give you all the money to-night before you go up to-morrow morning to the Commissioners to have the power properly registered in my interest — I said so to the pair of them—they were both sitting in the parlour at the time —the prisoner said Give the man 10l to-night —I said I would not give him 10l to-night I would make it up to 20l altogether clothes and cash—I gave him 7l 15s 6d in cash altogether including the 10s I had given him before—some of the money was in sovereigns and some in silver—I said To-morrow morning go up along with Mr Josephs my friend to the Commissioners and satisfy the Commissioners that you have sold your claim to me and have the power registered in an official way as it ought to be done and then Mr Josephs will pay you the balance of the purchase-money —the prisoner said You have no occasion for all that Mr Hart you don t think I will deceive you —I said I will have it done in a proper manner —I did not let them have any more money that day—I sent Mr Josephs next morning but did not go myself—I most forget the goods which they got—my recollection is not very good—there was a jacket two pairs of trowsers six white shirts two waistcoats I think a coat handkerchiefs and stockings—altogether I paid them in money and clothes 20l Q Was any thing said about an assignment A Yes we had the assignment done at that time—this is it— producing it —it was done on the Thursday—William Bouch signed it and two of my neighbours witnessed it—neither of them are here—it is what he called an assignment—it is not stamped—the prisoner and Bouch arranged to meet Mr Josephs next morning at twelve o clock at a public-house that was named close to where the Commissioners hold their sittings in Mount-street Grosvenorsquare—I did not know Bouch before—he took no part in it—I trusted to what the prisoner said—he said this was a special case of his own—I certainly should not have let them have the goods and money without the prisoner s representations made in Bouch s presence Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q You all yourself a slopseller A Yes—I sell old and new clothes—not old bottles or any thing of that kind—I am a wholesale and retail slop-seller—I am licensed to sell watches—I sell telescopes quadrants and any thing in the sea line—I have lived twenty-three years in my own house there—it was on the prisoner s representations that I parted with my goods and nothing else Q How came you to require a certificate A It was the view of Mr Josephs—I had not paid any money before the certificate was produced Q On your oath would you have paid a single farthing if that certificate had not been produced A Yes I should perhaps I might cetainly—if Josephs had not suggested it perhaps I should not have asked for it—he suggested that I ought to have a proper identity of the man and on that I required a certificate from his commanding officer or somebody who knew him—I think I should have parted with my money if the certificate had not been produced—Mr Josephs impressed it on my mind—that was the only view I had on it Q Had they any money whatever before this certificate was produced A They had on the Tuesday night—I think the certificate was produced on the Tuesday as far as my recollection serves me but my recollection is very bad—I think it was after the certificate had been produced that I paid the 10s as far as my recollection serves me—the certificate was not the security in my mind for advancing it Q Then what did you require the certificate for A It was merely the view of Mr Josephs—I did not suggest it myself—he suggested it and required it—I can only say I should not have parted with a shilling if it had not been for the prisoner s representations urging me so strongly to do so—I think I should have parted with it if the certificate had not been produced—I did not refuse to pay them the money until it was produced—I think it was on Monday that I told them to bring the certificate—I never told them I would not advance any money until the certificate was produced—there was no money asked for then—after Mr Josephs had suggested it I said Bring the certificate and then we will talk the business over —I only knew the prisoner before by his writing a letter for me—I did not know that he was a person who forwarded the claims of parties on this commission—I only know it from what he told me—I was not acquainted with it myself—I knew nothing of him—Bouch is gone off and I have never seen him since—he had all the money—I have tried to find him but cannot AARON JOSEPHS I live in Lower Chapman-street St George s I was at Mr Hart s when the prisoner and Bouch were there—an offer was made to dispose of a certain claim on the Portuguese government for services rendered in the war of liberation—the prisoner said he knew the man was entitled to certain monies—an appointment was afterwards made to go before the Commission on Friday the 24th of December—I saw the prisoner and Bouch that day—Bouch went in with me to the office of the Mixed Commission and the prisoner followed me in shortly after—I produced this power of attorney No 4 to Mr Younghusband one of the clerks the prisoner was in the office and near me and requested him to be kind enough to register it—Mr Younghusband requested me to lay it on the table and it would be registered in due course—I then requested him to tell me if it was all right—he asked me the name—I told him William Bouch—he immediately said he did not recollect that name—I then handed the power of attorney to him—he referred to the register and said there was no such name as William Bouch—he then asked me the number of the claim—I told him 254—he referred to that number and said it was wrong there was no such name in 254 and requested I would produce the award paper which I did—this is it No 1 —he said there was some mistake in it he could not find any such claim—the prisoner then said that he knew Bouch had a claim that Dr Blundell bad made it out and sent it in for him—the prisoner proposed that Bouch should go to Dr Blundell s and get the letter that conveyed the award paper to the doctor to which I objected and said he had better remain till the matter was cleared up—Mr Younghusband then left the lower office went up stairs and returned shortly after with Mr Barrow—Bouch had then gone—while I was talking to a gentleman in the office my back was turned and he left—I have never seen him since—Mr Barrow said in the prisoner s presence that he felt this a case to be laid before the Commissioners and Mr Younghusband said there was no such claim in the office—after stopping some time while I was in conversation with Mr Barrow the prisoner went away and returned with a written paper which he said he had brought from Dr Blundell and he distinctly stated in Mr Barrow s presence that he knew Bouch had a claim that he had gone abroad with him and served with him WILLIAM ISAACS police-constable K 223 I took the prisoner into custody on Monday the 27th of December—he was pointed out to me by Mr Josephs—after taking him to the station I told him what he was charged with—he said it was through being a friend to another man who had gone to Bristol to get a ship—I searched him and found 1l 15s 6d in silver and some coppers on him—I inquired for Bouch about the neighbourhood of Lisson-grove but not at No 12 Church-street JOHN HENRY BARROW ESQ I am a barrister and am British Secretary to the Mixed British and Portuguese Commission—the office is No 94 Mount-street Grosvenor-square—the title of the commission is The Mixed British and Portuguese Commission for investigating and determining the claims of British subjects who served in the war of liberation on the Government of Portugal and the commission is constituted under a convention of the ministers of the two governments — for services performed for Donna Maria II Queen of Portugal —it is a mixed commission partly British and partly Portuguese— looking at paper No 1 —this is one of the forms of a notice to claimants to come in and hear the award—it purports that the Commission have come to a certain determination subject to any objection which the claimants on coming in may make—the sum in the margin is the award which the Commissioners have determined to be due to the claimant subject to objection which is the privilege defined in article 40 alluded to in this form—this would intimate that the claimant was entitled to the sum in the margin if he was content to take it—he might possibly get more but he would certainly be entitled to that sum if he did not object to it—I never saw the prisoner to my knowledge except at the time when I was called down and saw him at the office—we have a claimant of the name of Peter Click—I hold his original power of attorney and his subsequent appointment of a person named Leslie to be his attorney—the number of Click s claim is 154—the original amount of the claim was about 65l the award was 15l odd—if Click appeared by agent the award paper would in the usual course of business be delivered to his agent and if he appeared himself it would be delivered to himself—this power of attorney would authorize Leslie to receive the award paper—this is the power constituting Leslie his attorney subsequent to the revocation of the first power—I have examined this paper No 1 and can distinctly discover an alteration on the face of it—the party to whom it is addressed is placed in the wrong part of the paper and there is decidedly an alteration in the sum itself Cross-examined Q Did you ever see the person called Click A I cannot undertake to say in the immense multitude of claimants which we have—I have ascertained that a person named Click did make a claim from reference to our books—I have no personal recollection of issuing that claim myself except from its having my own signature on it—I can merely infer that this was issued to Click from the usual course of business—I cannot tax my memory as to having done any business with Click—my signature would only show that this is a claim which was issued by myself in the usual course of business—without reference to books I cannot say that this was issued in favour of a person named Click for this simple reason the name of Click is gone MR PAYNE Q Can you say whether it was ever issued from your office in the name of William Bouch A Certainly it was not COURT Q Is there any appearance remaining by which you can detect any name in whose favour it was issued A The only appearance is what I may call a sort of contingent evidence—the No 254 has been altered from 154 which was the number of Click s claim and the 15l which was the amount of Click s award has been altered to 65l —we have no claimant named Bouch AUGUSTUS FREDERICK LIKGLEY I am a clerk in the office of the Mixed Commission This paper No 1 has my writing on it—I made it out originally-—the name of Bouch was not then in it—it was written on the 28th of October which appears by the date of it—I remember writing it perfectly well—it is part of my duty—the original name has been erased from the paper which is very evident by some kind of acid and this William Bouch introduced in a new place—that is not my writing—my figures were 15l 14s 4 1/2 d and now it stands 65l 14s 4 1/2 d —the I has been converted into a 6—the number of the claim was originally 154 but the I has been converted into a 2 and it now stands 254 and I think the address was originally 17 Tabernacle-walk but it has been altered to 27—I do not know in whose handwriting the alterations are Q Can you tell of your own knowledge and recollection what name was originally in that particular paper A Peter Click—in my own handwriting Cross-examined Q From your own recollection you can tell that distinctly can you A Yes—I have not looked at any book to refresh my memory because I had no need to do so—these are papers of importance—I look through the books almost every day but I have not looked at them for the purpose of refreshing my memory upon this point—I have looked to see whether any person of that name was contained in the books but before I did so I had a decided knowledge of giving that paper to a person named Click ROBERT THOMS I am a pork butcher and tripe dresser and live at No 146 Edgware-road The signature Robert Thoms butcher 146 Edgware-road to this paper No 4 is not my signature—there is no other Robert Thoms a butcher living at 146—I do not know a man named Bouch living in Church-street Lisson-grove ANN WILLIAMS I am the wife of Robert Williams who was a colonel in the Portuguese war of liberation—I know his handwriting—this certificate No 3 is not his handwriting—the prisoner called at my house with another person to ask for a certificate—the colonel was ill in the country at that time and continued so for about a fortnight—I am quite sure this is not his writing MR HART re-examined The prisoner represented to me that he or Bouch would execute to me a good and valid assignment of all the money due to him for the service—that was done before I parted with the money and goods—I do not think I should have let him have had either money or goods without they had made out at the time what I thought to be a good assignment—that was done on the Thursday evening—I had advanced the 10s before I got that paper MR BALLANTINE called WILLIAM BROWN I live at No 16 North-street I was adjutant of the regiment the prisoner formerly belonged to and served in Portugal—I have known him since 1831—he went out with me then and through his good character was promoted to the rank of sergeant—his character was always honest and trustworthy COURT Q Do you know a man named Bouch A I recollect a man of that name in the regiment Charles Morgan cabinet-maker Hosier-lane and Mary Jones wife of a builder No 5 Earl-street Lisson-grove also deposed to the prisoner s good character GUILTY Aged 25 — Transported for Seven Years

come to the door of No 13 which I had opened—he had a box with a rush mat over it—he told me he had brought it from Mr Stewart M Kenzie for Lord Stanley and there was 3l 5s 4s to pay—he had a paper in his hand at the time—he read it as he came in—the direction was on it—he read the direction—the office-keeper was not at home—he asked for a pen and said something about seventy-two bottles of wine but I took no farther notice of it—he asked for a pen to write a receipt—I went down and told my fellow-servant—the prisoner was in the hall—he said the box contained a chandelier—I told him to put it on the ground—he said it had better go on the chair—he put it on the chair—he said he had brought it from the Docks—I told my fellow-servant what had passed and she went up stairs—I did not see the prisoner again till New Year s-day when I saw him opposite the Custom-house in Thames-street when I went with the officer—I said I could identify him better with his hat off—he was taken into a room and his hat taken off—I said I was sure he was the man—he went with me and the officer to the Colonial office and there he was shown to Maling the other servant—she looked through the glass door first and said that was the man—the prisoner said he was at the Ship tap in Water-lane from five till half-past eleven o clock—he said he could bring witnesses to Drove he was eating and drinking with them Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q Had you ever seen the man before A I thought I had but I could not be positive of it—I was quite sure of him when I saw him without his hat—I did not say I thought he was the man because he had got a pilot-coat on—I said the pilot-coat helped me to know him—at Bow-street the Magistrate said he might have worn a blue pilot-coat himself—I was not doubtful at the station whether he was the person nor before the Magistrate—I swore positively on the first day he was remanded till the Wednesday—the first day was Saturday New Year s day—the man was not many minutes in the hall—he had on a pilot-coat—there was no one with him in the hall at the same time as I was—I am sure that the person who came with the box spoke about Stewart M Kenzie—he read it off a slip of paper—my master kept the paper—I looked over it as the prisoner read it—I knew the paper again—the prisoner after I said it was him did not wish the policeman to go to the Ship tap—I did not take notice of what he said—I did not go with the prisoner from the Custom-house to Downing-street—I believe he volunteered to go— paper read — By Malta The Right Hon J S M Kenzie Lord High Commissioner of the Ionian Islands Palace Corfu ELIZABETH MALING I am servant to Mr Dodsworth I remember Norman coming into the kitchen on the 27th of December and making a communication about a man in the hall—I went up and found the prisoner there—he was standing at the desk writing something—I spoke to him and told him Mr Dodsworth was out I expected him in a few minutes—I remained with him in the hall for five or ten minutes till Mr Dodsworth came in—during that time I had an opportunity of seeing his person—I am sure he is the man—when Mr Dodsworth came in I in the prisoner s hearing told Mr Dodsworth what Norman told me—I told him there was a man in the hall who had brought a box from Mr Stewart M Kenzie for Lord Stanley and it came to 3l 5s 4d —Mr Dodsworth said he would go down and get the

Custom-house in Thames-street on the 1st of January—I saw the prisoner in the row on the pavement and Norman saw him too—she said That is the man —she said afterwards that she should rather see him with his hat off—I took him into the Custom-house he was desired to take his hat off and she said that was the man—he wanted to know what it was about—I said it was a parcel delivered to Lord Stanley on the 27th of December and a demand of 3l 5s 4d was made on it—I had the papers in my hand and showed them to him—he said he knew nothing about them—I said the parcel had been brought to No 13 Downing-street for Lord Stanley—he said he was not the man he was at the Ship public-house tap in Water-lane playing at cards from five o clock till twelve and he could bring the landlord and other persons to prove that be was there and he had not been to the Colonial-office—I took him to the Colonial-office and there the other servant said he was the man—the prisoner denied it—he denied having been there or knowing where the Colonial-office was—he said he had never been there in his life and did not know where it was—at Bow-street he told the Magistrate he could bring the landlord and other witnesses to prove he was at the Ship from five till twelve—the Magistrate gave him from then till Wednesday to bring witnesses—he called for a number of witnesses but no one appeared and he was committed—when I took him I found three of these commercial steam-packet bills at his house the same as the one he left at the Colonial-office with L S on it Cross-examined Q These are common papers to state the time the vessels sail and are given to the public A I believe they are—the Ship tap is near the Custom-house—the prisoner said Go with me to the Ship and the landlord will tell you the

the man—he then wanted to go to the Ship but I did not take him—the inspector asked where he lived and he said in the front-parlour at No 6 Rose-court—the inspector wrote it down on a paper and gave it me—I went and found the prisoner s wife and family there—I found these papers in a chest of drawers not locked—I believe there were bills of other steam companies there THOMAS PORTER I am coachman to Lady Hope who lives in Park-street Westminster I know her ladyship is very intimately acquainted with Mrs Stewart M Kenzie—on the 27th of December about twenty minutes past seven o clock the prisoner came to Lady Hope s with a box—I do not know whether it was packed up in matting or not—he said he brought it from the Adelaide Hotel London-bridge—he said it contained a handsome chandelier for the Honourable Mrs Stewart a friend of Lady Hope—I said it could not be there but that her ladyship took parcels for the Honourable Mrs Stewart M Kenzie—the prisoner then said That is the name

said No —the gentleman then said Is it Havre —he said Yes —Lady Hope said he might leave the box and she would write to Lady Stewart M Kenzie and if it was right he might have the 3l 5s 4d for the carriage—he said he could not leave the box—he was going when the gentleman said If you go to Lord Stanley s the Colonial-office you will there find the proper address of the Honourable Stewart M Kenzie —Lady Hope then called him back and said Stop I can give you the address of the Honourable Mrs M Kenzie myself and her ladyship wrote the direction which has been produced—I saw her write it and give it to him—I have not the least doubt that he is the person Cross-examined Q You were not before the Magistrate A I was not—I had never seen the prisoner before that night—be was there five or six minutes—there is no light in the front-hall—there are two lamps in the dining-room and the prisoner was just inside the door—there were Lady Hope and another lady and two gentlemen there at dinner—the prisoner was dressed nearly the same as he is now he had a pilot-coat on buttoned but not all the way up WILLIAM RIVETT I keep the Ship tap in Water-lane I was at borne on boxing-day the 27th of December—I have no recollection of seeing the prisoner there that night from five till twelve o clock—I knew him before and if he had been there so long a time that night playing at cards and drinking I should have known it Cross-examined Q Will you swear he was not there between seven and nine o clock A I will not—I remember a 6d being given to my potboy but I do not know what night it was—I will not swear it was not that night—I will not swear the prisoner was not there at ail that night—I recollect he gave the boy a Christmas-box—he put it in the box—I do not know what day it was—I will not swear it was not that day MR CLARKSON Q Was this man in your house A I do not recollect—I did not state he was not there JOSEPH BURKS I am in the habit of frequenting the Ship tap in Water-lane—I was there on the 27th of December from half-past four till twelve o clock—I know the prisoner perfectly well—he was not there during those hours Cross-examined Q Do you mean to swear he was not there at all that evening A He was not—I was there the whole evening—I had my dinner there about four o clock and staid there doing nothing till near twelve—I am an interpreter—I was sitting there with friends—there were several passed in and out—I was at the tap—a person named Thompson was there and Lockwood Cook and James Page Q Will you swear that Lockwood did not come in and have a glass of ale that the prisoner paid for A I will not swear that nor that James Page did not have two half-pints of beer that the prisoner paid for nor that Thompson did not have ale that the prisoner paid for—I have frequently seen the prisoner at that house and on several nights before and after that night Q How can you swear he was not there that particular night A I am certain of it because on that particular day there came a Frenchman to me at the Custom-house who had lost a case in a cab—I recollect the whole day by that—the Frenchman came to me about three o clock in the afternoon—I was not hunting about with him in the evening—I do not remember the prisoner giving a 6d to the pot-boy as a Christmas-box that night—I swear it did not take place—I was not drinking all that time—I did not drink gin and water with the prisoner—I drank with several persons but not with him—I was subpoenaed here by Mr Humphreys—they found me at the Custom-house—I had not seen the policeman before Mr Humphreys subpoenaed me—I cannot say whether the prisoner was at the Ship on the following night or not MR CLARKSON Q Is it your habit to wait at the Ship tap to give assistance to foreigners who come to the Custom-house A Yes BENJAMIN BUTCHER I am stable-man at the Custom-house liverystables—I knew the prisoner by sight On the 27th of December I was at the stable—the prisoner came there and asked my consent to allow him to nail a mat on a box—I gave him my consent and lent him a hammer it was a mat similar to this which is here—it was between five and six o clock Cross-examined Q Where was it he did this A Close by my door in the open place—all I saw was his nailing a mat on a box—it was inside the gateway—the prisoner did not bring the box nor take it away—the person who did bring it was a perfect stranger to me JAMES RICHARD NAYLOR I attend from the Crown-office—the title of Mr M Kenzie is Lord Commissioner of the Ionian Islands—I have an extract from the book—it is a minute or docket-book in which every patent passing the Great Seal is entered and it is kept in the Crownoffice Cross-examined Q Is that considered as correct A It has often been proved in the House of Lords—I have not the book here but I have a copy of it—it is a public document—it is a minute-book—it is not on parchment—I make the minute and then the patent is made—the book is not always produced—I brought this merely to give evidence that Mr Stewart M Kenzie is the High Commissioner of the Ionian Islands—when a patent passes the Great Seal a docket is sent to the Chancellor and a copy of that is entered in the book—I have never taken a copy from that book into a court of justice before—I have often taken the book—I call it a public record because it belongs to the Crown-office and is there for public inspection on payment of a fee—when it has been required the book has been taken MR CLARKSON Q While you were here the book may be demanded to be seen A Yes—the names which appear here are

that department thirty-two years—I reside at Sydenham in Kent I was an acquaintance of Mr and Mrs Snow s of Portland-place—I have been an old friend of the Snow family many years—I visited Mr and Mrs Snow at Portland-place—we were on very intimate terms—my daughters also visited there—in December last I had heard that unpleasant differences had caused a separation between them—on the 18th of December the prisoner came to the War-office—I had never seen him before to my knowledge—he introduced himself as Baron de Behr—I had never heard that name or title before to my recollection—be gave me his card with that name printed on it—he said he came to me from Mrs Snow as her friend—he supposed I had heard what had happened—I told him I knew nothing but I was very anxious to hear—he said there was some letters in Portland-place which Mrs Snow was particularly anxious to have—that he could obtain those letters through the housekeeper whom he had seen—they were to be obtained through bribing the housekeeper—that she must be bribed by either 300l or 500l —I cannot exactly swear which he mentioned—I said I would have nothing to do with the letters—he then said it would be very unkind to her as she wished particularly to have them and as she had no money I must assist her—he asked if I could not advance 500l —I said Decidedly no I had it not —he then said 250l —I said I had it not—he then said What can you advance —I replied Perhaps I could find 50l — he had said before that he had advanced all he had in Mrs Snow s service—130l was mentioned—he said he had advanced 130l of his own —I then got five 10l notes and gave them to him—he then left saying he would go immediately to the housekeeper—I parted with the five 10l notes from a belief of what he told me—I took no security or acknowledgment—he did not offer me any—the 18th was on a Saturday—he came to me again on the following Monday the 20th at the War-office and said the house keeper was not satisfied and must have more—I told him I had not more to spare—he said You must find 50l more to serve your friend —after some hesitation I gave him 50l more two 10l notes five 5l notes and five sovereigns—he said striking his breast You may trust a nobleman and a man of honour and that he would procure the letters that day—I saw him again some days after—he called several times—I cannot remember any particular day and he told me all the letters were safe that he had procured them—he came to the War-office on the 30th of December and said again that he had come from Mrs Snow that she was distressed for money and I must advance her some for her own private use—I said he had taken all I had—he then proposed drawing a bill of exchange for 160l —I told him I did not understand bill transactions and declined to do it—he eventually persuaded me to accept the bill—he said it would be extremely unkind to Mrs Snow who looked to me to assist her—in the belief that that was true I consented to accept the bill—he produced the stamp—he went and fetched the stamp and the bill was then drawn JOSEPH EHN I am clerk to the solicitor for the prosecution I served a notice of which this is a copy on the prisoner in Newgate four or five days ago— the notice being read was to the defendant and his attorney to produce five 10l notes two other 10l notes five 5l notes and a bill of exchange for 160l MR RICH continued I wrote my name on the bill MR CHARNOCK for the defendant Q Have not you seen that bill in the possession of a third party since A I have—it was not in the prisoner s hand—a stranger to me came with it and asked if it was my signature—I said Yes —this was about the 5th or 6th of January at the War-office—nobody was present—he did not give me his card or his name—he did not say why he asked me—the prisoner had told me a person would call—he merely asked if it was my signature and if it would be paid when it became due—he did not say his object was to discount it that I remember but that was my impression as the prisoner had told me his banker would discount it—the gentleman did not mention Cassiday or any name MR BODKIN Q How soon was that after the prisoner told you somebody would come A Three or four days—I accepted that bill—it was for 160l at three months date drawn by the prisoner—I accepted it payable at Drummond s my banker s to the order of the drawer Q What induced you to part with the second 50l A His saying the housekeeper was not satisfied with the first 50l —I accepted and parted with the bill of exchange because the prisoner told me it was for Mrs Snow s private use and she was in great distress believing her from his representation to be in great distress—on the day I accepted the bill lie said Make your mind easy I shall be in the receipt of money at the beginning of January and I will give you an undertaking to repay you the 160l —he gave me an undertaking in writing—he undertook to pay it between the 6th and 10th of January—this is the paper he gave me— read — I hereby acknowledge to have received of Mr O Rich of the War-office a bill of exchange for the amount of 160l drawn by myself and accepted by him which I promise to provide for when it becomes due The bill is at three months date from this day London December 30 1841 DE BEHR Cross-examined by MR CHARNOCK Q Be kind enough to look at that letter marked A do you know it A

day of January 1842 by the attorney of the prisoner —T J HALL — War-office Wednesday January 1841 four o clock Baron —You used me ill and so you would think of me if I made promises which I did not perform punctually you have more than once failed in your engagements without any satisfactory reason you have represented yourself as a nobleman and a man of honour as such I have treated you and as such I wish to consider you A man of honour I always thought was punctual to his engagements and more especially in money matters You who can command so many thousands cannot have any difficulty in returning me according to your promise the sum of money you obtained from me for your temporary ac- commodation which sum is to me a very large one although a trifling one to you You would have heard news to-day if you had kept your word of honour as a nobleman and come here to settle with me according to your promise which you ought to have done on Monday and failing in that you were more bound to fulfil your promise of coming here for that purpose to-day —I am Baron your obedient servant W O RICH P S If you wish all the circumstances to be made public I have no objection the public may call me a fool which perhaps you have thought me but it will do me justice and be satisfied I have done nothing in the business at all dishonourable My son says you have obtained about 16s from him MR BODKIN Q Will you explain under what circumstances you wrote that letter A On the 17th of January the prisoner had promised to call and pay me the money—he did not call but on that day I taw Mr Kinnerston Mrs Snow s father who made a statement to me and I told him something—in consequence of the conversation between us I suspected the prisoner—on Wednesday the 19th I again saw Mr Kinnerston and after seeing him I wrote that letter MR CHARNOCK Q In what department of the War-office are you A In the accountant department—I am well acquainted with figures—they require great accuracy—I have been in that department the greater part of the time I have been there and from time to time have been promoted—I never saw the prisoner before the 18th of December to my knowledge—I do not know a Mr Squire a stock-broker—I never had any dealings or transactions with the prisoner before the 18th of December not any connected in any manner with the War-office that I recollect—I had not made arrangements with the prisoner to give him certain information—I have not given him certain information connected with the War-office that I recollect—I do not recollect his making any inquiry about the office—he might have done to in conversation but I have no recollection of what passed if he did mention the subject—I have never supplied him with copies of papers out of the War-office—I never met the prisoner at the West-end of the town in company with Mr Squire—Mrs Snow is now residing with her father in Arlington-street—I do not know how long she has resided there—I have not visited her at her father s—I last visited her in March last in Portland-place—I visited Mr Snow—I have corresponded with Mrs Snow since then and Mrs Snow with me—my letters to her were sent by post—I might occasionally have sent them by private hand by a servant or otherwise I believe I have—my acquaintance with Mrs Snow commenced after her marriage which took place about ten years ago—I have not corresponded with her from that time down to the present—I ceased to correspond with her to the best of my recollection the beginning of last December—I have not written to her since last December nor received letters from her that I recollect—they left town last March or April—I do not know that they are not living together—I have seen Mrs Snow during my attendance at this Court—they were abroad at the time and I do not know when the separation took place—I do not know it from Mrs Snow—I know that she is now separated from her husband and that they are not living together Q Why did you cease to correspond with Mrs Snow A By her desire—my letters to her were frequent at times—it is quite impossible X can state what number—I have no idea—sometimes they were ten a month and sometimes not one a month—twenty a month is a good deal more than I can swear to—I cannot swear as to fifteen—I wrote a great many Q Were you ever with Mr De Behr at Long s Hotel A yes—on Monday the 20th of December he invited me to dine with him—I did dine with him—I went with him there COURT Q Was that before or after he got the second 50l A After MR CHARNOCK Q What time in the day was the transaction about the second 50l A About twelve o clock I think or between twelve and one—he invited me to dine and I consented to do so—we had a very good dinner and plenty of wine—it was not a particularly merry affair—I do not remember any particular conversation that took place Q Why was not Mrs Snow the main stay of your conversation A Part of the time—we talked chiefly on that subject—I believe the express object of the dinner was to talk about Mrs Snow Q Did you or not on that occasion express great anxiety about the letters you had written to Mrs Snow A I should say not—I expressed anxiety for her—I did not express anxiety about my letters for I remember saying to the prisoner So far as I am concerned I don t care that for the letters snapping his fingers —the letters were the subject of conversation so far as to say that—I certainly did not say that I would not for all the world that any of those letters should fall into the hands of Mr Snow—no one was present at the dinner—the letters described by the prisoner were from me and others Q Were you anxious to get up your own letters and the letters of other persons A Only by the prisoner telling me that Mrs Snow wished for them—I was anxious only from what the prisoner said that Mrs Snow was anxious Q Were you not anxious that the letters should not fall into the hands of Mr Snow A Merely from that circumstance—I cannot positively say what time the dinner at Long s broke up but I believe it was about ten o clock—it began about seven—I think I saw the prisoner between the 20th and 30th of December but I cannot say positively—he called on me several times at the office but I do not remember any particular date—he came over to my house at Sydenham on Sunday the 2nd of January—he did not come there by invitation that I swear—I was not apprised of his intended visit—I do not know exactly at what time he came but it was before I returned home from church—I found him there on my return from church—he dined with me on that occasion—I dined between the morning and evening services and he partook of my dinner—I have been a widower between fourteen and fifteen years—my family consists of two daughters and a son—the prisoner had introduced himself to them before I came home—I think he left about three o clock or between three and four—Mrs Snow was the subject of our conversation on that occasion—I have no recollection of the next time I saw the prisoner but he called on me at the office—he came to Sydenham twice—the second time was on the 16th of January—he dined with me and my family then Q Now did you on that or any other occasion desire the prisoner to wait on Mr Snow A I did not not for any purpose whatever—he told me he was frequently in the habit of seeing Mrs Snow—I did not on any occasion direct the prisoner to wait on Mr Snow relative to some provision for Mrs Snow—my son did not on any occasion accompany the prisoner any where to my knowledge—I have heard my son say he had once been with the prisoner—I believe my son is not here MR BODKIN Q What is your age A Fifty-three—my eldest daughter is twenty-one and the other seventeen—some short time since I lost a daughter and on that occasion Mrs Snow attended her and behaved very kindly to her—she was with her just before she died Q About this dinner at Long s was Long s the first house that was mentioned or were you to have dined together at another house A The prisoner desired me to meet him at the Golden Cross Charing-cross—I did not know where we were to dine—when I got to the Golden Cross the prisoner came out—we got into a hack cab and drove to Long s hotel—he gave me no reason for that—he ordered the dinner—we had a good deal of wine after dinner—there was champagne—the prisoner paid for the dinner—I did not see either of my own notes changed ELIZABETH DIXON In January last I was housekeeper to Mr Snow who lived at No 72 Portland-place—the establishment was broken up which was the cause of my leaving—I know the prisoner—he was introduced to me by my sister last September— Mr and Mrs Snow were then abroad —we were intimate friends—he several times asked me to marry him—he represented himself as the Secretary for Foreign Affairs and he showed me some letters—we never conversed at all with respect to my master and mistress—just after Mr Snow returned home the prisoner asked me why Mrs Snow was not returned COURT Q Did you let him into the unhappy differences that were supposed to exist A No I did not MR PHILLIPS Q In the course of your conversation was the name of Mr Rich mentioned at all A Yes on one occasion—I never instructed the prisoner to get money in order to bribe me to give up letters of Mr Rich s—I never asked him for money—I never proposed to deliver up any letters in case money was given me for them neither letters of Mr Rich s or anybody else—I never received 50l from the prisoner or any sum whatever on the condition of giving up letters belonging to Mr Rich or anybody else—I never had any conversation whatever with the prisoner on the subject of letters in my possession which I was to give up for money—I never told him I was not satisfied with a sum of money that was offered—letters were never mentioned between us—he never offered me anything—I never received 50l from him for certain letters nor did he ever offer me 50l for certain letters—I never said I was not satisfied with 50l or with the money and that I must have more—I never had any conversation of that kind with the prisoner COURT Q Did he ever propose to you to give you a sum of money to deliver up letters in your possession A No—I never represented to him that I had letters addressed to Mrs Snow in my possession—I never said that I was not satisfied with the money nor that I wanted more money nor that I wanted any money to deliver up any letters—I never represented that there were letters of consequence to Mrs Snow in Portland-place which could be obtained by bribing me Q Had you any such letters in your possession A There were letters of Mrs Snow s in my possession I mean letters belonging to Mrs Snow—the prisoner never had any opportunity of knowing that fact from me—he never asked me any question about any letters—my sister was not aware that I had got any letters MRS GEORGINA SNOW I am the wife of Mr Robert Snow I have been married ten years last January—I have two children living—I resided in Portland-place—I left England with Mr Snow the Utter end of June last before that I had been staying with Mr Snow at Twickenham—I think I went to Twickenham in the latter end of March as well as I can remember—Mr Snow and I have not lived happily together for some time—while we were on the Continent those differences resulted in our separation—Mr Snow came to England in November last leaving me in Paris—one of my brothers came to Paris and brought me to England—I am now living at my father s house in Arlington-street—I have known Mr Rich of the War-office for several years—he has been on intimate terms with my husband and myself and his daughters also—I remember seeing the prisoner when he was brought before the Magistrate on this charge—I had never to my knowledge seen him in my life before that time—I never authorized or requested him to make any application to Mr Rich for money to procure letters from my housekeeper—I never authorized him to make any application to Mr Rich for money on my account under any pretence whatever—I never sent him to Mr Rich as my friend—I never had any conversation with him in my life Cross-examined Q I believe you say Mr Rich was acquainted with yourself and Mr Snow A Yes he was acquainted with me soon after I married—he is an old friend of Mr Snow s family—I was in the habit of writing to Mr Rich and of receiving answers often—I cannot exactly say how often not very often—perhaps oftener than once a month it might be five times a month—about three times a month I suppose within the last three years—it might have been oftener yes perhaps it was sometimes—never ten times a month I should say—I will not say I never received ten letters in a particular month—I dare say I have received and answered ten letters in one month—they came directed to me by post and sometimes his daughter brought them when she came to see me Q Have you those letters by you A Some of them were left in Portland-place and others are destroyed—those that were left in Portland-place were locked up in a drawer the key of which was left with Mrs Snow Mr Snow s mother in Saville-row—there were other letters and odd papers in a basket of no importance which were also locked up and the key of that place was in Saville-row—they were left in Saville-row under the care of Mrs Snow when I went abroad—I am not aware that there were any other letters besides those two parcels which I have referred to Q Why were some of those letters destroyed A I do not know—I destroyed them as soon as I read them—there were no letters in the hands of any other person in the house that I am aware of—I have written to Mrs Dixon the housekeeper—I am not aware that Mrs Dixon had any letters of mine—I did not correspond with Mrs Dixon Q Did not you write from the Continent to Mrs Dixon A Mr Snow wrote once and I wrote from Paris once to tell her that Mr Snow was coming home—I never corresponded with Mrs Dixon on any other occasion—Mr Snow wrote I believe—I never did Q Had you been in Paris before this visit that you took with Mr Snow A Yes several years ago—I was not there by myself I was with my father—I was there about two months about seven years ago—I did not go into society at all and made no Parisian acquaintances—on the last occasion I was in Paris about three weeks I think or not quite so much—I have only been in Paris twice since I married—I was not educated in Paris—I have been a good deal abroad—when I was in Paris last I did not keep much company—I went to visit some friends of my father s in the country some distance from Paris near Versailles—Mr Snow did not accompany me—he was in England Q How long did you remain in Paris after Mr Snow quitted A Not quite a fortnight—I resided during that fortnight at an hotel in the Area di Rivoli—I did not reside there all the six weeks—I had previously resided at the hotel Maurice but Mr Snow wished roe to move to the other hotel—he took apartments there for me before he left Paris—I never saw the prisoner till the day I appeared before the Magistrate—that is correct—I never saw him in Paris nor in any part of England—I never met him at Dulwich—I spent eight or nine years on the Continent before I married—I have never by letter or otherwise received any presents from the prisoner not within the last twelve months or two years—I never received a ring with a ruby—there are some proceedings going on at this time between Mr Snow and myself in the Ecclesiastical Court MR BODKIN Q I believe those proceedings have been instituted by yourself A Yes I am the complaining party—my former visit to Paris was about the period when I lost one of my children—that is seven years ago—I was accompanied from Paris on the last occasion by my eldest brother not the one who is head-master of St Paul s school—I was very unwell while I was staying at my brother s house at St Paul s which was when I first arrived on the 8th of December—I went straight to my brother s house and remained there till the 51st of December—I was very ill indeed from the 13th—I was taken ill on the 13th and remained very ill until I left on the

t18421128-61  61 JAMES MOLAND alias Leeson HENRY RUGG GEORGE NATHANIEL STEPHENS THOMAS MORRIS and FRANCES RUGG were indicted for a misdemeanor MR ATTORNEY GENERAL MESSRS ADOLPHUS WADDINGTON and GUENEY conducted the Prosecution FREDERICK REED a clerk in the Report Office of the Court of Chancery produced a petition of Frances Rugg Christopher James Rugg George Nathaniel Stephens and Mary Ann his wife Henry Rugg and John Peter Fowler dated 21st of Dec 1840 praying the Master to inquire whether the said Christopher James Rugg Henry Rugg and Mary Ann Stephens were three of Frances Rugg s children and what share of 1 113l 10s 8d in the Court of Chancery in which Frances Rugg had a life interest they were entitled to and praying that the same might be sold out and after payment of the expenses and what was due to Fowler the residue might be divided between the said three children —also the original entry of an order of reference to the Master dated 24th of Dec 1841 and also the Report of the Master Sir William Home upon the same dated 6th of March 1841 Also a second petition of Frances Rugg Christopher James Rugg Henry Rugg Stephens and his wife dated Sth of March 1841 praying that three-sixths of the money might be sold out and after deducting the costs that 40l might be paid to Christopher James Rugg 20l to Henry Rugg a moiety of the residue to Frances Rugg and the other moiety to Stephens in right of his wife —and the official entry of an order made on that petition on the 9th of March 1841 STAFFORD MOORE COOPER I am a solicitor practising in the Court of Chancery and live at No 9 Old Cavendish-street I know the prisoner—I first saw Frances Rugg Stephens and Henry Rugg—they came to my office together in March 1839—they consulted me on legal matters respecting a suit in Chancery of Rugg against Palmer and gave me instructions what to do for them in that suit—they were all in company together—I think Stephens was the person that principally spoke—they each heard what the other said—they all gave me instructions and they signed a retainer which is annexed to the affidavit made by Frances Rugg—that retainer contained the instructions given to me—it was deposited and filed in the Affidavit-office of the Court of Chancery—there was no written retainer given me on the first occasion—it was given me on the 15th of Dec 1840 EDWARD BRUNTON clerk in the Affidavit-office in the Court of Chancery here produced an affidavit of Frances Rugg with two retainers annexed MR COOPER continued These retainers were to authorize me to present a petition—this is signed by Frances Rugg but not in my presence—it was brought to me by Stephens on the 15th of Dec —I do not think she was present at the time—it was after she had been to me with Stephens—I know her writing—this is her signature—this other is signed by Henry Rugg—I did not see him sign it—Stephens brought it to me on the same occasion as the other—they are both on the same piece of paper—I have seen Henry Rugg write and I believe this to be his handwriting—Stephens also brought me a third retainer at the same time purporting to be signed by Christopher James Rugg—that is on the same piece of paper—I have seen Moland write and believe this signature to be his writing—they are both signed by Frances Rugg and I believe both signatures to be her handwriting — These retainers were dated the 15th of Dec 1840 signed by Christopher James Rugg and Henry Rugg authorising Mr Cooper to present the petition for the purpose of getting the shares of 40l and 20l which their mother had agreed to give them and were both signed by Frances Rugg The affidavit of Frances Rugg stated that she and her children were fully aware of the nature of the prayer of the petition and that she was willing the money should be sold out and divided as therein stated —I had never seen Moland before the 15th of Dec —he came that day with Stephens and Frances Rugg and I think Henry Rugg but I am not certain—it was on the occasion when the retainers were given to me—Stephens introduced him to me—Stephens had been to me the evening before and had some conversation with me—he brought the retainers in the morning—he came twice oo that day—in consequence of these retainers I presented the two petitions—I saw Stephens and Frances Rugg from time lo time while this matter was going on—I do not think I saw Moland between the time of presenting the petitions and the order being made except on the 23rd of Dec the day the petitions were heard when he was in court—I first saw Morris after the hearing of the first petition—he came to me I believe with Stephens and Frances Rugg—it is some time ago—I only speak to the best of my recollection—I believe they came but I will not be positive—I know Morris did not come alone—I am certain Stephens was with him—I cannot speak with certainty of anybody else—Stephens brought him in reference to the causc of Rugg and Palmer—Morris made an affidavit in support of the Master s report—it was made in the Master s office in order to lay grounds for the Master s report WILLIAM BROVEAUX YULE clerk in the office of Sir William Home produced a joint affidavit of Frances Rugg and Thomas Morris sworn on the 9th of Feb 1841 in which Frances Rugg deposed to marrying James Rugg on the 15th of Oct 1803 to his death on the 9th of Feb 1835 to the birth of Christopher James Rugg on the 13th of Dec 1806 and seven other children naming them and Thomas Morris deposed that he had known James and Frances Rugg nearly forty yean that he had read over the above affidavit of Frances Rugg together with the several certificates of birth &c annexed and that he verily believed the eight children therein named to be her lawful children MR COOPER re-examined On the 6th of March 1841 the Master made his report in pursuance of which I presented a second petition to the Master of the Rolls on the 8th of March for the division of the money that three-sixths of it should be sold out and paid out of court—I have the original order of the Master of the Rolls upon which I acted—it was delivered out to me by the officer of the court — This order directed the money to be paid agreeable to the petition after payment of arrears due to Fowler —Fowler had advanced money on this fund—I made an affidavit verifying the sums that were to be paid—I ufterwards attended at the office of the Accountant-General on the 3rd of April to receive the money in pursuance of that order—all the prisoners were with me on that occasion except Morris—I had informed them a day or two previously at my office what they were to go there for—they-met me there by appointment—I do not know that they all came to my office— some of them came for the purpose of ascertaining when ttie money would be received—I do not recollect seeing Morris after his making the affidavit except on the hearing of the petition—I think he was in cettrt when both the petitions were heard—I am not quite certain of it—I believe they were all there—I am nearly certain of it—to the best of my belief I saw him there—I cannot say beyond that—each of the prisoners except Morris signed the receipts for the cheques according to tht earns mentioned is the order—that was signed in a book produced by the clerk there—I was a witness to them GEORGE KITSON I am chief clerk in one of the divisions of the Accountant-General s office from the letter R to the letter Z His name is William Russell—it is the practice in the Accountant-General s office for the parties who are to receive cheques for money under an order of the Court of Chancery to sign their names in a book—I produce the receipt-book embracing the 3rd of April 1841—here are receipts signed by Christopher James Rugg Henry Rugg Frances Rugg and George Nathaniel Stephens in the cause of Rugg against Palmer witnessed by Mr Cooper—I do not remember the person of Christopher James Rugg—I remember the fact of a person signing in that name and upon his doing so I gave him ft cheque for 40l on the Bank of England signed by the Accountant-Greneral—I also gave separate cheques to each of the other persons for the amounts for which they had receipts—that cheque would not have been given to the person who signed himself Christopher James Rugg unless he had signed that name SAMUEL JAMES SMYTH clerk in the Chancery-office in the Bank of England produced a cheque for 40l drawn in the name of Christopher James Ragg also signed William Russell endorsed Christopher James Ragg and witnessed by S M Cooper MR KITSON re-examined This is the cheqae which I gave on that occation and this is Mr Russell s signature MR COOPER re-exammed I am the subscribing witness td this receipt—The prisoner Moland signed it in the name of Christopher James Ragg—the other prisoners were present at the time except Morris—they saw him sign it—they were quite close—they signed their receipts in the same book—I also witnessed those—I saw Mr Kitson hand the cheques to the prisoners—they gave them to me—I get them entered according to the rule of the office and then paid them into my banker s got the money end paid it to the prisoners the same day—I paid 40l to Moland and paid to each the share for which they signed deducting my costs from the larger shares of Frances Rugg and Stephens Cross-examined by MR BALLANTTNB Q Who was It introduced Stephens to you originally A A person named Roberts of Dean-street finsbury—at that 1 time I had a temporary clerk named James Price who occasionally acted in my business—he had authority from me occasionally to act in this business—he went to procure the certificates—he bed no general authority only on one particular oecasion—he was not constantly at toy office—he was there for a few days only during these proceedings at the end of Nov 1840 or the beginning of Dec —he left me about that time—he was not at all In my employ as clerk after that—I did not send him to the prisoners at all—I only instructed him to make search for the certificates MR KITSON Cross-examined by MR BALLAHTINE Q Is it your duty to pay the accounts that are ordered to be paid by the Court of Chaneery as the result of certain legal proceedings A Yes to give the cheques—I ascertain the names of the parties to whom I am to give the cheques from the solicitor who brings the parties—that is merely to identify them as the person in the suit entitled to receive the money—that is all I take from the solicitor and that is all I require from the parties themselves—an order of the Court is first left with us that specifies particular names and when a person is identified as the party named in that order I pay him the money—I read the order and then draw the cheque to whom the order says it is to be paid—the Accountant-general signs the cheque after it is drawn—the identity of the person with the name mentioned in the order is all that I am called upon to inquire into and on the faith of that I pay the cheque—I should no have paid the cheque in question to any one who did not bear the name of Christopher James Rugg MR ATTORNEY-GENERAL Q You say you rely on the solicitor for bringing the right party A Yes I always require the party to sign the receipt—if he had not signed that receipt in the name mentioned in the order I should not have given him the cheque GEORGE BIRCH I am a master wine-porter in the London Docks I have known the prisoner Moland upwards of five years—he has worked under me in the docks nearly the whole of that time—I always knew him by the name of James Leeson and never by any other—he continued working at the docks until the 8th of September last BENJAMIN LEESON I live at No 4 Parliament-street Cambridge-road The prisoner Moland is my half

name of Leeson Crou-examined by MR BALLANTINS Q How old was be when you first knew anything about him A About a week—he is my younger brother the last my mother had—I was in England at the time of his birth living with my mother in St James s parish—I went to sea when he was about twelve months old and returned in the year of the Peace—I cannot tell what year it was—I was only a boy when I went—I had been in St James s-school—his father came and fetched me home to go and see my mother when she was lying ill—I was at sea about four years and three quarters—I saw the prisoner I believe the morning after I returned—he was living at my mother s house—I think he was older than five years and a half—he was not fourteen or fifteen or ten or twelve—if I had met him away from my mother s house I should not have recognized him for the moment not till I received some information on the subject—I go by what my mother said MR ATTORNEY-GENERAL Q When was it you returned A In the year 1814—he was then a boy—he was living at my grandfather s place—my mother was in the hospital at the time and when she came out she lived with her father and ray brother continued to live with them till he was able to do something—we have been pretty well all together since the Peace—I have been in the habit of seeing him constantly from time to time since down to 1842—I never heard of his being the son of Frances Rugg or of his having any connexion with the Rugg family at all—I never knew him go by the name of Christopher James Rugg—I always knew him by the name of James Moland—he has worked in different places and situations in the waitering line from time to time since I cannot exactly say where attending at dinners—there has never been a year without my seeing him—I am quite certain he is the person who at the Peace was living as my mother s son EBENEZER LEESON I am a younger brother of last witness—my mother married a person named Moland after we were born—the prisoner Moland is my half-brother—I always knew him by the name of James Moland—I am forty-one years of age—I have known him as my half-brother ever since he was eight or nine years old—I was at sea at the time of his birth I returned in the year of the Peace 1814 and found him at home living as one of the family—he was then about eight or nine years old—I have known him ever since—he has always passed in the family as my half-brother—I never heard of his being the son of Frances Rugg or of his bearing the name of Christopher James Rugg—I never knew him in any other character than as my half-brother COURT Q Do you know the family of the Ruggs at all A Not at all—he has always been received by all the family as my half-brother and has always been treated as such Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q I believe you likewise went to sea A I did—that was before the prisoner s birth—I was at sea about four years—I cannot exactly say COURT Q You say he was born after you went to sea is that so A No—I said that I had known him after I came from sea—when I came home I came to my grandfather s and my mother s who was then living at No 43 Church-street Mile-end New-town—I cannot exactly say what age be was—I was at St James s parish School of Industry when be was born—I was there from a child—I was not living with him so as to be acquainted with him till after my return from sea MR BALLANTINE Q I believe your mother has a sister still living has the not A No—I have no aunt JAMES SAMUEL GASTRELL I am a turner and live at No 8 Jubilee-street Mile-end-road I have known Morris about nine years as next door neighbour to me—I also know Stephens and Moland but not by name—I never beard his name—Stephens came to live at Morris s about three years ago—I have known Moland about four or five years by seeing him come backwards and forwards—they used to call him the black woman s husband—he married a black woman—I have seen them all three together but only seldom—Stephens and Morris lived in the same house—Stephens was Morris s lodger and I have seen Moland come backwards and forwards to speak to Morris and to buy shoes—I have been in company with Morris a number of times as a neighbour and a friend—they never said anything to me about any property that they were entitled to—I have heard that Stephens had some property coming to his wife—Morris and his wife have told me so and of Moland having property coming to him JAMES PRICE I am a hosier by trade From Dec 1840 to the beginning of Jan 1841 I was employed by Mr Cooper to search for the certificates of baptism and so on relating to the cause of Rugg against Palmer—in consequence of that I became acquainted with Stephens and I knew all the prisoners before the settlement of the business—I knew Moland by the name of Christopher James Rugg—Stephens introduced him to me by that name—that was very near on the settlement of the business—I was at Morris s house in Jubilee-street with Stephens and Morris waiting for Christopher James Rugg to come to go up to Mr Cooper and he came in alone—Stephens had called on me wishing me to go with him up to Mr Cooper s as the business was being drawn to a conclusion—I was not in Mr Cooper s employment then—I was only employed by Mr Cooper to get the certificates—I left him on the 20th of January—it was I think in February that I was waiting at Morris s—there were two or three appointments before the matter was settled—I had at that time obtained the certificates as far as I was able—when Moland came in Stephens introduced him to me as Christopher James Rugg the party who was getting the money—he said he was a sailor just come from abroad—Morris was present but did not interfere in the conversation—it was to Stephens my attention was particularly directed—Morris was fn the shop—he distinctly heard all this and did not contradict it—we then all went together to Mr Cooper s—Morris went with me to Mr Cooper s on one occasion Q Did you afterwards learn from either Stephens or Morris any thing about Christopher James Rugg s share A Yes I knew about the share from having seen the papers during the time of my being employed—both Stephens and Moland talked to me about the share after that—there were two or three appointments to Fettle it and Moland was always there—I was always advised when to meet him—the principal cause of my being there was on account of an agreement that I prepared—Moland always said he was entitled to the money and that be was Christopher James Rugg—Stephens called on me and wished me to meet them in Southampton-buildings Chancery-lane—that was about the latter end of Feb 1841 a month or six weeks before they received the money while the matter was going on—I went and met them by appointment in Southampton-buildings and Henry Rugg was there Stephens and a person named William Bedford—Stephens and Henry Rugg said they had bought Bedford s share and asked if I would prepare an agreement for them for the sale of it—I said I would and if I could not do it I would get some friend of mine to do it for me—some months afterwards I called on Morris after I had been able to form some opinion as to who Christopher James Rugg was—it was on the 7th or 8th of April four days after the receipt of the money I met him down at the Mile End-gate—he had got a bad black eye at the time—I asked him about it and he said that he and Stephens had had a quarrel on the Saturday night on the settlement—I said What did you get by it —he said all he had got was 8l out of which he had paid his rent and two or three little things but that he had sufficient to pay for a pint or two of beer and asked me to go and partake of it—we went to a beer-shop—I was fetched out in a great hurry by Stephens s wife and a black woman who I did not know at the time but she was introduced to me that morning as Christopher Rugg s wife—Mrs Stephens and this woman took me to a house where Moland and Stephens were—I have only seen that woman in Moland s company twice—I have seen her alone in my own neighbourhood—I called on Morris in the beginning of August last to ask if he could tell me where Stephens lived—in the course of conversation I said that he knew Moland s name was not Christopher James Rugg any more than mine was—he said I know that —I said Well Morris now then what is his name he said Why he goes by two or three different names —I saw Henry Rugg that same morning previous to going to Morris—I called on him relative to the agreement I had prepared relating to another share—in the course of conversation I asked him how Chris was—he said he was dead—I said Dead how long has he been dead —he said About three months —I said it was the first J had heard of it—this was from the 3rd to the 10th of Aug as near as I can recollect in the beginning of Aug —in Sept I met Morris again in Whitechapel-road—I afterwards called the attention of somebody in a public situation to the circumstances and that led to this prosecution Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q How long is it since you have done anything in the hosiery line A Never since 1826 no I am wrong I came out of the country in 1829—I carried on a hosiery business at Nottingham—I was a hosier all my life—I was brought up to it—I learnt the art of drawing agreements through being with Mr Cooper—I was with Mr Cooper find his late partner Mr Walker four years in succession—I had a regular salary for nearly four years—I am not bound to tell what it was—I left in 1838 and after that was doing a little agency on my own account collecting debts or anything else and I was occasionally with Air Cooper backwards and forwards—I left the hosiery concern through being unfortunate—it did not answer—in fact it was a lace business at that time—I did not torn attorney s clerk then not for years afterwards—I was married and was resident in London after being unfortunate in business—I got my living the best way I could by turning a machine working as a labourer for two or three years in Nottingham—I worked with two or three persons—I worked with a brother-in-law of mine for two yean I think—I first went to Mesrrs Walker and Cooper s in 1883—I went as anything—I was never with Mr Cooper regularly alter 1838—I received no salary as a regular deck after that—I went to his office two or three times a week not every day Q In what capacity did you go to the houses of these people A In the capacity of Mr Cooper s clerk in the first instance in December—I was employed in the transaction to get the certificates—I went at Mr Cooper s clerk up to January and then I left Mr Cooper altogether and have never been in his employ since—when I went about the certificates in December I went as his clerk—I think the certificates were obtaiited in December—before that I was only occasionally in Mr Cooper s employ—sometimes one day he would want me and sometimes be would not want me for two or three days again—I went to the prisoners about the certificates the first day I went out I was out two three or four days about them—I did notgo to the prisoner s in any particular capacity—I did not go after them they came after me—they did not know me before they came to Mr Cooper s office—they became acquainted with me as Mr Cooper s clerk—I did not go to them representing myself at Mr Cooper s clerk—they came and fetched me—Stephens called on me at my own house if he wanted me—that was after they knew I had left Mr Cooper s—they knew that in the beginning of the year—I did not draw the agreement myself I got a friend who it in the profession to draw it—I do not know that I am bound to tell his name—it was a gentleman named Godwin an attorney s clerk—hi it better acquainted with these things than I am—I will swear that Henry Rugg said that Christopher had been dead three months not that he had not seen him for three months—I asked him how Chris was and he said he had been dead three months—nobody else was present at the time—he was in the shop getting materials ready for work—that was nearly four months after the money had been obtained Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q What are you doing now A I am out of a situation and have been so since I left Mr Cooper—I have been living on a little property arising from the right of my wife—I live at No 28 Winchester-street Pentoville—I have of course been struggling and getting as much as I could independent of that—I do any agency that anybody wants—I have done a little business for a geatleman named Pike a large collector collecting debts for him—I have served writs—I have served many for Mr Cooper since I have left him—I knew nothing of the prisoners before they came to Mr Cooper s—I know Mr Roberts of Dean-street perfectly well and have known him two or three years ever since I was with Messrs Walker and Cooper—he is an auctioneer &c &c —I knew when the money was to be paid to Christopher James Rugg—they came to let me know when it was to be paid—I did not know at that time that he was not the person entitled to it—I had my suspicions but not before the money was obtained—I certainly had suspicions before the money was obtained and that is in my deposition—I had suspicion that his name was not Christopher James Rugg Q I suppose if you knew his name was not Christopher James Rugg you would pretty well know that it was a fraud on the Court of Chancery A Why the fact is I suppose I had my own opinion as well as anybody else—there were various circumstances to create my suspicion—I did not know it was a fraud at that time—I certainly had a doubt in my own mind that he was not the right party of course—I did not make any communication about it for a long time after that after the settlement—I never told the prisoner Rugg that money might be got out of the Bank without the party being entitled to it—I never had any communication with Rugg—Stephens was the principal party I communicated with and Stephens asked me the question—I never told Stephens that money might be got out of the Bank by a person not entitled to it or anything of the sort—I never said it might be done but it was a dangerous experiment—he asked me if I thought it was possible to obtain money—I told him it was possible but it was a very dangerous experiment—that was long before the settlement—I did not communicate that to Mr Cooper or anybody—I never took any particular notice of it at that time for I bad not seen Christopher at that time—that was on my first going for the certificates—I took notice of it directly after I saw somebody else—I did not communicate it to Mr Cooper—I was not in his employ at that time Q Yes you were you said that it was on your first going about the certificates A No during the progress of it—it was not because I was not in Mr Cooper s employment that I did not tell him but because I did not take particular notice of the question he put tome at the time—I was standing at the Mile End-gate at the time—I thought of the question a few days after—that was before the settlement—I did not mention it to anybody then why should I Q How soon after the settlement did you begin to pay Morris and Stephens visits A The middle of the week following I was down and the week after that I called down—I did not call two or three times a week up to the time they were given in custody—I cannot tell how many times I called—I will say five or six times—I should say that would exceed the whole—I never went for money—I never applied for money to any of them that I swear—I received 30s for preparing the agreement at the time of the execution and the day they received the money I was waiting for it—that was the only sum of money I received from any of them—I have had a glass of beer with one and the other occasionally—I think I have treated Stephens more than he has treated me—I have had a glass of beer with him three or four times since the settlement and with Morris about the same time I think—Morris never said to me that he would have no more money extorted from him—he never suggested such a thing that I swear—I did not upon that threaten to charge him with this offence—it was about a month after I had been to Morris s house that I wrote to Lord Langdale the Master of the Rolls to give him information—I saw Stephens in the beginning of August—I wrote to Lord Langdale on the 30th of Sept —I had seen Morris on the 28th of that month and Stephens and Moland the same day—I saw Moland at his own house—I met Morris in the Whitechapel-road—I was not going to his house—I saw Stephens at his own house—I went to see him for I did not know for some time previous where he lived—the policeman got his address—I went in but there was nobody at home—I waited till I saw Stephens and staid with him two hours—I had something to drink with him—I had at that time made up my mind to inform against him to the Master of the Rolls—I had been to Moland s before that and found him at home—I remained with him half or three-quarters of an hour—I had nothing to eat or drink with him—I got no money from him or Stephens or Morris nor did I ask for any—I took Morris to Stephens s with me at least he took me for I did not know where it was—I did not give either of them a hint what I was going to do that was not natural HENRY JOHN PARKER I am a policeman On the 11th of Oct I went with Price and Mr Cooper to a house in Pleasant-court Whitechapel—I found Moland and a black woman there—I asked if a person Darned Christopher James Rugg lived there—the woman answered Yes —I then asked Moland whether his name was Christopher James Rugg—he said It was—I asked if he ever went by the name of Leeson—he said Yes very frequently it is my wife s name but I am not married —he said that in the same breath—I told him I wanted him for forging a receipt on the Receiver of Chancery—he made no answer—I took him into custody and told him he must accompany me to the station—and on the road Price pointed out Morris about three-quarters of a mile from the lodging—I went and told him I wanted him for being concerned with others in forging a receipt—he said I know nothing about it I knew them and I went to serve them —I took him to the station MOLAND— GUILTY Aged 36 —STEPHENS— GUILTY Aged 36 — Transported for Seven Years —FRANCES RUGG— GUILTY Aged 60 — Confined

t18430102-554  554 THOMAS COOK was indicted for unlawfully obtaining from James Sykes a gelding a chaise and set of harness by false pretences MR CLARKSON conducted the Prosecution JAMES SYKES I am one of the vergers of St Paul s In April I had a horse and gig which I wanted to dispose of—I advertised it—on the 12th of April the prisoner called on me at No 5 Amen-corner—he said I have heard you have got a horse and gig to dispose of and I think from the description I have heard it will suit me if you will bring it —he felt in his pocket for his card-case and had not got it—he said By the bye I have got a direction on the back of a letter which I received a few days since and if you will come to No 14 Fludyer-street I think I shall be a purchaser of your horse and chaise —this is the back of the letter—there is Mr Thomas Cook 14 Fludyer-street Whitehall on it—I went the next morning to No 14 Fludyer-street—I knocked at the door and found the prisoner in the house—I invited him to get into the gig by the side of me to drive the horse round to see that he was all right and sound—he got in and we drove round and came back to No 14 Fludyer-street—when we got back he said You must get out and come to the parlour I wish to speak to you there —he then said I like the horse very well what do you want for it —I said fifty-five guineas—he said I think that is more than it is worth what is the lowest you will take —I told him I would take fifty guineas—he said I will give you fifty guineas for it provided you will take a bill for seven days —I said I could not think of taking a bill it was not a regular way of doing business for a thing of that kind— I had never known him before —he offered to give me a bill for seven days drawn on Masterman and Peters—I refused to take that for some time till be began to tell me about his respectability and all the rest of it that he was agent to Sir Samuel Fludyer and that house he had the leasehold of and it was his own property—on that statement I thought I could not do better than to take the bill—he said Sir Samuel was over abroad and he bad sent over for so much money that he was short of cash and he could not give me the money—he said he frequently drew his bills on Masterman and Peters and it would be very handy for me to take it there—he said he kept his account at Masterman and Peters and frequently drew bills there—I believed all this of course and I took the bill and let him have the horse and gig—this is the bill—he wrote it in my presence—I have never had the horse and gig back nor anything else—I presented the bill both at Masterman s and in Fludyer-street Cross-examined by MR PRENDERGAST Q Do you not come from Yorkshire A Yes—I do not know any thing about a horse now—some years back I was a butler—I lived with Dr Bloomsbury—I knew very little about horses then—I never lost a 6d by betting—I never sold a horse before—I once sold a pony—I have been to York several times and have been through Doncaster but never at the races—I gave 25l for this horse when he was two years old and he is now rising six—I sold the horse gig and horse-cloths and every thing belonging to it for fifty guineas—I thought this was a good bill and it would be paid and that was the reason I parted with the hone sod chaise—that was not the sole reason—I wished to sell it that was another reason—I had a full expectation of the bill being paid that was the sole reason of my parting with it—the horse was worth the money and the chaise was worth the money—I thought he was the agent of Sir Samuel Fludyer otherwise I should not have parted with it and that the house was his own and there was plenty of property—I parted with it because I thought the money would be paid—that was the sole reason MR CLARKSON Q If you had known he had no authority to have drawn on these bankers would you have taken the bill A No—If I had known that he had not been the agent to Sir Samuel Fludyer I would not have taken it nor if I had known he was not the owner or lease-holder of the house in which he appeared EDWARD WHITE I am a solicitor and live in Great Marlborough-street I am agent to Sir Samuel Fludyer—Mr Burrows holds the house No 14 Fludyer-street—I have the agreement for it in my hand—the prisoner never was the holder of it—there is no other agent for Sir Samuel Fludyer but myself in London Cross-examined Q Where is Sir Samuel Fludyer A In Sussex—I have received the whole of his rents up to Michaelmas and am proceeding to receive them to Christmas—I have had no intimation that my authority is superseded—as far as my belief goes the prisoner is not his agent—I let that house to Burrows under the direction of Sir Samuel Fludyer and his family—he and bis family agreed to let the lease to Mr Burrows about two years ago or a little more—I prepared the agreement—there is a clause by which it is not to be underlet—Burrows has the agreement and he took possession of it—I cannot tell of my own knowledge whether he let it to the prisoner JOHN COTTLE I am a clerk in the house of Masterman Peters and Co bankers in Nicholas-lane I live in Albion-cottage Hertford-road—the prisoner is not a customer of theirs—he had no authority to draw this note at seven days sight on Masterman s house—it has been presented— read — Seven days after sight I promise to pay John Sykes or bearer

I can swear that Thomas Cook has no account and never had—if he had drawn bills payable there they would have been refused—this bill— looking at one —is accepted payable at Mastermans but there is no name to the acceptance—this bill has been in our house but we received it through the Hitchin s bank—people there might draw on our bank hot it is taking a very great liberty—if a bill comes through a banker and the money is sent we pay it GEORGE VICKERS police-constable A 25 I took the prisoner into costody on the 28th of Dec GUILTY Aged 40 — Transported for Seven Years Before Edward Bullock Esq

and am a widow About the 3rd of Aug the prisoner came and told me he belonged to a new Court opened in the Strand that it was a Sheriffs Court to recover debts to any amount and in any county—I asked if the people chose to go to prison instead of paying me what I should have to pay—he said I should have to pay a deposit down which he had to pay into Court and that would clear me of all expences—I paid him 4s for two bills—one of them was 12s and the other was less—he said that that was a deposit which he had to pay into Court or many people would be claiming debts that had not any owing them—I paid him the 4s on the belief that he was a Sheriffs officer of this new Court in the Strand—he called upon me again repeatedly and I took out more orders—I paid him 1l 14s in the whole—on his calling afterwards I refused to pay him any more on account of his neglecting to take out executions against two parties—he did not call again and I never saw him any more—I got one debt by a post office order—the other people would not pay me—they said he was a swindler—I had asked him if that Court could recover a bill of 8l or 10l —he said Yes to any amount —I should not have paid him any of this money if I had not believed the representations he made to me Prisoner Q You say I called on the 3rd of August was it not on the 30th of July A No I am certain it was on the 3rd of August—the first time I only requested you to get two debts—this paper looking at one is my writing—it appears that here are seven but I only gave you two the first time—I did not offer to send the notices myself of course I expected you to deliver them when I paid you for them—I cannot tell bow many times you called on me—you became quite troublesome at last—I never refused to pay you what you demanded—there were two or three parties who resided in town—those you never went near—I do not know where Foxwell and Wardle resided—you told me they resided in town—I authorized you to make these parties money payable at Mr Easter s a livery-stable keeper at the White Lion to prevent their trouble in coming to me—Ambridge has not paid me any money—I never said I was satisfied—you said you could make them pay—you had been absent a fortnight when I gave Phillips instructions to take you—a person named Kidney was in my debt—I wrote to a person to employ a solicitor to get it—I was not dissatisfied with that solicitor—I said I believed he had forgotten it and I gave it to you Q Have you not arranged with that party and are you not actually receiving money by instalments A No he has not paid me a farthing—he came to me and said he would make me the same offer that he did to the solicitor to pay 4s a month but that you were a swindler and he would have nothing to do with you—I did not say to you This solicitor has done nothing with that Kidney I wish you to apply to him —I had applied to Mr Fulwood to employ a solicitor and you said he had done nothing—I did not instruct you to write to a person named North you wrote of your own head—I asked if you could obtain debts as far as Margate and you said you could you had officers in every county Q Was there not a post-office order for it on the counter and did you request me to write a receipt A No—I said I had a person there that I knew was in good circumstances—I said you should write and I would ascertain where he lived and you said We have officers in every county —I sent my son to a neighbour to get the address and before you came again I had received the money in an order and I said I shall not want to trouble you again I have received the money but no expenses —you said you would write to him to compel him to pay 3s for expenses SARAH LYDIA FULLER I am the daughter of Elizabeth Fuller I was present when the prisoner was with my mother about recovering some debts—he said he was a Sheriff s officer to a new Court in the Strand for collecting debts to any amount and in any part of the country—he said they had officers in all parts of the country—he said he was paid from the Court and what we paid him was the mere deposit that he had to pay into the Court—I saw my mother pay him in different sums 1l 14s —I was always present when she paid Prisoner Q How many debts did your mother give me to collect on the 3rd of August A Two—my mother s signature is to this paper but she did not give you all these debts at one time—the per-centage you charged for 1l 14s was 2s —above 8l it was 10s —here is one debt 19s 11d —she paid you 2s for that—here is another at Watford for that she paid 4s JOHN PHILLIPS

for the recovery of small debts Prisoner s Defence I called on Mrs Fuller on the 30th of July and left a card which merely stated Tradesmen s debts speedily collected by application to John Lester Edge ware-road —Mrs Fuller told me to call again and she gave me these debts due to her to collect some in town and some in the country one is in Hertfordshire and if I were an officer of the Sheriff of London it is not likely that I should attempt to collect debts in Hertfordshire she asked me in what Court she could proceed I said in any superior Court but most likely they would be tried in the Sheriffs Court I called several times and she was satisfied or she would not have given me others I stated in the notices that I was authorized by the plaintiff but not stating about any Court there is not the slightest evidence of any fraud but a mere matter of contract she has shown a most malicious feeling in not acknowledging the receipt of this money from Margate it is possible that I might have stated that I had been a special officer of various sheriff s courts which I can prove by the warrants to me directed but certainly not for Middlesex there has not been a fair opportunity given me for collecting them it being only seven or eight days from the last time I saw her till I was apprehended GUILTY Aged 42 — Transported for Seven Years

Westminster-road Early in Sept the prisoner called on me—he asked for Mr Wall—I said I was he—he said No I want an elderly person —I said Then you mean my predecessor in business —he said No a Mr Wall who previously lived in Union-place Lambeth —I said it was my father but he had been dead eight or nine years —he said Has he indeed I have some good news for you —I asked him in and he said there was some property unclaimed in the Court of Chancery belonging to me—we held a conversation about my father s family and so on and I asked him how to get the property—he said I must get an order under the Court of Chancery the use of which was to search in Doctors Commons and examine the will—he showed me several orders similar to those before me—he said the expense would be 5s 6d —I made an appointment to see him the next day—he called but I was not at home—he called a day or two afterwards—I saw him and told him I would give him 5s 6d if he would procure this order from the Court of Chancery—he called in the evening brought the order and I gave him 5s 6d —I believed it was an order from the Court of Chancery—he represented it to be so and I paid him two half-crowns and a sixpence—I took the order in my hand previous to paying him the money—this is the order looking at it —I had it in my possession five or six weeks—he said he was not bound to say what the property consisted of—I asked him if it was freehold or funded—he said he thought it consisted of both and he thought it amounted to about 1900l Prisoner Q When did I call on you A Early in Sept —you asked my name as I have already stated—you said it was not me you wanted—you said it was my father—I told you he was dead and you said you had some good news for me—I have no recollection of saying that the descendants of my father might make application by letters of administration—you said you came from an office connected with the Court of Chancery—you gave me a card with West and Co on it—you said That is my card if you have any communication to make it must be by letter —there was West or his agent on the card—I understood you to be a principal—you agreed to meet me next day—when you introduced this order you said something about its being given you as an extract from the Master s office I do not admit that you did say so—I cannot recollect—you said after the order was procured it must be taken to Doctors Commons and the costs of it would be 6s to look after a will if there was any there—that was for your trouble I suppose in examining the will—you left then and was absent four or five weeks and called again to know if I had further considered the matter—I said I had given the order to my solicitor and I gave you his address—I employed you about a bill of exchange—you represented you could discount me a bill JOHN HARDING I am a boot-maker and live in Mary-street Stangate The prisoner came to me last July and asked me if my name was John Harding—I told him it was—he said he had come concerning property which had been laid by for sixty years and would go to the Crown—he did not say what property—he said he came as an uninterested person—I began to tell him about my family and my forefathers—he said it was right and I ought to prefer my claim—I said I would consider of it—he came again the first week in Sept and said I must get an order from the Court of Chancery and that would cost me 5s 6d —he showed me a small paper which he said was an order from the Court of Chancery and asked me for 5s 6d for my demand—he wrote the account which I stated to him and he said If they approve of this statement the Court of Chancery will grant you an order —this was on a Thursday morning—he came again in the evening and brought this order folded up—I said Did you write this —he said No I did not write it myself the Court of Chancery wrote this —I believed it came from the Court of Chancery and believing that I gave him half-a-crown and told him if he would call in a day or two I would give him the balance—he said it was a considerable deal of landed property and I understood in the county of Hampshire—I did not pay the prisoner any more money Prisoner Q Will you state to the Court the first conversation that took place A I do not know how that is possible if I were to relate all it would take from now till Christmas—I suppose the first time you were with me an hour or an hour and a half—it is impossible for me to tell what you related from the multiplicity of the words—you told me you did not know whether I was the person and after conversation you said I was and advised me by all means to get an order from the Court of Chancery—I did not go to the Commons—you said the expense would be 6s —5s for your expenses and 1s for searching the will EDWARD HAMMOND I live in Hamilton-row and am a shoemaker On the 18th of Oct the prisoner came to my father s shop and asked me what was my father s name—I told him and said he was born at Gosport—he

order from the Court of Chancery and he said it was necessary to write a petition—he had 5s 6d from me for this paper—he wrote a petition in my house and took the parchment away with him—I had not a farthing in the house—Mr Porthouse lent me the money two half-crowns and a sixpence—I did not see the prisoner again for three weeks and then he came with the petition and wanted 1s 3s but he did not have that—I found there was no property at Gosport Prisoner Q Did you ever pay me any money at all A I did not but the person I got to pay it did—Mr Porthouse paid it in my presence and I am answerable to him for it—I cannot recollect that you informed me if I was not the right party the money would be returned—I did not see you for three weeks after and I thought I should never see your face again—when you came again I gave you into custody ASEL PORTHOUSE I recollect seeing the prisoner and Hammond in Oct last—I paid the prisoner 5s 6d by Hammond s desire Prisoner Q Did you understand that if he was not the right party the money was to be returned A No—if he was not the right party they would not grant the order at the Court and the thing would be dropped—I said If this comes from the Court of Chancery there must be something in it and I advanced him the money to pay it CHARLES STODHART I am a solicitor I am acquainted with the affairs of the Court of Chancery and the manners of that Court—then documents are appearance papers in Common-law Courts—when a person is served with a copy of a writ we file them in the Court of Queen s Bench Common Pleas and Exchequer—these are not in any way connected with the Court of Chancery—they are always on paper not on parchment as these are—I swear that these cannot have issued from the Court of Chancery or the

business and having some small resources for old age I thought I was independent but in consequence of calamities one of which was fire I was reduced in forty-eight hours from ✗ ence to penury I was unable to follow the profession I had been in and was engaged as commission-agent to two gentlemen of the highest respectability ability Mr West employed me to find out parties that he gave me instruction had property in the Court of Chancery I had to walk very often from one part of London to the other to find the right parties if I found them I had a small commission if not I had my labour for my pains Mr West lives at No 18 Throgmorton-street and I do not consider I am the responsible person in this case I only acted according to my instructions and am entirely innocent of any guilty intention in reference to the orders that are given me by my employer through not being able to Inverse I have not been able to get Mr West and other witnesses for my defence I came here not prepared for my defence Mr West having employed me I made numbers of applications and where the party has not been the right heir to the property it has been no charge or expense to them I do not know whether they are entitled to the property or not that has to be proved according to the nature of the case I beg to state that the answer to each of the cases that have come this morning is to be given in Nov and without waiting for the expiration of that month I was brought here without witness or evidence or even the evidence of Mr West I am brought here like a man bound hand and foot and am rendered totally defenceless If I had employed a party to embody these particulars I could prove I am not guilty of the charge I leave my case for your consideration I solemnly declare I had no intention to wrong any individual and I trust you will give me the benefit of your merciful consideration GUILTY Aged 65— Transported for Seven Years See Humphery Mayor Eighth Session page 470 First

number which has been put on since—we have a customer named Jones a linendraper at Newington-house Newington-causeway—this order is on one of his bills—on looking at this I took Russell up stairs into one of our rooms and two pieces of satinet were given him—one was eighty-four yards the other fifty-nine—they amounted to 30l 14s — order read — April 30 —Please let the bearer have two or three lengths of good black satinet about 3s 11d and 4s 7d a long length is required THOMAS RUSSELL I was charged with uttering counterfeit money on the 10th of May—I was taken into custody and made a disclosure to the officer of some matters in which I had been engaged—I am sixteen years old—my father lives at Beaconsfield in Buckinghamshire—he is a maker of gimp—I was in the habit of going to the house of Morrison and Co with gimp from my father—I first became acquainted with Simpson about three weeks after Easter—I obtained from the house of Leaf and Co some goods by means of this order— looking at it —I first saw this paper on the afternoon that I presented it—on the 29th or 30th of April I was at a public-house in Shoreditch—Long and Simpson came there and said to me there were two young men waiting at the Old Crown in St Giles s for me—Simpson said they had been waiting with two young men at the Old Crown High-street St Giles s ever since nine o clock—he said one of the young men said we could get 100l worth of goods without any risk at all—we went off directly to the nearest cab-stand took a cab and Simpson told the cabman to drive us to the Old Crown in High-street St Giles s—when we got there the barman said they were gone but would be there again from four till half-past four o clock—we returned about that time and the two young men came in soon after—we had just drank some ale and ginger-beer—Simpson told me these were the two young men—Long was with him—one of the young men said we could get 500l worth of goods and carry it on for a fortnight he said 1000l in two days in the presence of both Simpson and Long—he mentioned the name of Mr Jones of Newington-causeway—he said he had lived at Mr Jones s and he had got twenty or thirty of his bill-heads—there was nothing more said about Mr Jones till the next day—on the following evening I went with Simpson and Long to Moss s wine-vaults in Broad-street St Giles s—we got there about four o clock—the two young men were there when we got there—there were no bill-heads produced but the young man said he had got some of the bill-heads and he wanted to write an order—Long said he could go to his lodging and write it there and we all went to Long s lodging in Neal s-yard Great St Andrew s-street Seven-dials—when we got there I saw a woman who lives with Long—a person called Irish Molly and Mary Welsh was there—Long sent the women out and the young man wrote this order which has been produced in the presence of Simpson and Long—he then gave it to Simpson and Simpson Long and I went out to Broad-street with an understanding that we were to meet the two young men in at hour at Moss s wine-vaults—in the meantime we were to go to Leaf swith the order and obtain the goods—Simpson Long and I all three got into a cab in Broad-street St Giles s and told the cabman to drive us to the Old Change but I believe he put us down at Paul s-chain—I cannot recollect which place it was—they are close together—Simpson gave the cabman his fare which was 1s and he also had 2d for drink—Simpson told him to put on the stand he should have something to take back and he would have him if he was there—Simpson had the bill-head at that time—he gave it me at the corner of Watling-street—he waited there and Long stood at the Cheapside end of Old Change—Simpson told me to be sure not to give the bill-head up unless I was asked for it—I went into Leaf s and presented the bill-head to Mr Thomas—he laid it down on the bench—I took it up and followed him down—I gave it to Mr Renison—I obtained two pieces of black satin for it—I came out with the goods—I saw Simpson at the corner of Watling-street—I joined him and Long came down as fast as he could to us—I had the two pieces of satin—we went round St Paul s Church-yard—I went on the right hand side of Ludgate-hill—Long and Simpson went on the left—when we got to Farringdon-street Simpson came and took the satin away from me—he said he would go by a Paddington buss to Moss wine-vaults in Broad-street—I and Long went back to the City with another bill-head—I and Long then went up in an omnibus and we joined Simpson in about an hour at Moss s wine-vaults—Simpson began knocking me about and swearing at me because I had not got the goods that we went for the second time—the two young men I had seen before were waiting at Moss s—we then went to Long s lodging—Barnett was sent for—the goods were opened in the presence of him and his friend Simpson Long and the two young men—they were wrapped in paper and when we opened them we all began to tear the papers up and burnt them—there was an invoice inside—one of the young men asked Barnett what he would give for the goods—he said 3l —I then showed him the invoice which was 30l or 33l —Barnett burnt it—there was then some haggling about the price—Simpson did not say anything to Barnett in the course of the transaction—Barnett paid 10l and his friend 3l for the things—Simpson took up the 13l and paid them all 2l 16s apiece except me—he said I will keep the kid s money —he said if I had the money if I went to any more houses they would take it from me and with the money he had got he would employ Mr Wontner to defend me if they should take me into custody—after the money had been divided Simpson Long I and the two young men went to Moss s Barnett and his friend met us there because they had been out with the satins—Barnett called for 1s worth of brandy and went away without paying for it—Simpson asked the barman whether it was paid for—the man said No —they called Barnett back—he came and paid for it—we then left—on the 7th of May Long and I went to the Two Brewers—we found Leary there— that was the day we went to Morrison s —Simpson was not there—he went to tell Barnett that we only got 6l for some goods—I had some ale and ginger-beer at the Two Brewers—Long had something else and Mr Roche the landlord had something— Long begged the landlord s pardon for having thrown a pot at his head and gave him a sovereign to pay for a looking-glass—Simpson was gone to Barnett s at that time—I afterwards by Barnett s direction changed my clothes—I afterwards agreed to go down to Uxbridge to get out of the way—I was taken into custody at Farnham Royal—I left this note looking at it for Simpson at the Hare and Hounds Red-hill two miles beyond Uxbridge—when I drove up to Uxbridge Long was standing at the door of the Falcon-inn and Simpson was inside Cross-examined by MR PARRY Q Where did you leave the cabman when you went to Leaf s A On the stand—when we came back we did not go to the cabman—I carried the goods under my arm—they are not here—Barnett had them—they were about six inches wide—I do not recollect how many yards there were—I went down to Uxbridge after this affair and was driving about in a horse and chaise which Barnett said he would pay for if Simpson was not at the Hare and Hounds by eleven o clock—I was in the employ of Mr Watson of Upper Seymour-street about two months ago—I was with him a fortnight—before that I was with Mrs Beal in the New Cut and before that I travelled for my father H to wholesale houses to take orders for gimp—I never embezzled any of my father s money—he never charged me with it—I lived with Mr Telford a hosier in New-street Covent-garden before I travelled for my father—he did not turn me out for robbing him—I left because he refused to allow me to go down to my mother s funeral—I was never in custody but once before this affair—that was the day of Acton foot race—that was a week after I left Mrs Watson s—it was for passing a bad half-crown—there is not a charge of that kind now against me it is for attempting to pass—we sold things to Barnett as often as we had them—we have had dealings with him ever since I had been in custody on that charge till I was taken—I had nothing to do with him before I knew Simpson and Long—I know three persons named Simpson in Field-lane—I have sold all of them goods—one of them is bail for Barnett—I have been in the habit of selling them stolen goods—I do not know a house in Wood-street Cheapside where I stole waistcoat pieces and sold two of them in Field-lane—I am sure of that—I have been to Stanley s coffee-house in High-street Bloomsbury—I knew it when I knew Simpson—I never was guilty of the slightest act of dishonesty till I knew him—he has led me to it all—I was taken up at Hammersmith for a half-crown he gave me—he and I went and bought the money that I am now under charge for—I slept at Stanley s coffee-house one or two nights—I did not the last time rob three fellow lodgers of some silver—the landlord stopped all the lodgers and talked about sending for a policeman—I told him to search me at once—I wished to be searched but they did not search me—I was let off of course and I went away Cross-examined by MR PRENDERGAST Q Where was it you said you lived before A The first place when I came to town was with Mr Telfer in Covent-garden—I came from Beaconsfield—it was twelve months ago last Feb since I came to town which is now about eighteen months ago and sixteen months out of that time I have been employed to go to these wholesale houses—I never was wrong in a penny in my accounts—when I first came to town I lived at Mr Telfer s—I went home in consequence of my mother s death and then came to town on my father s business—he is not in the employ of any person in particular—there was nothing about a post-office order with me and my father—I have been many times to Long s lodgings—it was on Wednesday the 30th of April these goods were obtained and on Tuesday that they came to me at the public-house in Shoreditch MR CLARKSON Q When did you first become acquainted with Simpson A When I left my place I went to the wholesale houses to see if there were any vacancies and I was then going to a person I know at Notting-hill I walked down and as I was opposite Tyburn-gate Simpson came along—that was the first time I ever saw him and on that day I was taken up for attempting to pass a bad half-crown which I obtained from Simpson—we have often sold things to Barnett—I never in my life sold him anything but what was obtained by Simpson Long and me—there are three persons in Field-lane whose names I think are Simpson—two of them have run away—I have sold them goods which were obtained by the same means and by the same sort of orders—I knew nothing about Stanley s coffee-house till I knew Simpson—I was never charged with any offence till I went down to Notting-hill and accompanied Simpson to the foot-race at Acton CHARLES HUMMAN I am a cab-driver About seven weeks ago I was standing with my cab in Broad-street Bloomsbury—Russell Simpson and Long hired my cab—they got in and Simpson ordered me to drive to Paul s-chain—I drove there and they got out—Simpson gave me 1s and Long gave me 2d —Simpson told me if I got on the rank they would have me again when they came out—he did not say what they should want me for—they then left—I cannot say which way they went—I noticed Russell had a small piece of paper in his hand—it was such a piece as this—they all went away together—I did not see any more of them—I went on the stand and was hired for another fare Cross-examined by MR PARRY Q You do not remember exactly what day this was A No it was about seven weeks ago—I did not notice the paper Russell had—it was not black—I cannot say whether it was white or brown Cross-examined by MR PRENDERGAST Q Have you ever been in prison A I have been in prison about twice but not for theft—it is a long time since for not paying my master for the day s work—when I go to my master he makes me sign a paper to pay so much and if I do not pay him he summonses me and I go to prison—it was the House of Correction I was in and you may call it hard labour—it was on oakum not the treadmill—I knew some of these persons before that day MR BODKIN Q Which of them did you know A Simpson and Long—I only knew them by coming to the public-house and having a pint of beer—I might have seen them in the watering-house at St Giles s and in the house at the corner of Crown-street—I did not know anything of Russell before—it is five years since I was in any gaol—I am twenty-nine years old—we agree to pay a certain sum for a cab for a day—the last thne I was with Mr Langridge it was 14s a day and if I do not get money I cannot pay—my master summonses me and I go to prison FREDERICK BUTCHER I am bar-man at Moss s wine-vaults in Broad-street St Giles—I have known the prisoners as customers about four months—I saw Russell when the officer brought him to our house and I saw him at Guildhall—I am not aware that I had seen him at my master s house—I cannot say positively—I might have seen him or not—it is very hard for me to say—I cannot speak positively—I know Barnett—I remember when there was some talk about some brandy not being paid for—I think it was a quartern of brandy—Mr Barnett was going out I called him back and he returned and paid for it—I believe Long was present—I will not swear to Simpson positively but I think he was present—several other persons were present—the shop was full—Barnett paid for the brandy at last Q Now reminding you of that I ask you again whether Russell was at your master s house on that occasion A Not to my recollection—this transaction about the brandy was about a fortnight or three weeks before Cross-examined by MR PRENDERGAST Q I suppose you have no recollection about the time that it happened A No—I knew Barnett because he was a frequent customer of ours—he was in the house ten or twelve times a day with different parties JOHN ROCHE I keep the Two Brewers in George-street St Giles I know Simpson and Long—I have seen them at my house—I have seen Russell there but whether in company with Simpson and Long I do not know—I cannot positively answer whether I have seen them at the same time with him—I remember a time when there was an apology made for something having been thrown at me and a sovereign was paid by Long I for a looking-glass he broke—that was the week before Whitsuntide—I remember Russell was there at that time—they paid for what they had a bottle of ginger-beer and a glass of ale—I had a glass of gin and bitters myself which Russell paid for Cross-examined by MR PRENDERGAST Q How long have you known Long A About eighteen months as a customer and living in the neighbourhood—I never heard anything against him JANE LEAKE I am a widow and keep the Falcon inn at Uxbridge I remember Russell being-at my house—Long and Simpson were at my house with him on the 8th of May Cross-examined by MR PRENDERGAST Q You are not quite sure it was Russell you saw A I do not like to swear it was him because I saw him through the window MR CLARKSON Q Do you believe it to be him A I quite believe it was him— looking at him —I am quite sure that is the boy MARY WELSH I am single I know Simpson—he lodged at my mistress s at No 29 George-street St Giles—I dare say it is two years ago—my mistress now keeps a lodging-house at No 4 Neal s-yard—Mary Fox and her sister rent a room there—Long was in the habit of coming there to visit her—I came back there three months ago and Long has been in the habit of coming there Cross-examined by MR PRENDERGAST Q You left A Yes at the time they took this house and left St Giles then I left and came back again about three months ago—Mr Long came to visit Fox—I saw no more of him than going up Starrs—he was alone when he visited her Q Was there any occasion on which Long told you and Mrs Fox to go out of the room A No—I never left the room—I was not in the room at any time when he requested me and Fox to leave—I never recollect it—it never happened that he and two or three more were in the room and I and Fox were ordered out MR CLARKSON Q Might such a thing have happened and you not recollect it A No—I was never desired to go out—I never went to the room without being called—I know Mary Fox —I have never been in the room sitting there with her that I know of—I had my work to do—I was not in that room—I have seen Long come there like another man—I cannot tell how often—I never saw him in the room only going up and down stairs—I never recollect an occasion when he asked me and Fox to leave the room—if he came in with other men and I was in the room with Fox I should have quitted it MR CLARKSON Q This Fox is no more a wife to him than to twenty I other persons A I do not know—different men go there ANN SHEPHERD My husband keeps the Hare and Hounds at Redhill near Uxbridge On the 8th of May Russell came to our house about ten o clock in the morning—he staid an hour—in five minutes after he was gone Simpson and Long came—they inquired if a boy in black had been at my house that morning—I said he had and had left a message for them that he would come back and meet them at five o clock—they staid a little more than two hours and left—Russell came soon after they were gone a little after three o clock—he inquired for them and I told him they were gone—he gave me this note to give them—I took possession of it till the policeman came down and I gave it him THOMAS HEARN I am constable of Stokepoges near Slougb On the 16th of May I went with Russell to a public-house in High-street St Giles—I went in and Russell had hold of my arm—I saw Simpson there—Russell put out his hand to shake hands and said Ah Simpson or Butcher —Simpson was sitting on the right-hand side—he was going to shake hands with him but drew back his hand and would not know him—Barnes another officer was behind me and whether it was him or me that Simpson saw I do not know—when Barnes came in Russell pointed out Long who was standing against the bar—he was brought away with Simpson in custody THOMAS BARNES City police-constable 334 I went with Hearn Warder and Trew to take the prisoners I believe Hearn and Russell went into the house first—I followed them in and was within half a yard of them when they entered the room where Long and Simpson were—Simpson sat on the right-hand side—he said Ah to Russell and held out his hand—he looked up at him in the face and drew back his hand—I was in plain clothes but I believe I was known to Simpson as an officer for a considerable time before that—Russell said This is Simpson pointing round to the right—that was after Simpson drew back his hand—I believe Russell said Butcher —I said Simpson you must go along with me consider yourself my prisoner —he said What for —I said For j disposing of stolen property —he got up I put him outside the door a cab was called and I put him inside it—Long was taken at the same time—as we were going in the cab Simpson said I do not exactly understand the charge I am taken for —I said For disposing of stolen property to Barnett at 60 Broadway —he said I do not know Barnett —we proceeded to the station-house in Black horse-court Fleet-street where the charge was entered—I then handcuffed Simpson and Long together and they walked with me to the lock-up in Smithfield—they were talking together and I heard Simpson say to Long as they were going up Fleet-lane The young b—has had his regulars and we have always behaved well to him and he clenched his fist—Long made no answer but gave him a nudge GEORGE TREW City police-constable No 26 I took Long at the Old Crown in Broad-street St Giles on Friday evening the 16th of May—Simpson was with him—they were taken to the station-house in Black Horse-court—I heard Inspector Woodruff ask Russell which of the men gave him the order—he pointed to Simpson and said That is the man that gave me the order for Morrison —Simpson was leaning on the bar at the time—he rose up and said What me I never saw you before GEORGE WARDLE City police-constable No 325 I took Barnett—I was present at the station in Black Horse-court when the charge was being made—Russell was there and pointed out Simpson as the person who gave him a certain order—Simpson was leaning over the bar—he got up and said I don t know you I never saw you before —Russell said Long was in company with the others on several occasions—Long said nothing to it WILLIAM JONES I carry on the business of a linen-draper at Newington-house Newington-causeway This paper on which this order is written is one of my bill-heads—I do not know the writing under it—I did not write it myself nor did I authorize anybody to write it for the goods named—I am a customer of Leaf and Co —I never received these parcels of goods Cross-examined by MR PRENDERGAST Q Do you send orders on bill-heads A Yes but if I send it I always sign it—I do not know that I ever saw one sent without being signed—I seldom send orders MR PRENDERGAST to MR THOMAS Q Do you mean to tell us that these orders are commonly sent on bill-heads A Yes just as this is without anything less or more—they frequently come unsigned as this is James

t18450616-1420  1420 WILLIAM WEBB was indicted for unlawfully obtaining money from Watson Stafford by false pretences 2nd COUNT from James Rhodes 3rd COUNT from Thomas Dermer WATSON STAFFORD I am a chandler and at the time in question lived at 11 Galway-street St Luke s I opened my shop there on the 24th of Dec—on the 22nd the prisoner came and represented himself as a traveller for the firm of Messrs Simmons who keep an emery warehouse in Ironmonger-row St Luke s—I did not know there was such a firm—I gave him an order for some black lead which I desired him to bring on the 23rd but he did not bring it till the 24th—early that morning a woman came for a bundle of wood for which she paid me a halfpenny—she returned in a short time and asked if I had any emery paper—I had none —the prisoner afterwards brought me the black lead which I had ordered I paid him for it—while he was there the woman who had been before came in again and asked if I had any black lead—I told her I had but if she had been a minute sooner she would have been too soon for that gentleman meaning the prisoner who stood behind her had that moment brought the lead into the shop—I then undid the packet of lead that was on the counter—she said she did not mean that lead she meant limp lead—I said I had not got any but I would get her some—she said she used a great quantity of lump lead and a great quantity of rotten-stone and likewise emery paper she used as much as 12lbs each week—she said she was a stranger about there but if I would oblige her by getting it for her she would be a good customer to me not only in those but other things—she put her hand in her pocket and produced a piece of rotten-stone and a piece of lump as a sample—she said she paid 10d a pound for the lump lead and 1s a pound for the rotten-stone—the prisoner was there all the time—she ordered 12lbs of each—I asked the prisoner if they kept it at their warehouse he said Yes —I said You hear what this lady says can you let me have it by the time —she wanted it at three o clock—he said he could—I said I was not acquainted with the articles nor did I know the value of them or wbat they were used for—after the woman left the prisoner turned to me and said You have a d——d good customer there meaning the woman—I asked him what it was used for he said It is used for doing the backs of these little penny looking-glasses that they hawk about the streets —I told him I was not acquainted with the things but if Mr Simmons would supply me as reasonably and with as good an article as he supplied to other persons as he lived near I might as well deal with him as any other person—I then gave him an order for 14lbs of rotten-stone 14lbs of lump lead and four quires of emery paper—he returned in twenty minutes or half an hour with a boy carrying the articles in a sack—he brought them into the shop and dismissed the boy—the packages were in large brown paper bags—he then produced this bill and one of Mr Simmons s cards with it and said either Mr Simmons was not at borne or he was in a great hurry and he had made the bill out in his own name but it did not signify—I laid No I don t suppose it signifies so long as you get the money —at the bottom of the bill I perceived the words Received same time —I paid him 1l 2s 10d —one sovereign 2s 6d and 4d in halfpence aud he then put W Webb at the bottom of the bill and went away—I never saw him again till he was in custody—finding the woman did not come for the goods I went to Mr Simmons and made some inquiry—I then opened the parcels and found only 2lbs of rotten-stone and lump lead instead of ten—I gave the prisoner the money believing he was as he represented himself to be a traveller to Mr Simmons a respectable manufacturer—being pushed for time by the woman giving the order for three o clock and not knowing where to go for the things of course I gave him the order HENRY SIMMONS I live at No 12 Ironmonger-row St Luke s and am a dealer in rotten-stone black lead emery paper &c I have seen the prisoner once at my shop about Christmas time—he was not in any employ at all as a traveller and was never authorized by me to sell things on my account—I have examined the rotten-stone and lump lead which is here—I am not aware that it ever came from my house—the things altogether are not worth more than 6s or 6s 6d —certainly nothing like 1l 2s 10d HENRY JAMES RHODES I reside at Richmond in Surrey On Wednesday the 2nd of April the prisoner came to my shop—I did not know him before—he said he had come down from London for the benefit of him wife s health and he came to me to know if I sold blak lead—I said Yes and showed him some—he said that was not the sort it was the lamp lead he wanted—I told him I had not got any—he asked if I had got any rotten-stone—I told him I had not—he asked if I had any emery powder—I said No —he said he was a stranger in this part and asked if I could get them for him—I said I don t know very likely I can —he said he wanted 28lbs of emery powder and 14lbs of lump lead—he had several articles from me at the time—my wife was present—she is not here—the prisoner then left—I went out leaving my wife in charge of the business and on my return she showed me this circular which a person bad left during my absence—she told me what she had done—next morning the 3rd of April a person brought 14lbs of lump lead and 28lbs of emery paper and handed me this bill which amounts to 2l 0s 10d —it was receipted—I paid that person and he weut away—after he was gone the prisoner came again and saw the things weighed which the other man had brought—he said I had got them very punctual to time and asked if I could get him 28lbs of crocus powder—I said I did not know that the person who had brought the things had gone into the town for orders and would call as he came back and I did not koow whether I could get the crocus powder from him but I would ask him about it—the prisoner said if I could get it by one o clock for him and make out the bill he would come and pay it and fetch the things away—the man that brought the goods came again and I mentioned it to him and gave him an order—he afterwards brought something for Spanish brown and I paid him 1l 8s —I added that to the other bill and paid him 3l 8s 10d —I know I gave him two sovereigns—I saw no more of the prisoner Prisoner I never saw Mr or Mrs Rhodes till I saw them at the Police-court MARY DERMER I am the wife of Thomas Dermer we did live at No 6 Brighton-terrace Brixton but have moved We opened a shop there on Saturday the 19th of April for my brother Henry Butt who is in the general line and lives in Wheeler-street Spitalfields—a person not the prisoner came to the shop for half an ounce of tobacco—served him—soon afterwards a woman came in she went away again returned in a short time and bought a sheet of emery-paper—she handed me a slip of paper with a list of articles that she wanted—about half an hour after she had left a man came—I afterwards saw the prisoner—he brought a second lot of goods which I had ordered of the other man—he said he brought them from Jones and Co of St George s-road Southwark—he gave me this bill marked C—the amount is 2l 4s 4d —I said I did not want the things that day and he took them away again—he brought them back in a few minutes and said he would not trouble to take them away as there were more parties in the firm it would make a confusion therefore he would call again for the money—he wished me to pay a part of it and I gave him a sovereign—he gave me a receipt on the bill and went away—the party who had ordered the things did not corae for them and when another traveller came in the goods were opened and were not genuine-the prisoner came again on the Monday morning for the balance—I told him I had been to ascertain whether there was such a place as Jones and Co and there was none and that he had overcharged me for the goods they were not what they were represented to be—he said yes they were and there was such a place as Jones and Co —I had been but could not find it—I did not pay him the balance—he ran away—I sent my brother after him and he brought him back—a constable was sent for and he was given into custody—I have never seen the woman since—the money I gave the prisoner was my husband s HENRY BUTT I am a chandler and live in Wheeler-street Spitalfields On Monday the 21st of April I was present at the shop when the prisoner came for the balance—my sister said You have charged too much for the articles and I shall not pay you and there is no such places is Jones and Co —he said Oh yes there is —he left the shop quite fast—I went after him and overtook him—he still walked on—he was looking about and said he could not see the cart that he had a cart belonging to the firm—I said If you don t come back I shall give you into custody —he went a little further on—I told him so again and then he returned to the shop Prisoner I did not run away Witness He did then looked round the corner and walked on JOHN GODDARD policeman On Monday the 21st of April I was called to the shop and found the prisoner there—he was given into my custody charged with receiving money under false pretences—I asked who he travelled for—he said ones and Co No 11 St George s-road Southwark and showed me their bills—Mrs Dermer gave me this bill marked E—I asked whether that was his signature—he said yes his master always knew his signature Prisoner I never said I was traveller to Jones and Co neither did he ask me any question respecting it he merely waited for Mrs Dermer giving me in charge Witness I did ask him—I have been to St George s-road Southwark and looked about for Jones and Co —these are no such persons there JAMES SHOVE I live at No 33 Lamb-street Spital-square and deal in such articles as have been produced—I have examined these—this crocus powder as it is called is nothing but Venetian red and is worth about 2d a pound—the parcel delivered at Butt s shop is 10lbs of black-lead worth 4d a pound making 3s 4d 14lbs of rotten-stone at 2d a pound 28lbs of emery-paper at 3d a pound and 28lbs of Venetianred worth 1 1/2d a pound altogether 19s 4d Prisoner s Defence In answer to the charge of Mr Butt I went to the shop to deliver some goods I did not receive any order for them neither was I at the shop before to supply them with goods I received 1l in part payment which I delivered to the man I had them from he being a man I had a slight knowledge of in the oil and colour trade I was not aware there was anything wrong When I went on the Monday morning following it was to ascertain whether there was any goods I could supply them with on my own account not to ask them for the balance of the former goods As to Mr Stafford I called at his shop and he gave me an order for 3lbs weight of black lead at 1s 6d and then ordered the other goods which I delivered to him and made him a bill out in my own name as he bought them of me The reason I gave a card of Mr Simmons was his saying he should want more of those goods and I said he would no doubt get supplied at Mr Simmons s as I occasionally bought goods there myself which I dare say Mr Simmons will recollect MR SIMMONS re-examined I remember once his buying goods of me the same as another person—he was never employed by me as a traveller Prisoner No I do not say I was neither did I ever make that representation GUILTY on 1st and 3rd Counts Aged 30 — Transported for Seven Years See Seventh Sess page 184

t18451027-1974  1974 ARTHUR ROWAN HAMILTON was indicted for unlawfully obtaining from James Wood the sum of 500l by false pretences —2nd COUNT for obtaining an order for payment of and value 500 l MESSRS CLARKSON and BODKIN conducted the Prosecution JAMES WOOD I reside at Woolwich and was formerly an officer in the marines I am now on half-pay—I am owner of a farm called Woodlands at Hawley near Reigate in Surrey—that farm was about to become vacant on the 29th of Sept —it is rather more than fifty acres—I spoke to Mr Tanton a veterinary surgeon who was attending a horse of mine about finding a tenant for the farm and he introduced the defendant to me as a person likely to take it—I first saw him on the 27th of March—Tanton brought him down to me at Woolwich—Tanton introduced him to me as Captain Hamilton—we had a conversation on the analysis of some poison and I said to him Are you a doctor or captain —he replied I am Captain Hamilton of her Majesty s 5th dragoon-guards —he staid and took dinner with me—I saw him several times afterwards on the subject of the farm and while these communications were going on I mytelf made inquiry at Cox and Greenwood s the army agents on the 1st of May respecting the character of Captain Hamilton who I thought I was dealing with—after that inquiry I continued to receive him as Captain Hamilton of the dragoon-guards—I considered him a trump card—I introduced him to my family during his visits to me—I eventually agreed to let him have the farm—Mr Nokes of Woolwich acted as my solicitor in that transaction—this agreement which is dated 14th May 1845 is the bargain that was made for taking the farm—there is some brick earth on land of mine adjoining the farm and both on the 27th of March and the 3rd of April the defendant spoke to me about making bricks—he said the very first day he came that he thought my earth was very fine for making bricks—he proposed that if I advanced 500l he would begin to make the bricks forme—he said he should be satisfied with fifteen per cent for his trouble—I was to have the remainder—he said he thought I should make 5 000l a-year by it—I advanced him 500l for that purpose on the evening of the 14th of May—I dated the check the 15th on my banker s Sir Claude Scott—this is the check—it has since been returned to me as paid—about three weeks after he applied to me for 500l more for making bricks—he said he wanted more capital and pressed me very much and on the 3rd of June after a great deal of pressing I gave him 500l more—before I advanced the first 500l he said he was on leave of absence from his regiment for that time—he said so both in April and May that he could get as much leave of absence as he liked because he had got the Colonel under his thumb he had assisted him out of a scrape with a lady—I think he mentioned the colonel s name as Scarlet but will not be certain—my inducement to part with the first check was because I thought I was dealing with a man of the highest honour and integrity and a captain of the 5th dragoon-guards—no other consideration would have induced me to do so—I believed that representation of his to be true—I would most decidedly not have parted with the check if I had not believed his representation that he was Captain Hamilton of the 5th dragoon-guards—he said on the 3rd of April that he had been abroad in India at Cabul and had been severely wounded there—he said nothing about the Welsh riots at that time—while he visited at my house I had a Miss Douglas of Glasgow staying at my house a distant relation of mine—the defendant got a tenant for a furnished house of mine in the north a Captain Barclay—he said he had got a very eligible tenant for me and sent me down there to prepare it for his friend—when I returned I found Miss Douglas had left my house and the prisoner also—he came down again afterwards—he returned tome afterwards—I saw him myself at Mr Douglas s the father of a young lady at Glasgow in uniform with spurs trousers and a sabre—I went down on the 16th or 17th of June and ordered the house to be repaired and then went to Glasgow—Captain Barclay declined taking the house afterwards—it was in July I saw the prisoner in Scotland in uniform after I had advanced both these sums—he took possession of the farm and began brick making Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q Are you on half-pay now A Yes—I am still a captain of the marines—my suspicions were first excited when in the north in July when I saw him there in regimentals—I ascertained that he was not Captain Hamilton on the 4th of August when a document was put into my hand I saw the handwriting was not his—I had ascertained the fact before but it was proved then—I felt quite sure he was not Captain Hamilton on the 4th of August I had suspicion before—Mr Keene is my present attorney—he has only been so this year—an advertisement brought me to Mr Keens s office I think in March or Feb —I consulted him on that business—I knew he had been defending a brother officer—I cannot say whether he was Mr Douglas s solicitor—I had gone before the Magistrate respecting this on the 4th of August—I went in company with Mr Keene to the Police-court—I do not recollect whether Mr Douglas was there—I do not think he was but he was a good deal with me at that time—I went to Bow-street once with Mr Keene alone—I went with Mr Keene and Douglas to Marylebone-offlce Q Did you make any charge against the defendant at Bow-street or did Mr Keene by your direction A I left it all to Mr Keene—I did not go there to charge the defendant with obtaining a watch from Miss Douglas by false pretences—I went wherever my solicitor told me—I might have accompanied Mr Keene when he went about that business—I know nothing about the watch—I accompanied him several times and did not know what he was doing—I know there was something about a watch—I think I went with Mr Keene to get a warrant on this charge but they would not give us one—I gave no notice to the defendant I left it to my attorney—I have not given evidence before a Magistrate on this charge—I preferred a bill before the Grand Jury in Aug —I suppose Mr Keene gave the defendant notice of it—I left it all to him—I preferred two bills one in reference to the agreement for the farm which is dated 14th of May 1845—the bricks were talked about the very first day he came to my house—the first 500l was paid on the evening of the 14th after the agreement was entered into—I do not know that he has been sued in a civil Court to recover the 1000l —I left it all to Mr Keene—I never received a card from the defendant nor ever had one of his cards in my possession—he never paid me anything for the land—he got it from ray tenant—he was to pay me 50l a-year for the farm for fifty acres— looking at the back of a card —I will not swear this is not my writing here—if I was obliged to swear I should swear it is not—I will swear it is not my writing—I do not remember the memorandum that is on it—it is not like my writing—this J Wood on it is not my writing— looking at an affidavit —this is my writing— looking at several letters —part of the third of these dated 14th of May is not my writing—the letter is my writing but not this part—two lines with my name signed to them is all a forgery—here is a memorandum on the same letter which is not my writing Q Had you any conversation with the prisoner on the subject of your being a partner in this brick-making A Yes I said I never would be a partner—I never proposed to him to be a partner and never agreed to be so at any time—I would allow nobody to be a partner with me—there was a conversation about partnership—he wished to become a partner—he wanted to make me a partner for he said it would be Wood and Hamilton —I said No it must be in your name and in the bank too I never will be a partner —I meant the funds in the bank were to be in his name—he told me he had made bricks before—the money was obtained to turn part of this field into a brick-field—it was to be used for that purpose alone—I never would have entered into the speculation if I had not considered him a responsible person—he had previously represented he was perfectly acquainted with brick-making—I went to Sir Claude Scott with whom I had just cleared off a debt by the sale of some timber and borrowed the money of him at 5 per cent to meet the check—I never went to see the field till I returned from Scotland on the 5th of Aug —I had trusted entirely to the defendant s honour—I knew nothing of it nor what was necessary to be spent on it—there were not half so many bricks as I supposed on the field—I cannot say whether there were 100 000—if they had been burnt properly I dare say they would have fetched 300l —I go by other people s opinion—I know nothing of it—I have not seized the bricks—after he was apprehended there was a seizure for duty which was about 40l or 50l —I believe there were four or live horses on the premises—I took steps by the suggestion of my solicitor to prevent the money being withdrawn from Sir Claude Scott s—there is about 400l there—I have no memorandum given me by the defendant in reference to the money at the banker s nor have I destroyed any memorandum—I knew the defendant had letters in his possession from Miss Douglas—the last time I went to Woolwich I told him he ought to restore them—I think that was about the 5th of August—he said he would never part with them as long as he lived Q Since this charge has been preferred have you over and over again offered to withdraw from it if the letters were returned A Never once nor instructed my solicitor to do so—I have not applied for their return—they were offered to be returned once—I never directed anybody to apply for them—I am positive—I was introduced to a Miss Tanton who proposed something about the letters—Mr Tanton was not present—I believe I mentioned to Mr Tanton that if everything was given up I did not wish to bring him into Court—I had no wish to expose him and be put to the enormous expense I have—I have not got the letters—I know nothing of the prisoner s having an engagement with Miss Douglas—I had a conversation with the prisoner about her fortune—I never told him I had found a nice little wife for him or anything to that effect—I think I may venture to swear I did not—I never said I had ascertained the amount of her fortune—I do not recollect saying she was a girl of large fortune—I do not know that we had any conversation about the amount of her fortune—I did not say it was 30 000l or 40 000l nor anything of the kind—I never said if he married her what was to be done with part of her fortune—I deliberately swear that—nor that it was to be made available for the brick-field Q Did you tell him If you marry this girl you will be able to throw so much more into the brick-field A I do not know I do not recollect anything of the kind—I never did say so I am positive—I did not tell him I had considerable influence with her father nothing of the kind that I am aware of—I think I may safely swear it—I do not recollect saying I would use my influence with her father on his behalf—it may have happened—I do not recollect his saying he did not care a farthing for my influence he could get the lady without it—I remember no conversation that could lead to such a thing—I am to pay the expense of this prosecution and not Mr Douglas—I employed Mr Keene—the prisoner collected some rent for me and paid some bills out of it—he collected twice as much as he paid—he paid Collards six guineas for the hire of a piano—he asked for power to collect my rents—he saw Collards bill and said he would pay it—he said he had rente and I told him to pay it out of them MR BODKIN Q What amount of rent did he collect A I think he received between 15l and 16l together—the advertisement I was introduced to Mr Keene by was about an estate that was to be sold—the name of A R Hamilton brick-maker was on the brick-carts and nothing else—I made an estimate of the expenditure on the brick-field and if the bills had all been paid it would have amounted to 270l but none of them are paid they have all been sent to me—I have been put to the deepest distiess and a bailiff sent down to seize my furniture—when Miss Douglas was staying at my house I believed the prisoner was a captain of the 5th dragoon-guards—I always considered him a brother officer and wrote to him as such JOSEPH TANTON I am a farrier and live in Gray s Inn-road I know Mr Wood and the defendant—I was aware Mr Wood had a farm to let—he spoke to me about a tenant for it and I introduced the prisoner—he went down with me to Captain Wood s and I introduced him—I knew him as Captain Hamilton not of any regiment—when I introduced him to Mr Wood I do not know that I mentioned any name—I might say Captain Hamilton and Captain Wood and I believe I did—in the course of our interview there was a conversation about the illness of a horse—the prisoner spoke on the subject—he and Captain Wood went to the infirmary to examine the horse—the prisoner said he thought it had been poisoned—in the room at the time we went down Captain Wood was going to introduce him to Mrs Wood and said How shall I introduce you as doctor but the rest I did not hear as the door closed and I was left in the little parlour—the prisoner is connected with my family—I said to him I will tell Captain Wood you married my daughter —he said No don t tell him that now he might think I want something of him but I want nothing more than I will pay for cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q I believe you have since discovered that he is not married to your daughter A I am told so—I have nothing to prove it—Captain Wood told me he had two or three farms in Surrey and I introduced the prisoner—it was not at the prisoner s application—I knew nothing about the bricks—I went with the prisoner to buy some materials to make bricks with tools and barrows—I saw him pay for them—I do not know to what amount—I saw them—I should think they were worth from 15l to 20l —he had never told me himself that he was Captain Hamilton of the dragoon-guards—the introduction I made of him was in consequence of something my daughter told me—I have known Captain Wood twenty-four years—I know his hand-writing but could not swear positively to it—I have had many notes from him but could not take on myself to swear to his handwriting—I should think the writing on this card looking at one is Captain Wood s hand-writing—I could not swear to it—I believe it is Captain Wood s I think so I do not know—I have no knowledge of handing that card to the prisoner—I never to my knowledge received a card from Captain Wood to hand to the prisoner—I know nothing about the card MR CLARKSON Q Pray how long have you known Captain or Mr Hamilton A I should think two years by seeing him but not personally to speak to him till since last March—my daughter has been living with him since last April—I had reason to believe he was married to my daughter until lately from what she told me—I cannot say when I was disabused of that—I did not know she was not married to him at the time I took him to Captain Wood COURT Q When you said to him Shall I tell Captain Wood you have married my daughter did you believe he bad married her A I did MR CLARKSON Q That was when you introduced him to Captain Wood A Yes I did not know him by any other name than Captain Hamilton—I did not know him as Dr Ayton—I am not quite satisfied now that he is not my daughter s husband it is about a week or ten days ago that I was first told they were not married—she continues to live with him up to this time as far as I know—they live in Duchess-street Portland-place No 8 or 9—they have lived there ever since last April or March when my daughter left my house—she is living there with him up to this time from what I know—I do not know Mr Lane the attorney of Argyll-street—I have not been to his office—I have never been shown any of these papers WILLIAM NOKES I am a solicitor and live at Newington On the 7th of May last I received instructions to prepare an agreement for a lease to let a farm from Captain Wood to the defendant—I saw the defendant on that occasion—Captain Wood stated that he wished me to prepare an agreement for the farm as he had agreed to let it to Captain Hamilton—the defendant was present—it was at Captain Wood s house—I was sent for there—on my first entering the room he introduced me to him as Captain Hamilton of the dragoon-guards—in the course of conversation I asked the defendant whether I should describe him as of the dragoon-guards —he said No not of the dragoon-guards we are not now on military business I reside in Duchess-street Portland-place —he did not say who he was—Captain Wood introduced him to me as Captain Hamilton of the 5th dragoon-guards Q Endeavour to recollect what passed on your asking if you should describe him so in the lease A He said No as we are not now on a military business I reside in Duchess-street Portland-place therefore describe me as living there —those were the words as near as I can possibly recollect—an appointment was made for the following week to sign the agreement Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q I believe he said Of Duchess-street Esquire A Yes I so described him—I mentioned to Captain Wood that I had done so—I was not directed by Captain Wood to prepare articles of partnership—he spoke to me about a partnership—I prepared no articles—Captain Wood refused to enter into partnership—no draft of agreement was prepared in reference to this brick-field that I am aware of—I am not the solicitor for this prosecution—I occasionally practise here MR CLARKSON Q Captain Wood refused to become a partner was that on your advice A It was GEORGE TAYLOR I am clerk in the banking-house of Sir Claude Scott This check dated 15th May for 500l was paid by our house and placed to Captain Hamilton s account MR BALLANTINE Q Did you see it done A No T did not MR BODKIN Q Has that check passed through your banking-house A Yes it is crossed with our name—it was entered into Captain Hamilton s account—it is marked as a paid check—at the time it was drawn Captain Wood had an account with us—the defendant opened an account with this check—this is his pass-book—here is 500l entered to his account that day—here is a check for 500l dated 3rd June—that was passed to the credit of the same account Cross-examined by MR CHARNOCK Q The account was opened with that check A Yes he did not take the money out then— looking at the pass-book —20l was paid in on the 20th of May 35l on the 21st and 150l on the 23rd—the first check he drew was for 5l dated 19th May but paid on the 21st—I cannot say whether that check was paid before the 150l was paid in as it is the same day—the first item debited is on the 21st 5l —the 51 was drawn before the 150l was paid in—the amount altogether paid in by Mr Hamilton was 1376l 15s 6d including the two 500l —the balance in our hand is 440l 2s —the last sum paid in was 120l on the 25th June—the checks go down to Aug —the last sum drawn out was 125l on the 6th Aug CAPTAIN WOOD re-examined These are the checks I gave him—the first one has his name on the hack and the second also MR BALLANTINE Q Had you not a tenant named Stacey to this land A Yes—it was necessary to pay him something for the land—I think the rent was 15l JOHN CHURCH I am of no profession I live on my means at No 67 Great Portland-street—I know Mr Wood—I dined at his house in company with the defendant on the 2nd of June I believe—the defendant was introduced to me as Capt Hamilton and at table he answered to the name of Capt Hamilton—he and I were left alone after dinner and supposing he was either in the Marines or the Royal Artillery I began to talk about both those corps—when I made some observations about them the defendant said I do not belong to either of those corps I have a troop in the fifth dragoon-guards JOHN HASE I occupy the house No 1 Frith-street Soho I am the landlord—the prisoner occupied part of my house nearly three years—he has left about six or eight months—he went by the name of Dr Robinson Ayton—I believe he practised there as an accoucheur CAPTAIN ARCHIBALD ROWAN HAMILTON Some time since I held a captain s commission in the fifth dragoon-guards I retired from the regiment at the end of last March—I have a brother a lieutenant in the regiment—there is no Captain Archibald Rowan Hamilton in the fifth dragoon-guards except myself—the defendant is no connexion or relation of mine—he was not in the regiment at the time I was GUILTY — Transported for Seven Years on the 2nd Count

t18451027-2110  2110 CORNELIUS STRONG was indicted for unlawfully obtaining by false pretences from Cashim 80 handkerchiefs value 4l and 36 fans 2l the goods of Mamut CASHIM sworn on the Koran I come from Penang Malay country—I am a seaman on board the ship Eliza which was in St Katherine s Dock I went before the Magistrate on the 27th of Sept —four days before that the prisoner came to me on board the ship and asked if I had anything to sell—I said I had got some silk handkerchiefs which I had brought from China—I showed them to him—he asked what I would sell them for—I said Ten rupees each piece —he took four pieces and asked what else I had got—I said Some fans —he asked how many—I said Three dozen —he asked how I sold them—I said I would sell them all for twenty rupees—he asked if I had any cigars—I said No not for sale —he took the handkerchiefs and gave me six sovereigns and four shillings as ten rupees—he said nothing at all about them—I believed the money was good and let him have the four pieces—that made eighty handkerchiefs—I kept the money about two hours when some Lascars came on board—they saw the money the prisoner gave me—I went to change it and found it was all bad—I gave it to Mr Dent Prisoner I never saw the man before I was at work at the West India Dock at the time it happened Witness I am sure he is the man—it was between ten and eleven o clock in the day time—I am sure it was four days before I went before the Magistrate CHARLES DENT I am one of the officers of the ship Eliza I saw the prisoner on board on Wednesday the 24th of Sept close on eleven o clock—I only saw him come up the port and go down into the forecastle with Cashim—I heard none of their conversation—Cashim gave me the medals—on the Saturday after I went with him up Chapman-street and found the prisoner—a black fellow had laid hold of him—they had been waylaying him from the Wednesday—there was a quantity of people round—I showed the money to the prisoner—I called a policeman who took him in charge—I gave the policeman the same medals that Cashim gave me SILVANUS GILL police-constable H 55 The prisoner was given into my custody by Mr Dent—the prisoner said they could do nothing with him they were not coin at all—he made use of the roost violent language—in going from the station-house to the office he told me he was not the man that did it but he knew who it was—I produce the pieces which Mr Dent gave me These were brass counters or medals MR DENT re-examined I know these to be the pieces I gave to Gill CASHIM re-examined I know them—the prisoner gave them to me Prisoner s Defence I have witnesses to prove I was at work at the West India Dock at the time SAMUEL BURRIDGE I hold a situation in the West India Docks I know the prisoner by employing him occasionally—I know by my books which I have here that he was employed by me in the West India Docks on Wednesday the 24th of Sept —he was employed for some time off and on by the name of William Simmons—he is the person—I employed him from the 19th of Sept to the 26th—on Wednesday the 24th he was employed from half-past seven o clock in the morning till a quarter or twenty minutes past six in the evening—I had not my eye upon him the whole time but there was no means of his getting away—they cannot leave the Dock without a pass—I muster the men at a quarter or ten minutes to one o clock in the middle of the day and again at the close of business—he could not get out of the Dock without a pass from me—there is a police-man at the gate and no man if out could get in again—I did not give him a pass that day—they must come and ask me if they want to go away—I can say that he never asked me for a pass on that day—there ii no way of getting out except through the gate—ours is an import dock and no one is allowed to go in or out unless they sign a book at the gate stating what business they are going on—they cannot get on to the river by a boat—if a man was to leave his work he would he missed directly—I make a calculation each day for the next day s work and if I have more men than I shall want I pay them off at night and if I want more I take them on—each man is stationed at a certain place and if one leaves his station the party from that place comes aud reports to me that there is a man short JOHN HARWOOD I keep a coal-shed and work as an extra labourer in the West India Dock I know the prisoner—I was at work with him on Wednesday the 24th of Sept from eight o clock in the morning till six at night—he was there all the time—he was not five minutes together oat of my sight—he was never out of the Dock that day—there is no getting oat without a pass—we get our dinner in the Dock at twenty minutes before one—we do not go out of the Dock—we stand and eat it where we are employed DANIEL BAKER I am a labourer On Wednesday the 24th of Sept the prisoner was at work with me in the Dock from eight o clock till six—he was at work at a jigger heaving up in the warehouse—he might be occasionally going away to the water-closet or such as that but not for above a quarter of an hour—we had six men heaving up and when a gang-man is placed at that sort of work they cannot go away from it—he was never away more than a quarter of an hour—he was dressed much the same as he is now—I bad seen him before—I did not know him by any name—I do not know his name now exactly but he is the man—there are a great many men there—I think he was called Somerfield Simmons or some such name CHARLES DENT re-examined The ship laid about two miles from the West India Dock—none of the property has been traced—I had never seen the prisoner before to my knowledge—I am sure be is the man that came on board and there was another with him—he was dressed as he is now—I can swear to that jacket—he came through the foremost porthole but one—a person could get out of the West Indian Dock by getting into a barge which is going out or by following a truck out behind—it would not be possible for a man to get from the West India Dock to our ship and back again in anything like a quarter of an hour—I am certain it was close on eleven o clock that the prisoner came on board—I saw nothing of the purchase—I only saw him come on board and go down forward—I did not see him go away—I have not the least shadow of a doubt that he is the man—I am quite satisfied of it—it is a usual thing for men to come on board when a ship comes home—anybody can come in and out—I am third officer of the ship—I had some things stolen from my cabin while the ship was lying there SAMUEL BURRIDGE re-examined I can positively swear the prisoner was never out of the dock the whole of that day—there was no possibility of his going out with a truck—there are always a certain number of men three sent with a truck and it never goes off the premises but straight over to the cooperage-yard and there is a constable at that gate so that no man could leave in that way—if the prisoner had been a quarter of an hour absent I should have known of it—I was all over the premises that day and have to overlook all the men employed at warehouses No 3 and 4—I have the stationing of all the men—there are 400 or 500 men under my notice—after placing them in the morning I go round to each foreman to ask if they are all right and if they have got their quantity of men and how many—I allow a certain number to each ship—the prisoner was stationed at a jigger heaving up the casks to house—there are only six men at a jigger and if one leaves they cannot go on with the work—he must have been missed—they could not get another hand to supply his place—each man has his station—he could not have got out by a barge—no lighter-man dare take a man on board—each lighter has a pass to go out and it would be known to the police—there is no possibility of a man s leaving the dock from morning till night GUILTY * Aged 39 — Transported for Seven Years The prisoner had been previously convicted of felony and sentenced to seven years transportation

relatives were in the habit of consulting fortune-tellers and others and upon their representation she would hurry him up to London that he had always told her he was unable to render her any

produced a letter to him which she said was from E H Powell Esq a barristers that the prosecutrix s brother had been raising money for years on the representation of his being entitled to this property that she was in the habit of going to people who by consulting cards told her that there was great property coming to her and that they used to see in the magicglass how matters were going on

and give you an answer in writing—you called on Thursday morning and told me Captain Gardner was in custody DAVID JOHNSON I know the prisoner M Lean—he is a journeyman baker and was in my employ up to Nov last M Lean It was only for the time I was in your employ that you knew me in that capacity Witness No—may acquaintance with you took place last July—you represented that you knew me twenty years ago but to the best of my knowledge I never saw you before MR BALLANTINE Q Was he a good hand at journeyman baking A Yes a very good one the best in England I think M Lean Defence I have endeavoured as far as lay in my power to carry out the views and do justice to every person that employed me I admit these people paid their money I saw it paid it was done with the best intention I made an arrangement with Gardner to take sixty passengers out—about the 6th of May I had met Captain Gardner named to him the subject he told me of the Recovery he took me down to look at it and wished me to wait on the owner I waited on Mr Gibson and you have heard what he has said—with respect to Rosenbaum I was employed by him to do the best I possibly could to dispatch these emigrants and I was to receive one-half of the profits—with respect to anything else I leave it entirely in your own hands I have got my conscience clear and here I stand innocent of anything wrong—there never was fraud intended by Captain Gardner or me Gardner s Defence I called on M Lean on Saturday evening the 24th of April he mentioned having a number of passengers and I thought it would suit my purpose I called on a corn merchant in the City and asked if he would join a charter party to transport these emigrants he said it was a deviation from his business but if it would further my views he had no objecttion I turned my attention to a vessel called the Recovery I commissioned Mr M Lean to call on the owner and from what he said I was of opinion she could be chartered on the Monday I was at Mr Ireland s Rosenbaum came in and I named having a vessel about to proceed to New York Rosenbaum asked What will you take these passengers for I named 5l he said What commission will you allow me I think I said 4s he said he was in the habit of having 6s from Phillips and Tiplady if I would give him the same he would give me the preference I agreed to it and he seemed anxious✗ that they should see the vessel I knowing they wanted to get away called on a friend a shipwright and asked him to walk on board and give me as estimate of what it would come to to fit it up in case the charter-party came to a close they left me about eleven o clock on Tuesday morning and agreed to meet me at Mr Ireland s at three o clock I met them and instead of paying the 5l it was agreed that 1l should be paid then and the remainder when they were on board it made no difference to me knowing I had a responsible party to join me in the charter they paid 9s the money was put into the box and after stopping a short time Mr Rosenbaum and his daughter asked me to leave an agreement with them as they might get more passengers I did so and the next morning I made an arrangement to proceed to Mr Ireland s I went to his house about one o clock on the Wednesday I left a message that I was on business in the corn-market and should be back at three o clock I returned and saw Mr M lean I left him full power in negotiate anything that might occur I called at Mr Ireland s again in the evening I was taken into custody I have not had opportunity to get a solicitor under these circumstances I applied to traverse my trail and had his Lordship granted my request I should have had not only a solicitor but a Counsel I have been a master and owner of a ship the last three years I commanded a ship for Mr Soames in 1844 M LEAN— GUILTY GARDNER— GUILTY Transported for Seven Years There was another indictment against the prisoners

the watch—I saw the boy Walters come from Messrs Davenport s warehouse with a basket—he went to the Brunswick coffee-house in Wych-street Strand—it is a very small place very dirty and with very little furniture except two beds on the floor—there was about a dozen cups and saucers four or five plates three or four egg-cups and some dishes of the most common description—there are six rooms in the house and the shop—Walters went in there with the basket and in eight or ten minutes the prisoner Mitchell came out with the same basket as far as I could judge under his arm—he went to No 22 Stonecutter-street—he did not go the direct way but through back courts and alleys a very circuitous route—some woman came to the door there and then Mitchell and a Mr Sabine who keeps the coffeeshop came out—they walked up Stonecutter-street together—Mitchell had something in his hand wrapped in paper—he had left the basket at No 22—I went up to him and asked what he had got in his hand—he said What is that to you —I told him I was a constable and I wanted to ask him some questions about the things he had taken into that house—he made no reply—Mr Sabine said in his presence that she was waiting for him—I asked her where the things came from—she said she had bought them that morning of a person named Walters—I asked her where—she said if I wanted to know any more I had better go to her house the Brunswick coffee-house in Wych-street—Mitchell said nothing but took my name and number and appeared very indignant—he had one of these saucers in his hand which I took from him—I went to the house in Stonecutter-street and found the basket—I took Mitchell into custody—Mr Sabine was not at the house in Wych-street when Mitchell came out CALEB GROVES police-constable C 360 I was with

was Jones WILLIAM BROCK I am a pawnbroker I produce a dozen goblets pawned on 17th of April—a sugar bason and jug pawned on 20th of April and a set of china pawned on 21st August by Mitchell—he said he brought them from a respectable coffee-shop No 44 Wych-street Drury-lane—I said they were rather too good for a coffee-shop—he said it was a very respectable place and if I doubted what he said I might send the man to see the landlord—the second day he came I did send the man but he missed the prisoner in a crowd MARY DOWNES I am a china dealer I have dealings with Messrs Davenports —the prisoner Walters lived next door to me—I knew him—I did not send him for any china WILLIAM CHRISTOE re-examined All the articles produced are my masters —the value of them is about 48l —they are not the sort of articles you find little coffee-houses using Mitchell s Defence In the beginning of December I was recommended to Mr Sabine who kept the coffee-house I was with her the whole winter I was servant there to do the work of the coffee-room to keep the shop clean and clean knives at the latter end of March Walters whose name I undertood was Alfred Jones came and lodge there a little time after he came my mistress said to me George I want you to go and pawn some things that was the first time I went to Mr Clark s the pawnbroker s after that she sometimes sent me and sometimes the bar-maid sent me which Walters knows that was the occasion of my pawning the things On the 4th of May I was down in the kitchen I was called by the barmaid to go and take these things to Mr Duro No 22 Stonecutter-street I went the nearest way I found my mistress there she said What have you got some China George I said Yes I have Mary Ann told me to get down as soon as I could because your daughter wants to go to bed she said I am going home I will walk with you we did and she said Hold this while I get my handkerchief out she gave me the saucer and the officer came and took me to the station and they found this duplicate on me which I got when Mary Ann one afternoon was going out she gave me a sugar basin and asked me to pawn it for a shilling at Mr Clark s I did so came back and she said Never mind the duplicate let it be and that is how I came to have it I pawned these things by the order of my mistress or the barmaid I gave them all the money and duplicates After I had been a great many times I said to my mistress How is it that this lad meanings Walters gets so much property I understood it was from his executor or trustee he had these goods instead of money coming to him and he will state the same because I asked him about the things I took the things directly to the pawnbroker s from the house what I have done was entirely through my mistress s order I have had a good character Alderman Challis knows I have lived in respectable situations I had not any knowledge of how Walters got these goods it is a most cruel thing for me as a servant to be answerable for the iniquity of a mistress or master I have concealed nothing I have stated everything straightforward MITCHELL— GUILTY Aged 49 — Transported for Seven Years

said This is Doherty —I said Indeed you know all about this watch —she said Yes sir I am very sorry it occurred have you any objection to come with me to Petticoat-lane if you have not M Carthy and I will go along with you —we went and at every watch-maker s shop she came to she endeavored to point out a watch that was similar to mine—I was walking between Doherty and M Carty and the policeman was

get the watch—we went to a public-house opposite Petticoat-lane and Doherty said I will go and let the Jew know have you got the money —I said Yes —she went away and returned in about half an hour—she said The Jew has not got the watch on his own premises he will have it in half an hour —she then said that house was too light and we went to another house and staid there half an hour—M Carthy then said the half hour was gone and he would go and speak to the Jew—he said he would probably sooner come for M Carthy than he would for Doherty—he went out and he returned and said I saw the watch what a pity it is that the ring is broken —I said it did not matter—he said The Jew hesitates in coming up I may succeed in bringing him up but if he comes you must not notice him —I said I will not if he comes I will take no notice of him —Doherty then said You had better let us have the whole amount and we will go down to the Jew and get the watch and bring it up —I said No I will not I will leave it with the landlord —Doherty then said You had better let us have a sovereign —I produced a sovereign and put it on the table—Doherty said We had better both be off —M Carthy said I will take the

Brook-street Grosvenor-square—I have some race-horses On 4th Dec last I received this letter marked A — read— Mr Kirtons 3 Peerless-place City-road 4th Dec 1847 Sir —Understanding you are the confederate with Mr Mostyn in the Beatinck stud I take up my pen to disclose the whole affair relative to the horses belonging to the Goodwood-stables being got at this last racing season more particular in reference to Planet Redhcart and Glentilt and if we can come to terms as I can prove the facts the of Planet and the other horses was got at and a certain drug given to them so as to ensure their losing any race they starts for and likewise injuring the constitution of the horses I hear that it has been hinted in some paper this last week that the trainer Kent knows all about it and the stable likewise but this I can prove to be false and likewise that the same parties will again if possible get at the Goodwood Derby horses again next year as one of the parties engaged in that affair is busily engaged in laying long odds against a horse called Surplice in the stable If Sir you choose to come to my terms the parties all concerned in the affair shall be given up to you and likewise some of the stuff that was given to the horses with every proof of the same and no surmise but all facts My terms are as follow that you shall send me per return of post on the receipt of this letter a 10l note I will then meet you on Thursday it cannot be before as one witness will have to come from the country and I must send him some money down to pay his expenses up to London at any place and time you choose to appoint and I will bring all the witnesses and proofs against the parties engaged in it and after I have done so and have proved to your satisfaction that what I state is true and the parties are in your possession that you shall further remunerate me with a sum of not less than 20l If you agree to this I shall thank you to let me hear per return of post so that there be no delay in the affair and that the parties engaged in it may be thoroughly exposed Awaiting your answer I remain Sir your obedient servant HENRY HALFORD —In consequence of receiving that I wrote a letter addressed to Henry Halford 3 Peerless-place City-road—I have no doubt that letter was posted— the prisoner admitted that notice had been given him to produce this letter but denied having it —it was to the effect that I should be happy to hear anything he had to say if he called on me but I should decline sending the 10l till I heard something more—some days after the prisoner came to my house and represented that he had been sent by his father who was unable to come himself—he asked me whether I had not received a note from his father Henry Halford promising to give me some information with reference to a conspiracy which he alleged had existed and did exist for the purpose of drugging or poisoning race-horses and if his father had not undertaken to produce certain witness if 10l was given him for the purpose of paying their necessary expenses up to London—I told him that I had heard from his father to that effect and upon his further statement I gave him 10l —he gave his own name as Alfred Halford—he said he was to take he 10l to his father that he had sent him for it that he was going to Manchester for one place and was to fetch up three witnesses named Wood Thacker and Phelps—I do not know such persons—before I gave him the 10l he produced to me this letter signed Williams —he said he had it from his father—he said his father had been implicated in these conspiracies for some yeard and he had received large sums of money at different times—this is a letter purporting to come to his father from Williams the head of the gang— this letter was dated 13th Dec 1847 from the Prince of Wales Clarence-street Brighton in which several parties were named as connected with the supposed transaction out of which the writer hoped 2 000l would be realized —he said that his father did not intend to disclose the names of all the partied engaged but only those certain partied who had behaved shabbily towards him upon some occasion that he himself had not up to that time taken any part personally in the conspiracy though he was aware of what had been going on that he had no desire to take any part in it but that his father and brother had not behaved well towards him and as he knew they meant to deceive me he would if I would reward and protect him work on his own account and get me information which they intended to deny me—upon the strength of this statement I gave him the 10l to give to his father—I took this receipt from him—I wrote it and he signed it in my presence— read— Received 10l for my father Mr H Halford to fetch witnesses up to London to prove that the Goodwood horses were drugged For H Halford A Halford —After that I had several interviews with the prisoner—he produced to me upon those occasions a mass of letters some written in blue and some in black ink—they were generally similar to the letters signed Williams —I have them here Prisoner Q When I came to you did not offer me money to work for you before I mentioned a word A No I did not say if you would work for me I would pay you handsomely nor offer you 1 000l reward—I said if there was such a conspiracy as was represented by you and if so many persons were concerned in it as you named and they could be legally convicted I had no doubt you would receive a very large reward—I said I had no doubt that a reward of 1 000 guineas would be given on conviction but I could not tell what might be done—you said several times that you did not want anything till you proved the case true Q Did you ask me after some time to join them and did not I say I would rather beg my bread in the street than become a gambler with them and you said you would protect me if I would join them A You volunteered to join them if I thought it would be of any advantage to me and I said I would give you such protection as I could if you brought me information relative to the parties—when you brought me a letter with four crosses and some drugs which you said you had obtained from Williams I cannot say that I trembled I might have shown some agitation—I may have said I thought I had seen writing like it—I do not recollect saying that I knew the writer—this is the letter looking at one —letters marked D E and F are my writing—I have no knowledge of such persons as Wood Thacker and Phelps except as represented in letters purporting to come from them—you said a person named Ashcroft had been pointed out as one of the persons who had been engaged in drugging horses—I believe I said that a person had pointed Ashcroft out to me at Ascot races MR CLARKSON Q I believe you are a cousin of Lord Mostyn A A nephew—at the time in question I was joining with Mr Mostyn his lordship s son in keeping race-horses—if I had known that instead of being the son of a supposed Mr Henry Halford the prisoner s name was Thomas Harris that he had been writing these letters himself and that he was the person residing in Peerless-place and no such person as Halford or Williams had ever been there I do not think I should have parted with my 10l —I had a little hesitation as it was—it was because I believed there were such transactions as his father could disclose that I was induced to part with it—whether there are such persons as he represented engaged in drugging horses or anything of the sort I gave not the slightest reason to suppose or know except from the information I gor from the letters he handed to me—he told me he and his father resided at 14 Castle-street Finsbury LORD HENRY LENNOX I am one of the younger sons of the Duke of Richmond and am a friend of Mr Lloyd s He sent me this letter marked A —I produced it at the Police-office where Mr Lloyd recognised it—the prisoner told me that his father his brother and Williams were well known at Kirton s coffee-shop 3 Peerless-place that Williams was always there at least once a day Prisoner Q I believe you have been yourself accused of standing is with the rogues A No indeed I did not say that it had been mentioned at Tattersall s that I had screened the parties EMILY BAKER I am waitress at Kirton s coffee-shop 3 Peerless-place City-road The prisoner has been in the habit of frequenting that shop—I have never seen his father or brother there or a Mr Williams—the prisoner was principally writing when he was there—he head a small bottle of blue ink—he wrote a great many letters some in blue and some in black ink and sealed them some with black wax and some with red—he left some blue ink there which I gave to Sergeant Beckerson—he was there alone—he came for about six or seven weeks in this way in Dec and Jan last WILLIAM KIRTON I keep coffee-shop I was ill in Dec —when I was sufficiently well to attend to business I found that the prisoner was frequenting my shop—I never saw his father or brother or Williams—the letters for the prisoner were directed to my house in the name of Halford—he gave that name—he was usually writing—he once asked me to post a letter for him—I saw him direct it in blue ink and he put two postage-stamps on it—this is the letter looking at one addressed to Mr Lloyd and signed Henry Halford dated 5th Jan 1848 Prisoner Q Did you pist that letter yourself A Yes JOHN CHALLIS SMITH I am a publican in Clement s-lane Strand I have known the prisoner sixteen or seventeen years—I knew his parents—his name is Thomas Harris—his father s name was Robert Harris he has been dead between four and five years—he has no brother JOSEPH SHACKELL I am one of the superintendents of the detective police In consequence of a representation that the prisoner expected to be poisoned I accompanied Lord Henry Lennox Mr Lloyd and the prisoner to Marlborough-street Police-court—the prisoner made a deposition in consequence of which on Tuesday 11th Jan I obtained a warrant which I have here—I set out with the prisoner to find the parties named in it—we walked about from twelve or one at noon till midnight—we went to a great number of places—I at last gave up the pursuit being satisfied he was telling me an untruth but I sent another party on—I was regularly knocked up—I told the prisoner to be with me to breakfast at nine o clock next morning—he did not come—before I saw him again I learnt his name and who and what he was—I had been to Castle-street Finsbury to Mr Henley s—next evening I went to Mr Lloyd s and the prisoner was sent for—I asked him the reason he had not met me—he said he had been to see Mr Lloyd at eight o clock and was coming to see me at nine but he had met his father in the Quadrant that from there he went to Oxford-street and afterwards took a cab and went with his father to various places about town which was the reason he did not meet me his father was to see me and put me on the persons mentioned in the warrant—I then said that everything he had been telling me was an untruth and he must consider himself in my custody—I charged him with obtaining 10l from Mr Lloyd under false pretences and told him that his name was not Henry Halford that I had found out his name—he afterwards admitted that his name was Thomas Harris—I told him where his father lived and who he was that I had found out all about him that his father used to keep a public-house that he said his father lived at 13 Castle-street which was untrue that I understood he had been dead four or five years—he admitted it—he had said he had a brother and a father who had got one of the parties named in the warrant safe for me to apprehend him—I told him that was untrue that he had no father only two sisters and a mother—he admitted t and then begged for mercy of Mr Lloyda I have seen the prisoner write—he wrote me a letter to meet him at the prison—I met him and be afterwards admitted having written it and the wrote a letter in my presence—these are them produced —I told him I believed all the letters to be in his writing—he did not acknowledge it but I saw four of his letters—I also saw him sign his name—I believe all the letters which have been produced are his writing Prisoner Q I believe you went after a person named Williams A Yes that is one of the names on the warrant—I found out a man about twelve at night and told you I knew a party mentioned in the warrant but his name was not Williams—I pointed him out to you—at first you hesitated and then said No that is not the person —a man named Cork did not tell me he knew Williams—he said he knew a person who answered the description but that was not his name and we went out together to find him—I saw you write twice once at the Police-court and a letter to your sister—I compared the letter with your signature at the Police-court and when you wrote your name to your deposition Lord Henry Lennox pointed it out to me and said Look at this it is the same handwriting —I do not judge of your writing only by comparison but from seeing you write as well—there was not person answering the description of Williams at a billiard-room—it was one of my sergeants who I had sent to make inquiries HLNRY HENLEY I live at 13 Castle-street Finsbury and have done so for thirteen months During that time neither the prisoner hi father or any one named Alfred or Henry Halford has been living there no one but my own family JURY to MR LLOYD Q Is it a practice on the turf to purchase information of trainers and others A Not that I know of—I have never yet paid persons for information and I do not think I ever shall—I had reason to believe my horses were drugged in the course of the year Prisoner s Defence I am the son of a widowed mother and was never before charged with a dishonest act I do not deny having the 10l from Mr Lloyd but it was to procure information if the letters had been read they would have shown much valuable information was obtained from me I have always lived at 1 Belitha-terrace Barnsbury-park with my mother having to frequent public-houses I became acquainted with Halford he asked me to join him I refused he said if I would act as his son he would find me a situstion I said I did not like acting another person but if it would be a good thing as he said I would do it and I did Mr Lloyd offered me a reward I told him I wanted nothing till the case was proved I understood they were going to deceive him and I believe if I was at liberty I could have put every one of the parties into custody and proved myself innocent I throw myself on the mercy of the Court William Benbow Nelson schoolmaster 19 Haberdasher-street Hoxton gave the prisoner a good character GUILTY Aged 20 —

house with another man who I did not know—the prisoner called for a glass of rum and water I served him—he handed to me this 5l -note produced —I looked at it and brought him a pen and ink and requested him to indorse it—he wrote on it Wm Jones No 10 Regent-gardens Westminster —he said You know me I am a neighbour of yours —I then gave him the change 4l 19s 6d —he returned the note to me and I put it into my cash-box—in two days I paid it away to Mr Gamble who brought it back to me on the following Wednesday 20th Dec in the state it is now stamped Forged —I then went to Jones s house—I saw him and asked him if I did not change a note for him the week before—he said Yes —I asked if he was aware it was a forgery—he seemed agitated and said he was not—I told him it was and he must come with me to my house which he did—I showed him the note and he acknowledged that it was his writing on the back of it—I asked him if he knew who he had taken it of—he said at first that he took it at Chester—he afterwards said he took it in Westminster he did not say from whom—I told him he must be aware who he took it from—he said he could bring the person but did not know his name—I said I dare say he was not in possession of so much money but what he knew who he took it of—he said he would find the person and I allowed him to leave me for that purpose—he said if he had the note it would facilitate his bringing the party to me—I told him I did not think it was necessary—he seemed very much agitated—he was to return to me in the evening about five—he did not return and I went to his house and found he had not been home—I went again about seven and did not find him then—I went again about mid-day next day and found he had not been home all night—I then gave information to the police and he was arrested on Saturday the 23d Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q He appeared agitated when you told him it was a forgery A Yes—his sister opened the door to me—he came down to me immediately—he told me he had been working at Chester—I do not recollect that he said he took the note from a man with whom he had been working at Chester I did not understand him to say so—it was after he said he had taken it at Westminster that he said he would find the man—I only knew him by sight—when he left I said Either bring me the money or the man MR CLARKSON Q Are you sure he said he had taken it at Chester first A Yes—the name of John Jones Esq May Fair is on the top of the note—I put 14th Dec 1848 on the face of it before I parted with it THOMAS HOLMMAN I am potman at the Princess Royal Warwick-street Piccadilly which is about a quarter of a mile from the Duke of York I know the prisoner by sight—he and his companions have frequently been in the habit of using our house—I remember a day on which there was a row at an eating-house and the prisoner and some others were taken into custody—I had seen the prisoners at the tap of our bouse about six o clock in the evening before that row took place—they all got talking together—I heard the prisoner make an observation that he had either been and done or copped a fiver—I did not know what that meant—his companions asked him if he was going to stand anything to drink—he did not but went away—I afterwards saw an account in the newspaper of the prisoner s examination in conesquence of which I went to the police-office Cross-examined Q When did you give information of this to anybody A Last Sunday night three weeks—that was after the prisoner was committed—I first communicated it to some young men who were in the tap-room when I read the paper—the name of one of them was Thomas Ivers—I did not tell any one in particular—I spoke it openly in the room whilst we were talking about it—I did not know the prisoner s name before I saw it in the paper—when I read it in the paper I asked those present if that was the person and they said Yes —they knew that was the person—they were not the persons to whom he said he had copped or done a fiver—Ryley and Brooker were present when he said that—Brooker for one asked him to stand something to drink—he is a young man living in the neighbourhood a grainer by trade and a customer at times—Ryley is a customer now and then the others have not been lately—I did not understand the meaning of copping a fiver—I am quite certain that was the word he used—I never heard it before to my knowledge—the words were I have copped or done a fiver —he used both words copped or done —I have not since ascertained or inquired of anybody what that meant I have no notion now—I have never before had anything to do with a case of a fiver or a tenner or anything of the kind—the prisoner said it publicly so that anybody might hear him—I did not go to any person or constable to give information—Inspector Cummings came to me and I told him what I have told to-day—I merely told him what the words were—I saw him again on the following Monday—he subpœnaed me—I did not see Rodwell till I came here HENRY WRIGHT policeman I know the prisoner—I took him and his brother on the night of 14th Dec for creating a disturbance and breaking a basin at a soup-shop—they were discharged next day—in consequence of information on Wednesday the 20th I went to the prisoner s house and waited about there all night in plain clothes—he did not come home all night—on Saturday morning the 23d about half-past eleven I met him in the New Cut Lambeth—I apprehended him and told him I took him for Mr Ridler s case—he said he did not know it was a bad one—I asked him who the man was who was with him when be passed the note—he said Oh that does not matter who he is he is off into the country and he did not know anything about it —he afterwards told me he had taken the note of a man he used to work with he did not know his name or where be lived—I searched him and found 13s 11 1/2 d on him Cross-examined Q Were you examined before the Magistrate A Yes twice—I was examined on the first occasion and then requested to be examined again to add something to my deposition—this is my signature to the deposition— The witness s deposition being read did not contain the statement that the man had gone off into the country and knew nothing about it —I had no reason for withholding that—I might have forgotten it at the time WILLIAM CUMMING police-inspector B On the evening of 20th Dec I was sent for by Mr Ridler and accompanied him to No 10 Regent-gardens—I remained near the door—in consequence of what I learned I put Wright to watch the house—I had been to several public-houses in the neighbourhood to look after him—he was not apprehended till Saturday the 23d—Mr Ridler gave me the 5l -note—I went to May Fair and made strict inquiries after a person named John Jones—I could not find any such person—I know Ryley he is a bricklayer be is very seldom in employment—I do not know Iver or Brooker Cross-examined Q Did you go to Holman s A Yes from information from Mr Ridler—I understand copped is a slang word which meant passing a note shilling or any article GEORGE RODWELL policeman B 205 On 11th Jan I was at the Westminster police-station on what is called the reserve duty—I was placed in the passage of the cells—there are five cells belonging to the station and two belonging to the police-court—I was attending on the five—the others belonged to the gaoler of the Court—the five cells are joined one to another with open tops with bars and wires—the prisoner was in No 6 cell and two females in No 7—there were two male prisoners in No 4 and no one in No 5—the prisoners can hear one another talk from one cell to another particularly when the outer door is shut which it was on this occasion so that all was quiet inside—they are obliged to talk rather loud to be heard—I can hear what they say if they talk loud—the females began talking and asking what one another were in for—the prisoner said he was in for a fib—one of the females asked him what he meant by a fib—he said it was a 5l -note in Regent-street he had had the money and melted it—he likewise said he had been remanded three times and he expected either to be turned up or fully d on that day—those are cant expressions meaning either to be discharged or committed for trial—a man in No 4 named Wilkie said he was in for a bad sixpence and he expected another one to be brought against him but he would take a sixer for it—the prisoner said he should not mind if he got off with a sixer—that means six months imprisonment—Wilkie asked him if he knew different parties mentioning their names and among them mentioned the name of Chitty—the prisoner said he knew him and Wilkie told him he had had three months imprisonment from Bow-street on suspicion of being about to commit a felony—the prisoner said he was surprised and said We must not talk too loud in case we might be beard the females were talking rather loud—the outer door was then open Cross-examined Q What has become of Wilkie A He was discharged—I did not give evidence against him—I was attending to my regular duty at this time to be there in case any of the prisoners wanted anything—they might have seen me if they had looked down the passage—I stood at the end of the passage when the prisoner and the women were brought in—they could have seen me—I do not know that they did—I cannot say what has become of the two women—there was a good deal of talking going on—the prisoner was in a cell by himself—I had heard him speak before that some time ago when he was brought in charged with breaking a soup-plate SIR J BAYLEY Q When you overheard this conversation did you know what the prisoner was charged with A No not till he began the conversation THOMAS POYNTER I am a meat-salesman at 62 Aldgate On Saturday 9th Dec between eight and nine in the morning the prisoner came and asked me the price of three legs of pork which I had for sale—I told him 4s a stone—he left went away a little returned immediately and said I will have those three legs of pork —he took two and my boy took one into the shop to have them weighed—he appeared to be a cook s shopman—I took particular notice of him being a stranger in the neighbourhood—he appeared to be in a great hurry—I saw no more of him—in consequence of what I afterwards heard I went to the Westminster police-court on 4th Jan and saw the prisoner there—he was not pointed out to me by anybody—he was along with five or six others—I recognized him immediately but I had my doubts then—he had much more moustachios then than he has now—I did not receive the payment of the pork—the only three legs of pork sold that day were to the prisoner—my son keeps the books and sits in the counting-house where the people have to pay Cross-examined Q Were you examined before the Magistrate A Yes and my son also—he is here—the prisoner was discharged on my case ROBERT WILSON On 9th Dec I was in the employ of Mr Pointer I saw the prisoner outside the shop on that day talking with my master who told me to take three legs of pork into the shop to the scale—I carried one leg in and the prisoner two to Davis the scalesman—I then went out again to the door and did not see the pork weighed or taken away—I next saw the prisoner at the Guildhall Westminster when I went with Mr Pointer—he was along with four or five more—I recognised him and pointed him out as soon as I saw him Cross-examined Q What did you know him by A By his features and his under coat which was a sort of darkish green—I have no doubt about him WILLIAM AUSTIN POINTER I am the son of Thomas Pointer and act as clerk and cashier in his shop—I sit in a room at the side of the shop with a window that opens into the shop—I keep the books there and take the money or the meat after it has been weighed through the window—I have looked at my book and on that day there is only one lot of three legs of pork—there are several lots of two but none but that of three—the name of Scott is entered here—that is the name of the party sending the meat for sale—the scaleman calls the name out to me and then the purchaser comes and pays me—the person gave me this 10l note produced in payment—I know it by my own handwriting on it—I did not take particular notice of his dress—he had a lightish coat on—I gave him the difference 9l 0s 9d —I afterwards went to the police-station and found the prisoner in custody—there were four or five others with him—I selected the prisoner from among them—I have a strong belief he is the person—the note was paid into the London and West-minster Bank and afterwards was returned as a forged one JAMS BARTON I am an inspector of Bank of England notes This 5l -note No 56046 is a forged note in every respect and this 10l -note is also—the water-mark is forged—they are not from the same plate Cross-examined Q Are they of the same character of paper A Yes only one is a little cleaner than the other—the only difference is one is a 10l and the other is a 5l -note Witnesses for the Defence WILLIAM JONES I am the prisoner s father and have been in the service of Claridge s Asphalte Company for ten years The prisoner was employed under me for eleven weeks at the Marquis of Westminster s and at Mr Tollemache s Peckforton-castle in Cheshire—he went down there with me and my wife on 19th Sept —we left there on 9th Dec about half-past eight in the morning by the Parliamentary-train and arrived at Euston-square a few minutes past seven the same night—we went home from there and the prisoner with us—my wife was with me in the carriage and a man named Solari a labourer to me and his wife Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q When did you leave the Marquis of Westminster s A I worked there six weeks—I left on 8th Dec by the mail-train at nine o clock in the evening and went to Beeston which is about ten miles off—I went to my lodging at Peckforton near the Castle where I was at work—I lodged with a man named Hodgkinson—it is a lodging-house—my son lodged with me—there were several masons and others lodging there—I got to Beeston that evening about ten—we had some supper there with my wife and two little children that were there—we quitted there next morning at half-past eight—that train did not go through to London it changed at Crewe—I superintend the work of the Asphalte Company and am accountable for the work when we are sent into the country on a job—I keep a list of the names of the persons I employ for the Company—I have not got that book here—my son was dismissed by the Company about ten months ago—I did not put him on again in a false name—I put his name Jones Williams on the time-bill because I did not wish our foreman to know—I asked my employer if I should take him down to the country and he said I could name it to the foreman and I did not like to ask him as he had discharged him and I took him with me—I entered his name Jones Williams as working eleven weeks in Cheshire—the agent in the country who paid me the money knew he was employed—I did not acquaint the Company of it as he had been dismissed for about ten months—during that time he had been working in different employments plastering and so on—I am a plasterer myself—he worked at that and white-washing or anything he could get in different places I cannot state where because I was in the country and he was in London—he had been working in the Bastenne Company five or six years—I have not an account of where he was employed but he worked for a gentleman at Staines some time—I offered Mr Ridler 1l to give up the 5l -note then 2l and then 2l 10s —he would not take it he said the prisoner was taken—I am not always at home my work lies away from home in different parts of London—I cannot tell where I was working from the 9th to 23d Dec —I had a job on the railroad at Vauxhall somewhere about that time and at the Queen s Palace—those were the only two jobs I had since I returned to town—I was at work on the railroad the week before Christmas—my son was at home on 20th Dec —the police-officer and Mr Ridler did not come to inquire for him in the evening—they never came while I was at home—I slept at home every night—I cannot say whether my son slept at home on the nights of the 20th 21st and 22nd—he was away from home but I do not recollect what nights—he might have been away two nights—I do not know where he was—he received a guinea a-week wages at Cheshire—I am certain of that—I have never said it was 12s —I never saw him with a 5l -note in his possesion—he did not live with me at Chester but his mother washed and did for him—he did lodge with me at the other job at Beeston—that job is not yet finished but I left on the Friday with Mr Lawrence the superintendent of the work—I went to Chester with him to receive my money and he paid me on the Friday night—I was paid up to the Saturday night and my son too—I never told Mr Ridler my son could not have so much money as a 5l-note I said nothing at all about it MR BALLANTINE Q When you offered Ridler the money was your son in custody A Not when I first offered it him—I found the note had been changed by my son and I said I would pay Mr Ridler the money—I said I would pay him 1l a month and he said he was very sorry he did not keep him when he had got him—the foreman said he discharged my son for being idle there was no charge affecting his honesty—he was twenty last June MARIA JONES I am the prisoner s mother I accompanied him and my husband to Cheshire—we left London to go there on 19th Sept —we left Beeston on 9th Dec —Mr and Mrs Solari my husband and son were with me—we came up to town together and arrived a little after seven o clock—we came by the ld a mile train—my two children one seven and the other ten came with us LOUIS SOLARI I am an Italian I went into Cheshire with Jones on 19th Sept —I came back on 9th Dec the Saturday fortnight before Christmas with Jones

there to London—I left Beeston with Jones his wife son and children MR BALLANTINE Q How many jobs had you A Three—on 8th Dec I was at Peckforton-castle—Jones went to Chester to finish a little job—I was at Beeston on the Friday evening that is a mile or a mile and a half from Peckforton SARAH SOLARI I am the wife of last witness—I was down in Cheshire We left Beeston-station at half-past eight o clock on the morning of 9th Dec —my husband Mr Jones his wife son and the little boy and girl were with us—we got to town about seven or a little after Cross-examined by SIR J BAYLEY Q What makes you recollect it was 9th Dec you came to town A Because it was the Saturday fortnight before Christmas—I believe that was 9th Dec —we had been five weeks at Beeston and five weeks in Chester—we left Chester five weeks before 9th Dec James Duke a journeyman-plasterer Henry Coleman a plasterer Thomas Burt a tailor and Edward Gould a chandler of Douglas-street Westminster gave the prisoner a good

t18491126-137  137 JOHN GALLEY was indicted with William Anns not in custody for unlawfully obtaining money by false pretences MR CLARXSON conducted the Prosecution HENRY BILLSON I am assistant to George and Robert Barker pawnbrokers who have a shop at 91 Houndsditch and another at 17 High-street Aldgate—I attend at the Houndsditch shop On 26th June the prisoner brought this box produced containing a chronometer and asked if we took in chronometers—I told him Yes and asked him what he wanted on it—he said 20l —I said I would look at it but that was more than we were in the habit of advancing—for any sum advanced above 10l the Act of Parliament requires an agreement and it is called a loan—I asked him who it was made by—he said Brockbanks —I said I would take it in-doors and show it to our managing man—I came back and told him we could not advance more than 10l —he said Oh it is a very valuable article and cost a great deal of money —I went in again and our managing man asked the prisoner to step round into a private room which he did—we then looked at the article again and asked him about it—I said This is a genuine article I suppose —he said Oh yes it was bought at Brock bank s and cost 80l or 80 guineas —he was asked if it was an eight-day one—he said Yes —there is an index denoting that—we do not understand them and did not take it to pieces—I noticed this card on it and said How is it this card of Mr Carter s comes here —he said Oh it has been lately rated by Mr Carter —I asked if he had a rate and he said No he had not brought it—we then said we would make the advance 12l —he said he could not possibly take less than 15l and was on the point of leaving when he said As you won t give more than that I will take that —I advanced him the 12l —if I had known it had never been rated by Mr Carter was not made by Brockbank never had cost 80l or as many shillings and was not an eight-day ship chronometer I should not have lent him the money nor if I had known what he was—previous to my advancing the money I filled up this agreement under the statute and he read it over and signed it in my presence— produced and read— I have this day deposited with G and R Barker the following goods an eight-day ship chronometer Brockbank 462 to be held by them as security for the payment of 12l this day lent to me together with interest 15l per cent &c &c Signed 26th June 1849 John Galley 24 Liverpool-street —on 24th Oct the prisoner came again and brought a silver watch which appeared to be a chronometer—it was not given me first but afterwards was brought to the part of the shop I was in—I looked at it and said Oh this is a regular duffer who has offered it —I went down to where the man was and said to Mr Wholstenholm Oh it is the gentleman who brought the duffing chronometer —Mr Wholstenholm had the watch in his hand and said We shall detain the watch till you take out the duffing chronometer which you left in June —the time had then expired it ought to have been taken away in three months—the prisoner said Oh you detain my watch do you —Mr Wolstenholm said Yes I shall detain it until you do something about it —he was about leaving and Mr Wolstenholm said Before you go write your name that we may know who you are and he wrote on the back of this ticket— produced and read— William Anns 11 Laburnam-terrace Kingsland—road —Anns person was known at our shop for years and we should not have advanced him money on anything—I had the loan-book got out and directly he had written it I opened the loan-book to see what name he wrote there—I said You have given the name of Anns now there it is Galley it is a decided fraud —he made no answer but left the shop came back with a policeman and said to him pointing to Wolstenholme I give that person into custody for detaining my watch —I detailed the circumstances to the policeman and he said he could not do it he had better summons Mr Barker before the Lord Mayor—the prisoner said Oh you can t take him into custody —the policeman said Let us hear the case and then he said Oh it is a case of fraud I should give him into custody and the prisoner was taken—on 26th Oct I went to 24 Liverpool-street a coffee-shop—I did not find that the prisoner lived there—he was known as occasionally frequenting it but had not been there for three weeks—I afterwards went to Anns premises 11 Labernum-terrace Kingsland-road—I afterwards showed this chronometer to Messrs Brockbank and Co of Cowper s-court Cornhill and found it was never made by them and afterwards to Mr Carter the rater and found it never was rated by him Cross-examined by MR WOLLETT Q How long have you been in Mr Barker s service A Seven years he is in a large way of business—we have a number of watches in the course of the year and several chronometers but not a great many—I believe the people in our shop are considered to be very experienced—12l is not a small sum to advance taking it to be a valuable chronometer—it is not a saleable thing every day—we have sold chronometers at a sale for 12l and we have one now we can sell for 10l 10s —Brockbank s name is on this—our manager looked at it—perhaps the examination lasted a quarter of an hour—we had no opportunity of making inquiry about it—we inspected it and came to the conclusion that we could lend 12l on it—we are not practical men—it was after a very careful examination—we always look at a thing before we buy it or lend money on it—I will not give any opinion as to whether I am very anxious to convict in this case—we have had the watch examined and the watchmaker says the movements are not worth 10s it is silver—I objected to lend 5l on it—I do not call all silver watches duffers—they are obliged to put duffing works into silver cases to make them appear gennine—this case is not particularly strong for a chronometer it would be worth about 2l as a chronometer—the prisoner did not say Anns was the person s name he got the chronometer from—he gave his own name as William Anns—he wrote that—he said nothing—I afterwards went to the address and found William Anns there who I have known three years—I do not know whether the prisoner gave that to mean his own name or the man from whom he got it—no one asked him who he got the chronometer from MR CLAKKSON Q You looked at it with such judgment as you had A Yes we never had one under such circumstances before SAMUEL ELLIOTT ATKINS I belong to the firm of Atkins and Son late Brockbank s of Cowper s-court Cornhill—this chronometer has Brockbank Cornhill London and Brockbank Cowper s-court Cornhill No 462 on it—it was never made in our house we never sent it to Mr Carter—I should be very sorry to give 80s for it—with the exception of the box and the materials of which it is composed it is worth nothing at all—as a chronometer it is perfectly useless—if I had it I should not know what to do with it—this index denotes the number of days it goes without winding—upon winding it up this hand should return to the word up which indicates that it is fully wound up and it would return back day by day as it ran down—there should be a wheel within in connection with the index to operate upon it—there is a wheel inside but it has no connection at all with the index it is placed there for imposition more than anything it has no connection with any part of the work—when it was left with me the hand was at the word wind as if it had gone down seven days—I wound it up and the hand remained where it was—I took it out of the case and found that it was not connected with the wheels—it went four or five hours and lost between forty and forty-five minutes—in my judgment it was made to deceive it has no chronometical properties about it—the dial is similar to ours—I have looked at the watch it is something of the same character—there is no other firm of Brockbank and Co Cross-examined Q How many persons have you in your establishment A Five we are not frequently changing hands—I have been there twenty years and there has been only one change that was seven years ago and that man discharged himself—I cannot swear none of our workmen made this chronometer—I have frequently seen watches with our name on them which have not been our make—it never happened to us that our workmen made watches with the firm s name on them—the watch has a pretty strong silver case the name of Stafford is on it—I never saw or heard of him—I should call it a very vile imitation of a chronometer—it is valueless to me—I should be very sorry to give 5l for it—I should say it would be an extravagant price—it is difficult for me to say what it is worth it is totally out of my way MR CLARKSON Q Of course these duffing articles would find no circulation unless the outside case was silver A No JOHN CARTER I am a chronometer-maker oft Cornhill and am in the habit of rating chronometers—I have had great experience in it—my attention has been called to this chronometer and the card in the box—it is one of my cards I do not know how it got into the box—I never rated it—it is valueless and utterly incapable of being rated—that which pretends to be an index is altogether fraudulent MR WOOLLETT to HENRY BILLSON Q You saw Anns A Yes he didnot say it was his chronometer he said I suppose you want your money back —it was left for me we must settle it MR CLARKSON Q If Anns had come himself he would not have succeeded in getting any money A No I had known him ten years—I knocked at the door and one of the daughters I believe opened it—I saw Anns and he said Oh what the devil are you up to in stopping that watch —I said I have come to say nothing about any watch I have merely come to ask you a question —he said Come in and said I suppose you want your money back for the chronometer that was left for me I suppose we had better settle it are you going to have me to-night —I said I have come to say nothing about it at all I have merely come to ask you a question when you allow me to do so —he said Sit down what will you have wine or brandy or what —I said No thank you —he went on a lot about it and said As to that chap Galley I will stick to him tooth and nail if it cost me 100 000l —I said I had merely come to ask him a question WILLIAM ENGLAND BARREN I am assistant to Messrs Barker at the Aldgate shop About three o clock one day in Aug a man came to our shopbe came again two hours after with Anns and I believe he produced the same chronometer in a handkerchief—I said Anns I am glad to see you come with that man for he has been before with a chronometer and seeing you with with him I know it is not a genuine article —Anns said Oh never mind I have stuck one into your other house with old Tom for 12l Cross-examined Q You do not know the other man A No I should know him if I saw him GUILTY ** Aged 27 — Transported for Seven Years 
t18491217-239  239 ALFRED SINCLAIR obtaining goods by false pretences MESSRS CLARKSON and PAYNE conducted the Prosecution JOHN CETTA I live at No 40 Hatton-garden and am a barometer and looking-glass maker—the prisoner came to my shop on 6th Aug 1848—he gave the name of C F Barclay and Co West India merchants No 10 Maiden-lane City my clerk made the entry in this book and I made a memorandum myself in the order book—he said he was a West India merchant that he had previously exported looking-glasses and barometers and if we could agree in prices he could be a very good customer—he chose some barometers and looking-glasses in the shop and I entered the order in the order book—he said he wanted them to be shipped next morning—I said You are a stranger you must give reference —he said he could give plenty he could give a hundred references—one was Mr Crowther No 104 Bunhill-row —he gave me three references the others I could not find but I went to Mr Crowther and he said he was a very good man I might trust him to any amount—I took the goods myself the next day to Maiden-lane—I saw the warehouseman and the prisoner came when he saw the cart with the goods—he said That is right you have just come in time —he said he wanted the goods to be shipped the next morning—I saw a great many empty cases they were cases made for exportation—the prisoner came again on the 9th he ordered more goods which were sent to him—this is the order book in which I put down the goods myself while the prisoner was there—the goods altogether amounted to 42l 19s —on the day after that I took down the last goods—I saw the prisoner and he said he should want some more goods and he came up and selected almost the whole of the goods that I had in my shop amounting to 70l or 80l —that was on the 24th or 25th—that put me on my guard—I went the next day to No 10 Maiden-lane to look after my money—I saw his warehouseman but I did not see the prisoner till I saw him in custody this year—I went to his house perhaps ten or a dozen times that day—there were new cases there ready to pack COURT Q What was it induced you to let this man have these goods A His reference and then I saw the house in Maiden-lane was a very respectable house—he asked for a list of prices and then he said that he used a good many—then be gave an order for two of these and two of those—he appeared to be a business man trafficking to the West Indies—I would not have parted with my goods to him unless he had told me these things—I thought I should have a good customer—on 26th or 27th Aug I saw at Bow-lane station a barometer and a looking-glass—they were part of the goods I had trusted him with Cross-examined by MR ROBINSON Q How soon did you go to the house in Maiden-lane A The first order was given on the 6th Aug and something was said about their being shipped next day—I went to Maiden-lane on the 7th when I took the goods—when I went with the next order following I saw two or three small glasses there but the large ones were gone—that was about the 9th WILLIAM CHILD I am an officer attached to the Trade Protection Society—I received instructions and inquired after the firm of Barclay and Co —on the 25th Aug I saw Mr Cetta in Mr Barclay s warehouse in Maiden-lane—I was there and when Mr Cetta came out I had some conversation with him—the next morning I went to Mr Cetta s place—I returned to Maiden-lane and watched there about a quarter of an hour—I saw the warehouseman come out with a looking-glass and barometer wrapped up in a shawl—I had been watching the premises three or four days—I had seen that man in the shop acting as warehouseman and he told me he was warehouseman—I saw him for hours in the warehouse-when he brought the goods out I stopped him in Thames-street took the goods from him and took them to Bow-lane station—Mr Cetta saw them and recognized them—I knew the defendant by the name of Tucker—when I took him he gave me the name of Sinclair—I knew him by the name of Willis I have seen him giving that name—the name of Barclay and Co East and West India merchants was over the door in Maiden-lane—the man whom I took with the barometer and glass was taken from the station to Clerkenwell he there begged Mr Cetta to forgive him and he would give the goods up—he said he was only servant to Mr Barclay—I did not see the defendant till last Jan at the Elephant and Castle he got into an omnibus to go to Shoreditch I got into the omnibus and rode with him to Spital-square I then took him to the station—I know Mr Crowther s place he has now left—I followed some goods from Mr Barclay s ware-house to Mr Crowther s—I think it was on the day after I took the looking I glass and the barometer—I there saw about two dozen glasses and a lot of chain I which I had seen in Mr Barclay s—I have been looking for Mr Crowther I do not know where he is—the place in Maiden-lane was first designated I as Barclay and Co s about June 1848 and it continued rather better than two months before it was shut up—Crowther s place was closed a few days afterwards JOHN BOUCHER I live in Bush-lane Cannon-street The house No 10 Maiden-lane belongs to my

26th Dec the prisoner came about seven o clock in the evening he wanted some electrical machines I showed him several he selected one the price of which was fifteen guineas he selected some other articles to the amount of between 30l and 40l he gave his name as Mr Winterbottom 8 Bryanston-square he ordered them to be sent on Saturday morning to that address he then said he wanted some spectacles and pointed to some in the window—he selected a pair of gold folding spectacles at 2l 15s I will not say whether he asked to take them or whether I asked if he would take them he did take them—if he had not represented that his name was Winterbottom and that be lived in Bryanstone-square I would not have let him take them—he said he had a friend residing with him who wanted a pair of spectacles and was unable to come out and he would be glad if we would send a pair or two for his friend to select from—he desired a separate bill to be sent with them as his friend would pay for them at once and he said I will send you back a check for the amount of the things I have ordered for myself —he came again on Friday evening and said the things were not to be sent on Saturday as he should not be at home but they were to be sent on Monday and he requested to be shown the spectacles which we had looked out for his friend they were shown to him and he said he should like to take them to his friend there was some little hesitation about it from his saying at that time Mecklenburg-square but he immediately corrected himself and said Bryanstone-square—he was allowed to take them—they were worth three guineas—I went next day to 8 Bryanstone-square but did not find him Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q Was not the address given after you gave him the first pair of spectacles A No before—Mr Bland is a clerk in our house—he was examined before the Magistrate—he was present during part of the time the prisoner was there on the first occasion—I only gave the prisoner one pair of spectacles—that was not before he gave the address—I am not at issue with Mr Bland about that—I am aware of the discrepancy in the depositions but it is very easily explained Mr Bland went next door to get some other things that the prisoner wanted and in the interim the prisoner gave his address HENRY WILLIAMS I am partner with Mr Pepys in the Poultry On 27th Dec the prisoner came to the shop in the evening and asked for some surgical instruments—he selected about 25l worth—he gave his address Mr Tyrrell 24 Bryanston-square —he then said he thought he should like to take some of them

whole—the amount that he took was 3l —I made inquiry at 24 Bryanston-square but did not find him—if I had known that that was not his right name and that he did not live in Bryanstonsquare I would not

Bryanston-square and ordered them to be sent there—he wanted to take a few things with him—I went into the counting-house and spoke to the assistant and he declined letting the prisoner have the goods—when the prisoner went out I followed him and said Mr Winterbottom I believe —he said No my name is not Winterbottom it is Pettigrew I live at 6 Bryanstonsquare what is your business with me —I told him I lived at Mr Wood s and that we had an order for him in the house and should like to see him on the subject—I have not the slightest doubt that he is the man who had been there on the day mentioned—he said he had not been there at all—I asked him if he would have any objection to accompany me to Mr Wood s—he said Not the slightest —I proposed that we should go down Little Britain which is the nearest way—he said he wanted to go down by Goldsmiths Hall to speak to his wife who was in a cab—I said I would go with him—we went and there was no cab nor wife—he then said he had made a mistake it must be on further—we went down Gresham-street and when we came to Wood-street he said he thought it must be there—we went on further and then he said I had so bewildered him that he did not know where it was—he said he should like to go back to Goldsmiths Hall—we went there and there was no cab there—he then said it must be Guildhall—I said We will go there —we went on past the Church—there was a tavern there and he wanted to go in—I said if he did I would go with him and I should follow him wherever he went—he went a little way into the tavern and came out again the same way—I then saw a policeman and called him—the prisoner tried to get away but I laid hold of him and gave him into custody—he said For God s sake don t give me into custody I will go with you to

Upper-street I slington I have a son named Benjamin Thomas Hartrop—in Aug last my attention was attracted to an advertisement in the Times newspaper and I wrote a letter in answer to it—I received this answer— read 28 Broad-street-building City 26th of seventh month 1851 Respected Friend —Wilt thou be pleased to call with thy son on second day Monday at our office as above between 12 and 13 o clock for particulars in answer to X Y Z We are thy friends Chadwick and Co To Thomas Hartrop ironmonger Upper-street Islington —In consequence of this went to 28 Broad-street-buildings Chadwick and Co was painted on a white ground and also on the office door—I went in and saw the defendant—I told him I had called with my son according to the appointment—I asked if his name was Chadwick he said Yes —he was dressed as a Quaker and spoke like a Quaker—he stated that he had a partner named Milson but unfortunately he had lost the late election for the borough of St Albans—he told me that he himself was a preacher and a member of the Society of Friends—on these representations and considering that he was a respectable man I parted with my money—he wished me to forward him some money—6l was to be paid down and 1l 1s for a copy of the indenture—some time afterwards I received this other letter read — 28 Broad-street-buildings to Thomas Hartrop Respected Friend—Not seeing thee on Wednesday I left town on Thursday for two days I will see thee as above to-morrow 2 o clock at which time I have desired the solicitor to come or send his clerk to witness the signing of indenture Charles Chadwick —He said at the first interview that he did not require any premium with my son but would require something like 30l to buy books and instruments and other things that were requisite in the profession of an architect—I afterwards received this other letter from him— read— 7th of tenth month 1851 Respected Friend—If 5l is paid me this day or to-morrow 2l for the instalment and 3l the balance of the solicitor s charges I undertake not to ask thee for any more instalment for three months respecting the stamp of the indenture if thou wish I will fulfill all the covenants without a stamp Thine respectfully Charles Chadwick —I signed an indenture on parchment this is it—it was drawn up by Mr Williams an attorney—I never saw the attorney—it is witnessed by a youth named Armiger— The indenture witnessed that the prosecutor s son Benjamin Thomas Hartrop was articled to the defendant for three years the sum of 30l to be paid by the prosecutor 7l down and the rest by monthly installments of 11 Q How much money did you pay under that A 6l and 1l 1s for the copy of the indenture—he gave me this receipt produced —my son went in Aug and remained till 10th Nov when he went and the office was shut up—I went there myself and found the empty room—I never knew Mr Milson the partner—I could not get in the place where Mr Chadwick carried on his business as civil engineer—his name was erased and another name painted on Williams solicitor Cross-examined by MR CHARNOCK Q Do you know how much was paid for engrossing this document A He told me 1l 1s was paid—I never saw this paper looking at one —I do not recollect that he told me he paid 6s 4d for engrossing—this 6l was to be laid out in books and drawing-boards and other things—the signature to this paper looking at one looks like my son s—I know my son brought home a book called Salisbury Cathedral —I do not know whether he was charged 2l 10s for it—it was not worth that—I did not see the receipts Q Did he bring home some architectural precedents A Yes and some 2d books—he brought home a drawing-board—I do not know whether he had any Indian rubber—he had no pencils of Chadwick he had bundles of pencils of his own Q Were you willing to take 5l to settle this business A I certainly should have taken 5l I should not have been perfectly satisfied I considered my son was injured—if I had been paid 5l I should not have looked after Chadwick—I never saw him—he sent me a very impertinent letter—he refused to give me 5l —my son went on 12th Aug on trial for a month—I believe Chadwick gave him 3s —he told me he would give the boy 3s a week—he gave him one 3s —I do not know that he gave him any more—I have not studied this book of Salisbury Cathedral—he might as well have bought the child a picture-book in my

wick absconding and leaving my son—he told me he was not in misfortune—I parted with my money considering he was a respectable man—my son brought home a bit of board—I never paid anything for this book—he told my son to bring it home and study it—I know that architectural books are very dear MR HUDDLESTON Q You parted with your money believing the prisoner to be a respectable man A Yes he told me he was an engineer and surveyor—I thought he was a respectable man because he said he was a Quaker and that he was partner with the ex-member for St Albans—that induced me to think he was a respectable man—this book is An Historical Account of the Cathedral Church of Salisbury —the way I came to say anything about the 5l was a person of the name of Wilson called on me representing

received no drawings—I received some tracing-paper very thin transparent—I did not take that home it was left at the office—I received some drawing-paper to practice on the value of all I had was about 1s —I copied plans of old copies which were lying about—I was there a month on liking—I was very regular in ray attendance—I really do not know how I came to sign this indenture as we had no

at Sherbourn Castle in Dorsetshire About the end of Oct I received a letter purporting to come from Captain Newton—I destroyed the letter—the purport of it was to raise a subscription for Mrs Bissett who was left the widow of Captain Bissett of the Royal Navy that she was left very destitute with several children—there was a paper enclosed in the letter containing the names of persons—I understood

the prisoner—my husband keeps the Maltster beer-house at Greenwich—I cannot say on what day I received it of the prisoner it was early in November—I am sure I gave the same note to my daughter—I had no other Cross-examined Q Do many persons frequent your beer-house A Yes I remember I received this note from the prisoner because I took the money from my rent to change the note and I put the note with my rent—I did not put any mark on the note I put it with the sovereigns to pay my rent up-stairs in my drawer—no one had the key of that drawer but myself—my husband has not the key he never wants to go to that drawer—I will swear that from the time I received the note till I took it out he never had the key—he never has the key—there are not two keys to it—I received the note from the prisoner at the bar—there was a short man with him who he gave some half-and-half to—I am sure I had this note from the prisoner—I never had another 5l note in my possession for the last six or eight

previous to his being taken I do not think he did—the two nights before he did—I received two 5l notes from him but not at one time—I received the last note from him about an hour or two hours before he was taken into custody—I cannot answer whether at the time I received the second 5l note I had in my possession the other 5l note that I received from him—I might have had it or I might not—I think I received it two or three days before—I remember I paid Mr Berry two 5l notes but I cannot say whether they were what I received from the prisoner—I might have had other 5l —notes in my possession

about eighteen months COURT Q You cannot tell whether you had another 5l note because you gave one to some woman can you tell whether you had two others A No I am positive I had not Cross-examined Q You had frequently been applied to for change can you venture to say that between the time of your receiving the 5l note from the prisoner and your paying Mr Berry that you had not any other note A I cannot I might have received a note and paid it away without noticing it—I had paid one to this woman and that I had forgotten at my examination MR BODKIN Q It was on 8th Nov he was taken A I cannot recollect that—there was a disturbance and I asked the cause—they would not tell me—they told me they were officers—I told them I did not wish to disturb them but I did not wish to have ray place knocked about—the officers had hold of the prisoner and a man who was with the prisoner resisted—he was a man about the size of the prisoner—I had seen him with the prisoner at other times at my house—he called him Jos that is all I know ANN PRICE I live at 84 Bridge-street Greenwich—I saw the prisoner at my house in Greenwich on 1st Nov to the best of my knowledge—there was a female with him

the way—he said he was not so fortunate himself but he hoped to be set on at Mr Perry s—he did not say what his name was but some days after he asked me if a letter came in the name of Newton would I take it in—I said Yes —he and the woman remained with me ten days—during the time he was there I did not address him by any name—I very seldom saw him—his wife waited on him—I addressed his wife by the name of Mrs Newton and his friend and his wife passed by the name of Wilson—they came the same day that he did—I did not take any letter in COURT Q What sized man was that Wilson A Not quite so tall as the prisoner but he was a tall man—the prisoner took my apartment for one week and as he could not give a reference he paid 5s and at the end of the week they paid up the rest—the week s rent was 9s —they staid ten days altogether—they staid three days more than the week and went away without paying Cross-examined Q The prisoner did not mention any name and the other man went by the name of Wilson A Yes his wife asked me if a letter came in the name of Wilson to take it in—I spoke to the prisoner s wife as Mrs Newton—that was not till after they said about the letter—I do not think I ever called her Mrs Newton—all I knew was that he said if a letter came in the name of Newton to take it in COURT Q When Mrs Wilson spoke to you about taking in a letter for her was the prisoner by A No I do not think he was JOHN CLUTTERBUCK re-examined These are the three notes I paid for the check Cross-examined Q What makes you know them A I entered them in the book—it is my course of business

employed at Greenwich in Nov last—I remember delivering a letter addressed Captain Newton R N at No 34 Bridge-street—it was quite the early part of Nov —it was the General Post delivery—a person accosted me in the street and asked if I had a letter for Captain Newton R N —I said Very likely I have but not knowing you I must deliver it as it is directed —I went round where I had to go and when I got to Mrs Price s I found the same man close at my heels—when the door was opened he pushed in and took the letter out of my hand—the door was half opened and he pushed in—I do not know who the man was WILLIAM HORSFORD I am a policeman in the service of the Mendicity Society I have known the prisoner in the name of Gill Smith Jones and various other names—I never knew him in the name of Newton till this time—I have known him four or five years CHARLES JAMSS FRANKLIN NEWTON I am a Commander in the Royal Navy I never knew of another officer of the same name—there is no other Captain Newton in the navy but myself—I did not make or know of any application to Lord Digby for assistance for the wife and children of Captain Bissett Cross-examined Q How many captains are there in the navy A About 500 and rather more than that number of commanders—there are rather more than 1 000 altogether—I know by the records that there is no other Captain Newton but me—we all know the records—I have a navy list every fortnight sent me by authority of the Board of Admiralty—I have searched the records from which the navy list is made up—I was looking at the navy list this morning MR BODKIN Q Is it possible there could be a Captain Newton in the navy without your knowing it A It is impossible RICHARD FERGUSON I am clerk to the Mendicity Society I have been to the Admiralty and find only one Captain Newton in the list of captains—I accompanied the officer to the back parlour of the public-house in Lower Thames-street—a violent scuffle took place in the back parlour—a man was with the prisoner a shortish man—they both resisted very much—the land-lord was there—he wanted to drive us all out—he said he would not have a row in his house—the charge was stated to be obtaining money under false pretences Cross-examined Q Did you search the list of commanders at the Admiralty as well A No I found one Captain Newton—the book was presented to me by the person appointed JAMES FREDERICK LEWIS WOOD I am a Commander in the Royal Navy I know of no Captain Newton in the navy but the gentleman who is here present and I am satisfied there is no other Cross-examined Q How do you know A I have had the pleasure of knowing Captain Newton from my first entering the service—I have been to the Admiralty and the books were searched by a clerk and that information was given me—I know from the authorised records that there if no other Captain Newton COURT to LORD DIOBY Q Did you observe the post-mark on the letter you received A Yes it was Lambeth I think Cross-examined Q You say you think there was the Lambeth post-mark have you a distinct recollection of it A I think so—there was the name of a street mentioned inside the letter—I looked at the post-mark—I think it was Lambeth GUILTY Aged 33 — Transported for Seven Year Horsford stated that he had had the prisoner in custody seven times and that he had been twenty-five months imprisoned for sending begging letters 
t18520202-237  237 HENRY CROMWELL again indicted for obtaining goods by false pretences MR ROBINSON conducted the Prosecution HENRY MEADEN I am clerk to Robert Kalloway Meaden a wine merchant who lives in Walbrook he succeeded Mr Alexander in the business About 28th or 29th Nov the prisoner called at our counting-house—he asked if our gin rum and brandy were good—I told him they were—he said he had been in the habit of dealing with Mr Alexander and found his articles good—I said we had a large stock of Mr Alexander s on hand—he said he had paid Mr Alexander 700l in two years and he had sold to some persons and be should want some samples—he said he wanted two hogshead of gin two hogsheads of rum from fifteen to twenty dozen of fine old crusted port and thirty dozen of champagne—on his making this statement I let him have three samples of gin rum and whisky in bottles about half a pint each—when he said he had dealt with Mr Alexander I was going to refer to the books to find his name—he said he always paid ready money and Mr Alexander never entered his name I should not find his name in the books—it was what the prisoner had told me and his representing himself a customer of Mr Alexander s that induced me to let him have these samples—I afterwards had a communication with Mr Alexander—the prisoner was to call at 12 o clock next day to take away fifty gallons of gin with him and he was to pay in cash—he called at the appointed time—I asked him how much he should want—he said he should not take it that day he would take it next day and in the meantime he had made larger sales and should want larger samples—I told him I had seen Mr Alexander and he knew nothing of him—he then said he did not know Mr Alexander neither did Mr Alexander know him but it was through customers that he had sent him that he had dealt with him—I asked him to mention the name of any one customer—he was not able to do it but he wished me to let him look at the book and be would point out several—I refused to show him the book and he left Prisoner Q What time in the day did I call first Witness About 11 or 12 o clock—it is usual when we want to make sales to induce some person to take samples and show—I do not know whether a four ounce bottle will hold half a pint—I never measured it—I remember your coming back and saying you wanted fifty gallons of gin—I do not know exactly what kind of gin or what the price of gin was then perhaps 9s 2d —I never recollect a case where strangers came and paid money before they received the goods—I told you we would not send oat the goods without the money—I do not remember that you said it was a respectable house and Goldings the brewer s might be referred to—you said you were well known to Mr Alexander and had done business with him and through that I let you have the samples—I did not ask you the first day whether you knew Mr Alexander—you told me you did know him well and his family—I said Mr Alexander was next door and you said it was no consequence he did not know you—sometimes the party to whom you sell goods will require the original sample to be left to see whether you will send goods equal to the sample—when you came hack you asked me for a larger sample of that which was sold and I declined it without money was paid for the goods and you declined all further connection with me COURT Q When goods are sold by sample and that sample is left with the customer is it usual for a larger sample to be sent out A I never knew it to be done—I refused to give him larger samples because Mr Alexander knew nothing of him—I told him if he would leave money sufficient to cover the expense of the sample he should have it—I refused to let him have them unless he would leave money on the gin he was to have next day—I do not recollect that the house was named where the gin was to go to—he said a customer of his named David Wells WILLIAM ALEXANDER I had that business till Aug last—I never saw the prisoner till he was at the Mansion-house—he never paid me a farthing Prisoner I never said the words that are attributed to me I never named Mr Alexander but on one occasion he asked me if I knew Mr Alexander I said I knew him by name that was all I went there as every other commercial man does under the impression that it was a respectable house I said I am a commercial traveller he was very glad of my proposal to sell for him he gave me four samples I did succeed with one for fifty gallons of gin at 9s 2d to Mr Wells of the White Horse I told him I had effected this sale and I supposed his were the usual terms of the trade provided he was satisfied with the respectability of the man I told him I should require the original sample for Mr Wells that always ratifies the transaction he refused that and I told him I could not lose my time any longer I would go elsewhere he said his brother would be borne in a few days and I expected his brother would be no better than himself all my expenses were out of my own pocket if he had applied to Coding s and found the man not entitled to credit I would have sustained the loss but he has never tried it but in his own stupid way he deprived me of the money I spent and the commission GUILTY Aged 38 — Transported for Seven Years There was another indictment against the prisoner

t18520920-868  868 CORNELIUS JULIUS TRIPE and HENRY GRAHAM MONTAGUE were indicted for unlawfully obtaining 11l of John Jones and 9l of James Gowland by false pretences MESSRS BODKIN and PARRY conducted the Prosecution JOHN JONES I live at 6 Durham-place Dalston I was formerly a farmer residing at Chingford in Essex In June this year I was desirous of emigrating and sold off for that purpose—I intended to proceed to Port Philip in Australia—on 25th June I was passing through Austin-friars and saw a board hanging out in the yard against a tree at No 6—there was a large placard on the board with red letters on which was Gold Mineral Company or something of that sort—it was about emigration—it said the vessel was going to Port Philip—I did not read it—I went upstairs to the second floor into what appeared to be the office of the company—I saw the prisoners and three other persons—Mr Greenwood was one—the title of the company was on the doorposts of the office—I spoke to Mr Tripe and asked him about the vessel going to Australia—I told him I had seen the board below and asked him if he had anything to do with it—he said he had and I told him I wanted to go to Port Philip—he said We have a vessel going —I asked him how much he would take us for—he said 25l each —I asked him how much he would take off for four to a certainty and it might be six including myself—he said he would take 3l each off—I asked him to take 3l each off and he said very likely he would but he would see when we came to pay the money—he gave me this bill with a dietary scale on it produced —it says they allow a bottle of wine a week and a pint of beer a day—I was attracted by that I thought it was very good living on the water—I am a Welchman—I asked him when the vessel was going and where she was—he said she was going between the 15th and 20th July— he had named the Camilla to me —I wanted to go and see the vessel and he wrote this bit of paper produced and gave it me—he said she was at the West India Docks—it has on it Camilla W I Docks Import Dock —he said it was a very quick voyage she had come home ten days sooner than any other one had come from Sidney here—I asked him if it belonged to a good firm—he said the company was very respectable that there was a lord belonging to it they were a gold mineral company and that they had engaged the ship— In fact he said we engage the ship and that it had been surveyed and found all right he did not say by whom—it was next day when we went to pay the money that he said there was a lord belonging to it I had asked him if it was safe for me to pay my money—I cannot remember what I said it is so long ago—I did not see Montague the first day—after that conversation with Tripe we left the office—a man named Barker was with me—I went with him to the West India Docks and went on board the Camilla and next day we went to the office again—we met Tripe coming out into the street as we were waiting for another person to meet us—I told him we were coming to pay him the money but we were waiting for another man to come up and I asked him what he would take off—I said he must take off 3l each as there were four of us to pay the money—he said It is a great deal to take off but I will do it —he ran indoors Barker and me remaining outside—he came out again and said I have made it all right with Mr Montague that he was going on business and we had better go upstairs—he then went away from the officer—I went upstairs with Barker and Wagner and saw Montague in a private room not the room in which I had seen Tripe—I told him we were going to pay part of the money for the Camilla to go to Australia and said My name it Jones —he said Oh ah it is all right —I said I suppose Mr Tripe settled the fare with you how much I am to pay —he said Oh yes —while we were talking Tripe came in and I said You said Mr Tripe you would take 3l each off did not you —he said Oh yes that is right Mr Montague —I said I saw the Camilla and the mate and he said it was all right they have been looking at it they have settled with it to go out—Montague and tripe said it was a very fine qcick-passaged vessel—Montague said the vessel was engaged by the company to go out—I am sure of that and Tripe said also the vessel was engaged but he did not tell me who by but he was present and must have heard what Montague said—we were to pay 11l each—that was the half of the passage money—I laid the money on the table—Tripe counted it and Montague put it into the drawer wrote this receipt and gave it to me— read—Australian Gold and General Mining Company 6 Austin-friars London June 26 1852 Mr J Jones has paid the sum of 11l as deposit money on board the Camilla the balance 11l to be paid at this office prior to embarkation H G MONTAGUE Age 48 description of accommodation intermediate to have accommodation for self and friends in the cabin of the ship —after I had paid my money but before the others paid theirs I saw a copy of the dietary scale on the table and noticed that the pint of porter a day and the bottle of wine per week was struck out—this is the paper produced —I said to both Tripe and Montague This won t do for us you are going to keep the porter and wine from us —Tripe said It is not in the intermediate —I said Yes it is —he said I will show it to Mr Montague and then he looked at it and said Yes it is well whatever there is there you shall have —after that the two Barkers and Wagner paid their money 11l each—I saw that—the second Barker was not with us his brother paid for him he did not join us at all—when Tripe said We have engaged the Camilla to go to Australia I believed him and when Montague told me so the second time I believed it or else I should not have paid my money—I believed the representations they made—afterwards in consequence of something that occurred I made inquiries of various persona and about a fortnight after paying the money I went again to Austin-friars but could not find the defendants they hsd left the office—there were other persons inquiring as well as myself—I eventually found out that the offices were removed to 26 Harp-lane from the clerk to Tripe and Montague whom I happened to meet that day—Harp-lane is near the Custom-house—I called there several times and eventually saw Tripe—that was six or seven days at near as I can recollect after I had paid the money—I asked Tripe about our money back—he told me Mr Montague had all the money—I said Mr Tripe I am come here after my money I understand this vessel it not going at all or something like that— there were three men with me outside —he called me into the private counting-house alone and said he was very sorry he could not pay the money then but not to make any noise about it—I said I would not make any noise if he would pay me the money—he told roe Mr Montague had all the money and was at Bristol that he Tripe was going to charter a vessel and he expected Montague back every day—I told him he was telling a falsehood for that Montague was in Whitecross-street—Tripe then said he was—I again asked him for my money—he said he could not give it to me he had not got it Montague had it— previous to that I had been to Montague —I said I would go to Montague —I went and found him in Whitecross-street prison—I told him I was very sorry to see him there and said I have come after my money Mr Tripe says you have got it —he said he had not that Tripe had it—he said Tripe had everything and that he was taken there for debt for the rent—he said he would write me a letter directly to Tripe to give me the money back—his wife wrote the note and he signed it and gave it to me—he begged me not to be too hard upon him for the sake of his wife and children—he said I was to be quick and without doubt Tripe would pay me the money back that he should be very sorry that any bother should be made about it or for his name to be published—I said I wanted my money—I took the note to Tripe the same day—I did not get the money—when I delivered him the note he said he had not got any money that Montague had the 10l I do not know what 100l —other persons were with me when I went back to Tripe—we all went to Captain Lane the Government inspector of emigration next day and the matter was brought before a Magistrate Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q The first thing that attracted your attention to the office was a paper posted on a board A Yes—I have not got it here—it was handed to me at the Mansion House by somebody and I handed it back again—I do not remember whether there were on it the names of certain gentlemen as directors of the company—I did not read it through but went into the office—during all these conversations I thought there was a company—I parted with my money on the faith that I could go to Australia in the Camilla —I thought there was a company—I cannot say whether I should have parted with my money if I had thought there was not—I should not have parted with it unless I thought it was safe—I thought Tripe was very respectable and Mr Montague as well and I paid it to them—I asked them if there was a company and they said there was—I asked that because I saw on the post that there was one—I asked if it was respectable and they said yes—I should not have parted with my money if I had thought they were going to swindle me out of it—I asked the question whether there was a company and whether it was respectable for the purpose of governing me in my conduct—I meant if they were not respectable not to part with my money—no prospectuses were shown me with the names of persons as directors on them—Tripe told me there was a company and that they were sitting twice or three times a week—he did not show me the names but he told me some of them—he said Lord Kilworth was one—he did not give me his address or show it to me—he said Major Hawkes was another—he did not give me his address—he told me Mr Edward Rudson Read wine merchant of Mark-lane was another—and that Captain Smith was one—he did not tell me that Charles Brown was another—he said John Lutwyche was one—he did not say of Hendon—he did not tell me that the Hon Charles Plunkett or Mr Hudson or Richard Burton were others—he told me that Mr Greenwood was secretary—Mr Greenwood was present the greater part of the time when the representations were made not every time but twice or three times—he was present on the 25th and 26th at Austin-friars—Barker a friend of mine was also present—Greenwood was present during the whole of the conversation with Tripe on the 25th and on the 26th he came in when I was paying the money—I saw no gentlemen during any of those periods besides Tripe and Greenwood—I saw three or four young men sitting there writing—I saw Major Hawkes at the Mansion House—I do not know Lord Kilworth—I heard the Alderman say something about him—his name was mentioned publicly before the Alderman and the names of Major Hawkes Captain Smith John Lutwyche and Mr Greenwood also—I do not recollect that Mr Rudson Read s name was mentioned—Tripe never told me he himself was a director—I treated him as a clerk in the employment of the company—Tripe did not refer to Greenwood on 26th from time to time before he answered my questions—Greenwood did not when the vessel s name was mentioned write the piece of paper which enabled us to go on board—he put these figures on the back of it remarking that 3l was too much to take off—Barker was present—I am not aware that Greenwood and Tripe spoke together after Greenwood had written the figures on the paper—I cannot pledge myself whether they did or did not—90l was mentioned but I do not know whether by Greenwood or Tripe—Tripe told us he would let us kuow next day whether they could take 90l —I was spokesman for the party—I asked what they would take half a dozen for—I do not know which of them it was answered 140l —all the money was paid to Montague—Greenwood was present at the time walking backwards and forwards—he is a man of about fifty years of age I should imagine—I went on board the vessel and saw a person on board who said he was the mate and that the ship was engaged—I have never seen him since Cross-examined by MR SLEIGH Q During the interviews you had with Montague at various times did he tell you he was about going out in the vessel himself as mineralogist to the company A He did—when I told Tripe I knew where Montague was that he was in Whitecross-street prison he said he had bolted with the swag MR PARRY Q Besides the statements about the company did you believe the statement made by the prisoners about having engaged the Canilla A Yes I did—that also operated on my mind to induce me to part with my money—it was between 11 and 12 in the day on 25th June that I first saw Tripe JAMES BARKER I have been assistant to a grocer in Kent About June last year I made up my mind to emigrate to Australia—I know Jones—I went with him on 25th June to Austin-friars and saw Tripe Jones had some conversation with him—I heard Tripe use the phrase We are going to have the Camilla —I went there again next day with Jones—we met Tripe in the street in Austin-friars—he asked us if we had come to pay the money we said yes provided he would take off 3l each—he agreed to do that—we afterwards went up to the office where we had been before and saw Montague who said he was going in the ship with us—there were four of us—we each paid 11l Mr Montague counted the money and gave us receipts—Tripe was there and Montague put one of the sums Mr Jones s into his hand to count—Montague signed the receipts—this is my receipt produced —I do not remember the term Chartered for the voyage being used—they both said they were going to have the Camilla—Jones had some private conversation—I paid 22l —I parted with it because I believed I was paying it to a respectable company for a passage in the ship Camilla to Australia—I believed that the prisoners had authority to sell me that passage I never got any of my money back or my passage—after the offices were shut up I saw Mr Tripe at Captain Lane s office next morning after we had complained—I did not see Montague afterwards till I saw him in court at the Mansion House Cross-examined by MR METCALFE Q Did you hear the names of the directors mentioned A Yes I saw a prospectus at Captain Lane s office of The Australian Gold and General Mining Company or something of that sort—I saw Lord Kilworth s and Major Hawkes s names on it—I did not hear from Tripe and Montague that those gentlemen were directors of the company—I do not remember that any directors were mentioned—I did not hear who the directors were before I parted with my money—I saw Mr Greenwood—I was not aware of his being the secretary I know that he was consulted about my paying less and he agreed that 90l should be taken for the lot—I saw him figure with a pen on a piece of paper the next moment after he was asked to deduct something—he was there I believe when the receipt was given for my money—the heading of it is The Australian Gold and General Mining Company —Mr Tripe was not present all the time on the second occasion he was absent about half the time—I saw some of the gentlemen I understood to be directors at the Mansion House—I saw Lord Kilworth and Major Hawkes they were present when this matter was investigated—I have not seen them here to-day—I went on board the Camilla in the West India Docks and saw the mate Cross-examined by MR SLEIGH Q On the second occasion when you were present at the office did you hear the conversation which took place between Tripe and Mr Jones about the directors of the company did you hear Jones ask Tripe whether it was respectable A I heard him ask Mr Montague whether it was respectable whether the company was all right—I do not remember whether Tripe was present at that time—I do not remember that on that occasion I heard that a lord was one of the directors—Montague Tripe and Mr Greenwood were present on the second occasion I cannot exactly say whether they were all there when the money was paid but Montague and Tripe I know were—I saw a book on the table in the room—I cannot remember whether Greenwood was present at that time or not—I knew him personally at that time but not by name—there might have been a third person present when I paid the money I cannot say—I saw Mr Tripe make an entry in a book when the money was paid MR BODKIN Q Did you know that there was any company except what they told you A No down to the time of my paying the money nobody interfered except the two prisoners—I saw the whole of the gentlemen who were on the prospectus at the Mansion House they were there in consequence of the case—one party was examined on their behalf and they were discharged and the prisoners were committed for trial COURT Q You said that Montague said he was going out with you in the ship A Yes he said he was going to the mines for the company—Mr Dawson a solicitor was examined at the Mansion House on behalf of Major Hawkes and the other gentlemen—Mr Gowland was examined—Major Hawkes was not examined in my presence nor was Lord Kilworth—I believe Major Hawkes was represented by counsel on that occasion ROBERT EWART SHAW I am a clerk in the firm of Messrs Willis and Co ship brokers of Crosby-square In June last they were brokers of the Camilla which was lying in the West India Docks—if any arrangement had been made with reference to the Camilla it would have come under my cognisance in the regular course of business—I have seen both the defendants—I saw Mr Tripe first it was at the office of what I believed to be the company in Austin-friars—I went there in consequence of receiving two notes from Mr Tripe—I believe those notes are destroyed I have tried to find them but have not got them—I have searched in all likely places—I put them in my pocket and as I am in the habit of destroying anything that is of no use I have no doubt that they are destroyed—they requested me to call on Mr Montague at the office—it was in consequence of the second letter that I went—I believe it was on 25th June about 4 o clock in the afternoon—that was the first time I called—I saw Tripe there—he brought me into a room marked Board room and there I saw Mr Montague—I told him I had come in consequence of those notes to learn what he had to propose for the Camlla the notes had mentioned the Camilla —we had a general conversation the words of which I do not remember—he said he would send us a positive offer the following morning by 10 for the charter of the Camilla and the conversation ended—Tripe was present during the whole of the time—there was a sum spoken of for chartering the Camilla about 2 400l and I think I said we should expect about 2 500l —there were various sums mentioned during the conversation—I heard nothing more from the defendants about the Camilla—that was the first interview I had a subsequent one—there was no proposition sent to us the following morning—the other interview I had was in consequence of it having come to our ears that passages had been engaged for the Camilla—that was about fourteen days afterwards—I saw Mr Montague at the same office in Austin-friars—I told him we had heard it and we could not allow it and I came to see what he had to say before we took steps to put a stop to it—he said as near as I can remember that he understood that passages had been taken and that he regretted it and would take care it should not happen again and that the money should be returned—that was all that passed between us—Tripe was not present at that interview I have not seen him since—the 2 400l would have had to be paid for the chartering before the vessel was permitted to go on her voyage—I had never given any authority either to Tripe or Montague to engage berths in the Canilla—I have told all that passed on the subject Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q Did you see anybody else from the company A No I saw a person of the name of Railton he was acting as a broker I believe on behalf of the company—I believe he is a broker—I knew him as a clerk in a counting house with which we had business—it is matter of opinion whether he is a well known ship broker—he was negotiating with us on the subject matter of this ship—that was some considerable time before I saw either Tripe or Montague—it was for the Camilla and previously for another vessel over a period occasionally of three weeks or a month it came to nothing—I saw Greenwood at the office of the company the second time I called—I spoke to him but nothing on the subject of the chartering—I saw a gentleman who was afterwards pointed out to me at the Mansion House as Major Hawkes he was writing at a table in the office in the board room—I did not see any of the other directors that I am aware of—I saw no prospectuses there—I did not see one at the Mansion House—I saw one I think here last session at the time we were waiting for the Grand Jury—there no doubt would be a mate on board the Camilla but I am not aware of the fact—he would be the officer in command in dock when the captain was ashore—the owners of the Camilla are Fletcher and Sons of Limehouse a negotiation could have been opened directly with them—the Camilla had not been advertised at that time—in chartering a ship any man can act as broker who can find employment for a ship—we were not employed by Messrs Fletcher to let the vessel we had no authority to let it without their sanction but we knew if we could let it the Fletchers would be extremely glad to avail themselves of our services—the broker is asked if he can recommend a vessel that was the case in this instance we were asked to recommend a vessel there are plenty of brokers in the City of London to any of whom these parties might have gone—a deposit of 100l would not be sufficient to secure the ship a deposit of 500l might but that question was mooted by me with Mr Montague—I did not hear anything said about the company I took no note of it Cross-examined by MR SLEIGH Q You mentioned the receipt of two notes from the office of the Company what time intervened between the int note and the second A I received one one day and the other the day following MR PARRY Q You had given no authority to the mate to represent that the Camilla was chartered by this Company A No I did not enter into any arrangement with Mr Railton it was simply a treaty nothing was ever concluded—the Camilla is now loading in London for Port Philip she is not hired by the Government Commissioners but by ourselves—we have not chartered her we are loading her simply on behalf of the owner MR BALLANTINE Q Was not a written agreement entered into A No—not with Railton—I drew out a paper—I do not know who has it—I gave it to Mr Railton MR PARRY Q Was any paper signed or any contract entered into with you by Railton A Certainly not no contract whatever—after I had seen Railton I saw Montague JAMES GOWLAND I am an engraver In June last I was desirous of sending a nephew of mine out to Australia—on 28th June I was going along Lime-street and observed a board in front of No 8 with two bills on it one was of a ship going out and the other was headed Australian Gold and Emigration Company —I did not read any more—I went into the house No 8 and found Tripe there and a little boy—I asked Tripe if they had any vessels going to Australia—he said yes they had got a very nice one just come home from Valparaiso and that she would be going out to Port Philip about 20th July—I asked the name and he told me it was the Medicis—he did not say whose ship she was or who had the management or ownership—I talked about hiring a passage for my nephew and asked him the price—he told me for the open steerage 18l —I asked if I could see the ship and he went with me and my nephew to the City canal where we found a French vessel of that name—I went on board of her—Tripe accompanied us and went over the vessel—it was not fitted up—he said the Government offcer Would soon be over it no doubt he wouid pass it and she would be readyfor the dry dock in afew days—I understood him that the company had engaged the ship that he was engaged by the company and that the company had chartered the ship—I will undertake to swear I understood him to say that the company had engaged the ship and she would go out in a very short time—he used the word chartered —he gave me no further information of what the company was or who composed it but I understood from Tripe that they were a respectable company—I found a French crew on board the ship—I spoke about that to Tripe and he said that in the charter half the crew were to be English—I did not then arrange with Tripe to pay the money for the passage—we came back to Lime-street and I wanted to see a dietary scale he gave me a bill and said the dietary would be the same as the Abel Gower then after some conversation I asked him if he could give me a list of the company he looked about but could not find one but he told me they were perfectly respectable gentlemen—I told him as the Government officer had not yet passed the ship as soon as he had done so if he wrote to me I would come down and pay the money—he said the company could not do that because there were only two or three places vacant and they could not keep them for me and on those terms I was obliged to pay the money to secure a place—I then paid half the passage money amounting to 9l —he gave me this receipt— read— No 18 Lime-street June 28 1852 Mr H Gowland has paid the sum of 9l as deposit on account of passage in the ship Medicis captain blank bound for Port Philip direct the balance 9l to be paid at this office prior to embarkation Name Henry Hammond—one—adult—steerage Signed for the charterers E J Tripe —this Tomlin and Co 63 Cornhill was scratched out when he gave it to me—soon after that I found it necessary to make inquiries and I called on Mr Stevens in the course of the same week—he is one of the firm of Stevens and Railton brokers—in consequence of what I told him he accompanied me to 6 Austin-friars—he inquired if Tripe was in but he was not—he called again with me a few days afterwards and we found Tripe there—he spoke to me first—he told me he was going to write to me that night but he had been so very busy or else he should have done so before that the Medicis was not going out but the company had engaged some other ships which were to take the name of The Star of the South Packets that I should see an advertisement in the paper the day following announcing the fact and that one which was coming up from the Clyde was to be called the City of Melbourne and I was to see the vessel with a fine flag at the mast with a gold star—I did not look out for the gold star but I looked outhead for the advertisement and saw one but not the flaming one which was promised—the reason he gave that the vessel did not go was that the Government officer would not pass her—I shortly afterwards made a communication to Captain Lane the Government agent which resulted in my going to the Mansion House—I have never got the passage for my nephew or the return of my money Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q Were the names of the directors mentioned A No not at any time RICHARD JOHN EDWARDS I am a ship broker carrying on business with my father at 66 Lower Thames-street—we were brokers for the ship Medicis—she was lying in the City Canal on 26th June last—I have seen both the prisoners—the first time was on the 22nd June—it was on account of somebody from the office going on board the Medicis and stating as the captain interpreted it that the vessel was chartered to go to Port Philip—the captain is a Frenchman—the vessel was not chartered on 22nd June to go to Port Philip—I saw both the defendants at Austin Friars—they said they had merely gone on board to look at our ship among a number of others which was satisfactory—I asked them what was the utmost price they would give for the ship provided the owners would allow her to go to Port Philip— they had said nothing to me about chartering the vessel before that —they said 5l a registered ton—the vessel was 384 tons French register 464 English—I informed them that I would communicate with the owners and immediately I got a reply I would let them know—on Friday the 25th I saw Mr Montague twice to the best of my recollection and Mr Tripe once—Mr Tripe was in the outer office—he conducted me into the board room where Montague was—there was some conversation about chartering the Medicis—the negotiation went on from the 25th to 28th but no arrangement was concluded about chartering the vessel—it went off for want of a sufficient guarantee—I asked them for the guarantee—I asked them if they could give me the names of four of the directors and their signatures to this document by which I meant the signatures of the directors themselves—they did not produce the signatures of any directors to me—neither of them undertook to do it—that was suggested on the last occasion the 28th—Mr Montague said he could not ask for it but he pointed to a sum of money lying on the table which was to be at our disposal on signing the contract and which was stated to be 100l but they offered no guarantee of any kind—that 100l was to be the first instalment if the matter was carried out—this paper produced was drawn up by me as the terms on which the vessel was to be chartered—the whole sum would hare to be paid before the vessel finally left the docks—the 100l deposit would have entitled them to sell berths provided she had gone through the regular survey by the Government—it was on the morning of the 28th that I saw Montague—Tripe was not with him—I cannot charge my memory whether Tripe was with him on the 28th on the second occasion—Tripe took part in the conversations—he suggested different things—the negotiation was broken off on the afternoon of the 28th—it was in the morning that the guarantee was first mentioned—we did not break off in the morning—this charter was drawn up on Saturday afternoon and I left it for Mr Montague s perusal on Monday morning he asked me if I would have the goodness to leave it as he had to see a friend about it and I left it and went again in the afternoon—Tripe had called on me during the negotiation—on Saturday afternoon the 26th he called at our counting-house—I did not enter into proposals with him—Montague promised to be with me at four o clock in the afternoon but instead of his keeping his promise Mr Tripe came with somebody else and I declined entering into it with him—I was rather angry that Mr Montague did not keep his appointment and refused to have anything to say to them—the party who came with him was Mr Railton—our firm is Batten and Edwards—I never authorized Montague or Tripe to dispose of berths on board the Medicis—she is now on her way to Calcutta—we acted as brokers for the owners and she was chartered to Calcutta—I did not see Montague or Tripe after the 28th till they were in custody—I did not hear that either of them had sold any passages on board the Medicis until they were in custody—if we were the brokers of a vessel which had been chartered it would not be at all necessary that the parties who had chartered the vessel should communicate with us about the passage it is just like a person letting a house they can do as they like with it after they have got it—it is marked out by the Government inspector to carry so many passengers Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q Who were you brokers for A For the owners—the ship was placed in our hands the broker is the middle-man between two parties we were brokers between the Company and the owners of the vessel—we were brokers for the owners and we should have been for the Company if the treaty had been concluded—that had nothing to do with my not liking the introduction of Mr Railton I do not know him as a shipbroker I have never done any business with him he came down with Tripe who introduced him to us—I suppose he might have been introduced as a broker I will admit that I understood him to be introduced as a broker Q Does not this all mean that if Railton had acted you and he would have had to share profits instead of your getting the whole A No nine times out of ten we are brokers for both parties—each party has not a broker generally speaking there is only one broker paid by the owners it is not the practice to have two brokers—it was all arranged about the vessel except the guarantee—I had not said anything on Saturday morning about the signstures of four directors but I did to Montague on Saturday evening—the names of any of the directors were not mentioned to me—I have no doubt that the 100l was ready for me I did not count it there was a sum of money there—I am sure I saw Tripe on Saturday at the countinghouse—I do not know a person named Greenwood I am placed here on my oath and if I had known Greenwood I should have said so—I pledge my deliberate oath that it was Tripe who came to me on Saturday afternoon I am quite sure it was him it was then that he came with Railton—after that I went to the company s office on the same afternoon and saw both Tripe and Montague Q Did you see Tripe and Montague or Montague and Greenwood A I am almost persuaded it was Tripe and Montague—I do not know Greenwood—I swear it was Tripe and Montague I saw both Tripe and Montague that afternoon—I cannot say whether I saw any other person Cross-examined by MR SLEIGH Q Did you understand from Montague that he was in the employ of the company and was going out as a mineralogist A I did—in the conversation respecting the ship Montague acted more than Tripe THOMAS STEVENS I am in partnership with a gentleman named Railton our place of business is 8 Lime-street we are shipping agents and Mr Railton is a licensed broker we commenced business on 7th of last June—I first became acquainted with Tripe about a week after I commenced about June 18th he came to our office to see Mr Railton—I heard what passed he merely came as an acquaintance of Mr Railton s—I had never seen him before—a few days after he called again and spoke to Mr Railton in my presence—he asked him if he knew of any vessels lying in dock to be chartered—Mr Railton said he would inquire for him and he went away—I understood that he wanted to charter a vessel to go to Port Philip for a company in Austin Friars the Gold Mining Emigration Company —nothing was said in my presence about taking deposits at our office—he came again after that—I did not see Montague with him then but he has called at the office with Mr Tripe and Mr Tripe asked Mr Railton if he knew of a vessel and he said No —I have heard of a vessel called the Medicis—a board was placed at the door of our office by Mr Tripe I did not give him permission—I heard that he had received passage money at our office and wrote him word that I would have nothing more to do with him—I had not given leave I do not know whether my partner had—this is a copy of the note I wrote to him produced —I sent it the same day to Montague—I always understood Tripe was clerk to Mr Montague—I understood that from Mr Tripe himself—note read Mr Montague Secretary to the Mining and Emigration Company 28 June Sir As we do not approve of your arrangements respecting the chartering of ships for the company we beg to decline having anything to do with respect to fixing of passengers Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q You swore that you wrote to Tripe A I was not aware of that—Mr Railton is pretty well he is here and in Court— Mr Railton was directed to leave the Court —he had everything to do that was done with Tripe—I am the senior partner—I hope ours is a respectable firm—Mr Railton had all to do that was done with Tripe and Montague with the exception of the letter to Montague—I adhere to my statement that Tripe placed the board there I saw him put it there with the placard on it I cannot charge my memory when but it was about three days before the 28th about the middle of the day Mr Railton was in the office—I am not aware that he saw it done—on my oath I did not send for the bill for the purpose of its being posted—Tripe brought it—he said he brought it from Tomlin s office in ornhill—I objected to his posting it at the time and took two of them in which he had placed at the side of the doors and I thought that was the whole of them—I put them inside out of the way of the gaze of the public behind the counting house desk not with their faces to the door but they were not seen—I did that because I did not approve of their being placed there as we had not come to any determination about passengers—I did that in his presence and told him I did not approve—I was not aware that one board remained—it must have been placed out there during my absence—it appears that it was close to the door underneath the window COURT Q You originally swore you saw Tripe put it there which did you speak of A The one at the door and he brought another from Cornhill which made two MR BALLANTINE Q Was not there a third one A I understood so afterwards that was underneath the window nobody coming into the counting house could fail to see it—I was absent during that time—I am not aware that it was with Mr Railton s cognieance and authority that it was done although he is my partner—Mr Railton said he was going with Tripe to the last witness Mr Edwards—if Mr Railton had been the broker on this occasion he would have been entitled to commission which would have taken away from the profits of the other broker but they could not appoint us as brokers because Mr Edwards was broker for the owner of the ship—several of these placards were brought to our office but I told Tripe I would not allow it—they were stuck up on the shelf over the mantelpiece in a bundle—one or two were stuck up by the young clerk in the office—he was ignorant that was the first day he was there—we have got rid of him—I do not know how many he put there—my name was placed on them without my permission verbal or written Cross-examined by MR SLEIGH Q You told my learned friend you wrote a note to Mr Tripe that note has not been found but a copy has—pray who made that copy A I did myself on 28th June—it was made before the note was sent the same day—I copied it from the note directly the note was written Q How was it you said that the note you wrote in the first instance was written to Tripe A I said it was written to the company Q You said it was written to Tripe how was it you said so A Tripe was acting for the company and I had written to the manager—Mr Tripe represented to me that Montague was the secretary to the company—this looking at a paper produced by Mr Sleigh is in my writing and not in my partner s Mr Railton s MR BALLANTINE Q Have you not yourself seen the directors of this company A No none of them—I did not see Mr Hawkes JOHN RAILTON I am in partnership with Mr Stevens I attend here on a subpoena from both sides Cross-examined by MR SLEIGH Q Is not that your handwriting handing the paper to the witness A No it is Mr Stevens s Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q Do you know of any boards being placed outside your house A Yes Mr Tripe asked me to allow them to be sent down and placed before the door and I gave him permission—I do not think I mentioned it to my partner till they were sent down—they were put outside one I think the other was respecting the Liverpool line of ships—they were put in front of the house—they remained about a week till we had some private information and we withdrew them—I do not know any of the directors of this company—I had a prospectus—I have not got it here I sent it to Captain Lane—I had two one had the names in writing and in the other the names were printed—I got them from the company s office—the secretary was Captain Edward Smith of the Royal Navy—I have seen him at the office—the prospectus is in the hands of the gentlemen on the other side—I can hardly say whether I got it from Mr Tripe or one of the lads—after I had got it I saw Captain Smith—I did not know anything about him—I also saw Major Hawkes s name there—I have heard them say that the major was inside but I never went into the board room—I only heard by the newspapers that the secreary had been changed and that there was an-other other secretary I know now that it was Captain Smith—I do not know that he is a captain in the Royal Navy—I saw him at the Mansion House and also a gentleman answering to the name of Major Hawkes—I always understood that Tripe acted in a perfectly subordinate capacity I understood so from his father and from Captain Smith merely as the servant of those gentlemen—from what I saw him do he appeared to be acting as the servant of others—I can hardly tell what part Montague seemed to take but he represented that he was going out under the company s service as a mineralogist—our house afterwards offered to send Gowland out—that was about the time they sent to Captain Lane it might be after—I think it was before the matter appeared before the public I do not mean at our expense Tripe s father had promised to repay the money MR SLEIGH Q You appear to know the handwriting to be Mr Stevens s were you present when that note was written A I cannot say whether I was or no I was so much out—I know that a letter was written—I always understood that it was written to Montague I understood so by reading the copy—I never read the original letter—I first saw the copy on the same afternoon that the note was sent off DANIEL WILLIAM OGG I am secretary to the United General Gaslight Company Their offices are at 6 Austin-friars—the whole house belongs to us we let off a portion of it—I know Montague well—about two years and a half ago we underlet a portion of that house which we did not require for our own use to the Union Mining Company—about April or May this year I found Montague in possession of the offices which I had let to the Union Mining Company—I did not know how he came into possession—I came back from Ireland and on applying for six or nine months arrears of rent found him in possession—he did not pay it—it was a difficult matter to find when he did come in but he was found there and I applied to him for the arrears of rent repeatedly—when I first applied to him I said the Union Mining Company owed us rent—he said Give me time and I may pay something of it and I wish to apply to your board to become the permanent tenant of this place —I said My board will object to it —he said very little about the former company—I expressed surprise to him at his being there—I said You are here without our consent —he appeared to wish to become the tenant very strongly and to make arrangements to continue—he postponed for a day or two—the board instructed me to issue a writ and a broker went in—I said Bring me one responsible party from your company and his guarantee will satisfy my board and we will treat with you and Mr Lutwyche was mentioned—we distrained on 22nd or 23rd June this year—I pressed him for a name and he gave me Mr Lutwyche s but refused the guarantee—he said Don t press me for a day or two time is the great object —I believe I said Surely your company will not break up for 27l the amount of the writ—he then promised 14l in a day or two and on 27th June he was not to be found there or I may be wrong about 27th June it was the following Saturday 4th July—I did not receive the 27l or the 14l or any guarantee—we never received any rent from Montague during the time he occupied the office—I saw Tripe in the house up and down several times and twice in our establishment—he came and begged for time it was not exactly said to me it was said with open doors begging for time and promising a few pounds in a week or so—I cannot remember what he said it was not a direct communication to me—he said In a day or two certain arrangements will be made —he appeared to make the application as two joint parties—he did not say anything about being sent by Montague—I never saw anybody else about it—it was a remonstrance Why do you send us out why are you so harsh to us but the internal management I am a stranger to—I also saw a third party whom I do not know it was before the goods were surrendered—he came and pleaded hard but Mr Lutwyche I was not allowed to see—I said I want to call on Lutwyche or Bring Lutwyche to me but he declined and they said Do not call —I believe I expressed the wish Bring me a responsible party two or three times—he did not name any person besides Lutwyche in the course of conversation—I may have expressed the wish twice to call on Mr Lutwyche—before the premises were closed Montague was absent three or four days—I think the premises were closed about 7th or 8th July Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q When did you first see Tripe A I first saw Mr Tripe to speak to after the writ went in which was after 22nd June—I think it was in my own room I think he came down—our accountant I think was probably there—I think he addressed himself to the accountant—I had seen Tripe up and down the staircase of our establishment—I do not know that I ever heard the fact of a Board sitting there except the Mining Company s Board—I have seen the name of Major Hawkes in a prospectus which I have only seen since the matter has become public—I think it was in the avenues of this Court in the hands of some party I think it was a printer—I can hardly charge my memory with what Tripe said to the accountant and it is not evidence for me to say what I am told but it was something about 5l —he did not say he was directed to offer it by Montague he merely came and offered it to gain time—I did not know who he was when I met him up and down stairs but suppose he was about the business of his society—it was in June that I saw him because I had come back from I reland about May—I might have known more of this matter if I had been in London in May—I had seen Montague several times before I saw Tripe—he represented the matter he came to me on which was the rent question—I had seen Montague several times before I had seen Tripe up and down the stairs—it might have been simultaneously—I saw Tripe the first time in June COURT Q I thought you said you saw him in April or May A The attention of our company was first called to it in May—he was found in possession by the company but the communication with me was on 22nd June—very possibly our accountant may know when Montague first came there but he is at Liverpool unwell Cross-examined by MR SLEIGH Q I took down that Mr Montague was in possession in April or May and now I understand you to say the first time you saw him was in June A To have business with him—he was certainly not a tenant of our company previously I was in fact applying to him for arrears of rent owing from other parties who had disappeared—he represented himself once or twice as acting for this new company in Austin-friars and he wrote it down he used the words his board —he said he was about to go out to Australia as the employe of the company as mineralogist EDWARD COLYER I am a printer of Fenchurch-street On 3rd June Tripe applied to me to print some cards and bills for a ship—this is the manuscript marked A produced —this is my account to him for printing produced amounting to 34l 1s 6d —that was all done for Tripe—I printed 200 copies of this manuscript on cards—it was brought to me by Tripe on 3rd or 4tb June the 3rd I think—they were sent to the office in Austin-friars— read— Under engagement to a Gold Mining Company to sail on 1st July full or not full for Port Philip direct the splendid and fast-sailing ship Camilla coppered and copper-fastened —Canney commander 700 tons burthen lying in the London Docks —This very commodious vessel has a considerable height between decks and possesses superior accommodation for intermediate and steerage passengers she carries an experienced surgeon and a practical mineralogist and a large party for the mines affording an unusual opportunity for individuals and small parties to accompany them For further particulars apply to Mr C J Tripe at the Australian Gold and General Mining Company s Offices 6 Austin-friars London —I printed a quantity of things—the next was a posting bill which Tripe brought on the following day marked B —it is headed Golden Regions of Australia under engagement to sail full or not full the splendid ship Camilla lying in the London Docks 700 tons —it is very nearly the same words as this on the card—I printed altogether about 2 000 posting bills and some receipts I do not know how many he ordered without my book which I have not got but I have printed a great deal for them—on the second occasion I asked him who was to pay me—he said It is a very good company and there is plenty of money and the next time I come I will bring a prospectus with the names of the directors —which he did for me to print—this is the prospectus corrected produced —it has corrections added to it—it is the prospectus of the company they commenced with under this title—I printed very few of them they were done in editions of proofs twelve at a time—he brought me that on June 11th—there were done altogether about sixtyfour with additions corrections and alterations there was some alteration in the names and some of the language was altered very materially—the word emigration comes into this

being devoted to this purpose &c Q Look at this where it says Trustees blank Directors blank did you print that A Yes this is the original of which I sent proofs out—I cannot trace the different proofs—I can trace the different dates—this is the original copy of which I sent twelve proofs—the one with the names of the directors was done first—I afterwards printed some leaving all the names out but not till the end of June I think about 28th June—this first paper was not printed altogether it was brought as it is now with the manuscript alteration—I printed six copies without names by Tripe s desire or by a boy a messenger who always came but the original order was given by Tripe about 11th June—from then till 28th June I made alterations from time to time in the prospectuses I printed the last printed on 28th June being without any names at all—in the course of this business I never saw Montague—I saw Tripe a great many times after the first time he came and conversed with him on the subject of the alterations—I made some of the alterations by his directions verbally to me—I saw nobody but Tripe and the boy—a person named Greenwood called once Cross-examined by MR METCALFE Q When did Greenwood call A As near the 27th or 28th June as I can say that was when the alterations were made leaving out the names of the directors—the addresses of the directors are printed in the prospectus a number of proofs of which were sent at intervals—I never went to the office—some of the drafts are in Tripe s writing—I know his writing—I have it in my possession here—I saw him write this paper produced and believe it to be his writing—I have not had an opportunity of seeing Montague s writing—I believe the bottom part of this paper B to be Tripe s writing it is appointing himself as agent and says For particulars of freight &c apply to Mr Tripe &c—I do not think prospectus marked A is in Tripe s writing—I do not know Montague s writing—I never had any communication with him—I do not know Greenwood s writing—at the bottom of one of these papers is signed C J Tripe at the Australian and General Mining Company s Office —I only know Major Hawkes by seeing him at the Mansion House on one occasion—I cannot tell whether any of these are in his writing—I do not know any of the other persons spoken of as directors—I was partly examined at the police office but only one paper was produced to me—when Tripe first came to me about this matter I asked him whether it was for himself or for the company—he did not say he had been recently appointed clerk in the office—he said it was for a company and he was to manage the shipping department for the company I concluded I do not know whether he added for the company —I understood all through that I was treating with him as a clerk but not until he had written me this guarantee that I was appointed printer to the company— read— Australian Gold and General Mining Company 6 Austin-friars I am authorized by the above Company for you to do our printing from this date 1st June 1852 For above company C J Tripe superintendent of shipping Secretary Captain Smith R N —I only know from what Tripe told me that Captain Smith was at that time the secretary and that he was succeeded by Greenwood—I have heard Major Hawkes and the other gentlemen mentioned—I cannot tell whether the boy came as clerk he merely came for the work I was doing Cross-examined by MR SLEIGH Q I believe you saw Major Hawkes at the Mansion-house A Yes and several other gentlemen in the interview I had with Tripe he did not tell me that Major Hawkes had made some of the alterations in the prospectus—he did not mention the name of any director who had made alterations in the prospectus—Mr Greenwood came during the progress of the prospectus—Tripe was not with him then MR BODKIN Q Have you any other papers written by Tripe there A Here is the original dietary scale and I believe this to be Tripe s writing at the bottom MR PARRY to MR RAILTON Q Just look at that document B not the part sworn to be Tripe s handwriting but the other part in whose writing do you believe that part to be A Mr Montague s I also believe this A to be his writing and the manuscript part of this document C I also believe to be his writing Adjourned Tuesday September 21st 1852 JOHN NEAGLE I am manager of shipping to the firm of Fletcher and Son of Limehouse they are the owners of the ship Camilla they were also owners of the Abel Gower I do not know either of the defendants if any application had been made by them to charter the Camilla the application would have come to me direct—neither of them made any application to charter the Camilla—it might have been made through the brokers but the brokers would apply to me—if the brokers had been negotiating for the charter of the vessel knowing she was in the Docks that application would come to my notice—I understand Montague and Tripe had made an application to charter the vessel through Messrs Willis s clerk but I never entertained it—the Camilla is now in St Katherine s Docks the owners are going to send her out and Messrs Willis are the brokers SAMUEL STEVENS I reside at No 8 Park-lane which is let out in chambers called Baker s Hall Chambers About 3rd July Mr Tripe called on me I did not see him the first time he called again next day and I saw him he seemed to be in a hurry to take an office and mentioned about paying a quarter s money in advance but I did not like to urge him for it as he appeared to be very respectable he wanted to know when he could come in whether he could send any furniture in—I said Yes he might send it in that day if he liked—I asked him for a reference and understood he would pay me a quarter in advance—he said I was to refer them to him—I could not make it out—when he took the office he wished to have a writer to put the name up he told me to put the name of Montague and Co up—there was no reference at all—he came in in the course of a day or so after that and began to have the place fitted up—the first time I saw him he mentioned about the writer coming to put up the name and the writer came and he gave his directions to put up the name of Montague and Co — looking at a paper —the name was Henry Graham Montague and Co that was painted up on the panel—in about a week or ten days afterwards he said there was some misunderstanding between him and Mr Montague and in consequence of that he was going to set up in business by himself and the writer came again and they put up C Julius Tripe and Co —that was about a week or nine days after 3rd or 4th July—Montague did not come there at any time—I never saw Montague till I saw him standing where he is—Mr Tripe used to come there every day and I saw a good many persons coming in and out of the office but I do not know their business—Tripe remained it might be about three weeks after the name of C Julius Tripe and Co was written up—he did not sleep at the house he only occupied it as an office—I did not know of his leaving he gave me no notice of it his father attended when he left the office—I have had no money in advance and have been paid no rent Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q Am I right in supposing that the date they came was July 3rd A About the 3rd that is as near as I can say—the name was altered to Tripe and Co about nine days afterwards SAMUEL FINCH I live in Canterbury-road Newington In June last I was desirous of emigrating to Australia—I was acquainted with a person named Waterford who was going to emigrate and in consequence of something he told me I went to 6 Austin-friars—I do not recollect the day but I should say somewhere about 13th or 14th June it was 10th July I was to sail—I only saw a couple of youths at Austin-friars but I saw Tripe the same day at Captain Tomlins s 63 Cornhill—Mr Vallance a solicitor in Essex-street had money of mine to pay the passage—I told Tripe if he would go up to Mr Vallance he could receive the money for my passage—it was not mentioned then what ship I was to go by—I did not go with Tripe to Mr Vallance s—I did not pay the money Tripe told me he had received it—I saw him write this receipt and believe this letter produced to be in his writing—after I had read it I saw him on the subject of it— read — Australian Gold and Emigration Company 6 Austin-friars June 23rd 1852 —Dear Sir I beg to inform you that our ship which sails on 15th July the Camilla is now in the West India Import Dock which you can go and see she as just returned from the colony in ninety-one days and a very fine ship I am dear Sir your obedient servant C J Tripe superintendent of shipping —after I received that letter I saw Mr Montague in Austin-friars—I asked him if I could get any passengers what he would allow me I spoke to him and Tripe on that subject in what was considered the board room and took the letter I had received from Tripe with me—I did not show it to Montague but I spoke to him on the subject—I asked him whether if I could get them some passengers as I was going by their vessel what they would allow me by way of commission—Mr Tripe appealed to Montague and asked what they could allow and he said they could allow me 1l per head—I did not succeed in getting any the affair blew up soon after—I had received a sort of printed receipt from Tripe this is it produced —this is not for the second 7l 10s that is alluded to this is the receipt for the money Mr Vallance paid for me he paid no more than 7l 10s —I have not had it back or any part of it—I found no Camilla or any passage— receipt read marked G — Australian Gold and Emigration Company 6 Austin-friars June 22nd 1852 —Mr Finch has paid 7l 10s as deposit on account of passage money per a ship to sail 20th July Capt blank the balance 7l 10s to be paid at this office prior to embarkation in the event of the ship being disposed of the passage money will be returned For the Australian Gold and Emigration Company C J Tripe Name—Mr Finch description of accommodation—steerage Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q What did Tripe represent himself to be A Manager of the shipping department to the company—he did not exactly say to me that he was acting under their control he did not say whether he was acting under the orders of anybody—I saw most of Mr Tripe but he appealed to Mr Montague once that was respecting the commission I never saw them together at any other time—I had a list of the names of the directors from Mr Tripe there was a lord among them Lord Kilworth and a Major Hawkes—I do not recollect seeing Lord Kilworth—I saw Major Hawkes at the Mansion-house and I believe Mr Lutwyche was there—I saw Captain Smith at the Mansion-house—I do not recollect that I heard an application made that they should be bound over as witnesses—I heard that Major Hawkes and some other of the directors subscribed money for the emigrants at the Mansion-house Cross-examined by MR GIFFARD Q Who was it said he would allow you 1l a head A Tripe told me of it ROBERT WILLIMA WATERFORD I live at 18 Frederick-place Newingtonbutts I keep a chandler s shop there I had a brother named William who in June last was desirous of proceeding to Australia—we saw an advertisement in the Times of 10th June in consequence of which we went to Austin-friars a day or two after—it was on 11th or 12th we saw Mr Tripe—we had no conversation with him about the Camilla—I afterwards received a letter from Mr Tripe—the City Solicitor or Captain Lane has it I do not know which it was given in at the Mansion-house— the letter was stated to be lost —after receiving that letter I went with my brother to see the Camilla—a day or two afterwards I called at the office and saw Mr Tripe Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q Were you present at the office when there was any meeting of people who called themselves directors A I was present one day I cannot say the day—it was at Austin-friars—I knew them to be directors by Mr Tripe s words—he said there was a board sitting—I did not go in and see it but I saw several gentlemen come out of the board room—I afterwards saw some of them at the Mansion-house—I cannot speak to Major Hawkes being one but I can speak to Mr Lutwyche as being one—I cannot say exactly whether Lord Kilworth was one—I did not see Captain Smith that day for I was in conversation with Mr Tripe—I saw Mr Lutwyche and others who I saw afterwards at the Mansion-house—I have received no money from any of them MR PARRY Q When was it you saw this meeting A I cannot say exactly the day but it was after 14th June it was in the month of July—Tripe said the board was formed and they were sitting—we were talking together me and Mr Finch and my brother—there was a remark made by a gentleman who came out of the board room Mr Finch said You know who that is —Mr Tripe said Yes that is the old leather-seller who can buy half the Bank of England if he likes —that was Mr Lutwyche—Tripe went into the board room came out and said The company is formed and it is to be chartered —I am sure that was in the beginning of July COURT Q You did not go into the board room A Not that day I did after that—one day when me and my brother called I found a gentleman sitting there who I have no knowledge of at all—it was none of the persons I mentioned just now—I knew about a board sitting from what Tripe told me and seeing gentlemen come out with bags and papers in their hands GEORGE THOMAS WAGNER My son was desirous of going to Australia I went with Mr Jones about 26th June to the office in Austin-friars and paid 11l for a passage in the Camilla CHARLES WILLIAM JAMES DAWSON I live at 20 Bloomsbury-street Bedford-square and am an attorney The name in this prospectus C is not in my writing—I was never appointed solicitor to this company Q That has been sworn to be in Montague s writing did you ever give Montague authority to insert your name in any prospectus as solicitor to that company A Never nor anybody else—I was spoken to in reference to the company by Major Hawkes—I saw Montague once—I saw Major Hawkes and Captain Smith together and a person who I did not know then but who I now know to be Mr Greenwood—it must have been about the beginning of June when I was first spoken to about this company—I went to Austin-friars twice—the first time was 16th June I think then it was that I saw Montague—no company was formed by me or by Major Hawkes at that time—that was the occasion on which I met Major Hawkes Captain Smith Montague and Greenwood together—there was a conversation about forming a company at that time—I again attended at Austin-friars on 2nd July Major Hawkes Mr Lutwyche and another gentleman attended Captain Smith was there and another gentleman whose name I do not know—at that time the company had not been formed Q Was any arrangement come to not to form a company on that day A I only stayed a quarter of an hour I was obliged to go away—neither of the prisoners were there a friend of mine Mr Bascall accompanied me but he had nothing to do with the proceedings—no company was formed on 2nd July while I remained there—no company was ever formed to my knowledge down to 2nd July—I speak as positively as I can that no company was ever formed but I cannot tell what they did after I left Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q Did you see your name attached to this prospectus as solicitor A No it was intended if the company was formed that I should be solicitor—I made no alteration in this prospectus—I did in one that was before 2nd July—I think it was the day I first went there—I cannot exactly tell when that was but it was somewhere about 16th June—I did not see either of the prisoners present in the board room on 2nd July—I never saw Tripe till I saw him at the Mansion House—I did not know anything of him in these proceedings—I cannot say whether Major Hawkes is a man of fortune—I am concerned in some family matters of his—I believe he is a real live major—he is a major but I have not seen him since 2nd July so I cannot say whether he is alive—I saw him at the Mansion House not charged with this fraud—I do not know that he was charged with conspiracy and fraud in conjunction with the two defendants—I was present at the Mansion House—he certainly was not charged there with conspiracy in conjunction with the two defendants—I will swear that—Mr Parry did not appear to defend him only to watch for him Q I want to know—he was there and several other of the alleged directors were there and the two defendants and they all appeared by counsel and the case was heard against them all together was not it A I did not understand it so but Mr Alderman Carden will tell you—as far as I can tell without a breach of professional confidence Major Hawkes is a person of apparent respectability—I know Mr Lutwyche I should say he is a person of reputed wealth—he lives at Banstead—he is a director of the Commercial Bank— Major Hawkes is a director of one other company—I cannot tell you the reason he is not here to-day or Mr Lutwyche—I have nothing to do with the conduct of the prosecution—I never saw the Hon Charles Plunkett in my life—I do not know Mr Hudson of Connaught-place or Lord Kilworth of the Conservative Club—I am not a member of that club Cross-examined by MR SLEIGH Q How did you first become acquainted with Montague were you introduced to him by Major Hawkes A The first time I saw him was on 16th June—I certainly when I got to the board saw Montague but I did not know him till I went there on the 16th—his name was not mentioned—Major Hawkes asked me to go there and when I went there Montague was introduced to me—Major Hawkes introduced him to me as a mineralogist about to go out for this company MR PARRY Q Until you were at the Mansion House had you ever known anything of emigrants having paid passage money A No I never heard of it till the charge was made against the defendants—on 16th June or 2nd July when I attended the meetings no authority was given to Montague or Tripe to take passage money nothing of the kind—Montague and Tripe stood in the usual place where persons are charged at the Mansion House—several of the directors came voluntarily forward owing to what was published in the papers—Mr Ballantine appeared for one of them—the prisoners were placed at the bar there was no one else at the bar—it was intended if a company was formed that I should be solicitor—after 2nd July I had nothing to do with it and I resolved not to act—on the next day after 2nd July I determined to have nothing to do with the company—I did not see Major Hawkes but I communicated that determination to Mr Lutwyche who I have a very high opinion of—that was after 2nd July—no company was succeeded in being formed to my knowledge—I was in the habit of seeing Major Hawkes and Mr Lutwyche immediately after 2nd July MR BALLANTINE Q When you left the meeting on 2nd July did you leave your clerk behind you A I left Mr Haydon there HENRY TUCKER I am a clerk in the Registration Office I have here the registration of the Australian Gold Diggings Company dated 22nd June 1852—there is no place of business of the company mentioned—I have no recollection of Montague coming to the office—the person who comes does not sign his name in our presence—he brings the document which I have here—I have examined the register MR SLEIGH This is not the best evidence the book ought to be here COURT Q How is the register kept A In a book which is open to the public every person coming to the office has a right to refer to it—I have no doubt there are many referring to it at the office now—I have searched the register—no such company as the Australian Gold and General Mining and Emigration Company has been registered at any time provisionally or otherwise CHARLES PEARSON ESQ I am the City Solicitor I have no recollection of such a letter as the witness Waterford speaks of coming into my possession—if there had been I have no doubt I should have recollected it—I remember the examination of the two defendants at the Mansion House before Sir Robert Carden—it was at his instance that I first attended to watch the proceedings and in the discharge of my duty as City Solicitor I afterwards conducted the case—this indictment was preferred under my directions MR SLEIGH to SAMUEL FINCH Q You spoke of Mr Tripe as being connected with the shipping department did you understand that Mr Montague was going out as mineralogist to the company A No I did not MR SLEIGH to WILLIAM DAWSON Q Did not you know that Mr Montague was in Whitecross-street prison for debt do you know for what amount it was A I do not I do not know when he was taken to prison—I heard it SIR ROBERT WALTER CARDEN KNT ALD I was the Magistrate in attendance at the Mansion House when this subject of complaint was first brought there—there were several hearings before me—Lord Kilworth and other directors attended before me they were never in custody on any charge—summonses were issued to them I think to all whose names were mentioned as directors during the examination but I believe it was from the prospectus that summonses were issued—I believe summonses were issued to all whose names were in the prospectus COURT Q Are you aware that in any degree during the investigation at the Mansion House any favour was shown to any of the directors or to any other party A Certainly not and in lieu of favour there was great harshness as I wanted to elicit the truth Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q Do I understand that Lord Kilworth was there A Yes under summons the first time I had no personal knowledge of him—I had some personal communication with him independent of what took place at the Mansion House it was on the subject of this case—I heard the case against the whole of the persons summoned with the intention of committing such parties as I thought the case was made out against—Lord Kilworth and Major Hawkes were not at all in the same position as the defendants—they were summoned by my direction because their names were on the prospectus to answer any question that might be put to them—I could not tell whether I should examine them as witnesses or what I intended to do until I beard the case—I without hesitation granted the summonses—they were to answer any questions—nothing occurred to cause them to be defendants Q Do you mean they were summoned there on speculation to see if anything occurred to make defendants of them A That was the case I should say Tripe certainly did not attend voluntarily but I really cannot tell MR BODKIN Q You said you had some communication which was not public with Lord Kilworth be good enough to state what it was A I did not know it was Lord Kilworth sitting next to me and seeing him I said Have you any professional gentleman engaged for you —he said No I shall merely tell my own tale I don t want any professional gentleman MR BALLANTINE Q Did he tell his own tale A Yes he said he did not know anything of the company—I did not bind him over because I had nothing to do with him Cross-examined by MR SLEIGH Q I believe Montague was brought up on a habeas corpus from Whitecross-street A Yes none of the directors who were summoned were examined as witnesses on the part of the prosecution—I do not remember that you made a request that they should be examined in the defendant s hearing and mine—you did not ask me to examine them or I should not have refused your request—as you were present at all the examinations you will give me credit for saying that I thoroughly investigated the case not only against the defendants but against all parties—I remember at the examination a book in the shape of a day book or something of that kind being produced as evidence on the part of the prosecution a book belonging to this Mining company in which the names of persons were written—I do not know where that book is—it was the only book that we could obtain from the office at all—it was called a call book MR SLEIGH to CHARLES PEARSON ESQ Q Do you remember my asking you whether you as City Solicitor in the discharge of your duty would call as witnesses for the prosecution the various directors who were sitting in court A I think you did say so on the first day which was before I had investigated the case at all—I knew nothing of the circumstances—I was only present as an auditor COURT to MR STEVENS Q What are Tomlins of 63 Cornhill A Brokers I do not know whether the prisoners had been employed there or what Tripe had to do with them MR SLEIGH called THOMAS SMITH I have carried on business in Mincing-lane for twenty-five years as proprietor of the Shipping Journal but I have parted with it to my son-in-law I know both the prisoners—Mr Tripe was a very respectable young man while he was with me—I have known Montague upwards of twelve years—I know him by bringing out an opposition paper to my own opposite my office—up to the period of his being connected with this company he was with my son-in-law as his agent—he has borne a good character for honesty—he was not always with me—I never heard anything dishonest of him Cross-examined by MR BODKIN Q I give you the opportunity of considering your answer do you mean to say you have had opportunities during twelve years of knowing his character A As far as I can I have had transactions with him—I have had opportunities of knowing the meant by which he got his living and the character he bore for twelve years Q Then I ask you whether you mean to deny if you know what his employment has been that he was charged with swindling a Mr Loader of 200l or 300l for a company for a cemetery in Moorgate A I never heard of it I heard of the company—I do not know him as a mineralogist at all—I know him as connected with the press—he occasionally writes articles and obtains advertisements for which he receives a commission—I employed him for my journal the Mercantile Journal—my son-in-law employed him in collecting advertisements till he was taken away by this company—that is not what I call being connected with the press—he wrote articles occasionally as other contributors do—I do not know Mr Loader an upholsterer of Moorgate-street—I do not know whether Montague got his house furnished in Moorgate-street where the cemetery was to be carried on—I do not know whether he attended there day by day MR SLEIGH Q Do I understand you you have been twenty-five years in business in Mincing-lane A Yes as proprietor of a newspaper I endeavour to be a gentleman of respectability—I know that Montague has been engaged for years in writing scientific articles for various publications AMB ROSE ADAMS WARDEN I have been editor of Mr Smith s paper the London Mercantile Journal for the last eight years I have known Montague nearly the whole time I have been there until he left our office which was some time since last Christmas—during that period his character for honesty and integrity has been very respectable—I have not heard anything derogatory to his character as a respectable man Cross-examined by MR PARRY Q Were you on visiting terms A No I have heard of this Cemetery or Necropolis Company and have heard Montague say he was connected with it—I never heard him say he was charged with defrauding Mr Loader of 300l or 400l worth of furniture to furnish up the cemetery with coffins and things MR SLEIGH Q Do you know that Mr Loader bag recently become a bankrupt A Yes TRIPE— GUILTY Aged 20 MONTAGUE— GUILTY Aged 51 Transported for Seven Years Second Jury 
t18520920-942  942 DANIEL MULLONEY GEORGE COLLINS and SAMUEL RIDGELEY unlawfully obtaining by fraud and ill practice in playing at skittles 3l 8s the moneys of Daniel Barker with intent to defraud him thereof MR RYLAND conducted the Prosecution DANIEL BARKER I am in the service of Mr Hurley a cow-keeper of Spitalfields and am about twenty years of age I know the three prisoners—on Monday 16th Aug I was in company with Mulloney and Collins—I knew Collins before but not Mulloney—there was a third person with them—I do not know his name—he is not here—I played at skittles that evening with Collins and Mulloney at the Buffalo in Skinner-street—I lost 3l that evening—four of us played the first game and I played Mulloney after that—we played two and two the first game and afterwards I played Mulloney—he won the money of me—that was all the money I had with me—I parted with them about 9 o clock—Collins proposed our meeting again on the Thursday night but I could not go before the Friday night—Mulloney bad betted that if we met on Thursday night I would not knock the skittles down in five throws for 3l —he betted with me and we were to meet on the Thursday but I could not go—on the Friday evening about 8 o clock I was passing by Bisbopsgate Church and fell in with Mulloney and Collins and a friend of theirs the same man who had been with us on the Monday evening—we went to Long-alley to the Dolphin public-house—Collins went in first to see whether we could have the ground—he came out and said they would not let him have the ball to play with—we then went up higher to another public-house where the ground was shut up and we could not get in—then we went up to the Skinners Arms in Skinner-street Bishopsgate and bad a game all four of us for a glass of brandy and water—I and the strange man beat—Mulloney paid for the brandy and water—then Mulloney and I played for half a crown—the potman held the stakes—I won that and Mulloney paid me at least the potman handed over the stakes to me—Collins was gone away then—he said to us Wait ten minutes or a quarter of an hour I will go up to my uncle s and borrow 5l and back you to play Mulloney —we were in the skittle-ground playing when he came back—we then left the Skinners Arms and went to a public-house in Acorn-street but there was no skittle-ground there and we all came back again to the Skinners Arms—we were in the taproom and had a pot of half and half—Mulloney paid for it and shortly afterwards Ridgeley came in—I had never seen him before—he talked like a countryman and wanted to throw weights along with Collins half a hundredweight—Collins said Come let us get him out into the skittle-ground —we went into the skittle-ground and they wanted it to themselves private but so many people came in that we came out again and went into the Sun Tavern—it was then nearly 10 o clock—Ridgeley ordered a glass of brandy going in and said we wanted the skittle-ground to ourselves—Collins played a game first with Ridgeley and gave him two chalks out of three—there are three chalks to a game—the one who gets all the skittles down in the least number of throws gets a chalk—while one had to get three chalks the other only had to get one—Collins beat and then he persuaded me to play Ridgeley—I commenced playing with him for 10s —the game Collins won was for a glass of brandy and then Collins and Mulloney both betted 10s on me—they betted the same as I did that I would win with Ridgeley but Ridgeley won—after that Collins persuaded me to play him for 1l and he would back me for the same—I paid my 10s —Collins held the stakes—I did not see him pay the money over but I put mine into Collins hands and he said he had got it all right—then Collins persuaded me to play for 1l and said he would back me for the same—Ridgeley won it—I paid my 1l to Collins who held the stakes and they made believe to pay their bets into his hand—I do not know whether they did or not—I saw no money paid over to Ridgeley—Collins and Mulloney both persuaded me to play with Ridgeley for another 1l —they said I could beat him—Collins persuaded me to give him a chalk—that was after Ridgeley had beat me twice—they backed me that game even with the chalk against me—I had given him a chalk all along—Collins said Bet him the same again you will beat him the next time —I deposited my 1l with Collins—I won that game and got my 1l —then we played for another pound in the same way—the others betted just the same—I lost that game—Collins persuaded me to play him for 2l Ridgeley giving me a chalk and they would back me with the same—I agreed to that—they each betted 2l —Collins held the stakes—I deposited my 2l with him—the game was played—Ridgeley won—Collins then said I had only given him one sovereign—I said I had for I had only got one farthing about me— I had no more money —I searched my pockets to satisfy him and said I had given him the whole of the stakes—afterward he said Yes I have got it all right —I saw no more of my two sovereigns—they did not propose to play any more when I had satisfied them I had no more money—they wanted to go—we were going out but there was an officer in front of the door and another behind it—I had not sent for them—I afterwards found that there had been a policeman on the ground some time—they were all three taken into custody and I followed them to the station-house—as we were going I saw Ridgeley swing his hand out and heard something like money jink—we all stopped—a policeman put down his light and I picked up a coin and gave it to Towsey—the landlord then picked up another one like it near the same place—I put it into my pocket and next morning gave it to Towsey at the ansion-house—these medals produced are what I picked up—they were not in this state then they were brighter and looked like gold then—on the previous Monday when I was with Collins and Mulloney Mulloney said he was a silversmith and lived in Bishopsgate-street and Collins said he knew he did Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q How long have you been a skittle-player A Only that night except for a pint of beer with my friends—I cannot tell you how long I have known what a chalk means—I have perhaps played at skittles two years—in one of the games I knocked all the pins down in one throw and some in two throws—I knew Collins in the beginning of the summer—I had never played with him before that night—I know the Mitre in Mitre-street Aldgate I have played at skittles there at four hand games and single games but not with Collins—I have bet on games at the Mitre—I did not always bet I generally did—I had never played at the Buffalo till the Monday previous—the largest amount I have won at the Mitre is about 1s or so the largest amount I have lost is 3s or 4s —I never played for a larger amount than 1s Cross-examined by MR RIBTON Q What are you A I look after cows and milk them—I live in Spitalfields with Mr Hurley I have been with him most two years before that I lived with Mr Roberts at Dagen-ham looking after cows—I used not to play at skittles in the country my first play was in London—I did not begin to play when I first came to London—I get 16s a week wages I do not board and lodge with Mr Hurley—I have to support myself out of the 16s a week—I had saved this money for years back—I had 1l or 2l when I came to London—when I won the 1l the prisoners paid me that was the only sum I won at the Sun—I did not win two or three times there I did not win 10s I lost it—I won 7s 6d at Skinner-street—when I commenced playing with Ridgeley I gave him a chalk I do not consider myself a skilful player—I know what a floorer is it is getting all the skittles down with one ball—I got one floorer on this night I swear I got no more—a great many men can get floorers when they want—I consider a man a tidy player if he can knock them all down in two throws but it is very seldom I can do it in two throws—I did do it twice that was tidy play then but sometimes I went four or five times that was after the brandy and water—I was not drunk I recollect things I knew what I was about—I was sober enough—I was ne er the worse for liquor we were all pretty much in the same state as far as drink goes—Ridgeley talked countrified as if he had come out of the country MR RYLAND Q What expressions did he use that you call country like A He drawed his words off and talked very broad—I did not observe in what way the pins were put up when I threw—they can be set either on the outside of the iron plates or on the inside so as to be nearer to one another or further off—I put up a few at first and Mulloney told me to sit down and not to make myself tired—there is a mode of placing them so as to make it easier to knock them all down—I took no part afterwards in placing them—when Ridgeley came to the Skinner s Arms he wanted to throw some weights he said he had got some money left him in the country and he did not mind going and having a game at skittles and losing 5l or any thing—I had been drinking at each of the public houses but I did not drink much I was only a little fresh I did not feel the effects of it JAMES TOWSEY I am landlord of the Sun public house Bishopsgate-street On Friday evening 20th Aug about half-past 10 o clock the prosecutor and prisoners came there—they went towards the skittle ground when they got to the taproom door they asked for a light and the gas in the ground was lighted up for them—they made the remark that they had got a mug and they were to send them some beer out—I cannot say who said it—Barker followed the potman in and the prisoners stopped to make that remark—I expect that a mug means a fool but I do not know—there were several parties in the taproom and one or two were going into the ground at the same time—I was five or six yards off them and they could not see me—Ridgeley said to me Bring in a glass of brandy and water Governor and I sent it in—I knew him he had been at my place playing at skittles about a week before—I had never seen Barker there before—I called Ward a policeman who was passing and told him what I had heard he was in plain clothes he went in and stood by the skittle ground door which is all woodwork—he could hear plainly what was going on but could not see—he stood outside the door it opens inwards—I went into the ground when the officer was there and they asked for another glass of brandy and water—the skittle ground is glazed and boarded up—when I took the brandy and water in Collins was saying to Mulloney Give me my 5l back again I won t bet —Ridgeley and Barker were playing—the play was over about 12—they were going away and were stopped by Finnis in front of the bar and taken to the station—I went after them—at the corner of Sun-street I heard something resembling money and they all stopped—I asked a policeman for his light we looked and Barker picked up a counterfeit medal resembling a sovereign like those produced but much brighter like a new sovereign—I thought it was a sovereign at first Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q When you saw it was the policeman s light thrown on it A Yes I examined one of them in my hand—I mean to tell the jury it looked like a sovereign it looks more like a farthing now—it has been worn by being handled Cross-examined by MR RIBTON Q Barker made no remark to you about unfair play A He had not time JOSEPH WARD City-policeman 628 On Friday night 20th August I was passing the Sun in plain clothes and was called in by the landlord—I stopped first behind the door and then went into the skittle ground and saw the prisoners Ridgeley was playing the prosecutor—I was about the centre of the skittle ground halfway between the man who throws and the pins—I sat on the ground—I knew Ridgeley before and he knew me or ought to have known me—Collins was setting up the pins assisted by some one else and Mulloney was betting in favour of the prosecutor—I noticed that on the pinch of the game the winning game the pins were set wide for the prosecutor and close for Ridgeley—I hardly knew which was the victim till I saw that—setting them close gives a man great advantage for the game—when there are two games each the last game is the winning game—Ridgeley took part in setting up the pins when he was going to play—I believe he set them fair—Barker took no part in setting up the pins—while his pins were set wide Mulloney kept him in conversation where they deliver the ball from—Barker seemed rather excited at some expressions Mulloney came up to him and threatened to punch his head as he was losing his money as well as his own and gave him instructions how to hit the pins—I staid till the end of the play—at the last game which was a 2l game Collins said You have only staked but 1l —he said Yes I have staked two —Collins said No you have got the other in that pocket he felt and said he had only got a farthing about him and then they said it was all right they had found it—when he had no more money they walked out—I asked Barker what he had lost he said 3l —I told him to give the parties in custody and took them—before we got to the bar Mulloney said to Ridgeley You had better return him his money back —Ridgeley did not seem to take any notice of that—a mug means a fiat or foolish chap—as we were going to the station at the corner of Sun-street I heard something like money drop and these two coins were picked up they were much brighter and cleaner than they are now—they had the appearance of a sovereign especially by gaslight—they were found close by Mulloney and right against one of the gulley-holes—I searched Mulloney and found on him this chain and tin tobacco-box which be wore as a watch this book and 2s 6d —I did not search Collins or Ridgeley COURT Q How often had you seen Ridgeley before A Perhaps two or three times in a month he has known me for years we are both natives of one town—I do not know the other two prisoners but I have seen them about—I should say Ridgeley certainly must have seen me I sat in a stooping position with my elbow on the table smoking a cigar—he did not nod to me—I was there I should say an hour—I was in the same place all the time—he is an Essex man he knew I was in the police HENRY FINNIS City-policeman 633 On the night of 20th August I took Collins at the Sun—I took him to the station searched him and found three sixpences a halfpenny and this counterfeit coin produced it is not a bad sovereign but it resembles a sovereign—it was brighter than it is now—I found Ridgeley and Barker at the station—I heard Ridgeley say to Barker What more do you want than your money —he made no reply to that—I have no reason to believe that Barker had had bis money back at that time—Mulloney was there the sergeant asked him his address he said he lived at 33 Church-street Shoreditch that did not prove to be his real address—I found it was 17 Pepper-street Southwark—that is not near Church-street it is two miles from it Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q Is there anybody here to prove that he did not live in Church-street A No I have not got anybody here from Pepper-street to prove that he lived there—I went to one place and did not hear of him and went to another place and did JOHN MARSHALL City-policeman 622 I took Ridgeley to the station searched him and found on him two sovereigns two half-sovereigns four half crowns 4s and 11 1/2 d in copper all good and a pocket book in which there were only a few directions Cross-examined by MR BIRTON Q Ridgeley gave you his address and you went and found it correct A Yes I saw bis wife there—I do not know what family he has got—I believe he has a large family living there JOHN WATSON City-policeman 651 I saw the prisoners in custody—I heard money fall turned my light on and found a counterfeit sovereign lying by the side of the sink grating—I saw Ridgeley s hand thrown out at the time it fell and it lay about a foot from the edge of the pavement near the sink—Barker picked it up and gave it to Towsey who gave it to me I produce it—it bad the appearance of a sovereign and was very bright DANIEL BARKER re-examined The 3l I lost was two sovereigns and two half sovereigns—I lost 8s besides two half crowns and I think 3s Cross-examined by MR RIBTON Q When you say you had 8s in silver do you include the 7s 6d you had won A No I had more than that when I left home and when I went into the Sun COURT Q Tell me what you bad when you left home A Two sovereigns two half sovereigns 5s 2 half crowns and I am not positive but I think the other was 3 shillings COURT to JOHN WARD Q You said you observed on the pinch of the game the last game of the set that they were set close when Ridgeley was playing and when Barker was playing they were set wide just tell me more accurately who set them A Collins and another one with him who I do not know—I noticed that particularly in the two last games the 1l game and the 2l game—they were playing when I went in and Barker won—there are plates for the skittles to stand on and by turning them a little it makes about two inches difference in each pin and by turning them again it brings them closer I observed that at the time Isaac Senior cabinet maker of 10 Sussex-street Clerkenwell gave Ridgeley a good character Collins also received a good character

t18530131-298  298 HENRY GERHARDT and THOMAS HOGG alias Smithers alias Brandon unlawfully obtaining 4 1/2 barrels of ale value 10l by false pretences OTHER COUNTS for conspiracy to defraud MESSRS BALLANTINE and O BRIEN conducted the Prosecution EDWARD RANDALL I am a partner in the firm of Randall Freemantle and Co we carry on business as brewers in Hampstead-road On 14th Oct I saw the prisoner Gerhardt he gave the name of John Henry Garrett by word of mouth—it was in our counting-house I saw him—I think I had seen him before about the beginning of the month—On 14th Oct he said he had taken a house in Bath-place New-road—he was fitting it up as a beer shop and he wished to deal with us—he said he was a painter by trade and he had recently come from Devonshire—he said he had laid out about 80l on his house and he stated that he had a lease of the house for twenty one years and he had paid a premium—we asked if he wanted credit—he said he did and we asked for a reference—he said he had not been long in town and he scarcely knew any one in London but he could refer us to one a respectable man Mr William Smith of No 8 College-place Camden-town—he said Mr Smith was a tailor and he had known him for many years—I went and looked at the house in Bath-place to see where it was situated and I went to No 8 College-place Camden-town—I went in the course of the next day or two—at the house in College-place Camden-town I saw the prisoner Smithers—I mentioned that Garrett had referred to him and asked him what he knew about him—I mentioned Garrett as a beer shop keeper and that he had referred to him for his general character and respectability—on my so explaining to him Smith said he had known Garrett for some time and knew him to be an exceedingly honest and industrious man—he said he knew he had some little money but not much but he knew he was a very honest man—I think Smith did not say anything about the premises—he said that Garrett had come from the country—I believe I mentioned Devonshire myself—on that occasion Smith was dressed much as he is now—he had not any mark of his trade at that time—the next time I saw him was at his own house about the 21st Oct —that was after the first goods had been delivered—it was before any money had been advanced—the goods were delivered on the 14th 22nd and 23rd of Oct this is the account of the goods produced —I had first seen Smith before any goods were sent—I had seen him before the first lot had been delivered and a second time before the two last lots were delivered and before the money was advanced Q Would you have sent the goods if you had not heard from Smith the character he had given of Gerhardt A No I would not have given credit unless I had had that character—I would not have given Gerhardt credit if I had known his name was Gerhardt—certainly not because that name was well known to me as having appeared frequently before me in the Trade Protection Circular in the Swindler s List—on the second interview with Smith he had a tape measure round his neck over his shoulders—the first lot of goods that was sent to Gerhardt was four barrels of ale one barrel of stout and four barrels of porter—that was on 14th Oct—on 21st or 22nd Oct we supplied half a barrel of ale and some bottled beer and some on the 23rd—the amount of the whole supplied was about 23l —we received a delivery ticket each time—this is one signed J H Garrett on 14th Oct —this other ticket is for the half-barrel signed by the same party and there is one other signed but not by the prisoner—I have seen Gerhardt write on two occasions and I believe these signatures to be his handwriting—our drayman is in Court who saw him sign them—about 18th Oct I saw Gerhardt again—he came to our counting-house and said he had been pressed for payment by the party who was fitting up the house and he could not open till the house was completed and he had been disappointed of some money from the country—he wanted to borrow 25l and he offered as security for it to sign a bill of sale or a deposit of his lease or agreement for his house—we said that on advances of that kind we were usually satisfied with a joint note—he said he did not know who to go to and I believe I suggested that perhaps Mr Smith would be joined with him— I bad seen Mr Smith previously —Gerhardt said he did not know whether be would but he would ask him—he went away and be came back to the brewery I think on the 20th and said Mr Smith would be a security for him—on his saying that I went and saw Mr Smith on the 21st at his own house in College-place—I told him for what purpose I came I said Garrett wanted an advance and he had mentioned that he was willing to become security for him and I asked if that was the case—he said he was not in the habit of doing such things he did not like to put his hand to a bill and he should not like his wife to know anything about it—I said we should make the advance entirely on the good character that he had given him and if Garrett did not pay it we should look to him—he said he hoped we should keep Garrett up to the mark and get payment as soon as possible to release him from his responsibility—upon that I drew a promissory note and I saw Smith sign it—this is the note signed by Smith and signed afterwards by Garrett and on Garrett s signing it I gave him a check which he indorsed and we cashed it in our own counting-house— the promissory note being read was dated October 21 1852 for 25l payable on demand and signed William Smith and J H Garrett the check was for 25l and indorsed J H Garrett —this indorsement on it would merely show that he had received it—we have not received any payment either for the goods or the note—we have received no payment at all—the goods were to be paid for a fortnight after he commenced business as drawn that is such portion as he had sold was to be paid for—he would pay at the end of the fortnight for all that was drawn—it not having been paid I wrote to Smith and he called on us—that was about 14th Nov about a month after the first supply of goods—I saw him when he called—he said he was sorry they had not been paid for but he would go and see Garrett and induce him to come round and make some arrangement—I said we should expect to have the amount paid and the 25l also—he said if the 25l was not paid within a fortnight he would pay it himself—I did not see him at the end of the fortnight—he did not call and I wrote again to the same address and that letter was returned by the post—I did not see either Garrett or Smith afterwards till they were taken into custody—at the Police-office Smith gave the name of John Smith Cross-examined by MR DEARSLEY Q I think you said Garrett spoke by word of mouth and did not write his name at the first interview A Yes he did not write his name—I went to the house where he represented he was carrying on a beer shop—it was in Bath-place New-road the corner of Tottenham-court-road I found such a house as Garrett represented—it was apparently fitting up for a person who was going to carry on the beer business—it was being fitted up—a new front had been put in—I did not go inside—I did not see any other alteration outside—when Garrett first came to me he said he wanted some beer he was going to start a new shop—I asked if he required credit and he said Yes —really I cannot say whether I was the first that mentioned about credit—I advanced the money for the purpose as I understood of paying the man who was fitting up the place—he applied for that purpose—brewers frequently advance money to publicans—I believe they do that to insure the custom of the men—I believe they do not do it to get the men a little in their debt—I do not frequently advance money—I object to it—I believe the large brewers do it—I advanced this money for a specific object—I had never known this man before—I would not have advanced the money to any other person on a man s merely asking it—I would not have advanced this man 25l to pay the person who might have been pressing him if he had not been a publican—it was in hopes of keeping the custom of the house—that was the motive that induced me to part with the money—I myself suggested Smith s name to be on the note—when I suggested it Gerhardt did not readily and at once adopt it—certainly not—he said he must go and see Smith—I believe he came back to me on the subject of the note in the course of the next day possibly the same day—he said he was a painter by trade—at that time he was a beer shop keeper—but he said he was a painter by trade and he should be able to paint our sign boards—I believe he did not paint the front of his own house—I do not know Q You say that when you went to Smith he said that as far as he knew Garrett had some money—not much—not a great deal A Yes and he had known him many years as an industrious hard working honest man—Gerhardt told me he came from Devonshire—no part of the money has been paid either for the note or the goods—Gerhardt gave me permission to dispose of the lease of the house—that was as soon as the first payment became due at the end of the first fortnight or within a few days afterwards—we instructed the broker to find a customer for the house if possible—when he said he could not meet the first instalment he said we might take the lease and dispose of it and we did all in our power to dispose of the lease—we brought an action for this money against Gerhardt and the action was stopped as soon as we knew what his character was—we took proceedings after we stopped the action MR O BRIEN Q You first gave instructions for an action and when you ascertained what character he was you stopped the action A We did—I certainly would not have advanced the money on this promissory note if I had not believed Gerhardt to be deserving of the character given him by Smith—I would not have supplied him with any portion of the goods if I had not believed him deserving of that character—it was after he had received all the goods that he instructed us to dispose of the house about the beginning of November—we did not receive a farthing of money on the lease or any agreement for a lease—we never had possession of the lease or agreement—after Gerhardt had made this representation to us he never placed the lease or agreement in our hands—I did not call at the beershop myself MR DEARSLEY Q Did you not go to the landlord for the purpose of getting a lease and did not the landlord say he was bound to grant a lease A I did not see the landlord for that purpose I did for the character of his tenant THOMAS MASON I am a miller and live at Fordham-mills in Essex I dealt with the prisoner Gerhardt in the name of John Gerhardt he then lived at No 44 Park-street Camden-town—he gave his name in writing—I have his signature in this hook written as a receipt for some flour—I believe this to be his writing—I have seen his writing—we supplied him with flour—he represented himself to be carrying on a corn and potato shop—this was on the 11th and the 16th of July Cross-examined Q When was this A In July and Aug last—at the beginning of Sept the shop was closed and I was left minus 11l —he had paid in the whole about 40l —he now owes 11l —I have seen him write in the Castle Tavern Mark-lane—he wrote his name and direction in my presence—that was the only time I saw him write COURT Q When did you last see him in Park-street Camden-town A Some time in Aug —the last supply I sent him was seven sacks of flour about 12th Aug —I called once or twice afterwards at No 44 Park-street and did not see him—I was told he was out—when I went about the 5th or 6th Sept the shop was closed—I was told it was closed last week—that was about three weeks after I delivered my flour—I had seen a woman there and a boy who I believe to be a shop boy JESSE PATENBALL I am a boot and shoe agent at No 114 St Johnstreet I sell boots and shoes wholesale on commission for manufacturers at Northampton—I know the prisoner Gerhardt under the name of Gerad—I law him write this name Gerad to this bill of exchange on 4th Nov 1851 he represented himself to be carrying on the business of a general clothier at Wanstead in Essex—he opened an account with me and obtained goods from me—I think the first parcel he had was about 20l —the whole amount was 67l I have lost by him—I received about 5l in money from him—this acceptance was never paid—I went to Wanstead to make inquiries and he was gone that was after the bill was accepted some time in Nov 1851—the amount of this acceptance is 30l payable at the post-office Wanstead Cross-examined Q Did you ever go after the bill became due A No he was gone before it was due—I expect the bill was presented it was returned to me from the bankers—I thought from his representation to me that he was postmaster—I afterwards heard he did not keep the post-office MR O BRIEN Q Did you go to the post-office A No the shop was shut up JOHN LAMBERT PAYNE I live in Church-terrace St Pancras and am a builder The prisoner Gerhardt called on me in Oct last—he gave his name John Henry Garrett No 8 College-place Camden-town—he called in order to have some alteration made in a house in Bath-place New-road—I gave him an estimate of the amount for the alterations that would be required—the entire amount was 27l —I made the necessary alterations on condition that the money was to be paid as soon as the work was done—there was extra work which came to 28l 16s altogether—I received 3l —I inquired at No 8 Collage-place for the prisoner and saw him HENRY WILLIAM DUBOIS I was formerly in the police I know the prisoner Gerhardt—the first time I knew him which is about ten years back he gave the name of Henry Connery—the last time I had to do with him as an officer was in 1847 by the name of Henry Gerhardt—that is his name—I should say the last time I saw him was about three years ago FREDERICK FISHER I live in Clarence-road Kentish-town I was clerk to Mr Kennedy a house agent—I know the house No 8 College-place—we had it to let in the beginning of Sept —the prisoner Hogg came to us to take the house on 13th Sept he represented his name as William Smith and that he was an engraver—in course of business it is usual to have a reference and he gave a reference to John Henry Gerhardt No 13 Jeffrey-terrace Kentish-town I went there one evening two or three days afterwards—I saw a woman she called Mr Gerhardt out of the parlour—he came out and stood in the hall—I told him for what purpose I had called—he said I have known Mr Smith a great number of years and his father too he is a very respectable man you might trust him for double that rent —upon that I let Mr Smith the house—he remained in it about two months—he did not surrender the house—he did not pay any rent he left without notice—having found the house vacant I went to No 13 Jeffery-terrace where the other prisoner lived—I knocked and no one answered—I inquired in the neighbourhood and they said he had been gone some time—the house was shut up JOSEPH TAYLOR I live at Grove-end Villa I am landlord of the house No 13 Jeffrey-terrace I let that house to Gerhardt under the name of Gerhardt—he did not spell or write it—I let it him about the beginning of Sept —he remained one quarter no I am wrong it was at the Midsummer quarter I let it him on 25th June he remained till the end of that quarter—he did not pay any rent—he gave me a reference to a cornchandler and potato shop in Park-street—I do not know the number—I went there and received a good character—when be left he did not give me up the keys—every key was gone from all the locks and the front iron gate too—when I found he was gone I employed a smith to make keys—I went to the place in Park-street and that man was gone also HENRY GREENHALGH I am a grocer and live in Henry-street Hampstead-road I know the prisoner Smith he first came to me in the beginning of Dec he gave his name John Smithers—here is his handwritings this is an order he gave me—he was living at No 40 Augusta-street Regent s-park—he said he was going to open a grocer s and beershop there and would I supply him with goods he should want to rather a large amount but as he was going to alter and beautify the premises he should want but a small quantity now—he gave me a reference to a man but I forget the reference—I did not go to the reference—I supplied goods to the amount of 1l 17s —he said he was about expending 100l on repairs and alterations JOHN OAKLEY I am messenger at the Debtors Prison in Whitecross street I know the prisoner Smith but not by that name—when he was in the prison his name was Brandon that

spoiled the letter A You tore a corner off it you made a mistake I suppose and thought it was the certificate DR LOUIS CAPPELL I am minister of St George s Lutheran Church Goodman s-fields There is no other person of that name connected with that Church—this seal producing one is the official seal of the Church and here is an impression from it produced —every Church in Germany has such a Real it is used if the handwriting of the minister it perfectly unknown and in the eyes of foreigners such a document has a legal effect it autho-rises the document—I never wrote or sealed these papers

Whitechapel I have left since—I am in the employ of Cowan and Co of Aldermanbury—I know the prisoners and have seen them together several times at Mailer s house in Partridge-court—I have seen Müller

and asked for relief—I told the clerk to give him 10s —I then went through the office and saw a young man—I said Have you been twenty years in England —he said No only ten years —I said You had better get off for I suspect it is a forgery and I let him go—he told me that his name was Spero and that he applied for relief—on 31st Jan he came to the Society of Foreigners distressed with a recommendation from the Rev Dr Steines I recognized him immediately and asked him if he had never seen me before he protested strongly that he had never seen me—I asked him to sit down for a minute

price of brandy was a bottle I said 5s —he desired me to put him up a bottle of pale brandy and to let it be very good—he gave me a 5l note in payment and I gave him four sovereigns and a half in gold and 5s in silver in change—I requested him to write his name and address on the note and handed him pen and ink to do it—this is the note produced —he wrote on it Edward Davis Johnson-street —he told me to put the brandy up in paper ready and he would call for it in a short time he went away with the change but never returned for the brandy—I am quite certain this the note my name is written upon it—my niece took it to Mr Hooker the butcher to be changed he brought it back to me immediately I kept it till the policeman came and then gave it to him Cross-examined Q Had you ever seen the man before A Yes his face was familiar to me—I knew his face at once I have served him in house I did not know his name—he was there five or ten minutes inquiring the price of different articles—I thought the note was a good one MARGARET FORD I am the niece of the last witness On 21st Dec I went for her to get change of a 5l note I took it to Mr Hooker the butcher in Seymour-street and got it changed—the name of Edward Davis was on the note when I took it there—this is the note Cross-examined Q The butcher thought it was a good one and gave you change A Yes he gave me 5l MR CLARKSON Q When did you see the note again A When Mr Hooker brought it back again that same day—he gave it to my aunt and she gave it to Abrahams the officer WILLIAM LUND I am shopman to Mr James Lancaster woollen draper of 12 High Holborn On 16th Feb the prisoner came to the shop and bought two yards and a quarter of black doe skin at 5s 9d per yard he paid for it with a 5l note—I called Cash and Mr Smart the cashier came and took the note—the prisoner took it from his breast coat pocket—I could not swear that this produced is the note—I saw the prisoner write a same upon it this is the name and address he wrote Edward Davis 14 Johnson-street CHARLES WAKE SMART I am clerk and shopman to Mr Lancaster and also act as cashier On the evening of 16th Feb I saw the prisoner there—I did not see him come in I saw him speaking to Lund who served him—he packed up the parcel and called out Cash —I went forward examined the bill and took this 5l note—I asked the prisoner to put his name and address upon it and he wrote Edward Davis 14 Johnson-street in my presence—I gave him change 4l in gold 7s in silver and copper—before he wrote his name on the note I looked a it and said There is no name on this —he said No I took it from a customer of mine who I know very well and he was satisfied with that himself and then I asked him to put his name—this is the note—he took the parcel and change with him Cross-examined Q I suppose a good deal of money passes through your hands A Yes—I thought this was a good note or I should not have taken it JAMES ABRAHAMS policeman S 296 On 20th Feb last I went to No 14 Johnson-street Seymour-street—I have been to about twenty different Johnson-streets and Johnson-places and courts trying to find the prisoner and have not found any person of that name at any of them Cross-examined Q At none that you went to A I went to a great many—I was engaged on purpose from last Dec —as far as I know I have been to all the Johnson-streets in London—I was occupied for four days in Dec last in trying to trace the prisoner s address and for three days in Feb —I did not take the prisoner into custody—these two notes were given to me one in Dec and the other in Feb WILLIAM WYBURD I have looked at these three notes they are forgeries and all three from the same plate GUILTY Aged 32 — Transported for Fifteen Years 
t18540814-941  941 HENRY WILLIAM HALL feloniously setting fire to a certain house in his possession with intent to injure and defraud Robert Tubba—Other COUNTS to injure and defraud John Hill and Thomas Prebble MESSRS BODKIN and GIFFARD conducted the Prosecution WILLIAM THOMAS ROSSWELL I am clerk to the solicitors for the prosecution On 11th Aug I served the prisoner with a notice to produce—this produced is a copy of it— This was a notice to produce the policy effected by the prisoner in the Westminster Fire Insurance Company on the premises No 158 Fleet-street JAMES TRIM City police-sergeant 69 On the night of 28th Feb about half past 12 o clock I was passing by No 158 Fleet-street—I saw smoke coming out of the first second and third floor windows—I gave the alarm with a rattle which I got from a man close by me and sent him off for the engines directly—I then knocked at the door but no one came—I saw Carter the waiter of the Portugal Hotel at the next door and I went with him on to the leads of the adjoining house—I saw fire raging on the first floor at the foot of the stairs—I could see the fire burning up the staircase which is on a level with the ledge where I was standing—I did not go into the house on that occasion but on I think Wednesday March 1st I went into the second floor front room and saw the remains of three chairs and part of a table and a mattress on the bedstead which seemed to be stuffed with shavings—there were a few loose shavings on the bed from the mattress—I think there was a counterpane but I did not particularly notice—the fire appeared to the best of my knowledge to have begun at the foot of the stairs on the landing of the first floor—the prisoner came there that Wednesday evening—he came in—when he came to the door he said My name is Mr Hall —I said Yes I know that —he said that it was a bad job and I said it was—he said that the first he heard of the fire was going out in the evening to meet a friend he went into a coffee shop and took up the Globe newspaper—he told me that he lived at No 2 Trinity-street Liverpool-road Islington Cross-examined by MR PARRY Q He did not say the day A No this was on the Wednesday that the conversation took place I think and I understood him that it was on the evening before that he saw it in the Globe—I only went into the second floor—the mattresses themselves appeared to be stuffed with shavings—there was a little hole in the middle through which I saw them MR BALLANTINE Q Did you see shavings anywhere else A Yes round the mattress but none anywhere else THOMAS CARTER I am a waiter at the Portugal Hotel in Flee-street and was so at the latter end of Feb last On the night of 27th or morning of 28th Feb about half past 12 o clock I was alarmed by a noise—I went out and found a crowd collected at the door of No 158 next door to our premises and adjoining them—I went to the leads at the back of our house and got on to the leads of No 158 so as to be able to look into the house—the leads are nearly on the same level as the floor—there were neither shutters nor blinds to the back window—I looked into the room that was used as a kitchen and saw a fire burning on the landing—there is only one landing between the room used as a kitchen and the room which looks into Fleet-street—the staircase goes up the centre of the house—it appeared to me to be a well staircase but I never was higher than the first floor—I saw no fire higher than that—I went into the street again and saw that firemen were there and people got into the house—the house had not been open since Saturday night—it was a house for chops steaks and refreshments—I saw the prisoner on the Wednesday after the fire about 2 o clock in the afternoon he came into the Portugal Hotel to receive some money which was due to him for beer—the conversation was not addressed to me but to the barmaid it turned upon the fire and the prisoner said to the barmaid It is a bad job for me but I ought to be thankful that my little children were not there —I do not know whether they are his children or his sister s but I have seen children there and he had his sister living with him as housekeeper—he said that he had locked up the house on Saturday night and was not there on the Monday but was staying at his lodging at Islington as he was very unwell on Monday and took some medicine which kept him at home all day that the first he heard of the fire was on Tuesday evening when he was coming down from his lodging at Islington to keep an appointment with a man at the corner of Chancery-lane who had taken the business of him and some one met him and told him that his house was burned down—the barmaid said What a strange place to make an appointment to meet a man on business of that kind —Mr Hall made no reply to that but took the money that was owing to him and walked out—the shop was open on Saturday but not afterwards—I had had conversation with him before that on the state of his business—I used to go in and out sometimes two or three times a day and used to say How are you getting on and one morning I said Mr Hall I do not think you will make a fortune here he nodded his head and said Oh never mind I will make somebody pay for it some day —I should think that was about a month before the fire—he was not there above four or five months certainly not six months Cross-examined Q Did he tell you that he had taken medicine on Monday and had lain in bed late on Tuesday in consequence A No he spoke of medicine and said he had taken pills but he did not say anything about lying in bed late on Tuesday—he said he had not been at business all day because he had taken the pills he was confined all the day to his lodging—he said that he was staying at his lodging at Islington—he did not say that directly after he told me he had heard of the fire on Tuesday he said he had been stopping there all day on Monday and the first time he had heard of the fire was on Tuesday and he had taken medicine which caused him to remain at his lodging—I know that he had fitted the house up but nothing very extravagant—I did not see the furniture moved in—I have been waiter at tie Portugal Hotel five years—I know that they were finishing the house up in a little better style when the prisoner went in—it was a coffee shop—the last occupant had not neglected it but he had lost money by it I think there have been five landlords—I do not know that the prisoner paid 200l to go into it—I used not to go and gossip with the prisoner but we used to deal with him—there was an improvement in the house he made a little improvement in the coffee room—I will not be certain whether he entirely re-fitted up the coffee room FREDERICK PERRIER I am one of the fire brigade On Monday night 27th Feb I got to fleet-street at about half past 12 o clock and with others broke open the door and got in—there was no fire on the ground floor the great bulk of the fire was on the first floor landing—I was able to get about three parts of the way up the first flight of stairs—we were about two hours before we succeeded in subduing the fire—the staircase was in the middle of the house—there was a wooden partition on the first floor to divide the front room from the staircase—the back room was enclosed by brickwork a portion of which was standing after the fire—I saw the fire going up the staircase into the first floor rooms front and back but the bulk of the fire was on the landing burning up the staircase very fiercely—I saw no shavings on the premises at that time but about a fortnight afterwards I saw some in the first floor front room and the back room the same on the second floor and the same on the upper floor—at the time I saw them there had been some carpenters at work on the first floor the shavings on the second floor had been on the beds—in the front room second floor and in the back room I observed shavings which bore traces of fire and the same on the upper floor the third floor in both attics—they were lying about the beds partially burned and the floors were very much burned we were not able to stand without planks Cross-examined Q There were mattresses stuffed with shavings were not there in the upper rooms A Yes but the shavings laid about so that they did not belong to the mattresses in my opinion—there were mattresses in the room stuffed with shavings—the mattresses were partially burned—the carpenters had been doing something at that time in the way of shoring up the house but no other persons had been at work that I know of—no other persons had been in the upper rooms that I know of—an inquest was held about this house by the City Coroner—I was present no lives were lost —the prisoner appeared before the inquest and gave his evidence and I also—the verdict was that the house was wilfully set on fire by some person unknown MR BODKIN Q You know I believe that many of the witnesses who are in attendance here and were examined before the Magistrate were not examined before the Coroner A There are some of them who were not examined JAMES GEORGE FLEMING I am an officer of the fire brigade I reached the house between 12 and 1 o clock on the morning of the fire and assisted in putting it out—I had charge of the premises till 7th April—I frequently went over the house after the fire was put out—there was very little furniture burned and what was burned there was some remains of—I saw the prisoner there the first time was on the Saturday after the fire which was on Tuesday Saturday 4th March and I saw him two or three times after that—I spoke to him on one occasion about a fortnight after the fire and asked him if his claim had gone in to the Fire-office he said No —I said that it was time now—he said It is no use doing a thing in a hurry to be sorry for it afterwards —we had no conversation on the subject of the fire or of his claim—I went carefully over the premises room by room on several occasions I went over the first day I got there—in the coffee room very little damage was done and that was not by fire only by water and dirt—there was something burned at the foot of the stairs but not in the coffee room—the staircase is in the middle of the house and is quite open it comes down into the bar the coffee room is enclosed you cannot go upstairs without going into the bar—if a person wants to go upstairs out of the coffee room they must go into the bar—the fire had burned down level with the bar nearly to the bottom—the balustrade was burned and the stairs were partially gone—the fire did not appear to have extended lower than that—there was a quantity of rubbish on the landing of the first floor and the landing was entirely consumed—it had destroyed the wooden partition and the staircase upwards—the fire had begun on the first floor landing there was no fireplace on the landing—there was a very strong brick fireplace in the kitchen that remained standing perfect after the fire—I found a great quantity of shavings in the upper part of the house on the bedsteads—there were seven or eight bedsteads in the house—I think the shavings had formed the stuffing of mattresses and that the covers had been burned from them—there was a great quantity of shavings lying on the joists on the second and third floors WILLIAM BROMFITT STORR This produced is the claim sent in by the prisoner—he signed it in my presence MR BODKIN to J G FLEMING referring to the claim Q Full sized goose feather bed bolster and two pillows in the top front attic did you find any remains of that A No there was a French bedstead—I did not find a wool mattress or a handsome mahogany chest of drawers or four new Windsor chairs or a handsome dressing glass in mahogany tray frame or four Windsor chairs on the attic landing —I saw one French bedstead in the front room but not on the landing—in the back attic I saw some part of these four cane seat chairs —I saw the remains of three chairs in that room—I did not see a bedside carpet or a full sized goose feather bed bolster and pillows —I saw a large French bedstead and palliasse in the back attic it was a shaving palliasse Q In the back attic 450 monthly parts of Ainsworth s and Bentley s works neatly bound at 2s 6d per part 56l 5s A I did not see a particle of paper about except in the coffee room or of books—books are very hard things to burn—in the back room third floor there was a four post bedstead there was a feather bed and one bolster and one pillow on one bedstead in the back room and a wool mattress —there was a large sized French bedstead in the same room and I think there were the remains of some Venetian blinds—there was not a large dressing glass in a mahogany frame nor three new Windsor chairs nor a mahogany chest of drawers —there was not on the landing on the same floor some nearly new oil cloth —in the front room third floor there was a handsome four post mahogany bedstead at least there was a four post bedstead—there was not a large sized French bedstead as well there was only one bedstead—there were not two wool mattresses or a Venetian carpet on the floor nor a dressing glass toilet table washing stand and fitting six new chairs or a towel horse —on the second floor I saw part of a very small dressing glass also a four post mahogany bedstead a white goose feather bed bolster and I do not know whether there was one or two pillows it was not a good feather bed at all but it was a feather bed—there were not twelve cane seated Windsor chairs nor a wool mattress —there was a toilet table and a wash hand stand and fittings —there was not a Venetian carpet Q Was there a Handsome mahogany commode A There were some bed steps—there was not a mahogany glass case —in the second floor front there was a washing stand not a mahogany one but it had been a very decent one by all appearance—it did not correspond with this description handsome Spanish mahogany desk wash stand with nest of drawers supply cistern inside and fittings all complete 21l —there was not a Spanish mahogany four post bedstead —there was a large white feather bed bolster and pillow also a Japan dressing table —there were not twelve Windsor chairs or a mahogany chest of drawers —there was a small dressing glass and a wool mattress the shaving mattresses were on the bedsteads they were not additional there Were wool mattresses on some and shaving ones on other bedsteads—there were only three wool mattresses—I did not see this mahogany child s bedstead nor these mahogany bed steps —in the first floor front coffee room I did not see a handsome large carpet planned to room Q Ten Spanish mahogany chairs 10l 10s A I saw the remains of three and I saw part of a sofa to match —I did not see a handsome china tureen or a handsome steel fender 30s these was an old fender worth about 3s —there were in the bar some pieces of oil cloth a new chimney glass an eight day dial in mahogany case these things were not injured except the clock which was a little injured by fire but it was going—I also found these neatly painted blinds to bar window —in the kitchen there were several pieces of crockery ware copper and some hot water dishes Q Three counterpanes twenty-eight table cloths twenty-four sheets sixteen towels thirteen toilet covers twenty-two pillow cases twelve shirts five blankets and chintz hangings to bedstead amounting to about 25l worth of linen A All the linen there was one sheet and one table cloth that was the only remains of linen I could find in the house—linen is a thing which is very difficult to burn Q Did you find three black cloth cloaks two pairs of trowsers four waistcoats handkerchiefs collars stockings &c about 16l worth of wearing apparel A Not a particle—I saw no remains of a handsome chest full of clothes linen and other articles value 45l —all I saw was one chest of drawers empty which fell from the top part of the house—I did not find watches trinkets and jewels value 22l —I did not sift the materials I did not look for jewellery—I did not find 55l worth of cigars I never saw a cigar or any tobacco there except what I bought myself—if such a quantity of cigars had been burnt I should be sure to have seen the remains of them—I did not see fifty-six lbs loaf sugar 8 lbs tea and 8 lbs coffee nor a quantity of newspapers value 3l 10s —I saw about twelve numbers of the Illustrated News—they were perfect—I saw no numbers of Punch—in the bar I saw six or eight cruet frames and cruets also a strong double case coffee boiler and a four quart oval copper teapot —they were not injured only by dirt and water—the fire had not extended to the coffee room therefore what is charged there I can test the accuracy of—a gentleman came and looked over them and Mr Hall was with him—there were four casks of ale in the cellars which had not been tapped and there were some coals there—28l is charged for a new watercloset—there was a water closet there but whether a new one or not I do not know— the claim for fixtures was 251l 3s for stock 96l 14s and for household goods 409l total 756l 17s Q You have said you found no such things as many I have put to you in your judgment and knowledge should you have found remains of such things if they had been there at the time of the fire A I am quite certain that I should have found the chest of drawers and the linen and the books I should have seen parts of—books in drawers I think would be seen but I saw the drawers and they were quite empty—I should have found the remains of a chest of linen if it had been there but there was not a particle—it would take a long time to consume when packed in a chest—we got the fire under in about two hours—it began on the first floor landing in my judgment Cross-examined Q Was the first floor entirely burned away A No none of it—the ceiling had partially fallen in and parts of the flooring of the upper rooms—the accumulation of rubbish was on the first floor landing—it remained there till I left but now it has been carted away and the house has been rebuilt—there were five or six cart loads of rubbish altogether—the flooring of the first floor had not fallen in the ceiling of the coffee room was perfect—the rubbish was not sifted—I examined it I could plainly see all over it—I did not superintend its being taken away JOHN PULLEN I live with my father in Pleydell-court I was in the service of the prisoner at his house No 158 Fleet-street for seven weeks and three days—I left about a week before the fire because the work was too heavy for me—I was not discharged—some time before I left I took a truck of goods about half-past 2 o clock in the day from the house in Fleet-street to No 67 Chancery-lane—there was a sofa a small writing desk a fender some large chairs a table and some other things—a week or a fortnight afterwards I went in the evening with another truck to the same place—the prisoner went with me on that occasion—the truck was full—I did not notice whether there were other things besides chairs in it—at another time I carried a large arm chair to the same place by Mr Hall s directions Cross-examined Q This was to Mr Halsey s in Chancery-lane A Yes—some things had come in a cart from Chancery-lane some time before and I heard afterwards that they came from Mr Halsey—I do not know that Mr Halsey had been removing—I did not drag the truck myself it was me and Mr Dobriski who is a newspaper man in Bouverie-street Fleet-street—it was an odd job that he did—on the second occasion Mr Hall shoved behind while I dragged—I think Dobriski was hired by Mr Halsey—a cart load of furniture had come to Mr Hall s from Mr Halsey s but I do not know whether it was the same furniture that was put in the truck—there were some mattresses fetched from up stairs but I do not know whether they were taken up while I was away because the things which were fetched in the cart were put into Mr Hall s cellar—some of the things which I took in the truck were brought up from the cellar—about three or four chairs came from up stairs but whether they had been taken from the cellar before they came from up stairs I cannot tell you MR BODKIN Q Were the chairs that were brought down in use in the rooms A Yes I fetched them out of the bedrooms—it was about three weeks before I left that the cart came—I think it was my master who told me that the furniture belonged to Mr Halsey that was at the time that it happened when they were bringing them in I helped to bring them in out of the cart—I do not recollect whether there was a sofa brought out of the cart JOHN CHARLES VANNER I have been waiter at the Alton coffee house in Fleet-street I was in the employment of the prisoner and left him on the last day of Feb —I was in his employment for a week before the fire and was so when it happened—I had to do the general work of the place—Mr Hall had a sister who lived with him as housekeeper and slept in the second floor front—the prisoner slept in the third floor back—there were two children in the house which were said to be Mr Hall s—there was a lodger there who was clerk to Mr Halsey of Chancery-lane he slept on the second floor back—his name is Gleed I believe—I was there on the Saturday before the fire and left the premises about half past 8 o clock at night—I went there again on Sunday morning at half past 6 o clock—I was not in the habit of going there on Sunday but he wanted me to go to help to wash up some things to be packed up—after knocking and ringing for some time the prisoner let me in and I remained there till about half past 1 o clock washing up glass and crockery ware while he was in the back coffee room eating chops and steaks with his friend Mr Hudson and they were sitting there all the morning smoking pipes and cigars—I did not see any baskets for packing in that morning but I did the week before they were being packed all the week by a Mr Hudson and the prisoner in the first floor front room—Mr Hudson is a friend of my master s I believe he is a publican—I noticed crockery ware being taken away from the premises during that week from up stairs and I think two looking glasses—I cannot mention anything else that was taken because I could not see the contents of the cases—they were taken away at night by cabs—I saw two cabs myself there were baskets and portmanteaus in them—I believe Mr Hudson went with them—the two cabs were there at different times—Mr Hudson went with one but I do not know about the other—I do not know where they went to—Mr Hall was in the house on those occasions—I did not hear him say anything about where they were going—I left about half past 1 o clock on Sunday and went again on the following morning at about half past 6 o clock—Mr Hall opened the door—I did not ring because the bell was cut away—it was not there on the Sunday—I had rung it in the course of the week—I think it was Friday night that it was gone—I made Mr Hall hear by kicking at the door for half an hour and the same on Monday morning—when he came and let me in he said that his sister had an engagement out of town and that he had got an engagement to go and see a friend of his a gentleman that day and he should not be able to open for business that day and I was to have a holiday but I was to be sure to be there on the following morning—I went on the following morning and found that the fire had taken place in the night—when I saw the prisoner on Monday morning he was dressed all but his coat—on the Sunday I went up stairs I did not go into any room but I looked into the second floor front room and fancied I observed two bedsteads there—I went into that room on the Wednesday after the fire and noticed some shavings under the mattress they were very much burnt—I knew that there was a quantity of shavings in the cellar I saw them on the Sunday but when I went into the cellar after the fire there were not so many there was not half of them—on the Friday before the fire when the things were packing up and going away I asked Mr Hall if he was going to sell his business—he said that was no business of mine—I then said that I wished to know whether I was to go on with the next people who came and he said Yes —some wages were owing to me and on the Saturday after the fire I went to the prisoner s lodging No 2 Trinity-street Islington to be paid and I noticed articles of furniture which I had previously seen at the house in Fleet-street there was some bed furniture four or five horsehair chairs an easy chair and I think a bedstead but I will not be positive—there was some bedding not on the bedstead but rolled up in bundles on the floor—I did not notice anything else because I was not allowed to go into the room but the door was on the jar and I saw in—on the same occasion I saw the prisoner s sister at his lodging Cross-examined Q Were there any wages due to you when you went to Islington A Yes I had been paid one week but I went for that week s wages—I do not know that his sister lodged at No 2 Trinity-street but she was in the house at the time I called—I saw only two cabs the last was on Friday night—I did not see his sister go with either of them—I do not know where the things went to—I believe Mr Hudson is a friend of Mr Hall s he was there from the first thing in the morning to the last thing at night—when I asked the prisoner if he was going to sell the business he told me that was his business—he afterwards told me that he had sold the business and I should go on with the other party Q Did not he ask you to come there and wash up the things that were in general use in the coffee shop A He asked me to wash the things for packing—it was glass but no crockery glass used in the business—there was a lodger of the name of Gleed and I heard Mr Hall say that Mr Gleed had broken the bell—I do not know that he came home drunk and broke the bell I did not lodge in the house but the prisoner sent me to Mr Halsey s with a note about 1 o clock in the day that was Thursday or Friday—I have never seen Mr Gleed tipsy—I never saw the shavings used for lighting the fires though I have lighted the fires myself MR BODKIN Q When did this clerk of Mr Halsey s leave A On the Thursday night before the fire he did not sleep in the house later than Friday—I used to go there at half past 6 o clock in the morning and I used to clean his boots—the only fires I lighted were the kitchen and coffee room—it was not ray business to light the fires but he had no servant and he said he would have a servant next week WILLIAM MARTIN I carry on business as a tailor at Nos 156 and 157 Fleet-street On Monday the day of the fire the house No 158 was closed—my attention was drawn to it by persons coming to my place—I went to the back of the house and found the kitchen window open—I called Mr Hall very loudly thinking that he was ill but I could not make any one hear—it was then about 11 o clock in the morning—I afterwards got into the kitchen which is level with the leads—there was no appearance of fire in the grate in the kitchen—my house is next door but I cannot say positively whether I heard any one in the house after that—I was contemplating alterations and was there till 10 or 11 o clock at night and I think I heard somebody come in but I should not like to swear it—it was such a noise as would be made by a person coming in—I did not do or say anything in consequence—I was in the house by myself—I had gone and called out two or three times in the course of the day both in the morning and in the afternoon—I went into the house twice that day the first time at 10 or 11 o clock in the forenoon and the second at 3 or half past 3 o clock—it was after dinner—I am positive that there was no fire in the grate the last time that I was in the house because I could look at the fire without getting in—the fireplace faces the window—I went to bed immediately after 12 o clock and was aroused by the noise of the fire I should think about 20 minutes past 12 o clock—I had not gone to sleep—some time before this I had noticed the removal of furniture from the house a great number of times I cannot say how many—I know the landlord of the house quite well and made a communication to him in consequence of the removal of the furniture—the things went in carts trucks cabs and different conveyances Cross-examined Q You say you heard a noise about what time was that A I think about 11 o clock I was not in bed then I was in my shop—I had undressed myself and got into bed before I heard the alarm of fire—I have been in the kitchen before not always by the back window but I have been that way several times—I was on friendly terms with Mr Hall and used to go in that way—I saw a sofa a bed and some chairs go away from the house MR BODKIN Q You used to take your meals in his house A Yes generally HENRY TICKTON I am apprenticed to Mr Alcock a carpenter in Chester-court Fleet-street I have taken shavings to the prisoner s house—I had orders from Mr Brett the baker to send them—it appears that the prisoner had asked Mr Brett s son to send him some—I took them in sacks—I took the first sack about a month before the fire—I saw the prisoner then—I left the shavings outside and went in and asked him if he wanted any shavings—he said Yes have you got any —I said Yes —he said Bring them in —he told me to take them into the cellar and told me to bring a sack every week—I took four sacks altogether—I only shot two into the cellar the other two I left in the shop because Mr Hall was not in the way—I called again and he was not in—I went again and the sack was emptied and they gave it to me—I went again with a fourth sack and saw a female—she would not take it in and I brought it away again—I remember the fire happening—I saw it the next morning—I did not keep it in my mind at all when I took the shavings Cross-examined Q Do you sell shavings to parties to light their fires A It is a general usage in carpenter s shops they are my perquisites when there are any but I cannot always have them—when I brought the second sack the first did not appear to have been used—Miss Hall would not have the last sack—Mr Brett was the only other person in Fleet-street whom I served with shavings—I did serve somebody in Fetter-lane ELIZA LEE On the Saturday night before this fire took place I was in Fleet-street and saw the prisoner there—I went home with him to his house No 158—it was then about 2 o clock in the morning and I stopped till about half past 3—there was no one in the house but us two—I went into the kitchen and into the second floor front room—there was no bedding on the bed only a blanket—he said that business was very bad and that his sister had that day taken his children away and they would be taken care of—I had seen him once or twice before—I remember the night the fire broke out—I was in Fleet-street at the time it broke out and not far from the house—I was between the house and Farringdon-street—about an hour or an hour and a half before the fire I saw Mr Hall I thought it was going from his own place towards Farringdon-street on the same side of the way—he may have been six or seven doors from the house—I did not speak to him nor did he to me Cross-examined Q You cannot say whether it was Mr Hall or not A I could not be positive ANN WELCE I am a servant and live at No 2 Gray s Inn-lane I have got a situation in Bedford-row three weeks ago but they do not wish me to go there till this trial is over—I was in the prisoners service for a month I left about eleven days before the fire I think—I slept in the house at the top the back room—while I was there I saw beds sofas chairs tables glass carpets a bedstead a hearthrug and several other things being removed from the place by Mr Hall and the lad they used to bring them down stairs between them—I did not see anything outside to carry them in I did not go out—this was at all hours of the day—the prisoner s sister was there as housekeeper—I remember being on the kitchen stairs and hearing the prisoner say something to his sister it was on Wednesday evening and on Thursday morning I gave him warning—the kitchen stairs go from the bar the same staircase continues to the kitchen—I was coming downstairs and Mr Hall was inside the counter in the bar they could not see where I was but I heard Mr Hall speak to his sister he called her Louisa and said he would set fire to the house as soon as the goods were out—his sister never answered a word—I said nothing till the next morning when I gave warning that I should leave that day week they looked at one another but did not say anything—I gave no reason for going but I would not trust myself there—I never told Mr Hall what my reason was or said a word about it to anybody Cross-examined Q You never said a word about it till after the fire A No—Mr Hall did not turn me away—he refused to pay me my wages and I went to Guildhall and got a summons for him—I did not get my wages—I had no dispute with him to speak of—there was a row about some potatoes but that was where I was living before—that has nothing to do with Mr Hall—I am fond of potatoes and I dare say you would not refuse them if you had nothing else to eat—I was not charged with stealing potatoes—I do not get my living by stealing but by hard work—I lived at Mr Loverett s for seven weeks before I came to Mr Hall and we had a little confusion about the vegetables and I left COURT Q What was it about A About some potatoes—some customers in the shop wanted them and they were not cooked the waitress went up to say that they were not ready and Mr Loverett came down and was rather angry that they were not boiled we had a few words and I came away MR PARRY Q Did you ever live in Shoe-lane A No—I do not know Plumtree-court Shoe-lane I never lived there—Mr Loverett lives in Holborn and I lived with him—he did not live in Plumtree-court No 19—his house was at the back of Plumtree-court—before I lived there I lived in Holborn in Furnival s Inn-place I lived there four years—I did not live in Plumtree-court with a woman named Betty—I do not know Betty nor yet Sally—I swear I know nothing at all about her nothing of the kind—I never in my life lived at No 19 Plumtree-court with a woman that went by the name of Betty and I can go now and prove it and nobody ever saw me live there—I have not a relation living in Plumtree-court—I know Plumtree-court I should say—an aunt of mine does not live there I have none and I never did live there Q Did Mr Hall complain of your smoking in your bedroom A Mr Hall can complain of anything—he did complain of it—I used not to smoke in the bedroom I will swear that—I did not send the boy out for tobacco to smoke nor yet to chew but because every winter I am subject to chilblains and I brought some tobacco water in my box for chilblains but it was not to smoke—Mr Hall certainly did complain of my smoking in my bedroom a great many times but I always told him it was no such thing Q Did not he tell you he could smell the tobacco A He could say anything—he asked me if I did smoke and I said No —he told me that if I did I should not do it—I do not know how many times he did that—he complained of my drinking as well—the drink was not for chilblains but he gave no one a chance to drink but himself his cellar was always locked—I did not try it Q Did he complain of your drinking his ale over and over again A I came here to tell the truth and I have told it and I will not tell you any more—he did not give me a chance to rob him of his beer—he did complain of my robbing him but it was no good for he had charge of his own cellars Q Did he complain of your going to the tap and letting his beer run away besides drinking it A It is no use to talk about that it was not my business to go to Mr Hall s cellar—he did not give me enough to eat much more to throw away—I did not throw the bread away I had not sufficient to eat I am sorry to say and I would not make myself so mean as to axe him for more although I am a servant—he charged me with throwing his bread out at the window—I did not throw a lump of bread and break one of the neighbour s windows I should think not—there is no mistake about that Q Did not he complain of your throwing bread out and breaking a pane of glass belonging to his neighbour A I have made you an answer and that is quite satisfied I am not going to satisfy you any more—I did not break a pane of glass by throwing bread out of the window—I do not know whether the neighbours came and complained or not it was not my place to listen to every person that came in he did not hire me to stand at the street door and see who came in—I heard somebody complain but who it was I do not know—he did not say who broke it because he could not see—Mr Hall will say anything—he does as he pleases and other persons put up with the consequences—I never lived or lodged at No 19 Plumtre-court —I do not know a woman named Catherine Bryant and I never went into Plumtree-court in my life though I have lived seven years in Holborn—I do not know a single creature there male or female—I cannot say whether Plumtree-court is a bad place you had better go and try you can make it your business to inquire perhaps you know better than I do—I do not know a woman named Catherine Bryant in or out of Plumtree-court I do not know a creature in the world—I have never gone by any other name than Welch—I have never gone by the name of Bryant I have only gone by one name and I can always go where that name is called—I heard this conversation Louisa I am going to set the house on fire as soon as all the furniture is out —it was said loud enough for me to hear and that is sufficient—I was very near the bar Q Were you listening A I will not answer you any more I cannot go any further COURT Q Were you at the time you heard it hearkening to what they were saying designedly were you listening there on purpose A No as I came down for some things in the coffee room MR PARRY Q Now madam were you listening A I am not a madam and I am not going to answer you one single question more I have given you perfect satisfaction—never mind whether I was listening I am not going to speak to you any further — the witness declining to answer the question which was several times repeated was informed by the COURT that she must answer —I was coming down the kitchen stairs to the coffee room for some things between 5 and 6 o clock—the kitchen is up stairs on the first floor back—you have to pass the bar to go to the coffee room—what Mr Hall said was not in a very loud tone of voice but loud enough for me to hear it—I do not know whether there were customers in the coffee room the door was shut—I have nothing to do with the coffee room—this was more than a week before I left—I had only been about a week in the place when Mr Hall came up into the kitchen and said that he was not going to suffer any servant to take any liberties with his victuals neither smoking or drinking and I said Mr Hall I never did —I listened on the stairs for about five minutes after Mr Hall said that but heard nothing else—his sister never answered MARY ANN TAPPENDEN I am the wife of Mr Tappenden who lives in Fleet-street—I had some intention of taking the house No 158 Fleet-street from the prisoner soon after Christmas—I saw the prisoner upon it—in the first instance he asked me 400l for the concern furniture fixtures and all that was some time in Jan —he afterwards offered it to me as low as 300l —I said I should not mind giving 250l —my agent proposed that we should divide the difference but that I declined—I had made no agreement with the prisoner at the time the fire happened—on the Friday or Saturday immediately before the fire I went to the place—there were two gentlemen in the first room as I entered and the prisoner said those two gentlemen were about taking the house and I had better fix upon it at once—I said I should consider more about it but I had not made up my mind at present —he did not say any more his sister asked me up stairs to rest as I was ill at the time Cross-examined Q Before you made the offer of 250l did you go over the house A Yes several times—he showed me an inventory and said what he wished me to take was what he himself had taken when he came in he told me that he had laid out money upon the place in the first instance he said about 100l in fittings and alterations—he pointed them out to me—I had not much knowledge of the business it was my husband who wished to enter into it—he pointed out a new water closet that he had built—he mentioned two or three different sums as what he had paid when he went in—at first he said 250l and then 350l besides the 100l that he had laid out—I should have given 250l —he did not in any way diminish the value of the business in speaking to me—I have never sold a business - - PATCHING I am an auctioneer and agent in Cranbourne-street—about the beginning of Feb I was consulted by Mrs Tappenden about the house in Fleet-street—I had sold the house to the former occupant Mr Pilkington in Feb 1853—there was then a valuation made it was 113l and 7l for fixtures—that was what Mr Pilkington paid when he went in—there was an inventory on that occasion that same inventory with certain additions was brought to me by Mrs Tappenden—I went to the house in Feb last I found same things in it that were not included in the former valuation—I should suppose the value of those additional things was about 40l they were to be included in the purchase—there were other things besides which the prisoner described as his private furniture I did not of course look at them with a view of purchasing but I should suppose they were worth about 60l or 70l Q In going over the premises did you see anything answering to the description of a handsome Spanish mahogany desk washstand with nest of drawers supply cistern inside and fittings all complete 20 guineas A I saw nothing which would amount to anything like that value—I saw a mahogany wash hand stand—I saw nothing which I should reckon above the value of from 2l to 3l —I saw a sort of mahogany square enclosed wash hand stand I did not look into the interior of it—I know what they are generally if there had been an article answering that description I could not have failed to notice it—I did not tell the prisoner that I came there on the part of Mrs Tappenden—he told me that he had been offered 300l by Mrs Tappenden which I knew to be false—he did not know that I was acting for Mrs Tappenden—I went down into the cellar there was a very small stock indeed what I saw there I should think would not amount to above 3l or 4l Cross-examined Q Did you go for the purpose of seeing the place on account of Mr Tappenden A I did I told the prisoner that I came there in consequence of the premises being to let and I wanted to see over them I did not tell him that I came on anybody s account—I merely went as a matter of form—I knew what the place was—I concealed from him that I was the agent for Mr Tappenden CHARLES ROUSE BROWN I am a clerk in the Westminster Fire Office I am subscribing witness to this policy produced by MR PARRY it is dated 7th Jan 1854—the household goods linen printed books wearing apparel &c at No 158 Fleet-street are insured for 500l the stock and utensils in trade for 100l and the fixtures and fittings up for 250l making a total of 850l —Mr John Hill is one of the directors and there are others—Mr Robert Tubbs is one WILLIAM BROMPIT STORR re-examined I am an auctioneer of No 26 King-street Covent-garden and am also assessor of claims in the Westminster Fire Office Some time after the fire I received this claim—it had been sent to the office—on 16th Aug I sent a lad for the prisoner and he came to my office—he made a long statement which I took down in writing—I had this claim before me and he signed it in my presence—I put questions to him and he answered them— Referring to the memorandum he said I was on the premises on Sunday and Monday—I slept there on Sunday night—I got home on that night between 11 and 12 o clock—on Monday I got up about 12 o clock having been in the house all night by myself—I lit the fire in the kitchen in the first floor to cook a chop—I left the house with no one in it at 3 o clock in the afternoon and I did not return upon that day—on Monday night I slept at No 2 Trinity-street Liverpool-road Islington—on Tuesday morning I left Trinity-street and proceeded to Fleet-street at about 10 o clock—I saw there had been a fire but I did not go into the house nor did I speak to any one on the premises connected with the fire brigade or any other person about the fire—I returned to Islington and after taking some refreshment at the Angel Islington I went to No 2 Trinity-street there I remained until the evening—I called at No 158 Fleet-street on this evening at about 6 or 8 o clock and saw the fireman—the claim prepared by Mr M Dougal which I have signed was prepared under my direction—during the six weeks previous to the fire I have removed some of the furniture two feather beds a bolster a pillow a few blankets and sheets two table cloths a few knives and forks the carpets which were folded up and not in use and two hearth rugs a chimney glass in the first floor front room a set of fire irons a fender a large dining table four mahogany chairs with horse hair seats crockery ware and glass an easy chair and a portrait—these articles were removed two or three days previous to the fire —the statement about removing the furniture was in answer to questions by me— My sister was living with me in the capacity of housekeeper for about six weeks previous to the fire—she took away her boxes and other property belonging to her on Saturday evening—I have two children—one of them was with my mother the other was with me in Fleet-street—I sent her away with my sister on the Saturday evening—I have sold to Mr Halsey No 67 Chancery-lane a small couch six mahogany chairs with horse hair seats and a chimney glass—this I think was two months ago —this latter statement he made after I had pressed him much as to whether he had not removed some other articles— I know a person of the name of Hudson a publican formerly of North Audley-street the York Minster public house—I do not know where he lives now—he was in the habit of calling upon me in Fleet-street—he assisted me on Saturday to remove the articles I have mentioned to Trinity-street—upon no other occasion did he remove anything from Fleet-street—I had sold the house and business at No 158 Fleet-street in the course of the week previous to the fire to Mr Parker of Dalston the fixtures fittings and utensils in trade for 300l the furniture and stock in trade to be taken at a valuation—Mr Parker paid me a deposit of 10l and an agreement was signed by each of us to this effect—possession was to be given on 8th March—the linen was in the chest of drawers in the bedroom on the second floor front and part on the landing there were no blankets on any of the beds but in that room—I am certain everything charged in the claim was on the premises at the time of the fire—my apparel was hanging up in the second floor back room—the chest was mahogany with drawers inside—this stood on the landing on the second floor—it contained clothes linen and other articles—in a small wooden box in the dressing table drawer in the back room second floor were eight or ten rings pearls and diamonds some of them I believed to be a very small gold watch set with pearls—the principal portion of the stock was in a cupboard on the second floor staircase I mean the cigars sugar tea and coffee the portion which remained after the Saturday s business was packed up in paper and weighed and removed upstairs on Saturday night and left on the landing—when I left on Monday there was a large quantity of shavings in the cellar those I expect will be found there now —he left me with instructions to furnish me with the agreement between himself and Parker which he said was at home in his pocketbook—I asked where Parker was and if a letter addressed Mr Parker Dalston would find him—he said it would not—he left me with the impression that he would bring the agreement—I understood him to say so and also the addresses of Hudson and Parker—he never did bring the address of Parker or the agreement but I received the address of Hudson on the Saturday following and Hudson called upon me Cross-examined Q Did you go to Trinity-street A I did not I went to the house in Fleet-street—after Mr Hall had made this statement to me he was examined as a witness at the inquest—I was also examined—I do not think a person named Gleed in Mr Halsey s service was examined there or before the Magistrate THOMAS PLOWMAN I am a clerk in the Westminster Fire Office The prisoner s first policy was dated May 1849 that was for 3002 —there was another policy in 1851 for an additional 300l and the third policy was for 850l in Jan last Cross-examined Q He never made any other claim against the office A No FREDERICK ERRICK I live at No 32 Great Portland-street at present I am a traveller in drapery—I travel for houses in the drapery line—during the time the prisoner kept the house in Fleet-street I used to dine there occasionally—in that way I became acquainted with him—I have been out with him several times into the City to several places—I have been with him to the Bay Tree in St Swithin s-lane that was about the latter end of Jan —I went there with him and two other persons we were there about an hour and a half or two hours—we drank together there we had nothing to eat—we left between 9 and 10 o clock in the evening—the other persons came away with us but we parted outside—the prisoner and I walked home towards Fleet-street together—on our return home we went into the Daniel Lambert public house on Ludgate-hill—we only stood in front of the bar and had a glass of ale we then proceeded towards his house—as we went he said Well I am going to be a partner of your governor that was Halsey—I had been in Halsey s employment previously and I was then in his employment—he lives at No 67 Chancery-lane—I had been about six weeks in his employment—he said If I can place confidence in you I can put money in your pocket —I said How —this was near his own house and he said I will tell you another time —we then parted he went in doors and I went on to the west end of the town—I saw him again the next day—I dined with him at least I dined at his house and in the evening we went out again together I and the prisoner Halsey and a man of the name of Gleed—they were the two that had been with us at the Bay Tree—Gleed lodged at the prisoner s house—we all four went to the Bay Tree again because it was near the omnibus where Halsey got in he generally took the omnibus near King William-street—we drank together there and stayed I think till near 10 o clock—the prisoner and I parted with the others outside the door and we walked home as before—in the course of our walk I said to him Well Hall how are you going to put money in my pocket —he said To tell you the truth I am going to have a blaze — Indeed I said—he said Yes I intend to fire the premises for I am insured pretty stiff or rather stiff pretty stiff I think it was—I said Then I shall not have anything at all to do with you that was all that passed—we parted and he went inside his house—the following day I was at Halsey s when he came there—they had a little private conversation which I did not hear and a few minutes afterwards some furniture was brought in in a truck—it was put in the back room—there are only two rooms the office and the room the furniture was put in the room—it is not a large auction room merely offices—it was put in the back office—some more was brought afterwards—altogether there were eight mahogany chairs an easy chair a large looking glass window curtains brass rods a sofa and a quantity of other things—the prisoner said that they were brought there as he was going to be a partner of Halsey s—he is an auctioneer—I was in Halsey s employment from the latter end of Dec to the 14th Feb —the furniture was brought the last week in Jan —I do not know at what time the prisoner went into the house in Fleet-street—during the time I was with Mr Halsey I did not know or hear of any furniture being lent by him to the prisoner or deposited in his house Cross-examined Q Will you give me the date of this conversation A It was the last week in Jan —it passed in Fleet-street between Farringdon-street and his house I should think between 10 and 11 o clock I was then living with Mr Halsey at No 67 Chancery-lane not sleeping there I slept at No 32 Great Portland-street at that time and for some time previously and do now—I have lived there for twelve months up to this time I am known there by the name of Errick—if anybody inquired for me there they would find that I lived there—I was not aware that an inquest was held about this fire until I returned to London from Manchester—that was I think in the middle of March—I think about the 8th or 10th—I then heard that an inquest had been held I did not hear that it was over—I read of the fire in the newspaper when I was at Manchester—I heard of the inquest when I returned to town that was after the inquest had been held—I do not know about the date I suppose it was about the 8th or 10th March—I heard then that the inquest had been held—I know the time that I came up from Manchester perfectly well I should not think there could be any mistake about it—it was either the 8th or 10th March that I returned from Manchester I am positive—I do not know positively but I believe it was about that time I heard from a man in Holborn that the inquest had been held—he did not tell me that the inquest was over—he told me the inquest had been held respecting the fire in Fleet-street and the officer was inquiring for me—that was when I returned from Manchester I think about 8th or 10th March I did not go to the Westminster Fire Office in consequence—the officer came to a house that I went to in Holborn—I did not go there purposely to meet him I had been in the habit of using that house sometimes—he was not aware that I was going there—he did not meet me by accident nor by appointment—the man told me the officer wanted to see me and then I went to see the officer—that was a few days after I came to town—I was not aware that the inquest was being held while I was in town I am certain of that—I left London for Manchester between 15th and 20th Feb from Manchester I went to Preston and then returned to town on 8th or 10th March—when I saw the officer I did not hear what the verdict at the inquest had been—the officer s name is Gaylor—I was first examined in this case at the police court I think that was in April—I did not lay the information I wont to the police court and was examined—I went there with the officer—I think it was about a month after I returned to town—I never laid any information—it was on my information that a warrant was issued—I am not the person that originated this prosecution—I do not know whether it was upon my evidence only that the warrant was issued—I gave my evidence at Guildhall—I do not think anybody else gave evidence that day—I was not in town whilst the inquest was held—I never laid any other information against any one for anything—I have never informed against any one—I did inform against a person for selling goods without a hawker s licence—that was a short time ago—that was connected with my own business there was nothing criminal in that I apprehend—I never informed against any one—I told the police of it I do not call that informing—I told the police that they were trading without a licence—I went before a Magistrate and was sworn about it—the parties were not fined—I have not done that more than once that was only a fortnight ago—I was never a witness before a Magistrate before the information was against a Mr Way—I did not go to the parties against whom I complained before I informed—I will swear that—I had not made any demand of money upon them—I am certain of that not a farthing—I did not give the information from a sense of public justice—I heard that I should not receive my money and then I gave information to the police it was money that was due to me 4l 19s 10d —one of the parties had refused to pay me and I told the police—it is necessary that these fellows should be brought to justice—I do not know whether I should have informed if the fellows had paid me my 4l 19s 10d perhaps I should I do not know that it would have been ungrateful that would depend upon circumstances—I have been connected with them for years—I have not been connected with men who sell goods without a licence I always have a licence—I was connected with those fellows that I informed about for about ten years—I did not say that they would not pay me my 4l 19s 10d but they put me off from day to day—I did not think I should get the money by informing against them—I dare say I shall get it I have not tried to get it—I intend to summons them in the County Court—I state distinctly that I live at No 32 Great Portland-street—I think it is the second floor that I occupy I know it is—I have occupied it twelve months—I pay rent for it myself in my own name—the landlord is Mr Matthew Slingsby—I have paid him rent for the second floor for twelve months within a week or two—I have lodged there and paid rent for that twelve months—I pay 5s 6d a week for one room a bed room—I have not been in town during the whole of that twelve months—I have stated that I was travelling about for drapery houses—that is true this last week I have not travelled for any one—I was engaged in London for this house in Bristol for the man of the name of Way—that is the man you say I informed against I was travelling for him—I do not think he has any place of business—I was engaged for three weeks till last week I did not travel before that—I was in a situation at Mr Hurst s No 108 Oxford-street a shawl house—I was with him from May last to the latter end of July and then for three weeks with Mr Way—I have stated that I was travelling in the drapery trade—I did not say for any house because the persons I have been travelling for travel from town to town—they do not sell by auction—they travel from town to town with goods and sell them in the various towns—they send hand bills round—I have been with them for ten years—I think the police have interfered with us once—that was in Leadenhall-street this time twelve months—the police were placed at the door for the purpose of warning persons from going in—that was not on the ground that we were a set of swindlers because our business was carried on quite as respectably as the drapers generally are Q Was that a set of men called The Towsery gang A It is in the country called The Towsery gang we had a man with us of the name of Towsery who was well known in the country he was not known in London—we aroused the jealousy of the drapers and they denominated us The Towsery gang —we are quite as respectable as the gentlemen in Ludgate-hill—we were never charged with selling sham goods—we were charged with charging exorbitant prices perhaps but not with selling sham goods—we were never charged with selling articles worth 1l for 5l or 6l Q Used you to represent that these sales were the wrecks of fires and so on A When a fire took place we bought goods there and then of course we represented them as goods from the fire—in Leadenhall-street we were known by the name of Brown Brothers —that was the place where the police were placed at the door—they were only there for two or three hours not longer I do not mean for two or three hours a day but for two or three hours in one day—we did not leave after that we stayed two months there from April to June—I do not know whether Brown Brothers were ever summoned before the Magistrate not criminally they were not—I think one of them was summoned that was Brown—I think it was to Marlborough-street I am not certain—we were then trading as Brown Brothers —the place of business was then in Pall Mall he was only summoned once to my knowledge—I was at Pall Mall with him—I have not been with Brown Brothers pretty well all over the country—I do not know what names we went by—various names—I was not the proprietor—I have been with them about ten years—I think we went by different names in different towns—we had a licence to travel and the licence was always in Brown s name—we did not always trade in Brown s name not when any large firm had failed or anything of that sort we very likely then traded in the name of that firm—we never traded in the name of Howard and Co —I know a Mr Lloyd—he was not one of them he was in business for himself in Maddox-street—he had sale rooms—he was there two years—I was with him part of the time—Mr Brown was not with him—that was not Brown s concern it was separate—I suppose I was with him for about two months I changed about from one time to the other—I remember the fire at Messrs Pawson s in St Paul s-churchyard—it was never complained that Brown Brothers had fraudulently represented that they had purchased a large quantity of their stock—it was said so by a draper in the neighbourhood—we did buy goods of them—I was never charged with assaulting ladies who came to our establishment and compelling them to buy nor were any of us to my knowledge—I think I did hear that Lloyd was but I was not present—I do not know a person of the name of Horwood—I know the name of Allgood—I gave him a character as a respectable man—I was never charged with giving him a false character—not the slightest complaint was ever made of it—I will swear that—he lived with me between three and four months—I never gave him a nine months character nor was it false nor was the slightest complaint made of it—that I swear—he lived with me at Chertsey or Egham—I was travelling about then—he was one of the men that lived with me while I was travelling about—I gave him a character on that account not from Mr Towsery or Brown Brothers but from myself—he was my servant and I paid him wages—I have lived at Cheltenham I was in the drapery business there alone—I had a shop—I was there about six months the second time and about twelve months the first time still in the drapery trade never any other—I was nothing else there but in the drapery trade—I did not know a man named Hog there—I knew him in London—I was not with him at any time—I met him at a tavern in Regent-street—I never lived in the same house with him—I never acted as servant to him—I knew him for about three or four months I suppose—I never used to be with him as a companion—God knows whether he has been transported—I saw him the other day—I first knew him in 45 I have known him since then but I was only acquainted with him in 45 for a month or two—I have known him ever since I should have known if he had been transported I have not known him but I should have known that—he was never imprisoned to my knowledge—I had nothing to do with him at a gambling house nothing of the kind—I was in the habit of taking my meals at the prisoner s coffee shop I always paid for them—there is no debt owing whatever not a farthing—I think I became acquainted with Gleed last August at Greenwich—I was not dismissed from Mr Halsey s I left of my own accord—I was there about six weeks—I did not live there at the same time that Gleed did—I left some time before Gleed MR BODKIN Q With respect to Brown Brothers or Mr Lloyd were you a partner or merely employed A I was employed as an assistant and paid for my services—I did not go to the office of the company when I heard that an inquest had been held—I wrote a letter this is it looking at it —this is dated 28th March—I think it was about the middle of March that I returned from Manchester I am not certain what time it was—I am certain that when I returned I heard that the inquest was over and that the officer was inquiring for me—I saw Gaylor the officer I think directly afterwards within a week—I wrote this letter before I saw Gaylor but after I heard that he wanted to see me WILLIAM M—BROWN I am Secretary to the Westminster Fire Office This letter was received on the day on which it is dated 28th March CHARLES THOMAS GAYLOR I am a police constable I went to the premises soon after the fire—I attended at the Guildhall police office when application was made for a warrant against the prisoner—I think that was on the 19th April or the 29th—Errick was examined there and Mr Storr—I do not think I was—on receiving the warrant of the Magistrate I endeavoured to execute it in London—I could not find the prisoner in London—I ultimately found him on 6th June at a pawnbroker s of the name of Thomas at 134 or 135 Dale-street Liverpool where he was employed—I told him I wanted him on a warrant for arson—he said Very well and I brought him to London Cross-examined Q Did you ascertain how long he had been living there A About a month—it was not so long as two months—I have heard that he was originally a pawnbroker by trade and that was the way in which I found him out—I cannot say whether he had the management of the business at Liverpool there were two other young men in the shop younger than he MR STORR re-examined I took down the statement made by the prisoner in his presence and read it over to him The following letter from the witness Errick to Mr Brown the Secretary of the Company was here read 32 Great Portland-street March 28 Sir —I can communicate to you the facts connected with the late fire in Fleet-street that will bar all claim that Mr Hall may have upon your office An answer by return will lead to an interview —F Errick GUILTY Aged 35 — Transported for Life

t18551022-955  955 WILLIAM STRAHAN SIR JOHN DEAN PAUL Bart and ROBERT MAKIN BATES were indicted for that they since 1st Jan 1851 being bankers and agents to John Griffith clerk and being entrusted by him with certain bonds set out in the indictment for safe custody without any authority to pledge or make away with them in violation of good faith did sell and convert the same to their own use and benefit Other COUNTS for negotiating transferring and pledging the same and for a conspiracy MR ATTORNEY GENERAL with MESSRS BODKIN and POLAND conducted the Prosecution The Defendants having surrendered and pleaded Not Guilty SIR F THESIGER who with MR HAWKINS appeared for Strahan applied that the Defendants might be permitted to plead double on the present occasion vis in addition to the plea of Not Guilty to plead a special plea under 7 & 8 Geo 4 c 29 The present charge was founded upon the 49 th section of that Act of Parliament and by the 52 nd section it was provided that if any offender against the Act should at any time previously to his being indicted for that offence have disclosed such act in consequence of any compulsory process of any court of law or equity or in any examination or deposition before any Commissioner of Bankruptcy that he should not be liable to be convicted as an offender against this Act in respect of any act done by him A question would arise whether under this section the disclosure here provided for might be given in evidence under the general issue he Sir F The signer entertained a strong opinion that it might and in fact that it must be given in evidence in that way only He was informed that that course was not objected to on the other sick but for better security he desired to put a special plea on the record which should contain a statement of the disclosure made by the defendants under an examination before the Commissioner of Bankruptcy MR BARON ALDERSON inquired if there was any authority to support the application The ATTORNEY GENERAL replied that the authorities were distinctly the other way SIR F THESIGER was not prepared with any authority but was informed that there were two cases in the Queen s Bench bearing upon this point MR BARON ALDERSON believed the decisions had been the other way He could not see upon what principle such an application could be acceded to it was not a claim of merit it could only be an appeal made to the discretion of the Court The application was refused REV DR JOHN GRIFFITH I am a doctor of divinity and a Canon of Rochester Cathedral—I have had an account for some years past with the house of Snow Paul and Strahan—my account with that house began in Dec 1830—at that time I think the firm was Snow Paul and Panl—afterwards I think it was Strahan Paul Paul and Bates and subsequently when the late Sir John Paul died it became as it latterly was Strahan Paul and Bates—I think the late Sir John Dean Paul died in 1853—I am not quite sure but it was about that time certainly—from that time down to the bankruptcy the firm continued to be Strahan Paul and Bates—I was in the habit from time to time of employing my bankers to make investments for me—I think it was in the year 1850 that I first directed them to make an investment in the Danish 5 per cent bonds—this is my pass book produced —I find myself debited here on 4th Feb 1850 with a sum of 202l 10s the purchase of 2 000l Danish 5 per cents—my practice was to give instructions for the purchase and I think in almost all cases I received from them bought notes—this produced is the bought note referring to the purchase I have spoken of—on 16th April 1850 I find this item in the pass book For 1 000 Danish 5 per cents at 953/4 958l 15s —this produced is the bought note that was transmitted to me with reference to the last mentioned purchase—in April 1851 I gave them a further order to purchase similar stock for me looking at a letter —this is the order contained in this letter—it is dated 9th April 1851—the postscript says I shall be obliged if you will purchase for me 2 000l Danish 5 per cent bonds J Griffith —that I sent to the house by the post addressed to Messrs Strahan Paul and Co —this produced is the bought note that was transmitted to me showing the execution of that order it is dated 10th April 1851 the day after my letter to them—on 16th April 1851 there is the following item in my pass book For 2 000 Danish bonds at 1013/4 2037l 10s —the date of the bought note is the 10th—it states at the bottom of it Bought for the 16th instant —this looking at another is a note referring to the same transaction it is dated 16th April—there is a memorandum on it Bought on the 10th instant —it is the same transaction—in that case I conclude they sent me two bought notes one on the 10th when the purchase was made and one on the 16th when it was completed and on the 16th I am debited with the amount expressed on both these notes—those three purchases made on the whole 5 000 Danish 5 per cents Q Did you ever ask for them or interfere with them in any way or were they remaining in their possession as you thought until the bank-ruptcy A I do not think I ever asked for them nor did I ever ask to see them but I had conversation with Mr Bates respecting them I think more than once—I mean with regard generally to the bonds which I had entrusted to their charge—I had other securities in their charge COURT Q You do not think you ever saw these particular ones A I think I may say I certainly never saw them MR BODKIN Q Do you remember the conversation you had with Mr Bates upon the subject of these securities A Yes I can recollect it pretty well in feet I used to transact my banking business almost solely with Mr Bates—I have had conversation with him upon the subject of my securities since the date of the purchase of this 5 000l Danish stock—since the last date I have had conversation with him and also in the presence of Mr Straban with regard to these particular bonds—in the first instance with regard to the general conversation I have had with Mr Bates he has told me that they were quite secure in their custody and they would take charge of them and keep them in safe custody—I am now speaking of all the bonds—but with regard to these Danish bonds I had a special conversation I think in the month of April 1855 with Mr Bates and Mr Strahan—I can state the very date referring to a paper it was on 28th April—I happened to go in on other business and was speaking to Mr Strahan and Mr Bates respecting some dividends on certain shares that I possessed in a gas company and in the course of that conversation I made an observation to them that they had received my dividends upon these 5 000 Danish bonds but that they had not received the dividends upon the gas shares which were at that time due—I spoke from what I had seen in my pass book—I had received my pass book a day or two before and I saw that the Danish bonds were inserted but the gas shares were not and my object in calling upon them was to induce them to obtain the dividends upon the gas shares—the reply of Mr Bates was Yes we have I think received this very morning the dividends upon the gas shares but they are not yet brought to your account but I will go out and ascertain the fact —this happened in an inner room and he went out into the bank and came back saying yes they had been received on that very morning—I do not think anything more was said on that occasion about the Danish 5 per cents —I know that this was on 28th April—Mr Bates and Mr Strahan were both present at that conversation—the dividends upon the Danish 5 per cents have been regularly passed to my account in the pass book—the last entry is on 16th March 1855 COURT Q From the time they were first bought up to 16th March 1855 the dividends upon the 5 000l Danish bonds were regularly carried to your account in the pass book A Yes MR BODKIN Q Give us the entries of March 1854 A The way in which it is recorded here is March 1st six months Danish ditto 121l 7s 1d —before that there are other dividends—the word ditto refers to dividends—with the exception of the difference of income tax that is the same amount that had been uniformly paid for the dividends down to that time—the previous entry is Sept 1853 six months on 5 000l Danish 5 per cents 121l 7s 1d —the same sum that was paid in March 1854—in Sept 1854 it runs thus Sept 2nd six months upon 5 000l Danish 5 per cents 117l 14s 2d that is the difference of income tax—that is the last item—the dividends were regularly carried to my account from the first period down to March 1855—I do not know that the variance in the amount arose from the difference of income tax but I conclude it was so—I took it for granted I said nothing on the subject—I never at any time gave to the defendants or either of them any authority direct or indirect to negotiate pledge transfer or sell these securities or in any manner to convert them to their own use or benefit—I never gave them any plea or pretext under which they might consider themselves entitled so to act COURT Q What was it that they were to do A To keep them in safe custody and to receive the dividends and bring them to my account—what I mean is that I never overdrew my account—I never asked them for any accommodation or anything of that description—I never gave them any plea upon which they could possibly dispose of these securities MR BODKIN Q I suppose your balance was always rather a good one A Rather larger than was prudent I suppose—I happened to be in London in June last when I heard of the stoppage of the house of Strahan and Co —it happened to be whispered on a Sunday afternoon that was the first time I heard of it—I put the matter into the hands of my solicitors and warrants were applied for at Bow-street against the defendants—application had been made at the bank by my direction for some information as to my securities in the first instance and we could get no satisfactory information respecting them—after the application at Bow-street Mr Strahan called upon me—I was then stopping in Lower Berkeley-street Q Will you be good enough to tell us what passed between Mr Strahan and yourself upon that occasion A May I be permitted to refer to a memorandum which I made at the time to refresh my memory —I made it either that evening or the day following— The witness was permitted to refer to the memorandum —perhaps I may premise that a friend of Mr Strahan s had called upon me before he came two friends of his indeed had called at separate times one of them I saw—Mr Strahan s first observetion was to this effect that he was surprised to hear that I could obtain no information at the bank respecting my securities for he and his partners were there constantly to give whatever information might be required—this I believe was in reference to the conversation which I had had with his friend—he then stated that they were engaged day and night in making up their accounts and that if I proceeded with the legal measures I had commenced it would be very detrimental to the creditors at large and particularly to myself for the securities had been so disposed of that there was no possible chance of my recovering anything of them whereas if I abstained from those proceedings there would be a good prospect of my having them replaced or redeemed I forget which word he used replaced I think it was as both be and Sir John Paul had great expectations of receiving money hereafter by which those securities of mine might be restored to me and indeed he added they had prepared notes of hand for me in case I should have called at the bank—he then proceeded to say that my securities had been taken by Sir John Paul himself to the City and placed in the hands of either Overend and Co or Burland and Co he could not tell me which but he said that Sir John Paul was not alone to blame that he himself was equally to blame and equally responsible for the transaction inasmuch as it was done with his full knowledge and consent Indeed said he I gave them to him and immediately added I assure you it was the first dishonest act of my life I never before defrauded any man of sixpence —I asked him when this happened—he said about 6 weeks ago—he then said that the securities so disposed of amounted in value to nearly 100 000l —he was speaking in that conversation of the great body of securities not in reference merely to this 5 000l but of the body of my securities and in making that observation I suppose he adverted to the whole misappropriations of the bank not merely to the whole of mine but to others as well as mine to the amount of nearly 100 000l but he said yours was by far the largest amount belonging to any one individual —I asked him in reference to the disposal of my securities whether some of them had not been disposed of to Messrs Peppercorn—they are brokers that transact business generally in the purchase of these securities—he answered that he believed some of them might have been disposed of through their means—I also asked him whether my special securities speaking generally of them were kept in my box—I had a box there of which they had a key and I had a key—it had only one lock—he said no they were not they were kept with other securities of a similar nature but in a parcel tied up by themselves with my name attached to it—I think he said they were kept in a strong room—he then urged upon me the impolicy of my proceeding and stated that many others who were similarly circumstanced with myself had been very kind to them and begged that I would abandon the proceedings—he said that he knew the warrants were issued—this was on the very day that Mr Bates was in custody I think that Sir John Paul had escaped from the officers and that the warrants were out for the apprehension of Mr Strahan—it was on the day following the issuing of the warrants on the Wednesday—my reply to him was this that I was not actuated by any vindictive feeling towards them but that I felt I had a public duty to perform it was a duty I owed to society to proceed and that I could not conscientiously pass over so grave an offence without continuing the proceedings—I also told him that I had placed the matter in the hands of my solicitor—I declined to stop and referred to my solicitors Messrs Fearon of Great George-street—his reply was If I go to him he will arrest me at once —that was the whole of the conversation—upon my declining he said Very well then it must be so and he took his leave Cross-examined by SIR F THESIGER Q I understand you to say that you never saw these Danish bonds at any time A I never saw them—I am not able to answer whether they are securities which pass from hand to hand without any assignment—the dividends were payable in March and Sept every year—they were brought to my account in March and Sept—to the best of my belief I have given an accurate account of the conversation that I had with Mr Strahan on the occasion when he called upon me—I will not say that I may not have omitted something—if you will call my attention to it you may possibly be apprised of something that I may have omitted—there was one question that I asked Mr Strahan which I have studiously abstained from stating and it is quite irrelevant and I do not wish to state it unless it is desired—I made the memorandum of the conversation either the evening of the interview or the following morning—my belief is that I have stated accurately what occurred between Mr Strahan and myself on that occasion—the two interviews I have spoken of were not the only interviews I had with Mr Strahan—I can hardly say that the first interview I have spoken of was with reference to these securities at all for I reposed that confidence in him that I never could have expected this matter would have taken place—I really cannot say that I had any other interview with Mr Strahan besides those two—Mr Bates was the person with whom I generally almost invariably transacted business with Mr Strahan very rarely with Sir John Paul never Cross-examined by MR SERJEANT BYLES with MR BALLANTINE for Sir John Paul Q I observe that you stated that you had a box of which they had a key and you had a key A Yes—I supposed that these bonds had been kept in that box—I had had securities in that box—the box was bought on purpose to be put in their safe custody with a view of retaining mortgage deeds and other securities Cross-examined by MR EDWIN JAKES with MR PARRY for Bates You mentioned some gas shares those shares you found did you not they have not been transferred A They were not in their custody—I think the Gas Company had them—they had nothing to do with them but to receive the dividends—happily they had not the shares I gave them a power of attorrney to receive the dividends MR ATTORNEY GENERAL Q They would require your signature before they could be transferred would they not A I think so but I cannot answer that question—they were in the possession of a friend I never saw them CHARLES PEPPERCORN I am a stock and share broker in partnership with my cousin and carry on business at No 2 Royal Exchange-buildings I was in the habit of making purchases for the firm of Messrs Strahan Paul and Bates—I called on them for orders from time to time referring to a book —on 2nd Feb 1850 I made a purchase of 2 000l Danish 5 per cent bonds for the defendants at 100l —I have the purchase note that I made out on that occasion—I received an order from them to make that purchase —that order is entered in my order book which I produce—this is the order Buy 2000l Danish 5 per cents for Dr J Griffith —the date of that order is 28th Jan —I did it on 2nd Feb —this order book was kept by the defendants—when it was filled up I returned it to them—the bonds that I purchased were delivered at the defendants banking house with the purchase note COURT Q Is it a special order book of theirs or an order book of yours in which you take orders from your customers A An order book of theirs—this book does not show how many bonds constituted the 2 000l —by my book it appears there were five bonds of 400l each MR POLAND Q What were the numbers of them A Nos 378 460 459 457 and 458 JOHN HILL I am a stock broker in partnership with Mr David Sims I was in the habit of making purchases for the defendants firm and of calling there for orders the order was generally on a slip of paper sometimes verbal On 15th April 1850 I made a purchase of 1 000l Danish 5 per cents by their instruction—this produced is the order they gave me 15th April buy 1 000l Danish 5 per cents —it does not say for whom—we completed that order—it was one bond for 1 000l No 87—this is the bought note that I sent to the defendants—the amount is 958l 15s —that includes our commission—Dr Griffith s name does not appear on this note—I am not sure in whose handwriting the order was I think it was Mr Bates but I could not say that it was so—on 10th April 1851 we received an order to purchase 2 000l Danish 5 per cents —we bought them on the 10th April they were delivered on the 16th—they consisted of two bonds of 400l each Nos 426 and 573 two of 300l Nos 793 and 794 six of 100l Nos 657 659 to 663 inclusive—we sent those bonds with the bought note to the defendants COURT Q What was the amount A The amount including our commission was 2 037l 10s —we received that ultimately we received 2 035l at the time and the commission was settled afterwards—they paid us the net cost of the stock on that day our commission account was settled with them at the end of the year Cross-examined by MR SERJEANT BYLES Q This transaction as I understand took place in April 1851 did you receive any instructions about the month of June 1854 to purchase or repurchase for these gentlemen any Danish fives A I have no books of that period with me and therefore I cannot speak to anything The witness was directed to fetch his books relating to that period JAMES ALLEN I was for many years a clerk in the house of Strahan Paul and Co bankers in the Strand The late Sir John Paul died about three or four years ago I do not know the exact year—in 1850 the firm was William Strahan Sir John Dean Paul John Dean Paul and Robert Makin Bates that continued to be the firm up to the time of the death of Sir John Paul—there was no alteration in the firm after that they kept up the same upon the cheques—I never heard of any alteration—the three defendants have continued to act as the members of the firm from that time down to the period of their bankruptcy—the securities that were in the bank before the death of Sir John Paul continued in the same custody after his death—they were kept in tin boxes in the strong room—the usual mode was for the entries in the pass books of the customers to be copied into the general books of the bank COURT Q Which was it the pass book copied from the bank books or the books from the pass book A The pass book was copied from the ledger MR BODKIN Q Had the three defendants access to that ledger and to the books of the bank generally A Certainly constantly—it was part of my duty to prepare lists of the coupons which entitled parties to receive the dividends upon them—I cut them off the Danish bonds as they became due—that was my duty—I made a list out and gave them to a clerk to take into the City to receive the dividends—I did that in Sept 1851—I believe Messrs Hambro and Co were the agents for that loan in London—this is the list produced —it is No 1164—that is the list that I prepared in Sept 1851—the coupons that I then made a list of were Nos 426 573 793 and 794—the dividend on No 426 was 10l that must have been a 400l bond—No 573 was also a 400l bond—Nos 793 and 794 were 300l bonds the dividend upon them was 7l 10s —there are some others Nos 457 458 459 and 460—then there is No 87 that is a 1000l bond 378 a 400l bond—I have got all the 5000 with the exception of six of 100l — looking at another list in this list I find No 657—this is a list made out at the time—No 657 was a 100l bond—then there are Nos 659 660 661 662 and 663 each for 100l —the numbers that I have given are the numbers of the bonds from which I tore the coupons for the purpose of receiving the dividends that were then due COURT Q Then there were in the possession of these parties in Sept 1851 all the bonds of which those were the coupons A Yes MR BODKIN Q Did you continue to receive those dividends in the same way down to March 1854 A Yes I believe so—I should Bay in Sept 1853 was the last time that I cut off the coupons from these bonds for the purpose of having the dividends received—t have here my list of dividends due in Sept 1853—here are Nos 793 and 794 those are 300l bonds—Nos 378 426 427 428 429 and 460 and 573 400l bonds and 87 1000l bond—in this list No 2181 I find the other numbers 657 659 up to 663 Cross-examined by MR SERJEANT BYLES Q Are you aware of any other customer besides Dr Griffith having at that time any Danish 5 per cent bonds A No—I am not aware of it—it was my duty to cut off the coupons—if there were others they would appear in the same list but they are not all checked off ALEXANDER BEATTIE I am one of the Directors of the National Life Assurance Society and carry on business in King William-street I have for some time been acquainted with the three defendants—Sir John Paul I knew very intimately—he came to me twice and applied to me to lend a sum of money upon foreign securities—the first time was towards the close of 1853 I could not say the exact date—at that time he wanted me to advance 20 000l —he wanted my Company to advance it—I told him that we did not advance upon foreign securities but I suggested as he was in want of the loan that he could easily do it upon the Stock Exchange—he afterwards came to me again upon the same subject—then the war had commenced and I stated to him there would be difficulty in borrowing at that time—he told me it was necessary he should have funds and he was desirous either tomorrow or to sell the securities that he had with him—I only know the period of this second interview from the facts that issued from it it was in the beginning of March 1854—he gave me a small memorandum of the securities and he requested me either to obtain a loan or if that was not practicable to get the things sold for him—in consequence of that I asked my brokers Messrs Foster and Braithwaite to manage the matter as they could—Sir John Paul gave me a memorandum of the securities—he did not give me the securities themselves—I never became possessed of the securities—I took the memorandum to my brokers and gave them instruction to carry out Sir John s wishes—I received from Foster and Braithwaite it the proper date two cheques which represented the value of the two parcels of stock sold—these are the cheques produced —one is for 4 795l 15s and the other for 7 487l 10s —I could not say with accuracy that I received that cheque for 4795l 15s in respect of any particular sale because I did not pay particular attention to the bonds that were sold—I merely handed the order over as the friend of Sir John and had no business transaction with it—I handed over the small memorandum of the bonds and received the cheques—it is probable that I had the same notes and at the time I no doubt knew it but as it was a matter passing simply through my hands I have no recollection of it—I should have given those cheques to Sir John but he represented to me the necessity of having notes and asked me if I could oblige him with notes instead of them and in order to do so I paid then cheques over to my own bankers and gave him an open cheque on my bankers to take bank notes—the cheque I gave him was for 12 281l 5s the amount of the two other cheques— The date of the two cheques was stated to be 14th March 1854 and the date of the last 16th March JOHN ROBERT GIBSON I am a member of the Stock Exchange I was formerly a clerk to Messrs Foster and Braithwaite—I remember the sale of some Danish 5 per cent stock by them while I was in their employment—on 15th March 1854 I saw Mr Beattie—as far as I can remember it was at his office—I saw there some bonds of Danish 5 per cent stock—as far as I can recollect I went to Mr Beattie s office and received the bonds from him there—I am not confounding the memoranda with the bonds—I received the bonds themselves—I received 10 000 3 per cent bonds and 5000 Danish 5 per cents—I entered in my book the numbers of those bonds—1 have my book here—there was one for 1000l No 87 7 of 100l each Nos 378 573 426 and 457 to 460 both inclusive 2 of 300l each Nos 793 and 794 6 of 100l each Nos 657 659 to 663—those bonds were sold through Foster and Braithwaite s house—one of these cheques produced was drawn for the proceeds of the Danish 5 per cents —the amount of it is 4 793l 15s —the other cheque was given for the 3 per cents—I do not know to whom the 5 per cents were sold JOSEPH HOWELL I was formerly clerk to Messrs Foster and Braithwaite I was so in March 1854—on 15th March 1854 I delivered some bonds to Messrs Rothschild and Sons—I believe I delivered some on the 15th and some on the 16th—I delivered 4500 Danish 5 per cent bonds No 87 for 1 000l 378 426 457 458 459 460 573 and 577 for 400l 793 and 794 for 300l and 657 for 100l —I delivered those on 16th March—I only delivered to Roths childs one 100l bond No 657—I delivered some Danish 5 per cent bonds to Cohen s on the previous day 15th March—they were Nos 659 to 663 both inclusive of 100l each—I have them entered in the jobber s sale book WILLIAM LEVINGTON SNUDDEN I am a clerk in the banking house of Smith Payne and Smith I produce some Danish 5 per cent bonds—there are 4 of 100l each numbered 659 to 663 inclusive—they are now in the possession of Smith Payne and Smith—they hold them on account of Mr Joseph Sykes a customer of theirs—they were deposited with us on 16th March 1854 and have been in our custody ever since—we have received on account of Mr Sykes the dividends that have become due upon those bonds while they have been in our possession up to the present time and have carried them to the credit of Mr Sykes ISAAC BRAITHWAITE I am a partner in the firm of Foster and Braithwaite I recollect the circumstance of the sale of these Danish 5 per cents—I recollect distinctly having the order from Mr Beattie to sell the bonds—these 2 cheques for 4 793l 15s and 7 487l 10s are in my handwriting—I have no doubt that the 4 793l cheque was for the proceeds of the Danish 5 per cents —this is the counterfoil of my cheque book—the cheque is dated the 14th March—I have no doubt that is a clerical error the correct date ought to be the 15th March—there is a date on the counterfoil of the cheque above and also on the cheque below but there is no date on the I counterfoil of that particular cheque—I have no doubt whatever that these cheques were drawn on 15th March although they bear the date of the 14th—I cannot tell you the date of the sale ALFRED TINGLE I am clerk to Jonas Simonson and Co of No 4 Savage Gardens This list No 3388 was filled up by me—it is dated 4th Sept 1854—it contains among others 2 coupons No 458 for 10l and 793 for 7l 10s —I subsequently received from Messrs Hambro the money for those—we received the coupons from a correspondent in Copenhagen of the name of F C Broom and cashed them at Hambro s—1 have here another list No 3713 dated 3rd March 1855—that was made out by me—it contains among others a coupon No 458 for 10l and 793 for 7l 10s —I took that list to Messrs Hambro and received the money—I believe they came from the flame correspondent at Copenhagen hot I cannot say certainly from whom I received that list—the one of Sept 1854 we received from Mr Broom of Copenhagen—they came into our hands to cash for some correspondent of ours—I do not know that it was the same correspondent FREDERICK MACKENZIE I am clerk to Over end Gurney and Co I filled up this list 3713—I had a coupon numbered 87 at that time—I obtained payment of the dividend by virtue of that coupon on 28th August 1854—I received a cheque for 25l —that dividend was due on 1st Sept 1854—I lodged the list on 28th August—this is the cheque I received—it is dated 1st Sept—I received that cheque in respect of the coupon of 28th August—here is a list No 3895—that was left on 26th April 1855—the dividend was due on 1st March 1855—I got a cheque for 110l for it—the coupons in respect of which I received that cheque were numbered 426 and 457 for 100l each—I presented the list and the coupons at Hambro s and got the money from them—we received the coupons from a correspondent at Copenhagen and received the money for him Cross-examined by MR SERJEANT BYLES Q Was there a deposit with Overend and Gurney s of 5000 Danish 5 per cents on 30th April 1855 MR ATTORNEY GENERAL Do you know that of your own knowledge A No MR SERJEANT BYLES Q Are the bonds here A I do not know anything about the bonds—all I know about is the coupons we got from Copenhagen THOMAS CLARK I am clerk to Messrs Westerholtz Brothers of No 26 Mark-lane I have before me the list 3746—I made it out—it contains among others coupons due on 1st March numbered 378 459 460 and 573—I delivered that list at Messrs Hambro s and received the money COURT Q Who did you receive it fort A For a correspondent at Hamburg—I received it on 13th March—a correspondent at Hamburg had the coupons of these bonds in March 1855 FREDERICK SAVORY I am clerk to Messrs Hambro and Son of London They are agents for the 5 percent Danish loan of 1949—the bonds upon which that loan was received were issued from our house—I was not in the house at the time I therefore can only state it as a thing I know but not from my own private knowledge CHARLES JOACHIM HAMBRO I am the only person in the firm of Hambro and Son—my father was the son —the Danish 5 per cent loan was negotiated by me—the bonds produced are some of the bonds issued by my house upon that occasion by the authority of the Danish Government—they all bear my signature—these are the bonds I issued—the coupons that are attached to them entitle the parties periodically to receive the dividends due—the practice is to tear them off from the bonds every six months and receive them as they become due—the coupons bear the same number and letter as the bonds—no two bonds of the same number are issued of the same loan—it is impossible that there could be two bonds of 100l bearing the same number—as far as I remember they were running numbers and then it would be impossible that there could be a bond of 100l of the same number as a bond of 200l Cross-examined by SIR F THESIGER Q The coupons are all dated are they not A They are not dated they are only numbered—yes they are dated the twelfth dividend warrant due on such a day—the time when the dividend becomes due is marked in each coupon but not the date of the issue—they are all payable on 1st March and 1st Sept in each year—the bond bears the signature of the Royal Minister of Finance and the whole bond falls due when the whole of the coupons are paid if not before—every six months there is a drawing of the bonds and if the bond is drawn it is paid off in the intermediate time WILLIAM BELL I am an official assignee of the Court of Bankruptcy I was the official assignee of the bankruptcy of the defendants—in June last an application was made to me by Messrs Fearon and Clabon the solicitors of Dr Griffith with reference to some securities of his that had been lodged with the defendants—it was made verbally and I think there was a note also—in consequence of that application I went to the banking house in the Strand—I there saw Mr Strahan and I think Mr Bates—I think it was on the 16th—it was after the bankruptcy—the bankruptcy was on 11th June and it was in that same week—I asked Mr Strahan what had become of Dr Griffith s securities—he said they were sold or pawned—my impression is that he at first merely said they would not be forthcoming but having seen my own note which I made immediately I find it is they were either pawned or deposited and therefore I have no doubt those were the words he used sold or pawned—I have not the memorandum now in my possession—Mr Strahan used the words sold or pawned—I do not mean that he used one or other of those words but both—he was not prepared to say whether they were sold or pawned—he said they would not be forthcoming and that they were sold or pawned—I am not certain whether it was on that day but I had asked if there was not a general security book and I got no answer—I asked that question in the course of that week either then or on a prior day—Mr Strahan and Mr Bates were present when I asked about the security book—no answer was made they looked at each other and there was no book forthcoming —I am not sure that there was anything said upon the occasion—when Mr Strahan said these securities were either sold or pawned I cannot say whether Mr Bates was sitting in the room or not bat he was very much in the habit of walking into the shop in front and of walking about the room—I am speaking of that interview—whether he was exactly seated by Mr Strahan I cannot say—I have no doubt he was in the room at the time—I had visited the house two or three times between the 6th and 11th—I do not recollect on which occasion it was that I asked about the security book Cross-examined by SIR F THESIGER Q I understand you are not speaking with any great certainty with regard to this conversation you had with Mr Strahan A I am speaking with certainty—he said they were either sold or pawned that they would not be forthcoming that they were either sold or pawned—I will say that he said they were either sold or pawned—I certainly would not like to swear that he said the securities would not be forthcoming but my belief is that he first of all said they would not be forthcoming—my memorandum is in the hands of Messrs Fearon—it was a note which I wrote to them immediately upon Mr Strahan answering me so—I do not know whether that note is here COURT Q When did you see it A At Bow-street in the hands of Mr Bodkin—it was in my handwriting and those were the words that I remember perfectly well MR ATTORNEY GENERAL Q Did any Danish bonds come into your hands as official assignee A I think none—none of Dr Griffith s at all events—I do not think any of the securities that have been handed over to me were Danish I think no Danish 5 per cents came into my hands Cross-examined by MR HAWKINS Q I believe you were the official assignee in attendance on 25th June A Yes at the choice of assignees—there is a statement now upon the proceedings it was merely formally handed in—this is it referring to the proceedings —this paper was handed to me as the official assignee MORRIS NORDEN I am clerk to Messrs Fearon and Clabon solicitors of Great George-street I employed myself in Quaking a search for these securities of Dr Griffith s when the low was discovered—Mr Fearon directed me to call upon Messrs Lawrence and Plews the solicitors for the fist and on several other persons—I at last called at the banking house in the Strand—I gave the date to Mr Humphreys it was a day or two after the bankruptcy had become notorious in the early part of June—I believe I saw Mr Bates I do not know who else—I believe it was Mr Bates I saw he answered to the name of Bates—I believe he is the gentleman I saw—I did not take especial notice—I asked for Mr Bates and saw a person who answered to that name—I believe the defendant to be that person there were two other gentlemen sitting down with him at a table in the inner room of the banking house—it must have been about the 14th June—I had in my hand this paper which is in Dr Griffith s handwriting and which contains the list of his securities that were in their hands and I told them that I had called from Messrs Fearon and Clabon Dr Griffith s solicitors that Dr Griffith was exceedingly anxious to learn whether or not they were safe and I read these from this list—among other things that I read from this list there was 5 000 5 per cent Danish bonds—Mr Bates replied that he could not say anything about them or he could not say anything about them in particular that if there were any securities they would be in the hands of the official assignee Cross-examined by MR JAKES Q Are You quite sure it was Mr Bates A Yes I believe it was—I do not know his son I do not know any of them to the best of my belief it was Mr Bates—I am not quite sure—I did not take especial notice at the time COURT Q Then it might have been young Mr Bates who might answer naturally enough to the name of Mr Bates A It might have been I believe it was the same gentleman that stands here but I am not positive about it JOHN HILL re-examined by MR SERJEANT BYLES I have now got my Book of 1854 here On 1st June 1854 we purchased by order of Messrs Strahan and Co 5 000 Danish 5 per cents the sum paid for them was 5 100l —they were bought at a premium—we paid 102l for each 100l bond—the amount of our commission was 6l 2s —there were seven 100l bonds Nos 2106 5289 5290 2556 1166 1607 and 735—one of 500l No 355 one of 300l No 935 another of 500l No 378 and thirty 100l bonds besides making the 5000—they were Nos 5373 5370 and then six-teen bonds running from 985 to 1000 both inclusive—ten numbered 1084 to 1093 and two numbered 1164 and 1165—we bought all those bonds for Messrs Strahan—they were delivered to them on 1st June 1854 and paid for by them subsequently to that date SIR F THESIGER desired to take the opinion of the COURT whether then was any evidence to go to the Jury as affecting Mr Strahan the offence charged related to certain bonds numbered in a particular manner and sold by Foster and Braithwaite in March 1854 he submitted that there was no evidence to connect Mr Strahan with that transaction nor any evidence at all affecting him except the conversation with Dr Griffith in which conversation Mr Strahan referred to a transaction occurring only in June last The Judges were of opinion that there was evidence for the Jury MR SERJEANT BYLES called the following witnesses for the Defence THEOPHILUS ABRAHALL I produce the petition for adjudication in bankruptcy—it is dated 11th June 1855 Montague John Tatham is the petitioning creditor—the adjudication is the same date 11th June 1855—the first meeting was on 25th for the choice of assignees—the bankrupts surrendered on 12th June they surrendered immediately—the summons is not here it is not usual to file the summons when they surrender—the examination of the bankrupts is here—first there was a joint declaration signed but there was no examination— The joint declaration was dated 25th June 1855 signed by the Defendants and was in the following words The Above named bankrupts solemnly depose and declare that the statement now handed by us to the official assignee under our bankruptcy is a true statement of the matters and facts therein contained and contains a true and correct account of all and every bond and security which have been sold pledged or otherwise converted by us or either of us or by our direction or authority COURT Q Pray did Mr Commissioner Evans order them to make any declaration A No he did not so I understand I was not in the Court at the time it was a very crowded meeting and the Commissioner desired me to sit in the other Court to take the proofs and this occurred in my absence— The account referred to was put in and read in part among other things it stated that the 5 000l Danish 5 per cents of Dr Griffith bought by them date not specified were deposited with Overend and Co on 13th April 1855—the separate statement of Sir John Dean Paul was read as follows 25th June 1855 The account now filed in Court contains a true account of all securities of my customers at any time pledged or converted by me the particulars can be found in the banking books namely a green stock book and ledger The separate statement of Mr Strahan was in the same words That of Mr Bates was as follows The account now filed in Court contains a true account of all the securities of the customers of our firm at any time pledged or converted by any of the partners thereof and the particulars can be found in the banking books namely a green stock book and ledger JAMES GRAHAM LEWIS I am attorney for two of the defendants Mr Strahan and Sir John Paul—I was first consulted by them on 22nd June—it was by my advice that this statement was prepared acting also under the advice of counsel COURT Q Then you and the counsel agreed to do what A We agreed that inasmuch as the defendants were declared bankrupts they should surrender under that bankruptcy and make a statement of every transaction they had had with reference to every security Q For what purpose A For the general purpose of assisting the creditors and for the special purpose of making a disclosure under the statute MR SERJEANT BYLES Q What took place in Court when this was done A The bankrupts appeared in Court a statement of the various securities which are now upon the file was produced to the Commissioner and the bankrupts requested to hand it in as their statement with reference to the securities which they had received from customers and the manner of their disposal not with reference to this prosecution solely but as a general statement upon which Mr Commissioner Evans stated that as no creditor had asked for them the bankrupts were at liberty to hand them in to the official assignee if they thought fit—the statement was then handed in with a deposition which appears upon it—that is what has just been read—to the best of my recollection the Commissioner signed that deposition—after that the solicitor for the fiat Mr Lawrence took the depositions and the accounts out of the hand of the official assignee and called upon each bankrupt to make a separate statement—after that voluntary deposition if it may be so termed Mr Lawrence took the depositions and the accounts out of the hand of the official assignee and then examined each bankrupt separately as to the truth of the statement contained in that account and I think to the best of my recollection it was put in these words Is this account of all the securities that you have converted using not the exact terms of the Act all the account you wish to render with reference to the disposal of these shares or something to that effect—I think the words are down in the depositions because I wrote them down immediately and the Commissioner signed it—each made a separate deposition—each answered Yes COURT Q I suppose the question was merely in the terms of the answer A Yes they are mostly taken so in bankruptcy—the solicitor for the assignees asked these questions and I reduced them into writing—after they had been so reduced into writing they were signed by the several bankrupts they then declared to the truth of them and the Commissioner signed his name Cross-examined by MR ATTORNEY-GENERAL Q You save said that this had been arranged before hand I think when you got to the Court the first thing that was done was Mr Parry applied to the Commissioner on behalf of Mr Bates to be permitted to make a statement disclosing certain transactions which had taken place with reference to the securities deposited with the bankrupts by various persons A It was an application generally on the part of the whole it was to that purport to be allowed to be examined COURT Q What did Mr Parry apply for A To examine or put in the examinations MR ATTORNEY-GENERAL Q Did not Mr Parry apply on behalf of the bankrupts to be allowed to examine them with reference to these securities and the disposition of them A With reference to the statement of the securities which he then held in his hand—the Commissioner at first said I refuse your application if any creditor applies for the bankrupts to be examined he can do so but upon the bankrupts own application I refuse it —upon that Mr Parry said Then I formally tender this as the declaration of the bankrupts and your Honour may accept it or not —he said those words with a great many others—he added that under the statute they were entitled to give it in as their statement COURT Q Therefore they claimed to be entitled to do this under the statute and get themselves off by their own statement A Under the Bankruptcy Act MR ATTORNEY-GENERAL Q Did his Honour on that say Let them put in what they like if they sign it A He did Q As soon as the paper was signed did not Mr Parry apply to Mr Lawrence and ask him if he wished to put any questions to them A Not within my hearing or knowledge—I will not swear that did not take place but I solemnly swear not within my hearing or knowledge or to my belief—I will not say whether he did or did not say to Mr Lawrence Do you wish to ask the bankrupts any questions and I will state why I was engaged at the moment in writing down the depositions the first one which accompanied the first petition and the account and the Court was so crowded and there was so much noise going on that I really cannot undertake to say whether he did or not—I had not had any previous communication with Mr Lawrence none whatever except applying to him to know whether he would bring the bankrupts up so that they might be examined at that meeting—Mr Lawrence declined in any way to interfere or assist me and I was obliged to apply to another Commissioner not the one adjudicating upon the fiat and undertake to pay the expense of bringing them up—I then communicated to Mr Lawrence that a warrant had been granted for bringing up the bankrupts and that was all that took place with reference to it—the defendants were then detained in the House of Detention—I had to get a warrant to the Governor to bring them up in order that they might surrender on the first public meeting to make such disclosure as I thought might be beneficial in the event of a certificate meeting—at that time they were all in custody on criminal warrants upon this very matter—I believe the first joint examination before the Magistrate was on that same day no not the morning of the 25th on the morning of the 22nd which was Friday—upon that same day I applied to the Commissioner about four o clock in the afternoon for a warrant to bring them up to be examined upon the Monday—it was not only for the purpose of making the disclosure—it was for that purpose amongst others—it was for the purpose of making a disclosure with reference to all the securities they had converted and to be present at any meeting to answer any questions which any creditor might put to them upon any subject MR SERJEANT BYLES Q I need hardly ask you whether there was any understanding between yourself and Mr Lawrence of any sort or kind whatever A Not the most remote—I never had any conversation with him upon the subject COURT Q I suppose neither Dr Griffith nor his attorney were there or desired to interfere A Dr Griffith s attorney was there—he did attempt to interfere WILLIAM BOIS I am a clerk to Messrs Overend Gurney and Co I have a memorandum of some bonds deposited with us by Sir John Paul and Co —they came from John Young—he deposited them with us—he came and borrowed the money of us—it came out afterwards that it was for Sir John Paul—I was not aware of it at the time—he came for the money for Sir John Paul—the numbers were 2106 for 100l 5290 5289 2556 1166 1607 and 735 one for 500l No 355 one for 300l No 935 another for 500l No 378 and the rest for 100l Nos 5373 5370 985 to 1000 inclusive 1084 to 1093 inclusive and 1164 and 1165 making 5 000l —those were pledged with other things on 30th April this year by the attorney for Strahan and Paul STRAHAN— GUILTY Aged 48 PAUL— GUILTY Aged 53 BATES— GUILTY Aged 65 On 1st and 3 rd Counts — Transported for Fourteen Years

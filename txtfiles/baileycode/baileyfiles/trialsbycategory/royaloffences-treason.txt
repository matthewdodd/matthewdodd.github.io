we will proceed to the trial of Arthur Thistlewood on Monday COURT Be it so MONDAY APRIL 17 ARTHUR THISTLEWOOD was put to the bar and the following Jury sworn - Alexander Barclay Teddington gentleman and grocer Thomas Goodchild North End Hendon Esq Thomas Suffield Aldersey Lisson-grove Esq James Herbert Isleworth carpenter John Shooter North End Hendon gentleman Samuel Granger Blackwall lighterman George Dickenson Colt Street Limehouse builder John Edward Shepherd Eden-grove Holloway gentleman John Fowler St John-Street iron-plate-worker William Gibbs Roberts Rope-maker s Fields Limehouse cooper John Dobson Felix-place Islington Esq William Cooper Grove-street St Pancras gentleman The Prosecution was conducted by the ATTORNEY and SOLICITOR GENERAL and MESSRS GURNEY LITTLEDALE and BOLLAND THE ATTORNEY GENERAL stated the case to the Jury after which the following evidence was called - ROBERT ADAMS I lived at No 4 Hole in the Wall-passage Brooks-market and am a shoemaker I was in the Royal Regiment of Horse Guards I left that service eighteen years ago - I know the prisoner Brunt Q When did you first become acquainted with him - A At Cambray in France in 1815 he then went by the name of Thomas Morton - I also know Thistlewood I first became acquainted with him on the 13th of January last he then lived in Stanhope-street Clare-market in the front room on the second floor I was introduced to him by Brunt and Ings Q Now will you tell us what conversation passed on the 13th when you saw Thistlewood - A I was introduced into the room by Brunt - on going in Brunt said to Thistlewood This is the man I was speaking to you about - Thistlewood said You was once in the Life Guards I said No I was not but I originally belonged to the Blues He said I presume you are a good swordsman I said I could use a sword to defend myself but I could not say I was so good a swordsman as I was some years ago not having used a sword or other arms for sometime On this he began to allude to the gentry of this country doing all he could to make them mean and contemptible saying there was no person worth 10 l that was worth any thing for the good of his country and as for the shopkeepers they were a set of Aristocrats altogether that they were all working under one system of government and it would be his glory to see the day when all the shops would be shut up and well plundered The discourse then turned on Mr Hunt - Thistlewood saidHunt was a d - d coward and no friend to the people and he had no doubt that if he could get into Whitehall he should find his name on the Government books as a spy for Government He next said that Mr Cobbett and all his writings were no good to the country and he had no doubt but he was a spy equally with Hunt himself - that finished the discourse at that time as far as I can recollect exactly Q Were you afterwards confined in Whitecross-street prison for debt - A Yes on the 17th of January Some other interviews took place between me and Thistlewood before that I had an interview with him on Sunday the 16th at the White Hart public-house in Brooks-market in a room in the back yard Ings Brunt and Hall and before it broke up Tidd was present I remained in prison till Sunday the 30th of January Q After you came out did you see Thistlewood - A I saw him on Monday evening the 31st in the back room on the same floor on which Brunt lives in Fox-court Gray s Inn-lane I cannot exactly tell the number Brunt Ings Hall and Davidson were present I cannot charge my memory with anybody else Nothing particular took place on that night To the best of my recollection I met him next on the Wednesday Thistlewood Brunt Davidson Harrison and Edwards were there On going into the room I saw a number of pike-staves Thistlewood was anxious to have them ferrelled and expressed himself surprised that a person named Bradburn the prisoner was not come I do not know his trade Davidson in particular began to express himself dissatisfied and gave a hint that Bradburn was supplied with money to purchase ferrels to put on the staves and that had not been done The staves were in the room at the time - they were quite green and appeared as if they had just come from the country Q Tell us any thing further that passed that evening - A After Davidson expressing himself dissatisfied about Bradburn not coming forward Thistlewood said he would not give a d - n for any man that would suppose he had spent the money These meetings were held twice a day from the time I came out of prison till the 23d of February Q Who hired the room - A I heard Brunt say he hired it for Ings he did not say for what purpose There was no furniture in it except a stove which was fixed Q You have told us of the meeting on Wednesday when did you go there again - A I cannot be positive but I recollect one circumstance in particular which struck me on one evening Nine or ten days before the funeral of the late King I went up to the room Thistlewood and Harrison were sitting by the fire in deep discourse - there were two chairs they made room for me to sit down and began to tell me the discourse they had been about Harrison was telling Thistlewood that he had met one of the Life Guards who had told him that all the horse and foot soldiers who could be spared would be at the funeral of the King and pretty well all the police officers and Harrison said it struck him that it would be a favourable time for what they had in view as the soldiers would be mostly out of town and the Life Guardsmen and it would be a good time to kick up a row and see what could be done Harrison stated this to Thistlewood Q What did Thistlewood say - A It quite met his approbation he said it certainly would be a good opportunity and he thought provided they could take the two pieces of cannon from Gray s Inn-lane and the six pieces from the Artillery Ground they would have the means of getting possession of London before morning Q What further passed - A Thistlewood quite agreed in the plan and said if once it was began and if a communication went from London to Windsor that they were round London the military would be so tired that when they got to London they would be too fatigued to do any thing He said he had been informed that after they got the cannon they might get to Hyde Park and prevent any communication between London and Windsor In the next place he thought it would be highly necessary to go to the Telegraph over the water and get possession of that to prevent any communication being made with Woolwich and he thought by this time we should be able to form a Provisional Government and that we should send to the sea-ports to prevent any gentlemen from passing out of this country without the passport of the Provisional Government He particularly mentioned Dover Brighton Ramsgate and Margate and at last he thought Brighton would be the most particular of any and it would be necessary to take a force to get possession of it not that he thought the new King would be there or even at the funeral of his father That it was no use for the new King to think of wearing the crown of England for the present family had inherited it long enough Q You said Harrison Thistlewood and yourself were there did any one else come in afterwards - A Brunt and Ings came in afterwards - Thistlewood got up and communicated to them Harrison s idea respecting what might be done at the funeral of the King they heard it and both of them declared that there was nothing short of the assassination which they had in view would satisfy them Q The assassination of whom - A Of the ministers Q Had any conversation taken place before - A Yes at a former meeting I asked them frequently for the plan Brunt told me two or three of them had drawn out a plan with a view to assassinate the cabinet ministers at the first cabinet dinner they had they scarcely ever met without that being the subject Q You saw some pike staves in the room was any thing else ever carried into the room before the meeting at which the funeral of the King was spoken of - A After that meeting I saw things carried in Q Come to the 19th of February - A That was on Saturday I went there between eleven and twelve o clock in the morning to Fox-court and saw Thistlewood Davidson Harrison Ings Brunt and Hall there On my going into the room they all sat round the fire they seemed in confusion and deep study I had scarcely been there a moment before they all got up saying Well it is agreed we are come to the determination that if nothing takes place between this and next Wednesday night we all go to work it was said they were all so poor that they could wait no longer Thistlewood immediately proposed that a committee should meet on the morrow morning Sunday at nine o clock in order to draw out a plan to go by Thistlewood said to Brunt You had better go round this afternoon and collect what men you think you can bring forward in order to mention it to-morrow Brunt said he had some work to finish and did not think he had time but he might get up to-morrow morning and tell a few and he did not want many to be at the meeting Brunt appeared as if he was leaving the room Thistlewood recollected himself and said Oh Brunt it will be highly necessary for all who attend the committee to-morrow morning to bring arms with them in case any officers should come up - on this Brunt said D - n my eyes if any officers come here I would run them through and take care of them afterwards that nothing should be found out This to the best of my recollection finished what I saw on Saturday - in the evening I did not go up Q On Sunday - A On Sunday I went about eleven o clock On entering the room what with the fog and the thickness of the snow the room was completely dark I could scarcely see who was in the room till Tidd said How do you do Adams Q Did you afterwards collect from the conversation and on looking round who was there - A Yes Thistlewood Brunt Ings Hall Davidson Harrison Cook Bradburn Edwards and Wilson I found the business had not been entered into Thistlewood on looking round and counting the heads said I think it is high time we should begin there are twelve in the room and that is enough to form a committee - he proposed that Tidd should take the chair Tidd took the chair and sat with a pike in his hand Mr Thistlewood standing on his left and Brunt on the right Thistlewood began and said Gentlemen I presume you all know what you have met here for turning his head to the door with an allusion that he would not mention the names of the Ministers but said The West End job Brunt perceiving this said Never mind mention their names what occasion have we to fear officers - he was called to order by the chair On this Thistlewood spoke and said Gentlemen we have all come to this determination and are all tired of waiting so long to do this job we have been talking of so long and finding there is no probability of their meeting altogether - Q Whose meeting altogether - A The Ministers He said If in case they do not all dine together between this and Wednesday night we are come to a determination to take them separately at their own homes - and if we take them separately we must content ourselves with taking them three or four together as we can get them I suppose it will take as many as forty or fifty men to do the West End job and I propose that the two pieces of cannon in Gray s Inn-lane and the six pieces in the Artillery-ground shall be taken at the same time He named Cook to take the lead and command in taking the six pieces of cannon in the Artillery-ground and when they were taken they were to take the Mansion House as a seat for the Provisional Government they were then to make an attempt on the Bank of England He directly proposed that Mr Palin should be the man to set fire to different buildings in different parts of London Q Was he to do this by himself - A To the best of my recollection This pretty well finished Thistlewood s plan that morning and he said there was time enough between that and Wednesday night to settle what time we should begin and he should drop the subject at present as Brunt had a proposition to make to them respecting the assassination of the ministers how it was to be done On this Brunt was coming forward to state his plan but Thistlewood said Stop this proposition I have made had better be put from the chair to see whether all are agreeable to what has been said Thistlewood said to the chairman You had better before you put the question ask them all round if they are agreeable The chairman asked them if they had any thing to say respecting it Nobody speaking it was put from the chair and carried unanimously Mr Brunt now came forward with his proposition - he proposed that as many of the ministers as they could form an idea that they could assassinate it should be done on the Wednesday night without waiting an opportunity for their dining together that the men should be divided into separate lots and after the men were lotted there should be a man drawn out of each lot for the sole purpose of assassinating the party they were to have and that whoever it fell upon that man should be bound to do it or be murdered himself and if he attempted the deed and failed in it he swore by all that was good that that man should be run through on the spot On this I got up myself and said to Brunt I wish to ask a question on the few words which have been dropped and said Do you suppose that it is not possible for a man to go to do a thing and not to fail in it and do you mean that man for so failing shall be run through on the spot He said No certainly not unless the man who attempted it should fail in it through cowardice then that man should be run through He here dropped his discourse for the present it was put from the chair and agreed to A few minutes before any thing else occurred Palin Potter and Strange came in they were asked to sit down by the fire being wet and covered with snow - Palin came and sat down by me Thistlewood then told them of the two plans which had been drawn up and settled but as they were not in the room he thought it right the plans should be stated to them Thistlewood related his plan and Brunt his they agreed to them the same as the rest had done After this was gone through Palin got up and said Mr Chairman I have a few words to speak Agreeing as I do with the plans which have been proposed and have held up my hand to assent to them there is one thing I want to know There are so many objects you propose to be done at one time which if they can be done will be a great acquisition to our view but this is what I want to know You talk of taking from forty to fifty men for the West End job I should like to know where you are to find the men to take the cannon in Gray s Inn-lane and the Artillery-ground - where are these men to come from No doubt you know your own strength better than I do but I can give no answer at present what men I can bring forward Before I go round to the men I want to collect this afternoon I want to know whether I am commissioned to communicate what is to be done then I shall know better how to act Am I at liberty to tell them in part or full what is to be done and when they will be wanted The chairman turning hishead to Thistlewood and Brunt said I suppose Mr Palin knows what men he has to depend upon and might state to them what is to be done and when wanted if he can depend on the men it was agreed to by Thistlewood and Brunt for Palin to have that liberty and so he sat himself down seemingly satisfied This finished the business of the chair To the best of my recollection nothing was transacted regularly after that but they began to be in a bustle saying they must go home to dinner in order to call on the men in the afternoon All of a sudden Thistlewood turned round and said Oh Brunt that is well thought of now Palin is here I would have you take him here just by and ask him whether he thinks that can be done Q What was that - A That was to go to the New Furnival s Inn and see if he thought it practicable to clap fire to it Q In consequence of this did they go out - A Brunt said As it is not far I and Palin can go and give our report here They went returned in about ten minutes and Palin gave it in that he thought it was very easy to be done and would make a d - d good fire On this they began to depart but before they left the room Thistlewood said he thought it highly necessary on Tuesday or Wednesday to get what men they could together and give them a treat but he did not know how this could be accomplished as we are all so poor Brunt said D - n my eyes I have got a 1 l note which I have reserved for that purpose and I am d - d if I don t spend it on the men I have got Thistlewood said Where are we to take them to I suppose we might have the room up stairs at the White Hart Brunt said I don t know I don t like to go to that room but never mind I think we need not fear the bl - dy traps for if they come into the room they shall not go out again and he thought he could send his apprentice and the boy out of the way by giving them a holiday and have the men there but nevertheless he should call and see what Hobbs the landlord of the White Hart might have to say Thistlewood said he thought he could take some of them up to his room but then said No that won t do as there is an officer lives opposite me and if he saw men going backwards and forwards it would give suspicion that something was at hand I believe this finished the Sunday morning s business Q When did you meet next - A On the Monday morning but I beg to state a circumstance that occurred between the Sunday and Monday I called on Hobbs - Q What took place on Monday morning - A I went into the room about ten o clock the prisoner Thistlewood was there at the time also Brunt Harrison Hall and Ings I cannot charge my memory with more They asked me if I was well I said I was rather unwell and said Gentlemen I have something to communicate they all turned their eyes on me directly I told them that Hobbs the landlord of the White Hart had told me the evening before that there had been a couple of officers one from Hatton-garden and one from Bow-street to ask him if there was not a Radical meeting held there for there was information at Bow-street and at Lord Sidmouth s office that there was a radical meeting held at his house Harrison turned round on me like a bull-dog and said Adams you have acted d - d wrong - Brunt turned on me and said I had acted wrong I said I did not know that I had He said If you have heard any thing it is your duty to communicate it to me or Mr Thistlewood I said I did not conceive it and that I thought it my duty to communicate it to all as it concerned all They swore at me again and said I had no business to communicate it to any but them two Q What was said in answer to that observation of yours - A He said I had no business to communicate any thing of what I heard out of doors but to them I said What would you have said if I had heard of this and suffered it to be kept to myself when I could have prevented it They then proposed leaving saying they had a number of people to call on and must go to them and that they had to attend a meeting which they called the Marylebone Union Q Was anything proposed by either of them respecting that - A Brunt said he must call at the Marylebone club and several of them said they should attend I shall call there said Brunt for I want some money It was asked by one in the room whether it would be of any use to call there on that speculation Brunt answered Yes it would Q Before you parted was any arrangement made where you were to meet that evening - A Yes I was appointed to be at the room in Brunt s house that was proposed by Thistlewood I was to attend in case any one should come that was not there in the morning as they all agreed to be at the Marylebone club that night I went to Brunt s room Potter called there he was wet and cold and he and I went to the White Hart Palin and Bradburn came there to me Q On the next morning Tuesday the 22d did you go to the room - A Yes I did Brunt Thistlewood Ings Hall Davidson Harrison Wilson Palin Potter and Bradburn were there While we were there Edwards came in went to Thistlewood and told him there was to be a cabinet dinner on Wednesday night which was the next day Thistlewood said I don t think that is true and proposed to send for the newspaper which was brought The paper being brought Thistlewood read out that the Cabinet would dine at the Earl of Harrowby s in Grosvenor-square on Wednesday evening Brunt walked towards the window and said Now I will be d - d if I don t believe that there is a God I have often prayed that these thieves might dine altogether in order that I might destroy them and now God has answered my prayer On this Thistlewood proposed that a committee should sit directly and I was put into the chair Q On this was any proposition made - A Thistlewood after I had called to order began to speak and proposed that a committee should sit directly to form a fresh plan regarding the assassination he was proceeding but I interrupted him and said Gentlemen after what fell from my mouth yesterday I hope you have all given it a due consideration Thistlewood walked backwards and forwards in the room they were all in a state of confusion more like madmen than any thing else and Harrison swore that the first man who dropped a word to throwcold water on the deed they were going upon he would run him through with a sword directly in a few minutes I was put out of the chair and Tidd put into it Thistlewood wanted to proceed in the business but Palin said No Stop I want to be satisfied about what passed from Mr Adams yesterday before the business proceeds any farther Brunt moved in order to do away with any suspicion that there should be a watch set at the Earl of Harrowby s house that night two men were to be set to watch to see if any men or soldiers went into the house in order to waylay them this was approved of The watch was to be set at six o clock until nine and from nine to twelve and to commence again on Wednesday morning at four o clock This was carried and the watch ordered Q What did Brunt say after that - A I cannot charge my memory Thistlewood came forward and said Now from what has fallen from Brunt s mouth I hope you will all be satisfied and if no one such as officer or soldier is found to go into the house it is determined to do what we talk of to-morrow evening Q What was talked of then - A The plan was altered altogether about the assassination Thistlewood thought it would take forty men but more if we could get them It will answer our end said he much better to take them altogether than at their houses separately - in doing that we could not command more than three at most but as there has not been a dinner so long there will be fourteen or sixteen which will be a rare hawl to murder them all I propose to go to the door to present a note to Earl Harrowby and when the door is open for the men to rush in directly and seize the servants who are in the way present a pistol and threaten them with instant death in the event of making a noise This being done a party were to rush forward to take command of the stairs one was to have fire-arms and another with a hand-grenade - another was to take possession of the top of the stairs leading to the lower part of the house these two men placed at the end of the stairs were to be armed in the same manner If any servants attempted to make a retreat these men were to clap fire to the hand grenades throw them in among them and destroy them altogether Two men were to be placed at the area one with a blunderbuss and one with a hand-grenade - if any attempted to retreat that way they were to set fire to the hand-grenades and set fire to them at the time The men who were to go into the room were to rush in directly after into the room where their Lordships were and to murder all they found in the room good or bad and if there were any good ones they would murder them for keeping bad company Ings volunteered himself to enter the room first with a brace of pistols and his cutlass and his knife in his pocket with a determination to cut every head off that was in the room and the heads of Lord Castlereagh and Sidmouth he would bring away in two bags which he provided for the purpose and as soon as he entered the room he should say Well my Lords I have got as good men here as the Manchester Yeomanry enter Citizens and do your duty On this word of command two swordsmen were to enter first to be followed by the rest with hand-grenades pistols swords cutlasses and what not and to fall to and murder all as fast as they could Q Who did Thistlewood fix for the swordsmen - A Harrison and I as being the two men most used to it Harrison had been in the Life Guards On his being proposed to go into the room Thistlewood turned to me and said Adams won t you go in Seeing no chance of escape and knowing my life was in danger I agreed to it Q Did Thistlewood propose any thing else to be done - A After the assassination at Lord Harrowby s house they were to leave as quick as possible and Harrison was to go to King-street barracks where the horse soldiers are and to take one of the fire-balls to fling into the straw-shed to set fire to the premises - he was to be supported by Wilson The rest of the party were to proceed from Grosvenor-square to the City Light Horse barracks Gray s Inn-lane for the purpose of meeting a party of men who had been appointed there and if they found themselves not sufficient to take the two pieces of cannon they were to wait their arrival to assist them They were to proceed from there to the Artillery Ground where Cook was appointed in order to lend him a hand if he was not sufficiently strong Q To what place were they to go then - A Cook was to wait there for the arrival of Thistlewood and to bring the cannon loaded into the street to fire on the people if they attempted to hinder them but if he found himself strong enough to proceed he was to go to the Mansion House and divide the six cannon into two divisions to take three on the Bank side of the Mansion House and three on the Poultry side then he was to demand the Mansion House - on a refusal he was to fire at both sides and it was thought that in doing that they would soon give it up Q Did he say what use was to be made of the Mansion House - A It was for the Provisional Government to sit in The Bank was the next place to be attacked and to plunder it of all that could be found but not to destroy the books if it could be prevented for by preserving them it would enable them to see the villainy that had for years been practised The further proceedings were to be left till Wednesday It was particularly mentioned that Palin s plan should be proceeded in but they came to no decisive time that was to be discussed on Wednesday Q Was any watch set at Lord Harrowby s house that night - A I wish to state that after the chair was left there was a bustle about the room Harrison proposed there should be a countersign and those that were to go round to the men should communicate the countersign to them - the first man that came up was to say BUT and the man in waiting to receive him was to say TON making the word button which was a token that the man was one of the party The man was to stand at the end of Oxford-road to communicate to any one that came up to him in this way the place of meeting which was settled Q In the course of the evening did you go on the watch at Lord Harrowby s - A I did I wish to state that in the afternoon after I had left in the morning I went to the room again and perceived a strange smell in the house I found Edwards Ings and Hall there - Edwards was making fusees to put to the hand-grenades Ings was dipping some rope-yarn into stuff in a pot to make the illumination or fire balls Hall was laying sheets of brown paper on the floor to wrap them up in after they came from the pot I left in a few minutes called again in the evening and found two strange men in the room - I afterwards found one of them to be Harriss Brunt and Thistlewood were there also - nothing particular transpired Davidson was on watch at six o clock About half-past eight Tidd came into the room saying he was disappointed in a man he was to have met and on this Tidd and Brunt being appointed to go on watch at nine o clock they started and in less than five minutes Brunt returned they had called at a public-house and said Tidd could not go for he had met a man he expected would be of great service to them I went with him and just as I was going out in came Edwards from the watch I asked him if any thing had been seen there he said Whatever has been seen I shall communicate to Mr Thistlewood I thought that was a hint for me and I went on the watch Q When you got to the square who did you find on the watch - A I found Davidson and another man who he was I cannot say Before I went to the square I intimated to Brunt that I was faint went to a public-house and got some bread and cheese and porter directly at the back of Lord Harrowby s at the corner of the mews - a young man sat there Brunt played at dominos with him We kept walking in the square till eleven o clock I got ashamed of it and walked at the back of the square I met him again at twelve o clock he and I then went away home Q Next day did you go to Fox-court - A Between two and three o clock in the afternoon - I found nobody there but Brunt in his own room Strange came in alone two more came in in five minutes I turned my head and saw them Brunt in consequence of this proposed to go to the back room where we usually met Q Before that was any thing done with the pistols - A We handled them and Strange and another person tried the flints They unlocked the door and we went into the back room On entering the room I saw a blunderbuss a number of cutlasses several pistols besides and the pistols that were in Brunt s room were brought into this room they placed themselves down and the two strangers in particular put the flints into the pistols We had not been long in the room before Thistlewood came - Ings and Hall entered afterwards On Thistlewood s coming in he looked round and said Well my lads this looks something like as if something was going to be done He clapped his hand on my shoulder and said Well Mr Adams how do you do I said I am very unwell and low in spirits I have had nothing to drink to-day He said You shall not be without any thing long Brunt sent for some gin and beer which was fetched Before the beer came Thistlewood said he wanted some paper the size of a newspaper in order to write some bills on and asked who would fetch it Brunt said either his boy or apprentice should He put his hand into his pocket and gave Brunt a shilling to fetch six sheets of cartridge-paper which was brought and a table and chair fetched out of Brunt s room for Thistlewood to sit on and the table to write on He sat down and wrote three bills to stick against the different buildings which were to be set on fire to acquaint the public what deeds had been done He wrote and read the bills to the best of my recollection these were the words - Your tyrants are destroyed the friends of liberty are called upon to come forward The Provisional Government are sitting James Ings Secretary February 23 1820 He wrote three of them In writing the last I perceived Thistlewood to be extremely agitated he could not write he expressed himself very tired and did not know what was the matter with him but he could write no more Q Was any thing else written - A Three other bills were proposed to be written - one was drawn up in part it was to make an offer to the soldiers In consequence of Thistlewood s hand trembling he proposed that Hall should take the pen he refused Another man whom I never saw before was proposed he objected but afterwards sat down and took the pen - Thistlewood dictated to him what to write The last time I saw the papers was one in the hands of Thistlewood doubled up and another in the hands of Ings I do not know what became of them Q Was that paper completed - A It was not for the man who was writing it and Thistlewood together could not come to any particular terms respecting the wording of it and it was dropped Thistlewood expressed great dissatisfaction saying he spoke to a man a fortnight ago to draw them out and he had not seen him since While the bills were writing Ings was preparing himself in the manner in which he was to enter the Earl of Harrowby s house he put a black belt round his waist and another over his shoulder he also put on two bags like soldiers havesacks and then pistols in his belt He afterwards looked at himself and said D - n my eyes I am not complete for I have forgot my steel He took out a large knife brandished it about and swore he would bring away the heads of Lord Castlereagh and Sidmouth in his bags and the hand of Lord Castlereagh he would cure preserve as it would be thought a good deal of hereafter The knife was about twelve inches long with a rough handle round which there was wax-end which he said was to prevent its slipping when he was using it Q What were the rest doing - A They were equally busy in equipping themselves - Palin came in about half-past five o clock Thistlewood and Brunt left the room Palin addressed those who were present and said Gentlemen I hope you are all aware of what you are going to do you ought first to think within yourselves whether you are going to do your country a service or not you ought to think whether the assassination of the ministers will be countenanced by your country if you think the country will approve of it you ought to make a resolution that the man who flinches should be run through on the spot unless you come to this determination it will be of no good A tall man in the room said You speak as if we all knew what we were going about I should like to know what you are going after - I had not seen this man before He said to Palin I can pretty well see the meaning of what you say I am not afraid for myself nor ought any man to be afraid who once enters into a concern like this Q How long was it before Brunt and Thistlewood returned to the room - A I do not recollect seeing Thistlewood after that When Brunt came into the room he perceiving an alteration as he thought in the countenance of the meeting he enquired the reason and was told by that tall man some in the room wished to know further of the plan they were going upon Brunt said that was not the room for them to be told what they were going about but they were to go with him to the room in the Edgware-road and they should be told he directly began to wish to put them into movement to go and said he would take good care that all who went with him should have something to drink to put them in spirits the tall man said I hope you are not going to encourage drunkenness for that is of no service to a man in a thing like this for the only service in it is to run himself into the hands of his enemies Brunt was on the move I went out of the room first Strange this tall man and other strangers whose names I do not know were to follow it was agreed they were to walk two and two in the street and not close to each other to prevent suspicion I started and in going up Holborn I had a tap on my left side and was called by name - it was a man who had been at the meeting I cannot swear to him Q You are now got out of the room I want to ask you was there any cupboard in the room - A Yes different things were kept in it that were brought to the room such as swords hand-grenades and flannel bags which were made for the sole purpose for the cartridges for the cannon I only saw one filled Q You told us there were some poles and ferrels fixed to them where was that done - A In the back room Q Were all the arms and ammunition kept in that room - A No the depot was at Tidd s who lived in the next room to myself in the Hole in the Wall-passage I found out that was the depot and Thistlewood was always in a hurry when any thing was ready for it to be taken away to the depot in case anybody such as officers should come up and if they saw these things they might suspect something was in hand more than they were aware of Q Had you any arms when you went out - A I had a brass-barrelled blunderbuss being tall and having a great coat it was given to me to sling over my shoulder under my coat so that it should not be seen Brunt had a broom-stick which was given to me for a walking-stick - it was for a bayonet Q Were there any pikes for the staves - A Yes The generality of them appeared to be made from old files and old bayonets Q Did Brunt go with you all the way or did he leave you - A When this man came he told me to slacken my pace for Brunt had gone back for something I went on to the top of Oxford-road crossed the road under the dead wall and turned to see who was behind me I found none of the persons who accompanied me were in sight I turned back walked to the end of Park-lane and met Brunt afterwards somewhere below the end of Park-lane He said Halloo Where are you going I said I was going home and did not know where to go for I had been walking about until I was tired - another man was with him I at last turned back with him along the Edgware-road and met the prisoner Thistlewood We all four went on to a stable in Cato-street Q Who did you see at the stable-door or near it - A As I went under the archway I was behind them and saw Brunt enter Thistlewood followed and this other man I staid behind Harrison came up and said Come go in which I did and in the ground floor I saw Davidson sitting down and Wilson standing up - they appeared to me to be doing something to the pikes I went up the ladder and found Thistlewood Brunt Ings Hall Bradburn Strange Cooper this tall man I alluded to and several others whom I did not know by name At the conclusion of it there were eighteen in the room and two down stairs Q Did you see a carpenter s bench in the loft - A Yes and on it were arms of different descriptions - one candle was alight There was a chest at the end of the bench under the window Q When you first went in what were they doing - A Preparing different arms there was some beer standing on the bench I did not see Tidd in the room until twenty minutes before the officers came up Q Before Tidd came what passed between Thistlewood and Brunt - A Thistlewood proposed going to the square to see if the ministers had arrived to dine at Lord Harrowby s He was gone sometime and on his returning as I sat in the loft I heard a great deal of talking down stairs I went down and found Thistlewood Brunt Davidson Harrison and Wilson talking very closely together As soon as they perceived me they turned sharp on their heels and said what good news they had got I said What good news Thistlewood said We have just got news from the square that the carriage are arriving as quick as possible there are no less than six or seven carriages there already Brunt said D - n my eyes what a hawl we shall have to night We went up stairs by Thistlewood s desire I then saw Thistlewood and Brunt together very much agitated talking about Tidd On Thistlewood turning away it was seen there was something the matter Ings said D - n my eyes don t think of dropping it now or I shall hang myself - I shall be mad It was said round the room that Tidd would not come but he did come very soon after Q Without going through all this was any thing said by Thistlewood to move them aside to see what should be done - A Thistlewood said he hoped they would not give up what they had met there for for if they did it would turn out another Despard job On this he began to count the number of men in the room he said There are eighteen here and two down stairs - you think there are not men enough to go but I think there are plenty He proposed that fourteen would be sufficient to go into the room and the other six would be sufficient to take care of the servants of the house The fourteen men were set apart on one side of the room for the purpose of going into the room Brunt produced a gin-bottle from his pocket and passed it to them Now said Thistlewood I conceive this number of men is quite sufficient Suppose Lord Harrowby should have sixteen servants in the house they are not prepared and we are we can enter the house and do what we propose in about ten minutestime I do not recollect any thing particular dropping from Thistlewood afterwards Q Did you hear any disturbance below - A Almost directly after we heard a pistol fired below and all of a sudden there was a call at the bottom of the ladder Halloo shew a light Upon this Thistlewood took the candle off the bench and held it down to see who it was then sat the candle on the bench quite confused At this instant the officers ascended the ladder and took command of the room at the head of the ladder Q What do you mean by taking command of the room - A Got into the room Two stood at the top of the ladder with small pistols in their hands and presented them saying Halloo here is a pretty nest of you Gentlemen we have a warrant to apprehend you all and as such we hope you will go peaceably At this instant of time one of the officers that was behind on the ladder said Let me come forward This was the man that was murdered The two officers at the head of the ladder opened to make way for him and at this instant a group of those who had got into the little room before the officers came came forward among the group I saw an arm rush forward and at the same time I saw another arm with a pistol which was fired the man fell and out went the candle I cannot give an account of what passed afterwards Q Did you get away - A I did After the officers left the room I went down the ladder through the stable and into the street gave the alarm of murder and went away straight home Q How soon after was you apprehended - A On the Friday at my own lodgings and have been in custody ever since Q Look at the prisoners and tell us their names - A There is Thistlewood Davidson Wilson Brunt Ings Cooper Harrison and Tidd I know the others by sight but not by name Cross-examined by MR CURWOOD Q You went with the full determination of assassinating his Majesty s ministers - A Not with the full intent Q What carried you there - A My legs Q What intention carried you there - A Why I certainly cannot tell but that I went there with that pretension to outward appearance Q What was your inward intent - A Entirely against the plan that was proposed Q You attended many meetings where the plan was debated - A Yes and one morning I was chairman Q How came you to join them again if your intention was against it - A There had been threatening language held out by Brunt that if any man withdrew himself he should be marked out - fear kept me to them Q Had you quitted the army for some time - A Yes Since that I have been principally in trade as a shoemaker I went to France to follow my trade - I had no other particular motive for leaving England Q Were you ever trustee to a benefit fund - A No I carried between 30 l and 40 l to France I conceived it to be all my own Q Some persons conceived it to belong to other people - A I do not know I was never charged with carrying money away that did not belong to me Q For what purpose did Brunt introduce you to Thistlewood - A For the purpose of assassinating the ministers - this was proposed to me by him before I saw Thistlewood and I agreed to be introduced to Thistlewood for that purpose Q And joined a variety of meetings for that purpose till you were apprehended - A Yes I was selected for my adroitness at the sword I and Harrison were to go into the room with swords The first account I gave of this was on the Saturday after I was taken I did not give it under the idea that I was to become an evidence Q What it was from the freedom of your own breast and not out of any regard for your own neck - A My conscience accused me of acting wrong I laid it to heart and made a solemn vow that if God would spare me I would disclose all Q You had rather thirteen men should be hung on your evidence than that you should be hung yourself You had none of those feelings till after you was in custody - A Yes I had prior to that - I had them before I entered the room on that day but after the man was murdered they were worse I was much shocked at it and went down stairs with the sole intention of surrendering myself to the officers but finding no officers I went home and did not get out of the way Q Did you think of surrendering yourself the next day - A I did not think of surrendering myself or of getting out of the way I agreed to wait the event Q How many were the most that you think were that night assembled - A On the 20th of February in the morning there were about fifteen - they were all poor men Q Was not the money for the newspaper rose by a subscription of a halfpenny each round the room - A No Thistlewood produced it from his pocket Q What was the largest sum of money you ever saw - A I saw Brunt produce 15 s Q It was proposed not only to murder the ministers but to take the two guns in Gray s Inn-lane and six in the Artillery Ground and to seize the Mansion House where were the forces to come from - A That I cannot tell The depot of arms was at Tidd s kept in a box under his window I do not know where the grenades or the pike-staves were put I saw no cannon-ball Q What was to be done with the cannon - A They intended to put a cartridge into the cannon and to take a sledge-hammer with them and knock off the top iron railings of the areas as they would act better than balls - this was the proposition of Thistlewood I do not know where the men were to come from Q When did you last see Edwards - A I have not seen him since the 22d He was as active as the rest and seemed to be more close in communication with Thistlewood and Brunt - he communicated the news of the cabinet dinner The New Times was fetched Q You have given a confused description of what happened in the loft The unfortunate man that was killed was the man who said Make way let me come forward - A Yes I saw an arm but no sword in it I was at the end of the room near the bench Q Was not your own arm within sufficient reach to have done that mischief yourself - I do not ask you if you did do it - A I might have done it with a pistol but not with a sword I was not near enough to do it with a sword I have no recollection whether the candle was blown out or whether it went out by the report of the pistol - it was out instantly MR ATTORNEY GENERAL When you was at Cambray were you carrying on trade among the English

prisoner in the Tower I remember meeting Thistlewood at a person s of the name of Ford About two months before the 23d he called on me at my lodgings Brunt was with him After he had been there five minutes he said he wished to speak with me and I went out of the room with him My mother and brother were in the room Q Did you in consequence of that go out of the room with him - A Yes I did Brunt staid behind Thistlewood said Great events are at hand the people are every where anxious for a change He said he had been promised support by a great many who had deceived him but now he had got men who would stand by him He then asked me if I had any arms I said No I had not - he said that every man ought to be armed He said some had got a pistol and others a pike or sword Q Who did he mean - A Those that would stand by him He said I might buy a pistol for 4 s or 5 s I said I had no money to buy pistols with he said he would see what could be done That was all that passed at that time Brunt called about two or three days afterwards but nothing particular passed he said he had several others in our trade to call upon I remember Brunt calling on me on the 22d of February - I believe that was the next time it was on that day he was accompanied by Tidd Q What was said between you and Tidd - A I said I thought I had lost him and asked him the reason why he staid away so long he said the death of the King had made an alteration in their plans I asked him what plans he said you will know at the meeting that is to take place I asked him where this meeting was to be held he said at Tyburn turnpike I asked him if I saw any person there how I was to know them he turned round to Tidd and asked him if he should tell me the word he said Yes he supposed there was no danger upon this Brunt said if any persons were about I was to say B U T and if friends they would answer T O N He said he should call on the following morning and tell me more particulars then Brunt called next day between four and five o clock he called me down stairs and asked me if I was ready to go with him I said I had some work that must be done - my brother was then in the room When I told him I could not go till the work done he asked me when that would be I said six o clock He said he could not wait for me but I must go to Tidd s he told me he lived in Hole in the Wall passage he told me no more but not to be later than six o clock for Tidd had more men to take with him I went to Tidd s house about half-past six he was at home Tidd said that several of the men that had promised to come were not as good as their word and he should not wait longer than seven o clock We waited till seven and no other persons having arrived he went to the corner of the room to a trunk took out a pistol and put it into a belt that was round his body also six or seven pike heads in a brown paper and a staff about four feet long with a hole in it fit to receive any thing - the pistol was under the great coat he had on I went down stairs with him through Brook-street Holborn and Oxford-street I asked him where we were to go to he said to a mews in John-street Edgware-road When we got into Holborn he gave me the pike-staff and told me to take it I asked him what it was for He said I should know all about it when I got there I asked him if we were going to the House of Commons he said No there were too many soldiers near there I then asked him where we were going to he said Grosvenor-square I asked him if there were any particular persons living there he said there was to be a cabinet dinner there that evening - we then went up Oxford-street Edgware-road to Cato-street When we got to the gateway leading to Cato-street we met two men whom Tidd seemed to know and after a few moments we went into the stable We went up stairs - there were in the stable and loft about twenty-four or twenty-five persons it was proposed to count them but Thistlewood said it was not necessary for there were twenty-five While I was there a man was sitting on the bench with two pistols in his belt - he was a tall thin man with a brown great coat He spoke of the impropriety of going to Lord Harrowby s with so few men but Mr Thistlewood said there were quite enough for he only wanted fourteen men to go into the house and even if there were sixteen servants that would be enough The man in the great coat said when the thing was done there would be a crowd collected and how were they to escape Davidson told this man it was not right to throw cold water on it for if he did not like it he might go and they could do without him Brunt said that sooner than give up the business he would go into the room and blow them up if he perished with them for we knew they had the thing that would do it The man said although all things were not right he would not be against it as they were all for it he then proposed that they should put themselves under the order of Mr Thistlewood to which Thistlewood said that every one should have the same honour as himself he then proposed that fourteen men should volunteer to go into the room Twelve or thirteen of them in the room did volunteer and arranged themselves in a few minutes on the side of the small room - there was nothing said about the rest Tidd spoke to me about choosing my place but Thistlewood said putting him back You all know your places After Thistlewood had gone out for a few minutes he returned and said they had received information that Lords Sidmouth and Wellington had arrived I do not recollectany thing else passing till the officers came up I was taken into custody in the room Cross-examined by MR ADOLPHUS Q You never spoke to Thistlewood before the time I saw him at Ford s - A No I attended the Finsbury meeting Q Do you know when the meeting in Finsbury Market-place was held - A I think it was before Christmas Q Was the meeting about the Manchester business - A I do not know I had no particular acquaintance with Thistlewood I never saw Brunt before Thistlewood brought him to me - I do not know Edwards There was a great while passed between the times of my seeing Brunt - I thought I had lost him I was to say on meeting the man BUT and he would answer TON There were twenty-five in the room where we were - the ceiling was as high as I can reach there was a carpenter s bench in the room - no one could stand on the bench The man in the brown great coat was not Adams - I saw him at Hicks s Hall - I did not go much about the room I stood near the bench most all the time I do not know whether there was any other tall man they were eating bread and cheese and drinking porter - I cannot remember whether Adams was there I am not sure that he was not there - I have not the least recollection of seeing him I saw the prisoners Davidson Thistlewood Tidd and Brunt I saw Strange as I was standing by the side of him I have told all I cannot tell any thing about Adams If any person had spoke like the man in the brown coat I should have heard him the room would not hold twenty more but it would ten - I should have heard if any body had spoken I had quite lost Tidd until the 22d The conversation between Thistlewood and the man in the brown coat was loud enough to be heard Q You are honourably attended I see - A Yes I was taken on the spot I made no resistance nor had I any arms Re-examined by MR GURNEY I was one of the last that went into the room about half an hour before the officers came I know no more of the prisoners except as before stated - it was candlelight Q What was there on the bench you have been speaking of - A A great many pistols and blunder busses Strange was taken into custody with one - there were four in the room When I was going to be examined before the Privy Council I was hand-cuffed to Thistlewood he told me that when I was examined by the Privy Council to say that it was Edwards who took me to the meeting I asked him how I could tell such a falsehood when I had never seen the man He laughed and said that was of no consequence I was to say that he was not much taller than myself that he had a sallow complexion and dressed in a brown great coat JURY Q Have you since your apprehension had any conversation with a man of the name of Adams - A No nothing relating to this business I have never seen him only when he has been up as a witness THOMAS MONUMENT I am brother to the last witness I remember Thistlewood calling on my brother I know Brunt - Thistlewood brought him with him they did not stay above five or ten minutes - there was some conversation Thistlewood asked if he might be permitted to speak to him and they went out of the room together they did not remain out of the room more than two or three minutes then returned and Thistlewood and Brunt went out together On the Tuesday before the Cato-street business he called on my brother with a man of the name of Tidd When they came into the room my brother said Brunt I thought I had lost you I have not seen you for some time Brunt said that was in consequence of the death of the King and they had made some alterations in their plans My brother asked them what those plans were he said they had different objects in view Brunt asked my brother to meet him at Tyburn turnpike next evening which he agreed to Brunt said to Tidd Suppose we give him an outline of the plan then said if he would come to Tyburn turnpike they would tell him and if any of their party was there he was to say B U T and if they were friends they would answer T O N They did not press me to go it was to my brother he spoke - I did not go My brother went out about seven o clock Brunt called about five o clock but he was busy and could not go He told him to call upon Tidd who lived in Hole in the Wall-passage About seven o clock my brother went but I did not Cross-examined by MR CURWOOD Q You was in the room when the conversation passed - A Yes I never saw Brunt before that evening - I know nothing of any of them I had no idea what the meeting was for nor did I ever ask THOMAS DWYER I live in Gee s-court Oxford-street In the month of February I became acquainted with Davidson I saw him twice before the 23d - he introduced me to Thistlewood We went to a house in Molineux-street at this end of Cato-street It was Wednesday Thursday or Friday about the 9th 10th or 11th Thistlewood said he had been in five or six revolutions He said that Ireland was in a disturbed sate and that he had a great many of my countrymen to join him I saw Davidson in the afternoon of the 22d of February - he said he was going on centry - he did not make any appointment with me for the 23d A person called on me and we went to Fox-court Gray s Inn-lane it was Harrison - he had a bundle wrapped up in paper We went to the two pair back room the room door was locked then I believe He knocked at the front door and a woman gave him the key - there was an old chair in the room I afterwards saw a ball wrapped up in rope-yarn Harrison told me it was a hand-grenade but did not tell me what was to be done with it Thistlewood Davidson and a few other persons came in Davidson had a blunderbuss a pair of pistols and a bayonet in his side pocket - other persons came in whose names I do not know After Davidson had shewn the pistols he said he had given 12 s for them Brunt said he would go out and by a pair Thistlewood said that some of the hand-grenades were to be thrown into the horse barracks and some into Lord Harrowby s house to set it on fire and blow them up Thistlewood asked me how many of my countrymen I could muster and said he should want them at half-past eight o clock that evening I told him twenty-six or twenty-seven He told me I was to muster at the Pomfret Castle public-house in Wigmore-street that is a house a great deal frequented by Irishmen He told me I was to take some of the best of them to the Foundling Hospital knock at the porter s lodge put a pistol to his head and at the other lodge we should findtwenty-five or twenty-six stand of arms at the same time another party would seize the cannon at the riding school of the London Light Horse Gray s

cupboard - A Yes it contained gunpowder it was measured into bags there were several of them - Harrison did it I heard Thistlewood speaking generally to them all he said that twelve pike heads were to be taken to Marylebone some to Finsbury and some elsewhere I was asked to take some which I refused - they were not in the room I saw the powder and grenades put into the bags and taken to the Horse and Groom Cato-street by Harrison the grenades and powder was put into a sack Q About what time did you leave the room - A I got to my place about twelve o clock I told a gentleman of the name of Major James what I had heard and in consequence of what he said I went to the Secretary of State about half-past two o clock Cross-examined by MR CURWOOD Q What are you - A A bricklayer That was the first time I saw Davidson it was about the 9th I never knew any of the party before Q They never knew you yet they let you into the secret - A Yes Q And that at an accidental meeting - A Yes I do not

of February I saw Harrison - I knew him before - I saw him standing against the stable door in Cato-street with a candlestick in his hand I asked him how he did - he said very well he said he had taken two chambers there and was going to clean them up - this was about five o clock in the evening I saw from 20 to 25 persons go in and out between five and seven o clock RICHARD MUNDAY I live at No 3 Cato-street I remember in the afternoon of the 23d of February about twenty minutes past four o clock seeing Davidson walking in the archway - I knew him having seen him at Firth s I saw Harrison about six o clock open the cow-house door and shut it again in coming home again from the chandler s shop about five I saw Davidson again in the archway - he went to get a light from a woman - he had another in his hand On his opening the door I saw a bundle which I thought was a quartern loaf two pistols in his belt and a sword Harrison opened the door and let him in There were several persons going in and out - and when the door was half open I saw seven or eight It formerly belonged to General Watson Mr Firth turned it into a cowhouse and kept five cows in it there is a loft above - one of the rooms is a small dark bed-room with a fire-place near the window The place was cleaned out about five or six weeks ago There was a kind of hempen sack at the window and over the door likewise I saw it up at the window at three o clock ELIZA WESTON I live at No 1 Cato-street On the 23d of February as I was standing at my door I saw a man with a bag in his left hand and a key in his right - he unlocked the stable-door About six o clock I had occasion to go out on an errand I passed the stable and saw a man of colour standing at the door I returned in about ten minutes and saw him standing at the same place at which I was frightened as the stables had been shut so long After I had been in a short time there was a knock at the door which I opened and the same man asked me to give him a light which I did - he had two candles one of which he lit and went into the stable G T J RUTHVEN I am a constable of Bow-street I went in consequence of information to Cato-street - three or four others I knew would meet me there When I arrived I found our party amounted to about twelve I went into a stable and saw a man with a blunderbuss and a sword this was about half-past eight o clock - I am not certain that I saw more than one - the whole party followed me into the stable When I saw the man with the blunderbuss I told some of the party to secure him I then went up a ladder nothing was said by the man for it was not a minute before I was up the ladder I saw in the loft several men and heard the clattering of arms pistols and swords three or four were with me Ellis and Smithers were there but I am not certain who else were with me I thought from the slight view I had of the parties there were about twenty-four or twenty-five The room is fifteen feet five inches by ten feet ten There are two rooms which communicate with each other by a door On going into the room I said We are officers seize their arms I saw Thistlewood in the room I have known him four or five years he was standing on the right-hand side of the table near the little room He looked up took up a sword and then retreated towards the little room - the sword was drawn at the time he seized it it was a very long one and bright He retreated into the little room and stood fencing to prevent any person from coming to him Smithers approached him he trust his hand forward and stabbed him - Smithers fell and in falling cried out Oh my God The lights were put out and some person near the spot where Thistlewood was standing said Kill the b - rs throw them down stairs There were about eight lights When we were in the dark I heard a rush towards the ladder and a cry of Kill them I then went into John-street and met the soldiers There were about twenty shots fired some of which were from the window On my return I saw Tidd lift up his hand as if to fire I seized his right hand we fell and the pistol went off the soldiers then came up and I secured him I searched him and found a buff leather belt I also found two ball cartridges in his pocket - this was at the Horse and Groom I also searched Brunt and round his waist I found a string which went several times round to answer the purpose of a belt He had six ball cartridges and three loose balls on him Davidson and Wilson were then brought - I did not search them Davidson said D - n the man that would not die in liborty s cause and sang part of Scots wha hae wi Wallace bled When I went again to the loft I found it in possession of the soldiers and some of the officers I there found Strange Cooper Monument and Gilchrist on my going into the room - I told the officers to search the rooms and each take care of what he found I found two swords ten hand grenades of one size and two parcels of tow as it appeared to me one of them was nearly as large as my hat - they were taken to Bow-street and are now in the possession of an officer I have seen them at Bow-street they are the same Before I went to the stable I went into the Horse and Groom public-house I saw three or four persons come in Cooper was one and Gilchrist another Cooper brought a stick with him it was a mop-stick or a broomstick it was left in the room Gilchrist came again after it but it had been removed by the boy belonging to the house - it was cut as if to receive a socket Next day I had a dirk stick brought to me Cross-examined by MR ADOLPHUS Q How long have you known Thistlewood - A Ever since the trial in 1817 I do not know how long he has been out of Horsham gaol Within the three weeks previous to the 23d I saw him five or six times We have four or five persons of the name of Edwards in our office I have been employed to look after Thistlewood I do not know any other Edwards JOHN ELLIS I am one of the conductors of the patrol at Bow-street On the 23d of February I went with the other officers to Cato-street I go to the stable about half-past eight o clock as near as I can guess and on going into the stable I observed two men - the first man nearest to me had a white belt over each shoulder they were cross-belts and on his right side he had either a carbine or short shoulder-piece and in his left hand or by his left side a large sword On coming close to him I took him by the collar and turned him half round - I observed he was a man of colour The other person was between the foot of the ladder and the manger in the stall nearest to the ladder I followed Ruthven up the ladder as close as I could walk When we were going up the ladder I think it was before I gained the first step of the ladder I heard the black man give notice to those above the last word he said was men - I did not distinctly hear the other words On my going to the top of the ladder I observed a number of men falling back from the carpenter s bench close against the wall As I entered the loft I heard a noise of swords clashing like two people fencing - there might be from twenty to twenty-five men in the room as far as I can guess On gaining the top of the ladder there were three or four men attempting to gain the little room the farthest from the ladder which looked into the street The moment I gained the top of the ladder Ruthven called out We are officers surrender your arms or seize their arms I cannot recollect which Q Did you observe Smithers doing any thing - A Not immediately Previous to that Thistlewood whom I now know and am perfectly satisfied he is the man he held his sword in a threatening attitude I held out my staff at him I was about five feet from him - he still menaced me with his sword I held up my pistol in my right hand and desired him to desist or I would fire At that moment Smithers had gained the top of the ladder and rushed forward towards the little room - Thistlewood and the other men who were in the room got backwards some feet into the middle of the room and on Smithers going to the door Thistlewood rushed forward and stuck him with the sword near his right breast on that I saw Smithers arms extended he said Oh my God and staggered against me on seeing that I immediately fired my pistol towards Thistlewood but without effect At the moment I fired Smithers staggered against me and fell dead The last light I saw was the flash of my own pistol - the candles were put out At that moment I was forced down the ladder by the rush that was made I went to the doorway in Cato-street several shots were fired from some part of the stable at that time one or two men passed me at the door I saw one shot fired by a tall man who stood under the ladder Q Were any shots fired out of the little room - A Yes some were fired out of the window of the little room they were apparently fired towards the door of the stable Q Did you pursue a man down Cato-street - A I heard a cry of Stop him and saw a man running with his belts on towards Queen-street I pursued and took him about seventy or eighty yards from the stable it was Davidson the man of colour he had a carbine in his right hand and in his left hand was a long sword - I believe him to be the man I first saw in the stable I assisted in securing four others in the loft I am not certain who they were - I recollect Monument to be one Cross-examined by MR CURWOOD Q What situation do you hold - A I am conductor of the patrol Ruthven was the principal officer - I had the warrant WILLIAM WESTCOAT I am one of the conductors of the patrol at Bow-street I went with the other officers to Cato-street Edgware-road on the 23d of February COURT Q Are you a constable also - A Yes my Lord we are all sworn in as constables at Bow-street I am sworn in and so were Ruthven Smithers and Nixon MR GURNEY Q Did Ruthven Ellis and Smithers go first up to the loft - A I heard fireing in the loft I remained in the stable the whole of the time and observed Ings in the stable Q What did Ings do or attempt to do - A He attempted to run out but I collared him and he and I had a contest against the wall There was terrible confusion in the loft and a great bustle - some came tumbling down the ladder and some came singly Q Did you observe any of those whose faces you knew - A I did it was Thistlewood - there was a light in the stable at the time He came down and turned round presented a pistol at my head and fired at me - the pistol was fired a few yards from me the ball went through my hat - there are three holes in it I afterwards made a rush towards him and received a blow on the right side of my head I do not know whether the blow was given with a weapon or a fist I fell down and Thistlewood made a cut at me with something like a sword and went out of the stable-door I attempted to follow him he got out of my sight directly and I was wounded by a ball in my wrist LUKE NIXON I am one of the Bow-street officers I went to Cato-street on the 23d of February when I first got to the stable I saw a light at the top of the door by the ladder Ruthven Ellis Smithers and Gibbs went up I followed them - by the time I got up the lights wereall out I remained for half a minute and saw Ellis fire a pistol into the little room I thought it was them fireing at him Another pistol or two were fired from the little room then there was a rush and I fell backward and hit my leg against something I cut it hit my head and fell down to the bottom of the stairs There came a rush of persons down one of whom I saw present a pistol I really believe it was Thistlewood He presented it against Westcoat but having only a side view of him I could not distinctly see Q At that time had Westcoat apprehended anybody - A He had Ings in custody but he got away from him afterwards and I pursued him He was brought back again and taken by Wright I believe Q Some time after did you go to the stable - A Yes and found a sword there went up again to the loft and found a bayonet I saw Ruthven find a bag which on being opened contained a quantity of ball As I was going down stairs with the combustibles I found a tin can wrapped round with paper I found about 7 lbs or 8 lbs of powder in it and gave it to Ruthven JOHN WRIGHT I am a patrol of Bow-street and was one of the party of officers that went to Cato-street I went to the Horse and Groom public-house with Ruthven Cooper and another came in and had a pint of porter Cooper brought a stick and left it behind him - it was like a broom-stick I afterwards saw it in the custody of Ruthven Q Did you afterwards accompany the party to the stable - A Yes and after we had got three or four steps up the ladder we were driven back again I turned round and observed a stoutish man in the further stall - he had a great coat on I observed something shining under his coat took it from him and found it was a sword I also took a butcher s knife from his side - the handle was tied round with wax-end Q Did you take that man into custody or did he escape - A I was knocked down and he escaped The moment I was knocked down I received a stab in my side I got up and went out Shortly after the soldiers came down and stopped me but I told them I was an officer Captain Fitzclarence went into the stable and Wilson and Bradburn were brought out I searched Wilson and found some ball cartridges in his pocket and a haversack suspended across his shoulder and hung on his right side there were about two dozen ball cartridges in it a pair of scissors and a gun-flint or two WILLIAM CHARLES BROOKS I am one of the Bow-street patrols On Wednesday evening the 23d of February I had just turned into the corner of John-street Edgware-road and asked a coachman some questions respecting some men when Mr Birnie came up to me and said Run Brooks and pointed over the way I saw Ings and another man before him with a cutlass but I could not then distinguish whether the man with the cutlass was one of our party or not I saw Ings with a pistol in his hand he presented it at the other man then turned round presented it at me and said I will shoot you fired and the shot passed through my great coat close coat and waistcoat grazed my shoulder and I believe went out at the back of my neck Q After he fired what did he do - A I staggered into the road and he also came into the road to avoid the other man as I suppose and went into Edgware-road - John-street leads into Edgware-road I pursued him and just as he turned the corner he flung the pistol from him I called out to stop him and he was stopped by Moye the watchman I saw him lay hold of him about a second before I did I said to him You rascal why did you fire at me a man you never saw before He swore at me and said To kill you and I wish I had done it for I know I shall be hung for what I have done COURT Q Are you quite sure those were his expressions - A Yes Prisoner INGS It is false COURT You are not now upon trial WILLIAM CHARLES BROOKS in continuation We took him down to Marylebone watch-house I said If you offer to put your hand into one of your pockets I will knock you down He said Well I might as well knock his brains out then as bye-and-bye I searched him at the watch-house and found two haversacks one over each shoulder under his great coat and slung under his arms I found a belt buttoned round him apparently to hold two brace of pistols on each side I pulled a tin can from his right-hand coat pocket about three parts full of powder I saw Champion pull three slugs from his pocket and a knife-case was found on him about a foot long He was confined and I returned to the stable GILES FRANKLIN MOVE I am a watchman On Wednesday the 23d of February I was on my beat in the Edgware-road and heard a discharge of fire-arms I immediately went down the road and as soon as I got to the end of John-street I saw a man come out of that street and fire either a carbine or pistol I saw Brooks the last witness stagger another man called out Stop thief and I stopped him He caught my stick in his hand I took him into custody and kept him till Brooks came up - he was searched I found some powder in a tin can on him two bags under his coat and a knife-case also a belt on each side to hold pistols JOSEPH CHAMPION I am one of the Bow-steet officers I accompanied them to Cato-street on the 23d of February - Ings was the first man I saw in the stable - I did not know him before On the other officers going up the ladder Ings held up his head and said Look out above there as a signal he was standing with his back against the wall facing the ladder - he was afterwards apprehended I took out of his jacket pocket the case of a knife four pistol-balls and the key of a pistol at Marylebone watch-house Q After the officers were driven down the ladder did you see any persons escaping - A I saw nobody in the stable I saw Thistlewood in Cato-street with a sword in his hand which he moved twice or thrice across his body though no person was near him CAPTAIN FITZCLARENCE I am Lieutenant of the Coldstream Guards I recollect on Wednesday the 23d of February going with a piquet to John-street I was desired to attend by Mr Birnie I got there about eight o clock or a quarter past directly after I got there Iheard a pistol shot which appeared to come from Cato-street I brought the piquet forward to Cato-street Q There is an archway over the entrance to Cato-street - A Yes on my getting to the arch I met a police officer who hallooed out Soldiers soldiers to the doorway - the stable I went towards the stable and was met at the door by a man on my right and another on my left the man at the stable door cut at me with a sword and the man on the left presented something at me The man in the doorway seeing the piquet coming on ran into the stable - he was the man who cut at me - we exchanged several cuts before he went in the other man I could not see afterwards for the moment he presented the pistol the other man cut at me - there was a scuffle between him and Sergeant Legge I followed the man into the stable ran in and felt somebody inside the stable - it was dark he said Don t hurt me don t kill me and I will tell you all I gave him over to the piquet and ran again into the stable I do not know the man for it was dark I then ran into one of the stalls and secured another man - the soldiers took him away I called to the file of Guards to follow me up the ladder On going up stairs a light came from the bottom and up stairs I secured three four or five men - I rather think it was four I fell against the body of poor Smithers which laid at the top of the ladder I saw several arms in the loft SAMUEL HERCULES TAUNTON I am a Bow-street officer On the morning of the 24th of February I went to Brunt s lodgings with a warrant On going up stairs I went into the front room on the second floor - I searched three rooms but found nothing there material I

No 8 White-street Little Moorfields One Harris kept the house Q After searching different rooms did you receive a key - A I received a key from Mrs Harris of the room on the ground floor I opened the door and saw Thistlewood in bed - the shutters were shut but there were holes in the shutters to admit light enough for me to see he put his head up from under the clothes - I had a pistol in one hand and a staff in the other - I told him my name was Bishop from Bow-street I had a warrant against him and threw myself on the bed Thistlewood said I shall make no resistance I and my brother officer secured him he had his breeches and stockings on in bed - his coat and waistcoat laid on the side of the bed I searched his waistcoat-pocket and found three leaden balls two flints one ball cartridge and one dry cartridge also a small silk sash I saw Lavender take from his coat-pocket a black cloth belt with a place to put pistols and a sword in Cross-examined by MR CURWOOD Q Did a man named Edwards go with you - A No nobody but the patrol and officer went no person went to point out the house to us STEPHEN LAVENDER I produce the belt I found in Thistlewood s pocket GEORGE THOMAS JOSEPH

sharpened for Ings I am quite sure of it by the mark on the edge and also by the polishing of it EDWARD HARRISON I am a sergeant in the Royal Artillery I have examined one of the grenades produced at Bow-street it is a tin case about three inches long brazen on there is a tin tube with composition in it - the tin contained 3 1/2 oz of gunpowder Q What is the priming in the tube - A A composition of saltpetre gunpowder and brimstone the end of the tin is pitched Next to the tin is a body of oakum about an inch thick and cemented together with tar and rosin it is all wrapped round with rope-yarn tarred The first I opened had twelve pieces of iron planted round in different directions Q What time would it take from the lighting the fusee till the explosion took place - A About half a minute or scarcely so much Q If one was to explode in a room where there were a number of persons I suppose it would be very destructive - A It would the iron would fly about like so many bullets Q Look at the grenades found in Cato-street do they seem similar to the one you opened - A Yes - here the witness opened one Here are two old stockings wrapped round the tin and five cart-tire nails fastened tightly round it by the rope-yarn tarred the tightness of the rope-yarn increases the force of the explosion The tin contains very good gunpowder Q Now examine one of what are called fire balls - A It is oakum tar brimstone powder and rosin Q If one of them was lit and thrown into a house would it be likely to set it on fire - A If it fell on wood straw or hay it would be sure to set it on fire - it would burn three or four minutes MR ATTORNEY GENERAL My Lords here ends the case on the part of the Crown MR CURWOOD addressed the Jury on the part of the prisoners and called the following witnesses MARY PARKER I am daughter of the prisoner Richard Tidd and lived with him I remember the officers coming on the 24th of February at half-past eight o clock in the morning and finding some things Q How long had those things been in the house - A About a quarter of an hour they took a box away - I do not know what was in it Q Did they take any thing like those pike-handles - A Yes they were brought that morning I do not know by whom I know Adams and Edwards and have seen them often at my father s before he was apprehended Q Had you seen the things there before the day on which the officers came - A I had seen similar things before I should think they were the same Edwards took part of them away on the Wednesday Q Did he take away the box or the staves - A He did not take away any box - that was not taken Q What were taken - A Some things which I have since understood were grenades and powder The box was put there a day or two before my father was taken up and remained there but was never uncorded I do not know who brought it Q Were any of the grenades of different sizes - A Yes one was larger than the others Adams brought it EDWARD HUCKLESTONE Q Do you know a man named Dwyer - A Yes I have known him for years but within the last year I have used the same public-house as he did I do not think he is to be believed on his oath MR ATTORNEY GENERAL Q You have known him by meeting at a public-house - A Yes I have seen him with a great deal of money and it is very seldom that he works I wondered how he came by the money till one day he asked me if I had any money I said No He said Come along with me I can put you in possession of many a bright pound He took me to Hyde Park and told me to keep behind and he would go out there and watch a man out and say he was an unnatural man then I was to come up as an officer to take him into custody and get money from him - at that I was borror-struck and shunned of his company He said he got 70 l at a time by those jobs Q When was this - A About three months ago He said he got 70 l from a gentleman in St James s-street by only touching him on the collar and accusing him A Where did you meet with him - A At the Rodney s Head I have met him frequently since but I would have no more doings with him I told him the dangerous consequences of it and also that his brother was transported from this bar for that offence He said as for that his brother did not know how to do it as he did Q When did you mention this to a magistrate - A Why Sir I ought to have done it but I was afraid because there are a great many Irishmen about our place I was afraid I should fall a victim to them and thought I had better shun his company Q You was in his company afterwards - A No only by meeting him in the street and saying how do you do Q What are you - A I was brought up a shoemaker but am articled to a cow-doctor I live at No 15 Portman-street - his name is Edward Skelly No 4 Newman s-mews Q You was afraid to tell a Magistrate when was it you assumed courage enough to mention it to any one - A I told my brother about a week ago I saw the name in the paper among the witnesses and said I knew that man to be a bad character and they subpoened me here to give evidence Q Are the same Irishmen living in the neighbourhood now - A No some of them are gone away and so I mustered up courage to speak of it Q How long age is it since this communication was made to you by Dwyer - A Two or three months ago I cannot say which - I had other business to attend to Q You did go with him to the Park - A Yes but when he mentioned it I walked back directly horror-struck COURT Q He mentioned it first to you at the public-house - A Yes I went to the Park with him that same night JOSEPH DONNE I am called Court

an announcement in the New Times of the 22d of February under the head of Court Intelligence did you furnish it - A As far as relates to the Royal Family I did The next article is Lord Harrowby will give a grand Cabinet dinner to-morrow The impression on my mind is that I did not send that article for I never use the word grand as I know all Cabinet dinners are alike ANDREW MITCHELL I am printer of the New Times I have the manuscript of that article JOSEPH DONNE re-examined It is not my writing and does not come from me ANDREW MITCHELL re-examined I received it from a person of the name of

was here before you was asked if you knew Hucklestone and you said No - A I do not Q Look at that man pointing to him and say if you know him - A Yes I have seen him but did not know his name was Hucklestone I have often seen him in Oxford-road in the street but never saw him in any house that I know of Q Did you ever propose to him to go and charge a man with an unnatural crime in the Park with a view to get money - A Never I solemnly swear it I never went out with him in my life Q In January or February last were you out of your regular work - A Yes and then went to work at Mr Elwell s before that I worked at the parish mill for two or three weeks I have a wife and three children MR ADOLPHUS Q On your oath when you came into this place just this moment did you not look at him and say Oh Hucklestone - A I did not I have seen him at the top of James-street where he used to resort with a parcel of chaps Q Did you never see him any where but in the street on your oath - A I have seen him in Hyde Park I used to resort to the Rodney s Head public-house in Chandler-street but I never knew him to resort there My countrymen in general resort there Q Will you say on your oath that you have not repeatedly met him in a public-house - A I will say I have not repeatedly met him Q Will you swear you have not seen him at a public-house - A That is a hard thing - I have not lately Q

between us I then worked for Mr Smith No 22 Mortimer-street Cavendish-square for thirteen years and several other gentlemen Adjourned THIRD DAY WEDNESDAY APRIL 19 MR ADOLPHUS addressed the Jury on behalf of the prisoner in which he contended that the object was the assassination of His Majesty s Ministers and afterwards to create a riot for the purpose of plunder but not to depose the King and subvert the constitution or levy war LORD CHIEF JUSTICE ABBOTT recapitulated the evidence to the Jury who retired at five minutes before five o clock and at a quarter past five returned and found the

Lampton farmer John Young Frederick-place St Pancras gent and scale-maker James Cary Wade-street Poplar joiner William Edgcombe Wade-street Poplar joiner The Jury being charged with the prisoner Mr Solicitor General opened the case and called ROBERT ADAMS Q Are you now a prisoner in the Tower - A Yes Before that I resided in Hole in the Wall-passage near Brooks-market I was acquainted with a person named Brunt - the first of my acquaintance with him was at Cambray in France in 1815 he then went by the name of Thomas Morton Q I believe some years ago you was in the Oxford Blues - A Yes about eighteen years ago I was discharged through illness since which I have been chiefly employed at shoemaking When I was in France I was pursuing my trade with the English army there Q After you returned when did you resume your acquaintance with Brunt - A Some few months after I returned he lived in Fox-court Gray s Inn-lane I first became acquainted with Thistlewood on the 12th of Januarylast it was on a Wednesday as Sunday was the 9th - Brunt and Ings introduced me to him I had known Ings five or six days before that I was introduced to Thistlewood at his lodgings in Stanhope-street Clare-market I had conversation with him in the presence of Brunt and Ings Q Tell us what passed on that occasion - A On Brunt introducing me into the room he said Here Mr Thistlewood is the man I was speaking to you about Thistlewood said Oh is this the man You belong to the Life Guards do you not I said No I told him I belonged to the Blues once but the proper name of the regiment was the Royal Horse Guards He said he presumed I could use a sword well and was a very good soldier I told him I once was a good soldier and once could use a sword well I told him I could use a sword sufficiently to defend myself if occasion required it Upon that he turned his subject upon the different shopkeepers in London saying they were all a set of Aristocrats and under the same system of government and he should glory to see the day when the shops were all shut up and well plundered He next turned his discourse on Mr Hunt Saying that Hunt was a d - d coward and no friend to the people and no doubt if he could get into Whitehall he should find his name on the books as a spy of Government He next turned his discourse on Cobbet saying he had no doubt but he was equally as bad and with all his writings was not a man for the good of the country Nothing more passed in particular further than Brunt saying he had two men to call on in Carnaby-market and asked Mr Thistlewood to walk with him to see this man Thistlewood declined and on that we left the room with Brunt and Ings Q I believe you went to prison for debt on the 27th of January between that and the interview on the 17th had you other interviews with Thistlewood and the prisoner - A I had an interview with him on Sunday the 16th at the White Hart public-house Brooks-market we first met there in the taproom and proceeded to a room at the back of the house in the back yard on the ground floor - Thistlewood Ings Hall Brunt Tidd and myself were present The next day I was taken to prison for debt and remained there until the day after the death of the late King Q That was the 30th of January when did you next meet Ings - A I saw him the day after that which was the 31st at the White Hart Q Did you go with him to any place - A I saw him at Brunt s lodgings he occupied the front room second floor in the room that was taken for the men to meet in which was the back room on the same floor Q Can you recollect who were at Brunt s room on the night of the 31st when you went there - A It was between six and seven o clock in the evening and the first time I was ever in that room As far as I can recollect I saw Ings Hall Harrison Davidson Thistlewood Brunt and Edwards there - there was a conversation between them respecting the proclamation and indisposition of the new King They had a few words to say about that Q Did you see any thing there that evening - A I saw some pike-staves Thistlewood said he wished they were all ferrelled and holes bored in order to admit the pikes that they might be taken to the place of safety as he did not think they were safe there which place of safety they called the depot I did not then know where that depot was but I afterwards knew Q Where was it - A At Tidd s house in the Hole in the Wall-passage in the house adjoining to where I lived myself Thistlewood left word with Brunt that he hoped they would be taken there when they were done - they were quite green and very stout Ings said he brought them from the other side of the water Q Do you remember any thing more passing that evening - A This I have since called to my recollection there was a conversation respecting the new King thinking he would die Thistlewood remarked that he hoped he would not die from the circumstance of the Duke of York coming to the crown - he said he would rather the new King would live a bit longer as they did not intend he should wear the crown Ings said the people were a parcel of cowards for he himself went into the Park the day the new King went to open Parliament and took a pistol in his pocket with intent to shoot him Ings said so and in saying so he took a pistol from his pocket and said There is the pistol I took with me JURY Q On what evening did this conversation take place - A On the same evening 2d of February MR ATTORNEY GENERAL Q Well - A He regretted that he had not had an opportunity of doing it saying he did not care a d - n for his own life I cannot bring any thing else to my recollection that transpired that night Q How often did you meet at this room - A The appointed time was twice a day at eleven o clock in the morning and seven o clock in the evening There was no furniture in the room except a stove which was fixed - I learnt that the room was taken for Ings but for what purpose I cannot say Q Did you attend many of those meetings between the day you have mentioned and Saturday the 19th of February - A Yes I attended some few times but not so regularly as after I saw Ings at every meeting I went to Q Do you recollect any meeting in the interval between the the 2d and the 19th before the King s funeral - A Yes I found Thistlewood Davidson and Edwards in the room - Harrison Brunt Ings and Hall came in afterwards Thistlewood began to tell me that Harrison should say he had seen one of the Life Guards who had told him Harrison that on the night of the funeral of the King every man of the Life Guards who could be mounted were to attend at the funeral of the King and all the Foot Guards and police officers as well that could be spared from London and that after Harrison had left the guard it struck him that would be a favourable opportunity to collect the men together for the sole purpose of having a riot in London that night and to put themselves in possession of the two pieces of cannon in Gray s Inn lane and the six pieces in the Artillery Ground and it was thought by the time they had got this cannon they should be able to proceed by means of the people that would turn over to them and he thought it would be best to send a party of men to Hyde Park Corner in order to prevent any orderly men from proceeding toWindsor to give notice of what was passing in London At the same time it was proposed that the telegraph on the other side of the water should be seized to prevent any communication with Woolwich at the same time it was thought necessary to dig entrenchments in the different reads in order to prevent the Artillery or soldiers from entering London Q Was any thing more said - A It was thought best by Thistlewood as well as Harrison that if the soldiers got any account of what was doing in London they would be so tired that they would not be fit for duty During this discussion Brunt and Ings were not present but they came in just at the conclusion of it Thistlewood went to them and communicated to them the plan Harrison had proposed and what he thought might be done He communicated to them what I have stated Q What did Brunt and Ings say to that - A They said nothing short of the assassination or murder of the ministers should satisfy them Q Before that had you heard that there was an intention to murder or assassinate His Majesty s Ministers - A Yes I had heard it from Brunt and Ings Q Do you remember any thing more passing - A I recollect one thing passing between then and the 19th Q What was that - A Ings was in the room his blood was all in a boil and he said that we must have the ministers before the Parliament was dissolved Q On Saturday the 19th were you at Brunt s room - A I was between eleven and twelve o clock in the morning and saw Thistlewood Wilson Davidson Harrison Ings and Hall On my entering the room they seemed in a deep study among themselves and all of a sudden they got up saying it was agreed on that if nothing occurred between then and the Wednesday night that was the night agreed on they were to go to work for they were all so poor they could wait no longer Thistlewood proposed that there should be a meeting on the following morning at nine o clock in order to form a committee to draw up a plan to act upon On this they were going to separate but Thistlewood all of a sudden said Oh Brunt if you go round to any of your men give them orders to come armed Brunt turned round and said D - n my eyes are you afraid of any officers coming into the room if any enter the room now the time is got so near I will take d - d good care they shall not go out alive Q In pursuance of this proposition did you go there again on Sunday morning - A I did just at eleven o clock I found Thistlewood Brunt Ings Harrison Davidson Hall Bradburn Wilson Cook Tidd and Edwards there I had not been long in the room before Thistlewood thought it highly necessary as there were twelve in the room and enough to form a committee that they should enter on business and proposed Tidd to take the chair which he did with a pike in his hand Thistlewood stand-on his right hand and Brunt on his left Thistlewood said as they had been waiting so long and were all out of patience from the ministers not dining together and finding there was no chance of their meeting together it was agreed that if nothing occurred between then and Wednesday night they should be taken separately at their own homes He said in doing this they should not have so good an opportunity as by destroying them together but they must put up with it - he thought three were as many as they could take together He proposed that this should be attempted on the Wednesday night but the hour was not then fixed it was also proposed that at the same time the two pieces of cannon in Gray s Inn-lane and the six pieces in the Artillery Ground should be taken Cook was proposed to be at the head of the party to take the six pieces of cannon in the Artillery Ground after he had got them it was proposed that they should be loaded on the ground before they were brought out and if any one interrupted them when they were brought out the cannon was to be fired on them directly but if Cook found himself enabled to make a movement by people coming over to him they were to move to the Mansion House which was to be beset on both sides - the six cannons were to be divided into two divisions three on each side Cook was to go to the Mansion House and demand it and if it was refused he was to go to the cannon and give orders to fire on both sides and they would then give it up to them Q What was to be done then - A The Mansion House was to be the seat of the Provisional Government After they had taken the Mansion House it was said with the other two pieces of cannon which were to be brought from Gray s Inn Lane they might take the Bank and to plunder it if they succeeded which they made no doubt of but did not intend to destroy the books - said that it was necessary to keep the books as they would be the means of bringing to light some of the proceedings of Government that they had not yet got possession of Palin was not present but Thistlewood said he was to be the man who was to set fire to the different buildings which were proposed Thistlewood said they would fix no particular time at present and it was not necessary to fix the time as it could be done afterwards he said he had nothing more to propose but that Mr Brunt had a proposal to make respecting the assassination of Ministers how it was to be done On this Brunt came forward to state what he had to say and was beginning to speak - Thistlewood said stop you had better let the proposition I have made be put from the chair and see if every one is agreeable to it - it was put to the men that if any of them liked to speak on what had been proposed they might speak The proposition was put from the chair and assented to by all present Q Did Brunt say anything - A Brunt came forward saying the proposal he had to make was respecting the assassination of Ministers he said it should be done in this way that so many men as could be got together for the job should be divided into as many parties as different Ministers they had to kill he said after the men were so lotted out there should be one man selected from each lot and the man that it fell on should murder the gentleman or nobleman they had to kill and if the man that was appointed made the attempt and there was the least sign of cowardice seen in him and he did not do it that man was to be run through on the spot which proposal was agreed to Q After that do you remember any one coming into the room - A Yes Palin Potter and Strange Thistlewoodcommunicated his plan to all three and Brunt communicated his they agreed to it Palin got up and said Mr Chairman I wish to speak a few words respecting what has been dropped from Mr Thistlewood and Brunt I paid perfect attention to what has been said and have been one that has assented to it and agreeing as I do in the propositions that have been made before they can be carried I consider it to be a great acquisition to what we have in view but this is what I want to know you talk of from 40 to 50 men for the West-end job - you talk of taking the two cannon in Gray s Inn Lane and six in the Artillery Ground and all this to be done at one time I want to be satisfied how it is to be done You ought to know better than I do what men you have to depend on for my own part I can give no satisfaction respecting the men I can bring forward unless I can be entrusted from the Committee to communicate to them in part if not in full what are your plans and what you are going to do and when they shall be wanted It was thought that Palin knew what kind of men he had and whether he might trust them this passed between Tidd who was in the chair Thistlewood and Brunt they saw no harm in his having liberty to communicate it On this the chair was left and soon after there was a move Thistlewood all of a sudden turned about in the room and said Well thought of Brunt now Palin is here you may as well take him to the new building Furnival s Inn just here and let him pass his opinion on it and see whether he thinks it can be done Palin and Brunt went away together and were absent about ten minutes on their return they gave in to the Committee that Palin thought it a very easy job and would make a good fire On this Brunt resumed the subject of the assassination again he said he had no doubt in his mind that there would be no difficulty in drawing the person to murder the different parties Ings said Whoever has the lot to murder Lord Castlereagh I am the man to turn out to murder that thief Q When did you meet again - A On Monday morning I went there about ten o clock to the best of my recollection I found Brunt Harrison Thistlewood and Ings there I cannot recollect any more being there then there were more in the course of the morning Q What passed on your going into the room - A They seemed rather cast down I communicated to them that there had been two officers at Hobb s who kept the White Hart one from Hatton-garden and one from Bow-street signifying there was information of what was going on both at Bow-street and at Lord Sidmouth s Office Davidson turned himself round on me and said You have acted d - d wrong I said why Brunt turned round directly and said You have acted wrong if you have any thing to communicate whatever you hear out of the room it is your place to speak to me or Thistlewood I said I did not think I had any right to speak to him or Thistlewood I thought it my duty to communicate it to the whole as it concerned the whole they began to think about separating and calling on their different men and on the Mary-le-bone Union there was to be no meeting there that evening Q On the next day Tuesday morning did you go again to Brunt s - A Yes about ten o clock they began to meet earlier after the 19th - I found Thistlewood Brunt Tidd Ings and Hall in the room I had not been in the room long before I saw Ings pull three daggers out of his pocket he was asked the intent of these daggers he took one in his hand made a rush and said with a view to run into their using a bad expression bodies These were handed about and put into his pocket again Just after in came Edwards who went up to Tidd and told him he had seen it in the paper that ministers were to dine together on Wednesday evening at Lord Harrowby s Q On that being communicated was any thing done - A Thistlewood rather disputed it and proposed that the paper should be sent for - it was sent for and on being brought the paragraph was read by Thistlewood himself and believed to be true Brunt jumped about the room and said Now d - n me I believe there is a God - it has often been my prayer that these villains might be brought together and now he has answered my prayer Ings was equally as pleased and said he should have a better opportunity of cutting off Lord Castlereagh s head Thistlewood proposed that there should be a committee sit to settle another plan to assassinate the ministers altogether The committee was formed I was asked to take the chair which I did and called to order Thistlewood was going to proceed to business I having something to say stopped him and said I hoped every man who heard what fell from me on the morning before had given it a due consideration Q What passed on that - A They were all like a set of mad devils more than any thing else Harrison walked about the room looked at me as fierce as a lion and said that the first man who attempted to throw cold water on the deed they were going on he would run that man through directly with a sword I was considered unfit to keep the chair and Tidd was put in Tidd was going to speak but Palin said No as something fell from Mr Adams yesterday morning and as he has alluded to it today I wish to know what it is before we proceed to business On this Brunt jumped up and said D - n my eyes I will tell you what it is - He told Palin what I had communicated to them and proposed that there should be a watch set on Lord Harrowby s house at six o clock in the evening to a moment They were to take particular notice who went into the house If any one went in having the appearance of a soldier or police officer it was to be communicated to the committee Q What was said - A This was agreed to and Brunt said if nobody was found to enter the house likely to give us any obstruction the business should be proceeded in It was settled who should go on the watch then Thistlewood came forward and said It is a more favourable opportunity by ministers all dining together than to take them separately at their houses for then we should only be able to take three or four and by taking them at dinner there may be fourteen or sixteen and there will be a rare hawl - thirty or forty men will be sufficient I will go to the house with a letter for Lord Harrowby telling the servant I must have an answer On his going in he was to be followed by men supplied with pistols swords pikes and different things to be presented at the servants - if they made the least resistance they were to be shot on the spot and when this was done the men that were to takecare of the house were to rush in after Thistlewood and two were to take possession of the stairs leading to the upper part of the house and two at the lower stairs each of these men were to have a hand-grenade in his hand to prevent any one from retiring from the upper or lower part of the house if they attempted it the men were to clap fire to the hand-grenades and send them in among them to destroy them altogether Two men at the same time were to take command of the area one with a blunderbuss and the other with a grenade and if any one attempted to escape from the area they were to be served the same way After the servants were secured the men who were to enter the room were to proceed led by Ings at his own proposal Q What did Ings say - A He said he would go up to their Lordships door and particularly mentioned the description of the things he would take for his defence He said he would have a brace of pistols and a knife which he had prepared for the sole purpose of cutting off their heads as he came to them - the heads of Lords Castlereagh and Sidmouth he was determined to bring away in two bags he brought for that purpose and one hand of Lord Castlereagh he was to bring away to preserve it for a future day and then it would be thought a good deal of Q What was he to say on entering the room - A He said he should say Well my Lords I have got as good men here as the Manchester Yeomanry - enter citizens and do your duty He was to be followed by two swordsmen appointed for that purpose which was Harrison and myself Q What was to be done after this was accomplished at Lord Harrowby s - A They were to retreat from the house as quick as they could and Harrison was to go to the horse barracks in King-street with an illumination ball to put in at the window where the straw was kept to set it on fire The others were to proceed after they left the house to Gray s Inn-lane and if they met anybody that offered to interrupt them they were to be shot or run through with the pikes that they had The two pieces of cannon there were to be taken and the six in the Artillery Ground - Cook was appointed to take the latter Ings repeatedly stated the satisfaction he felt at having an opportunity of cutting all the ministers heads off Q Harrison was there - A Yes After this Harrison proposed that there should be a countersign to be communicated to the men that were to come forward - it was the word button The man was to be stationed at the top of Oxford-street the men who were to approach him were to say BUT the man who was in waiting was to say TON He was then to be taken to the place which was afterwards to be appointed by Harrison to meet at Q Did you go to Brunt s again that day - A I did I called about three o clock in the afternoon - in going up I perceived a strange smell and on entering the room I saw the cause of it Ings Hall and Edwards were there - Ings was making the fire-balls for the purpose of setting fire to the different buildings Edwards was making fusees for the hand-grenades and Hall was laying sheets of paper down to catch them as they fell from the iron pot to prevent their sticking to the hand I went away almost directly and called again at Brunt s between six and seven o clock in the evening and found Thistlewood in the room with two men whom I had not seen before - the name of one was Harris I did not know it then Tidd came about half-past eight he had been appointed to go on the watch with Brunt at nine o clock at Lord Harrowby s Tidd on entering the room expressed himself dissatisfied at not meeting a man he expressed to meet that night Brunt said it was time we should go to watch and relieve the men in proper time Brunt and Tidd went away for the purpose of going there In about five minutes Brunt returned alone saying he had called at a house where he expected to find a man who was likely to be a great acquisition to us and as such Tidd would not go with Brunt and they must have another Brunt looked round the room and said Adams there is nobody can go except yourself - I consented and just as we were leaving the room in came Edwards who had been appointed to go backwards and forwards to see that the men were on duty I asked him if any thing had been seen He said What I have seen or heard I shall communicate to Mr Thistlewood I and Brunt went to Grosvenor-square and when I came there I saw Davidson with another man we relieved them We then went to refresh ourselves at a public-house at the corner of the mews directly at the back of Lord Harrowby s Q While you were there did anything happen - A Nothing occurred except that Brunt played at dominos with a person there We stopped there till very near eleven o clock I went out twice at intervals to watch - Brunt remained there and staid in the neighbourhood of Grosvenor-square till twelve o clock which was the time appointed to leave I then went directly home At four o clock in the morning Ings and Hall were to go on the watch Q The next day was Wednesday the 23d at what time did you go to Brunt s then - A I called very early in the morning I did not stay but went again at two o clock in the afternoon and found Brunt in his own room - his wife got in just before me Strangeand two or three others came in soon after whom I do not know not having seen them before there were several pistols lying in a drawer and some on the top of the drawers but the exact number I cannot say They began to handle the pistols On the strange men coming into the room Brunt proposed going into the back room They were putting leather to their pistols Q What did you see on going into the back room - A I saw arms of different descriptions cutlasses pistols and a blunderbuss with a brass barrel Tidd came into the room and not long after Ings and Hall and very soon after another strange man came in they began to prepare themselves with different arms to take with them such as fixing flints to the pistols and slings to the cutlasses On Thistlewood coming into the room he looked round and said Well my lads this looks something like as if we were going to do something He laid his hand on my shoulder and said Well Mr Adams how do you do I said I was very low and wanted refreshment as I had had nothing to drink that day - he sent for drink which was brought Thistlewood proposed to send for some paper to write some bills he said he should like the sortof paper that newspapers were printed on I said As you don t know the name of the paper you had better send for cartridge paper which will answer your purpose as well Brunt said he would send either his apprentice or boy for it Thistlewood gave Brunt the money and he went out of the room the paper was brought into the room but I do not know who by Thistlewood wrote three bills on it In writing the last bill he expressed himself to be very tired and said he did not know what was the matter with him but he could not write any longer Q Were the bills read - A He read them aloud himself I afterwards saw one of them in Ings s hand and another in Thistlewood s hand This was the last I saw of them Q Now tell us what he read - A Your tyrants are destroyed the friends of liberty are called on as the Provisional Government are now sitting James Ings Secretary 23d of February 1820 Hall was called on to write a fourth bill he refused another person also refused but afterwards consented Ings was in the room at this time - he was very busy preparing himself for action he put a black belt round his waist to contain a brace of pistols another black belt hung over his shoulder for a cutlass He next hung a large bag across each shoulder in the form of a soldier s haversack After doing this he said I am not complete yet I have not got my steel He said never mind and produced a knife from his pocket brandishing it about and said This is the knife I prepared to cut the head of Lord Castlereagh off and the rest as I come to them I asked him what intent he had the bags for he positively said he intended to bring the heads of Lords Castlereagh and Sidmouth away in them The knife was a large one and the handle covered with wax-end he said that was to keep it from slipping when he was at work Q After this did any of the persons go into the room - A Thistlewood and Brunt went out Palin came in and perceiving Thistlewood and Brunt were not present he took upon himself to address those that were there he said he hoped all in the room knew what they met there for and he hoped they would give it a proper consideration and see whether the assassination was likely to be approved of by the country and whether the country were likely to turn on their side Q Was any thing said in answer to that - A A tall man in the room said You seem to speak as if all in the room knew what was going to be done that is what some of us who are here wish to be satisfied of I for my own part am not afraid of myself nor do I conceive that any man who turns out in such a case as this ought to value his life Just at the conclusion of this Brunt entered the room again and seeing an alteration in the countenances of those in the room he wanted to know the cause The tall man told him that some in the room wanted to know what they had met there for Brunt said This is not the place where you are to be informed go along with me to Edgware-road there you shall be informed what you are going about and all who go along with me I will take care they shall have a drop of something to drink to put them in spirits A blunderbuss was fixed with a brass belt round my shoulder slung to it and fixed under my great coat for me to carry it to Cato-street after that there was a broom-stick which had been prepared for a bayonet to be fixed at one end this was Brunt s I was to take it as a walking stick Nothing further was done in the room more than that Brunt said it was necessary to begin to prepare ourselves to go as the room where we were would be wanted for the meeting of Palin s men after we are gone Q You told us some pike-staves were prepared and were to have ferrels put on them - A Yes I saw a dozen of them ferrelled by Bradburn there is a cupboard in the room which was used for the reception of swords I saw some tallow pitch and some small hand-grenades there I have seen gunpowder balls and muskets I saw powder put into hand-grenades the powder was brought in a brown paper bag I have seen Brunt take a bag to carry the hand-grenades from there Q What time did you leave Brunt s to go to Cato-street - A As near six o clock as I can recollect I went by myself and was to be followed by Strange and this tall man whom I spoke of and Brunt I met Thistlewood Brunt and a strange man in Edgware-road and went with them to Cato-street I entered a kind of stable under the arch-way it is the first building on the right-hand side I found Davidson sitting and Wilson standing up in the stable - they appeared to be doing something at the pikes - I passed them and went up the ladder into the loft above and found Ings Hall and Bradburn and the tall man whom I did not know they were handling different arms which laid on a bench in the loft Tidd was not there when I arrived Thistlewood began to be rather agitated for fear Tidd should not come Brunt seeing the men rather confused said there was no occasion for any uneasiness about the arrival of Tidd for he would venture to forfeit his existence if Tidd was not forthcoming About this time Ings began to shew himself mad he stamped and swore and said D - n my eyes if you think of dropping it now I will either hang myself or cut my throat Thistlewood said to the men For God s sake do not think of dropping the affair if you do it will turn out another Despard job Thistlewood looked round and said You seem to think there is not sufficient men present there are 18 here and two below make 20 it is quite sufficient supposing Lord Harrowby has 16 servants they are not armed we shall go prepared and it will not take us from our entering the house to coming out above 16 minutes He proposed that 14 men out of 20 should enter the room he thought six would be sufficient to take care of the servants Tidd came in about 20 minutes before the officers came I did not see him enter the room but I saw him there Q Thistlewood proposed 14 men should enter the room - A Yes Tidd was in the room at that time and I said Don t you think this is a pretty set out - do you think this is sufficient to do what we are talking about Tidd shook his head and said never Fourteen were selected to go into the room it was first proposed to be put to them to see if they were all willing to go This was put and agreed to and the 14 men called out separate from the rest and Brunt pulled a gin bottle from his pocket Q Was the prisoner one that was picked out - A He was and I was one and Harrison another and this being done they thought of preparing themselves to go Just about this time I heard somebody in the stable I heard a person call out and directly after the words Halloo shew a light Thistlewood took a candle from the bench and went to the head of the ladder and seeing who were coming up he turned round set the candle on the bench in quite a confused state I never heard him speak Two officers directly entered the room Thistlewood sided off from where he was into the little room which room I had not noticed before Ings Brunt and Harrison went in also On the officers coming up they stood at the top of the ladder in the room with a small pistol presented saying Halloo here is a pretty nest of you and looking round and seeing the arms on the bench and arms about them they said Gentlemen we have a warrant to apprehend you all and hope you will surrender quietly Smithers said make room let me come forward He came up between the two officers who made way for him and at the moment a group of those in the little room made towards the door and I saw a hand rush forward from the group and another hand presented itself with a pistol it was fired and out went the candle and I could not see what passed afterwards I did not see Smither s fall - there was great confusion in the room - the officers as soon as they saw their brother officer was murdered ran down and gave the alarm of murder I went out of the room down the ladder and through the stable under the archway and escaped As I got out into Cato-street I turned my head aside and a pistol was fired from the window at me As I was under the archway the soldiers were coming up I was apprehended on the Friday and have been in custody ever since Cross-examined by MR ADOLPHUS Q Where were you born - A At Ipswich in Suffolk I was educated a Christian and profess that religion now Q Did you ever cease to profess it - A Yes I was what they term a Deist I always believed in a God Q How long have you ceased to be a Deist - A Since I conceived myself to be wrong which is since I was apprehended I became a Deist in August last Q Did you ever deny your belief in God - A I never denied my belief in a God though I was brought by that cursed work of Paine s to deny Christianity Q How long did you serve your King - A Five years I served in England and left 18 years ago on account of illness Since last Monday I have been in the House of Correction and have had communication with nobody but those who attend me I have had no writing or printing conveyed to me I heard before I went home on the day the Jury gave their verdict that Thistlewood was found guilty I have heard no observation that was made on my evidence Q I will tell you why I ask You have altered your evidence a great deal - A I do not know that I have Q From the time you begun to hold communication with Brunt Ings and Thistlewood was it your intent to execute the project they proposed or was it to give evidence - A No I was in hopes and wanted the opportunity to creep out of it but was hindered from threats that were held out nor was I disposed to plunder the shops or any thing of the kind Q You was in a society which said that was their object and you had the benefit of fourteen days consideration in prison - A The threats were held out before that On the very day before I went to prison I asked Brunt in the presence of Thistlewood for the plan that was drawn up I wanted to see it Brunt said nothing would be communicated till the day of action Thistlewood said By no means there shall be nothing given and the very day we think of going to work we will have the men all together give them a treat and tell them what shall be done and then we will never lose sight of them Brunt said he would take d - d good care there should be no writing but if he suspected any man had given information he should be run through I was imprisoned for 23 s 8 d Before that I had met Brunt and Ings several times at the public-house Q When was the first time you heard any threats - A On Friday the 18th at the White Hart Q That so intimidated you that when you came out of prison you sought them directly - A I had reason to be intimidated from what Ings said - his whole soul was bent on murder The room at the White Hart had been given up while I was in prison which I did not know until I met them Q The other day when you was examined did you tell us about Ings producing a pistol and saying he hoped the King would not come to the crown and so on - A I did not I told as far as my recollection went the reason I did not say it was on Monday was that it did not come to my recollection I have not mentioned to-day about taking the sea-ports as I did not recollect it MR GURNEY We studiously passed over certain parts of his evidence for the purpose of shortening it MR ADOLPHUS Q You have told us to-day about digging entrenchments - A I did not recollect that on Monday and I can tell you now things which I forgot even to day - if more comes into my head at another time I shall state it I cannot say whether I stated about the cannon being loaded on the ground Q Now we will come to the meeting on the 22d was that the time Ings pulled the daggers out - you did not state that on Monday - A If I was to state every thing I could but when I am called on to select one thing out of many it confuses me if I had thought of it at the time I should have mentioned it I did not conceive according to the dictates of the counsel who examined me that I was to state every thing there are things that transpired on the 22d which I have not stated either on Monday or to-day Q Are you certain that when you came to Cato-street there were eighteen up stairs and two below - A That is what Thistlewood gave out I never saw Monument to my recollection at the time the murder was committed I was at the end of the room farthest from the door - I never observed the little room until the party went to it To the best of my recollection the door of the little room is about the middle the door of the loft is on the side and the bench stood in the middle I only noticed one candle in the room but I will not say there were not more Q If any man swore there were eight candles it would be false - A I should say he was a false man Q You are sure one of the officers said Here is a a pretty nest of you Gentlemen we have a warrant to apprehend you - A Yes words to that effect were used but it is not possible to be answerable for every word that passed I afterwards found Edwards very deep in conversation with Brunt and Tidd Q You did not tell us last time of a pistol being fired at you - A I did not think of it nor when it was fired did I know it was fired at me but there was a hole in my coat I do not wish to fix the guilt of any other man on the prisoner The coat is in the room that I slept in last night Q Did you ever call on a person named Chambers in Heathcock-court in company with Edwards about four days before this affair took place - A Never in my life that I swear I know know such person Q Did you call on any person and wish him to assist in assassinating His Majesty s Ministers and say you would have blood and wine for supper - A Never in my life When I was at Cato-street Hall brought me a pistol and gave me five round of ball cartridges I handled the pistol and laid it on the bench where it was when the officers came I threw the cartridges away before I left the room I never had the large hand-grenade in my hand - I never carried any ammunition from Cato-street to Brunt s but I carried some pikes from Brunt s to Tidd s - I saw Edwards making touch-paper for the fusees he never had much to say and what he did say was always in a whisper to Thistlewood Brunt Harrison or Tidd ELEANOR WALKER I am niece and servant to Mrs Rogers Fox-court Gray s Inn-lane Brunt lodged in the house near twelve months - he occupied two front rooms on the second floor In January he introduced a man whose name I afterwards found to be Ings to take a lodging Q Is that the man at the bar - A He appears something like him but I cannot swear to him He took the back room on the same floor as Brunt at 3 s per week he had it a month or five weeks He said perhaps he might bring in his goods in a week or better but he never did Cross-examined by MR CURWOOD Q What part of the house do you occupy - A The bottom part The staircase door is always shut Q Could ten or twelve men go up once or twice a day without your knowing it - A I have heard people go up but cannot say how many MR GURNEY Q Is there a door that people may go up without going through your shop - A Yes there is a private door in a passage leading to the staircase There is also a back door which lodgers come in at and go up stairs without coming to the shop MARY ROGERS Eleanor Walker is my niece and servant In January I let a back room on the second floor the prisoner occupied it four or five weeks - he paid for four weeks and left one unpaid the lodgings were kept till Brunt was taken up I asked Brunt who the lodger was he said he was a butcher out of employ and he knew nothing more of him only by seeing him at a public-house and hearing him enquire for a lodging One evening as I was putting my child to bed I saw three men go up stairs the middle man was a man of colour but I did not take sufficient notice of him so as to be able to speak to him JOSEPH HALE I am apprentice to Brunt and lived with him in Fox-court he had two front rooms on the second floor one to live in and one to work in I remember the prisoner Ings taking the back room on the same floor I had seen him in Brunt s workshop about a fortnight before he took the room - I think I saw him once before Brunt looked at the room with him When they came out I heard Brunt say to Ings It will do go down and give them 1 s - this was on a Monday Ings came there that evening with a man named Hall Ings came and asked Mrs Brunt for the key and I believe she gave it to him He and Hall went into the room several others came - they used to come every evening till my master was taken up Q Can you give us the names of the different persons who used to come to these meetings of an evening - A Yes Thistlewood Ings Davidson Bradburn Tidd Edwards Adams Hall Potter and Strange There was no furniture in the room - they used to borrow Brunt s chairs to sit on my master used to be in the room with them and I have also seen some of them in my master s room They sometimes called Thistlewood T and sometimes Arthur Q Do you remember ever seeing the room door open and observing any thing in the room - A Yes I saw some long poles like branches of trees I have heard hammering and sawing going forward in the room My master was taken up on the 24th of February Q On the Sunday before that was there any meeting in that room - A Yes the persons I have named were present with others - it was a larger meeting than usual they went away one or two at a time - my master was with them after the meeting was over I saw Strange in the room with my master - he had been at the meeting Q On Monday evening was there a meeting - A Yes and on Tuesday evening On Wednesday several persons came at different times some in the morning and some in the afternoon Q Do you remember any of them coming into your workshop - A Yes Strange and a man whom I do not know - this was about two o clock they were flinting five or six pistols One of them said there were persons overlooking them from the opposite house and Brunt told them to go into the back room which they did - Brunt was in the back room several times in the course of the day I saw Thistlewood there about four o clock he came to me for a piece of writing-paper which I gave him and he took it into the back room After that Brunt came out gave me 6 d and told me to go and get six sheets of cartridge-paper I went and bought six sheets gave them to him and he took them into the back room - my master went away about six o clock Before he went away a man whom I do not know came into our room Q After Brunt was gone did you do any thing respecting your mistress tea - A Yes She wanted a table out of the back room and by her desire I knockedat the back room door asked for it and Potter gave it out to me I saw four or five men there then and a fire in the room Q In the course of the evening did you meet Tidd - A He came to Mrs Brunt s room she took him to the cupboard shewed him a pike-head and sword and asked him what she could do with them he said he would take them away he did so - this was between seven and eight o clock He went into the back room after that I heard some persons going down stairs - a person came and told me if any persons came and enquired they were to go to the White Hart Shortly after three persons came they did not know the way and I shewed them I returned and as I stood at the door Potter came I sent him there and he went Q About what time did your master come home - A About nine o clock - his boots and the tail of his coat were very muddy he seemed rather confused He told his wife it was all up or words to that effect and said where they had been a lot of officers came in and he had saved his life and that was all Just as he said this another person came in Brunt shook hands with him and asked him if he knew who had informed he said No The man said he had a terrible blow on the side and was knocked down - they spoke as if they had been together Brunt said there was something to be done yet and they went away together My mistress and I then went into the room there were several things in the cupboard a large pole in the corner of the room and several rolls of brown paper and tar in the cupboard and some round balls made of string and tar over them - I have since heard they were called hand-grenades the officers found them there next morning There was also an iron pot and some flannel bags two of them full of something they were left there My master came home about eleven o clock and told me to get up early in the morning and clean his boots Q In the morning did you do so - A Yes and he asked me if I knew Snow s-fields I said No He then directed me how to find it and told me to go to Potter s in Kirby-street Snow s-fields He took me into the back room told me to take a rush basket up and he took another - he told me to put the things into them out of the cupboard which I saw there the night before I did so One of the baskets was tied up in a blue apron of Mrs Brunt s which had been used as a curtain to the window of the back room Brunt went into his own room to look for something to tie the other in but two police officers came in and apprehended him Q How many do you think met there on the Sunday - A About twenty Cross-examined by MR CURWOOD Q You told us on Tuesday that you found a piece of cartridge-paper in the cupboard - A Yes I was not particularly surprised at their meetings I did not know what they were about I never saw many arms I was never in a Court of Justice before nor ever before a Magistrate except about this business THOMAS SMART I am one of the watchmen of St George Hanover-square On Tuesday night the 22d of February I was on the watch in Grosvenor-square and saw four very suspicious characters about half-past eight or a quarter

JOHN HECTOR MORRISON I am journeyman to Henry Thomas Underwood who is a cutler and lives in Drury-lane On Christmas eve the prisoner Ings brought a sword to be sharpened he was dressed like a butcher He called for it about three days after and paid 9 d for grinding it Q Did he give any direction about it - A To grind the point particularly sharp and to make it cut both back and edge - it was a very short sabre He gave me the name of Ings as near as I can recollect He afterwards brought another very long sabre and told me to grind it in the same manner as the first EDWARD SIMPSON I am corporal-major of the second regiment of Life Guards - the prisoner Harrison was formerly in that regiment he has been on duty at King-street barracks - his duty would make him perfectly acquainted with every part of them The barracks join Gloucester-mews There were some windows which looked into the mews they were stopped up three days after the affair in Cato-street there was hay and straw opposite the window in the mews If fire was thrown in and it communicated with the straw it would undoubtedy destroy the barracks JOHN ALDOUS I am a pawnbroker and live in Berwick-street Soho The

business as a cow-keeper and dairy-man in Manchester-mews I have known the prisoner Wilson some months before last February Q Shortly before the 23d of February did he make any proposition to you - A He did He met me and asked if I would be one of a party that was going to meet to destroy his Majesty s ministers he said they had got such things as I never saw that they were made of tin wound round with tarpauling and tarred and were very strong so that if they were set fire to they would blow up one of the walls of the houses where we were walking He said they were to destroy his Majesty s ministers that they hadgot every thing ready and were waiting for a cabinet dinner and when there was one he would let me know and that they were going to light up several fires - he mentioned the houses of Lord Harrowby the Duke of Wellington Lords Sidmouth and Castlereagh the Bishop of London and another which I do not remember He said I had no occasion to be afraid for there was a gentleman s servant who had supplied them with a certain sum of money and if they would act on the subject he would give them a considerable sum more He told me that by lighting up the fires it would keep the town in confusion for a few days and then it would become general He said the things were to be lit by a fusee and those who escaped the explosion were to die by the edge of the sword or some other way Q Did he offer to introduce you to any person - A He said if I would make one of the party which they depended upon that Thistlewool would be glad to see me - I said I would make one Q Before the discovery in Cato-street did you give information - A I wrote a letter to Lord Castlereagh two or three days after I had seen Wilson I could not see his Lordship and delivered the letter to Lord

Inn-lane and another in the City or Gee s-court I am not certain which He said all Gee s-court were in it but they would not act unless the English began first for they had been deceived so many times - I believe Irishmen lived in Gee s-court He said after they left Grosvenor-square they meant to retreat towards the Mansion House for that was where all the parties were to meet Q Did he mention any thing that was to be done at other places - A He said there were some cannon - they could very easily get two pieces in Gray s Inn-lane and six more from the Artillery Ground which they could get by killing the centinel I said I would be sure to come I would be there by six o clock or a quarter before I went between six and seven I was behind my time - I think it was near seven I saw Wilson and Davidson standing at the corner of the court by Cato-street - I had known Davidson a long time before Davidson asked me if I was going in saying Mr Thistlewood was there I said I could not go in for I must go to fetch some cream and asked him what time they should go away from there he said about eight o clock and if they were gone away I was to follow them to Grosvenor-square at the bottom of the

Yes about a week or a fortnight before I was never at any meeting in Fox-court I knew nothing of the affair till Wilson told me Q The cream was a thing of great profit to you - A It was I should get

be alarmed for a gentleman s servant will supply money - A It was the first time He repeated it more than once or twice I have known him a great while He mentioned it both times He said the servant s master was a ministerial man I never went into Cato-street I went no further than John-street MR GURNEY Q Did you continue to carry on business as a milkman till Saturday last - A My family did and have the premises now My wife generally serves the house in Princes-street I think it is the first door out of Cavendish-square on the right-hand side THE RIGHT HON LORD HARROWBY I am one of his Majesty s Privy Council It is usual for the members of the council who form the cabinet to dine at each others houses The dinners had been interrupted by the death of his late Majesty Q Did your Lordship cause cards to be issued inviting the members of the cabinet to dine with you on Wednesday the 23d of February - A I did on the latter end of the preceeding week If nothing had occurred the dinner would have taken place Q Will your Lordship have the goodness to enumerate the company that would have been assembled - A Here his Lordship stated the names of the cabinet ministers as on the former trial - there would have been fourteen besides myself - they are all members of the Privy Council My house is on the south side of Grosvenor-square next door to the Archbishop of York s Q On Tuesday the 22d of February was your Lordship riding in the Park - A I was and was accosted by a person whom I now know to be Hiden He delivered this letter to me addressed to Lord Castlereagh and spoke of it as business of material importance to Lord Castlereagh myself and others and begged of me to deliver it to Lord Castlereagh I was then going home to dress for the council at Carlton Palace and not finding Lord Castlereagh there I dispatched it to him with a note from myself Q Did Hiden at your Lordship s desire give you his card - A He did and I met him next morning in Hyde Park in the plantation by appointment he made a communication to me respecting a plan for attacking the ministers at my house in consequence of which the dinner was given up and I dined at Fife House but the preparations were carried on precisely the same as if the company were to dine until I dispatched a note to inform the servants that the cabinet would not dine I believe that note must have reached my house about eight o clock - I had concealed it from my servants Cross-examined by MR CURWOOD Q I believe your Lordship had some intimation of this before the letter was delivered to you - A I had intimation at a period considerably antecedent to this of a design of this nature JOHN BAKER I am butler to Lord Harrowby By his Lordship s desire on Friday or Saturday I issued cards of invitation for a cabinet dinner the preparation for dinner went on till about eight o clock I received information from his Lordship about eight o clock or ten minutes past that the dinner would not take place Down to that period neither myself nor any of the servants knew that it would not take place JOHN MONUMENT I am now a prisoner in the Tower I remember meeting Thistlewood at the house of one Ford two or three months before the meeting in Cato-street He called on me about a fortnight or three weeks afterwards in company with the prisoner Brunt - my mother and brother were in the room Thistlewood was in the room about five minutes then called me outside the door saying he wanted to speak to me - I went out with him and Brunt remained in the room He said great events were at hand the people were every where anxious for a change and he had been promised support by many people who had deceived him but now he had got men who would stand by him He asked me if I had any arms I told him No He said no one should be without arms and every one they belonged to had got arms some had a sabre some a pistol and some a pike and that I might buy a pistol for 4 s or 5 s I said I had no money to buy pistols - he said he should see what he could do We returned to the room and Brunt and Thistlewood went away together Q After this did Brunt call on you by himself - A He did two or three days after he said he was in a hurry for he had several people waiting for him down stairs and he had to call on several people in our trade Q Do you remember Brunt calling on you on the 22d of February - A Yes he called in company with Tidd between two and three o clock I said I thought I had lost you He said the King s death had made an alteration in their plans I asked him what plans he said there would be a meeting on the following evening at Tyburn turnpike where I should know all the particulars He turned round to Tidd and asked him if he should give me the word Tidd said Yes he supposed there was no danger He said if I saw people about I was to go to them and say B U T and if they were friends they would answer T O N making the word button he then said he would be at our house the following morning and tell me farther particulars - he and Tidd then went away Q Now on Wednesday did Brunt call - A Yes between four and five o clock alone - he called me down stairs - my brother was up stairs He told me he wanted me to go with him for half an hour I told him I could not for I had got some work to do which must be finished and I could not go at that time He asked me what time my work would be done I said not till six o clock He said I must go to Tidd s and told me where Tidd lived in Hole in the Wall-passage Brooks-market - he then went away I went to Tidd s about half-past six o clock and found him at home he said he was waiting for some more men but they had not come and he would not wait longer than seven o clock Nobody came and he and I went to a box in the corner of the room and took a pistol put it into a belt and put it round his body under his great coat he took a bundle of pike-heads I suppose about six or eight and wrapped them in a brown paper and took them in his hand He also took a staff about four feet long it had a hole at one end to receive a pike-head as I suppose I accompanied him through Brook-street up Holborn where he gave me the stick to carry and as we were going along Oxford-street I asked what we were going about He said I should know when I got there I asked him if we were going to the House of Commons He said No there were too many soldiers about there I asked him again and he said they were going to Grosvenor-square I asked him if anybody in particular lived there he said there was to be a cabinet dinner there that evening - nothing farther passed He took me to Cato-street through a gateway and on the right-hand side of the way there was a stable Q When you got there what happened - A There were two people standing there whom I do not know - he said a few words to them and we entered the stable three or four men were there and a light He asked if Mr Thistlewood was up stairs they said Yes and we went up stairs there were about twenty-two or twenty-three people there according to what I could tell - Thistlewood was one of them there was a carpenter s bench and a great many swords and pistols on it There was a man in a brown great coat sitting on a box by the bench he spoke of the impropriety of going with so small a number of men as twenty-five to Lord Harrowby s and Thistlewood said there were quite sufficient for supposing Lord Harrowby had sixteen servants fourteen men would be quite enough to go into the room The man said what should they do when they came out of the room for most likely a crowd would be about the door and how should they escape Thistlewood said to him You know this is the smallest body and the largest is already away The prisoner Davidson told the man in the brown coat not to throw cold water on their proceedings for if he was afraid of his life he might go Brunt then said that sooner than leave the business they were going about he would go into the room by himself and blow them all up if he perished with them He said we knew we had that which would do it or words to that effect The man in the brown coat said he did not like their going with so small a number yet if they were all for it he would not be against it He then proposed that they should put themselves under the orders of Mr Thistlewod Thistlewood then said that every man engaged in this business would have the same honour as himself he then proposed that the fourteen men to go into the room should volunteer themselves from the rest Twelve or thirteen persons then arranged themselves on the other side of the room and one of them Tidd came out to speak to me on which Thistlewood came forward and said You all know your places I do not recollect any thing particular passing afterwards - the officers came up in about five minutes it seemed that two or three got up before those in the room knew it One of them said they were officers told them to surrender and said there was a guard of soldiers below - I was taken into custody in the room and have been in custody ever since Cross-examined by MR CURWOOD Q Thistlewood side every man would have equal honour with himself what was to be your post - A I do not know fear led me there Brunt said the day before that every one who had engaged in it and did not come forward should be destroyed Q Did you go to a place to do you knew not what - A Why I was foolish I was afraid they were going after something bad by his taking pistols Q I think you said last Tuesday that he said there was to be a cabinet dinner and then you fully understood what they were going about - A I said I asked no questions when they said there was a cabinet dinner because I was certain they would be going about nothing but to destroy the persons there assembled I went to none of the meetings I believe I saw Thistlewood before I saw him at Fox s I was at the Finsbury meeting Q What prevented you from going to a Magistrate and telling your fears - A I should not have liked to have done that Q When you found yourself in custody your concience struck you - A I never intended to do anything - I meant to get from them when they got out Q Thistlewood told the man in the brown coat to go away for they would have no cowards there why did you not go then - A I wished at the time that they had said that to me I joined them from fear and certainly have acted very foolishly I did not know their intention THOMAS MONUMENT I am brother of the last witness I remember Thistlewood calling at our lodging and bringing Brunt along with him they remained in the room between five and ten minutes then Thistlewood asked my brother if he could speak to him - they went outside the door and in about five minutes returned into the room again On Tuesday the 22d of February Brunt called upon my brother and brought a man with him named Tidd My brother said to Brunt I thought I had lost you There was something said about the King s death Brunt said it had made some little alteration in their plans My brother asked what plans Brunt said they had different objects in view and then said to Tidd Suppose we give him the outline of the plan I did not bear Tidd say anything to that Brunt then told my brother to meet him up at Tyburn turnpike the next evening about eight o clock which he agreed to do - they then gave him the pass-word B U T and said if he met any of their party the answer would be T O N Brunt called about five o clock the next evening and asked my brother if he was ready to go he told him he was not that he had to finish some work Brunt told him to call at Tidd s house in Hole in the Wall-passage and he would take him My brother went a little before seven o clock I did not see him again until after he was in custody GEORGE CAYLOCK I live at No 2 Cato-street I know Harrison - on the 23d of February I saw him in Cato-street going into the stable and asked him how he did he said very well He said he had taken some chambers there and was going to clean them up I saw several persons going in and out of the stables from five till seven o clock G T J RUTHVEN I am an officer of Bow-street I went to Cato-street on the 23d of February about six o clock in the evening and went to the stable about eighto clock I entered the stable about half-past eight and observed a man with a gun on his shoulder marching as a centinel - I told some of our party to secure him I went up a ladder into the loft and observed several men standing round a carpenter s bench I think about twenty-four or twenty-five I heard the clattering of arms saw several swords and pistols I was followed up by three or four of our party and am sure Ellis and Smithers followed me up When I got up to the loft I said We are officers seize the arms I do not recollect anything being said before Thistlewood was standing by the side of the carpenter s bench he turned himself took a sword off the bench and drew back into a little room - the sword was drawn at the time he took it up it appeared a very long sword and was very bright I knew Thistlewood before I did not hear Ellis say anything Smithers passed me and approached the door where Thistlewood was who was fencing with the sword on Smithers approaching Thistlewood stabbed him A pistol was fired almost the instant that Smithers was stabbed the lights put out and a great rush made towards the staircase - somebody called out Kill the b - g - rs throw them down stairs I said Ah kill them throw them down stairs I rushed through the stable got into John-street and met the soldiers I returned and on my return I saw Tidd coming out of the stable door - the door was open - he was going in a kind of shuffling neither walking or running I saw somebody following him and called to him to take hold of him I saw Tidd lift up his arm with a pistol in his hand and appeared to be going to fire it I caught hold of his arm had a scuffle fell upon a dunghill he fell upon me and the pistol went off - Sergeant Legge came up and secured him We took him to the Horse and Groom at the corner of Cato-street searched him and found two ball cartridges in his breeches-pocket he had a belt round his waist Bradburn was brought in while I was there - I searched him and in his breeches-pocket I found six ball cartridges and three bullets a string was twisted six or eight times round his waist to answer the purpose of a belt Davidson was brought in and began to sing Scots wha hae wi Wallace bled &c and d - n - d the man that would not die in liberty s cause - he gloried in it I did not search him Wilson was brought in - I did not search him I returned to the loft found several soldiers four of the prisoners and some of the officers in the room Q When Smithers received the thrust with the sword what took place - A He said Oh my God or I am done I do not know which I afterwards went to the stable and found the arms Here the witness produced the several quantities of arms and ammunition taken from the prisoners or found at Cato-street the same as stated in the former trial Q Before you left the public-house did Wilson say any thing - A He said he did not care a d - n he knew it was all over and they might as well kill him now as at another time Q Before you went into the stable did you go to the Horse and Groom - A I did and while I was there Cooper and Gilchrist came in - Cooper had a broom-stick which he left in the house I took possession of it that night Gilchrist came back for it but did not get it It was cut round at one end as if to receive the socket of any thing Cross-examined by MR ADOLPHUS Q How many lights were there - A As near as I can tell in the two rooms there were about eight I think there were four in the loft and four in the little room - but that I guess from the blaze All I said was We are officers seize their arms JAMES ELLIS I am one of the conductors of the patrol of Bow-street On Wednesday evening the 23d of February I went to the stable in Cato-street John-street I entered the stable as close to Ruthven as possible There was a light in the stable I found the men there The first man I observed was standing about half-way between the door and the ladder at the end leading to the loft - I believe it to be Davidson I took him by the collar turned him half round and believe it to be him He had a short gun or carbine on his right side and in his left a long sword and two white cross-belts across his shoulder I took him him by the collar turned him half round and desired some of the others close by to secure him I then observed a man before me at the foot of the ladder in the further stall of the stable he appeared to be a short man and had a dark-coloured coat on I took very little notice of him but followed Ruthven up the ladder and heard a man from below call out Above men I cannot be positive as to the words but I understood it to be a signal to those above Smithers followed me up the ladder I heard a rattling of swords when we came to the top Ruthven called out We are officers seize their arms or surrender your arms - it was to that effect There were three or four lights in the loft but how many I cannot say there were other lights in the little room The candles were placed on the bench which stood across the room The moment I gained the top of the ladder I observed a number of men retreating to the top of the room towards the wall I saw Thistlewood and two or three others between the end of the carpenter s bench and the little room and immediately on my going to the top of the ladder Thistlewood shook his sword at me as if to make a stab I desired him to desist or I would fire at him I had a pistol in my right hand and a constable s staff in my left which I held out at him on this he retreated backing into the little room At that moment Smithers having gained the top of the ladder rushed forwards to enter the door of the little room The moment he gained the door Thistlewood stabbed him in the right breast Smithers held up his hands exclaiming Oh my God and fell almost immediately upon this I fired my pistol at Thistlewood The lights were all put out the moment I fired The flash of my pistol was the last light I saw Great confusion took place - a rush was made against me and I was thrown down the ladder Q Were there any other shots fired - A Several were fired in the loft while I was on the ladder I recovered myself in the stable and got to the door - two shots were fired and passed me in the doorway - a third was fired but I could not exactly tell from where Another shot was fired in the stable by a man who stood there and when I got to the door some shots were fired from the window of the little room above which looks into Cato-street I heard the cry of Stop thief and saw a man running away down Cato-street towards Queen-street - I saw he had white cross belts I pursued and caught him in Cato-street - itturned out to be Davidson the man of colour On my laying hold of him he made a cut with his sword which I believe was intended for me Gill and Champion my brother officers came up and assisted in securing him I left him in their custody and returned to the stables - I found the soldiers there and four of the prisoners in their custody in the loft Monument was one and I believe Strang and Wilson were two others I fetched Davidson to the loft and they were taken to Bow-street WILLIAM WESTCOAT I am a conductor of the Bow-street patrol and accompanied Ruthven and the other officers to the stable in Cato-street I did not go into the loft at first When they got up I heard a confusion and a noise of firing in the room I observed the prisoner Ings in the stable - he rushed towards me as if to get out of the stable I seized him by the collar and shoved him back against the wall at the foot of the ladder He was going to put his hand to his right side as I thought to get a weapon I hit him one blow on the right side of his head and knocked him down Q What then - A The officers came tumbling down the ladder I heard firing above stairs and saw a flash of a pistol from the ladder it appeared to be fired into the stable I then observed Thistlewood came down the ladder into the stable - I believe him to be the man who fired the pistol when he came into the stable he turned round presented a pistol at my head and fired I put my left hand up and found myself wounded in my hand the ball went into my hat for I found three holes in it I left Ings to defend myself and then received a blow on my right side and fell The shot went right through the sleeve of my coat Q As you fell did you observe Tidd do anything - A He made a cut at me with his sword and rushed out at the stable door When the officers went up the ladder I heard somebody say something but I cannot say what Ings escaped LUKE NIXON I am a Bow-street patrol I went with the other officers to the stable in Cato-street and saw Westcoat in contact with Ings I saw Ings leave the stable and made a snatch at him to catch him - he got out I do not think Thistlewood had got away then I ran after Ings up John-street heard a pistol fired in John-street and found him in custody of Brooks and Champion JOSEPH CHAMPION I am a Bow-street patrol I went to Cato-street on the 23d of February and followed Ruthven up the ladder - I was the sixth or seventh man behind him I saw Ings at the foot of the ladder he held up his head towards the loft and said Look out look out above Westcoat was endeavouring to secure him and struck him a violent blow - he fell When I returned from the ladder Ings was gone I afterwards found him in custody of Brooks and the watchman I took him searched him found four pistol balls the key of a pistol and a knife-case made of blue cloth for a large knife - the knife produced fits the case - he had no knife on him when we searched him the knife has wax-end round the handle I saw Brooks find two haversacks slung under his great coat in one of them was a tin case containing a quantity of loose powder he had also a cloth belt round his side for pistols - it was adapted to receive pistols That is all that was found on him except a paper JOHN WRIGHT I am a Bow-street patrol and was at the stable on the 23d of February I went to the foot of the ladder and saw a man in the further stall of the stable - it was a man of the same size and appearance as Ings I cannot say it was him I took a knife from him with wax-end round the handle and a sword about three feet long with a brass handle Q After you took these things from him what happened to you - A I received a blow was knocked down and received a stab in my side on recovering I found the man was gone I searched Wilson - he said nothing that I remember WILLIAM CHARLES BROOKS I am one of the Bow-street patrol and was in John-street I saw the prisoner Ings running up the street as I crossed the way - one of my partners was before him with a cutlass Ings presented a pistol at me said he would shoot me and fired I snatched at the pistol the powder scorched my hand and the ball went through the sleeve of my great coat through my collar and out at the back of my neck - it bruised my shoulder - this threw me into the middle of the road Ings also came into the road and turned into Edgware-road - at that moment he threw the pistol away Moye the watchman laid hold of him and I caught hold of him at the same time - I never lost sight of him I said You rascal why did you fire at me a man you never saw before He said To kill you and I wish I had done it He repeated it to me and told the soldiers so also WILLIAM LEE I am a Bow-street patrol I went to the Horse and Groom in the evening of 23d of February before the officers went to the stable I saw Cooper and Gilchrist go into the public-house - they were taken up that night and taken to Bow-street CAPTAIN FITZCLARENCE I am a Lieutenant of the Coldstream Guards I was applied to on the 23d of February to go to Cato-street with a piquet I arrived and entered the stable three or four minutes after eight o clock under the gateway leading to Cato-street I saw a police officer who cried out Soldiers soldiers the stable door - the stable door On getting to the stable door I saw two men one of whom presented a pistol at me and at the same time a man with a sword made a cut at me which I parried On seeing the piquet coming up he ran into the stable I followed him and the moment I got in I ran against a man who surrendered himself saying Don t kill me and I will tell you all I gave him over to the piquet and ran forward into the stable went up to one of the stalls and took another man out who I gave to the piquet also I then ran up the steps into the loft - I headed the men There was only sufficient room for one to go up at a time the first thing I fell over was the body of Smithers I secured three four or five people in the room and went down Q Did you see any arms in the loft - A A large quantity consisting of blunderbusses swords pistols and pikes The soldiers picked up some arms in the stable WILLIAM LEGGE I am sergeant of the second battalion of Coldstream Guards I went to Cato-street with a party commanded by Captain Fitzclarence I directed the party to advance in quick time I got to a gateway - just before that I heard the report of pistols and saw a man standing against the wall by the stable in Cato-street he had a pistol in his hand which he levelled at Captain Fitzclarence - it was turned away by me I then seized the pistol with my left hand and a scuffle ensued between the prisoner Tidd and me - the pistol went off as we both held it he held the trigger end - it tore my coat I delivered Tidd to one of the police officers I kept the pistol After going on to the left I saw Cooper Monument and Gilchrist who had surrendered SAMUEL HERCULES TAUNTON I belong to Bow-street office On Thursday morning the 24th of February I went to Brunt s lodgings and apprehended him there I searched but found nothing in the front rooms I went to the back room and found two rush baskets both packed up one was tied in a blue apron there was nothing in the room but two baskets and a pike handle he said he knew nothing about them They were in his presence when I asked him Q Did you afterwards open them - A I did and found one basket contained nine papers of rope yarn tar and other ingredients in separate papers - they are calculated easily to take fire I tried some in the fire and it burnt I also found some steel filings in the basket The other basket contained four hand-grenades three more papers of rope yarn and tar and two bags of powder 1 lb each they were whole flannel bags about six inches long and five flannel bags empty of the same sort one small paper of gunpowder and a leather bag containing sixty-three bullets I also found an iron pot in the room which appeared to have had far very recently boiled in it and a pike handle with a ferrel at the end with a socket Q Did you afterwards go to Hole in the Wall-passage to Tidd s - A Yes in about three quarters of an hour - it was about nine o clock in the morning I searched his apartment and found 434 bullets in a haversack 171 ball cartridges loose 96 ball cartridges without powder a brown paper parcel containing 3 lbs of gunpowder in a brown paper wrapper were ten grenades eleven bags of gunpowder of 1 lb each the same sort of flannel bags as those found at Brunt s and ten flannel bags empty a small linen bag with powder in it sixty-eight bullets four flints twenty-seven pike-handles of the same description as I mentioned - they were rough sticks with ferrels and stocks at the end I also found a box there containing 965 ball cartridges Cross-examined by MR ADOLPHUS Q Have you searched for Palin - A Yes There was a reward offered for his apprehension I have not searched after Potter and Cook MR SOLICITOR GENERAL Q Has Palin absconded - A Yes The reward was to apprehend him for the part he took in this business - Adjourned FIFTH DAY SATURDAY APRIL 22 Examination resumed DANIEL BISHOP I apprehended Thistlewood on the 24th of February between ten and eleven o clock in the morning at No 8 White-street Moorfields in the apartment of a Mrs Harris he lived in Stanhope-street Clare-market I found him in bed with his stockings and breeches on On my entering the room he raised his head from under the bed-clothes - I had a pistol in one hand and my staff in the other I threw myself on the bed and said Mr Thistlewood my name is Bishop an officer of Bow-street I have a warrant against you - he said I shall make no resistance His coat and waistcoat were by the bedside in the pocket of the waistcoat I found three leaden ball a ball cartridge a blank cartridge two flints and a small silk sash I took him into custody and conveyed him to Bow-street Cross-examined by MR ADOLPHUS Q How did you find out where he was - A In consequence of information which came to me from an officer - it was not from Edwards I know no such person RUTHVEN here produced the whole of the arms &c JOHN HECTOR MORRISON re-examined This is the sword I first sharpened for Ings - looks at the sword Since I ground it it appears to have been sharpened on a stone to help the keenness of the edge TAUNTON here produced the two baskets and ammunition found at Brunt s with their contents as stated in the former trial also those found at Tidd s G T J RUTHVEN re-examined Q Were the firearms found at Cato-street loaded - A Most of them were loaded with ball - one or two had been fired off S H HANSON I am a sergeant in the Royal Artillery - examining the fire-balls - they are composed of oakum tar and rosin If they were thrown into any building they would be sure to set it on fire - they would set wood on fire if they were thrown on a floor they would set a house on fire if thrown into a hay-loft some of them would burn three or four minutes The flannel bags of gunpowder are cartridges for a six-pounder It is the way powder is made up for loading cannon Q Now take one of the hand-grenades to pieces and shew us what it is composed of - he does so - A The exterior is a tight binding of rope-yarn and tar which would make the explosion much greater - if loose it would not have half its effect Under it is a binding of woollen cloth or stuff cemented on very fast and this encloses cart-tire nails under this is a tin case containing 3 1/2 oz of powder which is lit by means of the fusee It would explode and disperse the nails about like so many shot - the binding would make the explosion much stronger JURY Q Could anybody manufacture them without being connected with the army - A Yes It is nothing like our army grenade - it is not made like it by any means The effect would be very dangerous the nails would fly about killing and maiming those in the room There is a piece of blanket round The fusee is brazed on and each end brazed in It is very good gunpowder and has rather more powder than we put to burst a nine-inch shell MR ATTORNEY GENERAL My Lords this is the case on the part of the Crown MR CURWOOD rose and addressed the

through drinking or gambling I sent my wife back to Portsea and I myself set up a butcher s shop in Baker s-row I stopped in it from Midsummer to Michaelmas and the summer being hot it was very much against me and I lost a considerable deal of money I then took a house in Old Montague-street and turned it into a coffee-shop but it did not turn out to my expectations A man frequently came to take a cup of coffee who used to enter into conversation about Government and the Manchester massacre I took very little notice of him suspecting him to be an officer and I had nothing to do with politics After I had left the coffee-shop I was in Smithfield looking for work and met this man He said I ought to stand treat as he had often been to my house I said it was not in my power as I had no money and if I did not get work I must sell my few things He asked me what I had to sell I said a sofa bedstead and various other articles He asked me what it was stuffed with saying he should like to buy it He went to my lodgings looked at it and said it did not suit him - this was early in January In a few days I met him in Fleet-market he said he had a friend who would give me more for the bedstead than anybody else and took me to his friend near my lodgings but he would notbuy it so we went back to Fleet-market and he told me there was something to be done and asked me if I would make one I said I did not know what was to be done He said no good man wanted to know what was to be done till it was begun he then took me to the White Hart and introduced me to my fellow prisoners He told me that his name was Williams but I never knew the particulars of what they were going to do because they did not wish to trust me as a stranger and I meerly went there for food On that very day I carried a sword to be ground for him and left it in my own name If I thought any thing had been going on do you suppose Gentlemen that I should have left a sword in my own name Is it reasonable I had no idea at the time that any thing was going on I met him frequently afterwards and kept him company as I got victuals and drink in the room and there was a fire On the 23d he came to me at my lodgings in Primrose-street but did not find me there I met him in Bishopsgate-street that morning He said Something is going to be done if you come up the alley opposite Mrs Carlisle s about six o clock I shall be there I went to the room in the course of the day and got some bread and cheese and about six o clock I went to the alley where he was waiting for me - I understood that he lived at a side door in the alley He gave me a couple of bags a belt and a knife-case and asked me to come to the room in Fox-court which has been mentioned and he and I went away together He told me the bags were to put some gin in that had been got by the sly which was the reason I put them under my coat that the people might not stop me and discover where I got the gin I went up by St Giles s Church where we were to get the gin but he said it was not there We went up Oxford-street and about half way up he turned round and told me to wait there for him I waited for him near an hour he then came back and took me to John-street to the stable where the arms were he said he was going to call on a friend and told me to stop there a moment When I came under the archway I saw Davidson who took me into the stable and he went up the ladder I heard great confusion in the loft and kept down I declare positively that I was never up in the loft I waited below about five minutes when the officers came in - Mr Ruthven and somebody came in and two went up to the loft a third collared me said You are my prisoner and began beating me about with his staff till my head was swelled dreadfully I heard the report of a pistol upon which he let me go ran out and I followed him out into the street - an officer followed me and I ran off I met a man in the street with a stick who hit me violently on the head but I got from him ran round another way and the watchman stopped me - I was taken to the watch-house This is all I know of the meeting but the man who got me there has been at all the meetings and planned everything that has been done He has not been called and I am sold like a a bullock in Smithfield depend upon it The Attorney General knows the same and knew all these plans for two months before I heard a gentleman say when I was before Lord Sidmouth that his Lordship knew of this four or five weeks ago I consider myself murdered if this man is not brought forward but he is put on one side I am ready and willing to die with him if he will die with me for he was guilty of every thing and the inventor of the plot if it be a plot I do not value my life if I could get a living for my family for I have a wife and four children I was drawn into it I cannot describe my feelings to you for my wife and family and I hope before you return your verdict you will have this man brought forward or I shall consider myself a murdered man Edwards is the man who came to my house - he came to get acquainted with me I never was at any meeting I am accused of being at a public-house I never was at any except the house in Brooks-market I attended no meeting since Christmas I never was at any of the Radical meetings in London I hope you will weigh it well in your minds before you return your verdict The evidence planned all this to get out of the halter themselves they would hang their God I believe - Adams would but sooner than I would be the instigation of hanging a man I would die if I had five hundred lives The Jury retired at twenty minutes past eight o clock and at a quarter before nine returned and found the prisoner GUILTY - DEATH On the First and Third Counts Before Lord

Limehouse builder John Smith of John-street Oxford-street undertaker John Woodward Upper-street Islington gentleman The prisoner was given in charge of the Jury and the following evidence called - ROBERT ADAMS I am now in custody Before I was apprehended I lived at No 4 Hole in the Wall-passage Brooks-market I was a shoemaker I was in the Royal Horse Guards eighteen years ago I know the prisoner Brunt I first became acquainted with him at Cambray in France in 1815 he then went by the name of Thomas Morton the British army were then quartered there - I followed my trade among them Q Do you remember calling on Brunt early in the present year - A Yes at his lodgings in Fox-court Gray s Inn-lane he is a boot-closer He introduced me to Thistlewood on Wednesday the 12th of January at Thistlewood s lodgings in Stanhope-street Clare-market - Brunt and Ings went there with me Brunt said Here is the man I was speaking to you about Thistlewood said You belonged to the Life Guards formerly did you not I said I did not I belonged to the Oxford Blues He said No doubt you are a good soldier I said I once was He said You can use a sword well I said I could sufficient to defend myself but not so well as I originally could as I had not used any arms for a long while On this he turned the discourse to the shopkeepers of London and said they were a set of Aristocrats altogether all acting under one system of government and he should glory to see the day when they should have all their shops shut up and well plundered He next turned his discourse on Mr Hunt saying Hunt was no friend of the people and he had no doubt if he could enter Whitehall and look at the books but he should find his name there as a spy for Government - that Cobbett with all his writings was no friend to the people and he had very little doubt but he was a spy the same as Hunt Brunt said he had a couple of men to call on towards Carnaby-market and asked Thistlewood to walk with him to see the men but he did not go A few words dropped from Brunt to Thistlewood about attending a raffle for a brass-barrelled blunderbuss - I do not recollect that Thistlewood said he should go Brunt and Ings came away leaving Thistlewood there Q I believe sometime after this you was imprisoned for debt in Whitecross-street prison - A Yes I came out of prison on Sunday the 30th of January and saw the prisoner on Monday the next day I first saw him at Hobbs s the White Hart - I saw him in the evening in the room where he was taken on the same floor on which he lived - I had heard him say that he took that room for Ings I attended several meetings in that room Q Up to what time did you attend these meetings - A Up to the 23d of February from the time I came out of prison they were held twice a day Q Who usually attended - A Thistlewood Brunt Ings Hall Harrison who had been in the Life Guards Davidson Edwards Wilson and Tidd who lived in the next house to me in Hole in the Wall-passage he is a shoemaker I saw Palin there on Sunday the 20th of February but not before I saw Potter there before that Hall is a tailor Q After you came out of prison what passed at these meetings - A I called on the Monday evening several of them were there Nothing particular passed then On the Wednesday following I attended a meeting in the back room - Thistlewood Brunt Davidson Harrison and Edwards were there I saw a number of pike-staves there There was no furniture except a stove which was fixed the chairs were brought from Brunt s room The staves were rough and quite green as if they had just come from the country I saw Bradburn who was there cut the ends of the staves off and putting on the ferrels - he cut off one end of each pike-stave - there were a dozen of them It was considered that the ferrels were too small for boring the holes and the pike-staves would not be strong enough to support them They were cut off again and larger pike-staves put on Bradburn had instructions to buy the ferrels but did not Brunt brought them afterwards and put them on - they were larger and deeper Q Do you recollect being there a short time before the funeral of the King - A Yes I found Thistlewood Harrison Davidson and Wilson there Harrison told Thistlewood that he had seen one of the Life Guards who told him all the Life Guards that could be mounted were to attend the funeral as well as all the Foot Guards and police officers that could be spared - Harrison had been in the Life Guards He said that after the Life Guards had left it occurred to his mind that it would be a favourable opportunity to collect what men they could besides themselves and kick up a row in London as he thought all the officers soldiers and what not would be out of London and that there would be none left in London to protect it On his coming into the room he communicated his thoughts to Thistlewood and it meeting with his ideas he proposed that the two pieces of cannon in Gray s Inn-lane and the six pieces in the Artillery Ground should be taken the same night and after this was done they thought it highly necessary to send a party to Hyde Park to prevent any orderly man being sent from London to Windsor to communicate what was going on in London At the same time the telegraph over the water was to be taken to prevent any intelligence being sent to Woolwich as to what was going on - he thought at the same time it would be necessary to cut entrenchments across the road to prevent any cannon being brought from Woolwich to London Q Who said all this Thistlewood - A He said that the soldiers would be so knocked up and have to come so far that they would not be able to do any thing in protecting the country Here Thistlewood for the first time which I can vouch for said there must be an offer made to the soldiers in order to bring them over If the soldiers refused to accede and determined to act against them Harrison proposed they should enter the houses and fling hand grenades into the streets among the soldiers to destroy them as fast as possible Thistlewood proposed that men should be sent to the different sea-ports such as Dover Brighton Margate and different places with an express order that nobody should leave the country without an order from the Provisional Government or their towns should be blown down over their heads He mentioned particularly that as soon as they could collect force enough which he had no doubt they should to send a large force down to Brighton in case the new King should be there after the riot was kicked up which he did not suspect he would on account of his indisposition Q What was to be done at Brighton - A It was to be plundered and then Thistlewood said as to the King being crowned that was all nonsense as he did not intend that should be After that Ings and Brunt came into the room Thistlewood told them the conversation that had passed Brunt and Ings both declared together that nothing short of the assassination of ministers would satisfy them Q Had Brunt before told you of any plan to assassinate the ministers - A Yes he told me of it in his own room on the 2d of January before he introduced me to Thistlewood He said it was to be done the first time they met together at a cabinet dinner Q Did anything farther pass on their declaring that nothing short of the assassination of his Majesty s ministers would satisfy them - A That was the night when Ings said he had been to the Park with the sole view to assassinate the Prince Regent when he went to open Parliament He produced a pistol from his pocket held it out and said D - n my mortal eyes that is the pistol I took Q Do you recollect a meeting that took place on Saturday the 19th of February - A Perfectly well I saw Thistlewood Brunt Harrison Wilson and Ings there - it was between eleven and twelve o clock in the morning I cannot say whether Davidson was there On my going into the room they sat with their heads together as if they were in consultation about something I soon found out what it was They got up all of a sudden and Thistlewood said Well it is agreed that if nothing transpires between this and Wednesday night we intend to go to work as we are all so poor we cannot wait longer He proposed directly that a committee should be appointed to meet on the following morning Sunday at nine o clock to draw up a plan to act upon - this was agreed to and he gave orders to Brunt to tell all the men that came that it was necessary to come armed Brunt said It is a parcel of nonsense for any officers to come here and d - n it if they do they will be murdered and I will take good care to secure them afterwards that they shall never be found out Prisoner Can that man look me in the face and state that with a clear conscience - A I can MR GURNEY Q Look at the prisoner and the Jury and say if what you have said is true - A It is a fact I had left them in the room I had seen a sword and hand-grenades in the room previous to this some of which were made in the room and I have seen pistols pulled from their different pockets - they were moved from there to Tidd s lodgings which was the depot Thistlewood wished them to be removed there that they might be safe that if any one should come into that room they should have no suspicion what they were there for As Brunt is the man that has denied what I have said he is the man that carried the principal part of the hand-grenades there I followed him myself into Tidd s room saw them with my own eyes lying on the floor and saw Tidd s daughter put them into the box under the window Q Did the meeting take place on Sunday - A Yes Thistlewood Ings Hall Brunt Harrison Davidson Edwards Bradburn and Cook were there three others came afterwards there were twelve in all Thistlewood looking round and seeing there were twelve in the room said Well gentlemen we may as well proceed to business here is enough to form a committee Tidd was proposed to take the chair Q Was he there when you first went in - A Yes I might not have mentioned him but I recollect he was present he took the chair and order being called for - Thistlewood stood on the right of Tidd he said Well gentlemen as we are all met here turning to the door there is no occasion to mention names you all know what you have met here for and as there is no likelihood of their meeting together we are come to the determination if nothing occurs between this and Wednesday night to take them separately He then proposed that at the same time that the West End job as he called the assassination was done the two pieces of cannon in Gray s Inn-lane and the six pieces in the Artillery Ground should be taken and that Palin should take the command of another party in order to set fire to the different buildings Cook was appointed to head the party who were to take the cannon from the Artillery Ground - he was at the meeting Thistlewood said there would be sufficient time between this and then to fix the time and he thought forty men would be enough for the West End job but more if they could get them and as to the farther particulars of the plan it would do at another time as Brunt was coming forward with a motion respecting the assassination how it was to be done Brunt came forward but was prevented by Thistlewood s saying his motion should be put from the chair and if any person should wish to say anything upon it he should speak The motion was put and agreed to by all in the room Brunt came forward and proposed that as there was no prospect of their taking them altogether that they should be taken separately and it was to be done in this manner - As many men as could be collected were to be divided into as many parties as there were persons that they would assassinate When these men were so lotted he proposed that a man should be drawn from each lot for the purpose of assassinating whoever they might be appointed to and if the man did not execute his duty from any appearance of cowardice he should be run through on the spot Upon this I got up and asked him if he thought it not possible for a man to attempt to do a thing like this and fail and did he mean that man to be run through on the spot He said Certainly not unless there was a proof that that man was a coward - I then sat down The motion was put from the chair and carried in the same way as the other Directly after Palin Potter and Strange came in and what had passed was communicated to them after Palin had consented to the plan he got up and addressed himself to the chairman saying Agreeing as I do with what has been said I wish to know how the thing is to be done as you talk of so many objects at one time If they can all be carried I think it would be a great acquisition to what we have in view but this is what I want to know You talk of forty or fifty men for the West End job the two pieces of cannon in Gray s Inn-lane to be taken and the six in the Artillery Ground and you propose to me and my men to set fire to the different buildings - you ought to know better than myself what men you can command I for my own part can give no satisfaction as to what men I can bring forward unless I am entrusted by this committee to state to them what has passed in this room this morning If I can tell the men what they are going about and when they will be wanted I shall know better how to act It was agreed by Thistlewood Brunt and Tidd that if he thought he had men he could have confidence in they did not see where the harm could be in making the communication On this Palin sat down satisfied - nothing more particular passed while he was in the chair After the chair was left Thistlewood turned round and said Oh Brunt now Palin is here you can take him to that place just by and let him see whether that thing is practicable or not Brunt and Palin went out together to examine the place whether Palin thought it was practicable to do it They returned in about ten minutes and Palin gave in word that it was a very easy job and would make a good fire - it was Furnival s Inn I had heard Brunt tell Thistlewood before that that heand Tidd had found that place out to set fire to - the building was then going on I believe the back is not yet finished Fox-court is very near the back Some of them began to separate saying they had men to call on to tell them when they would be wanted Thistlewood said Brunt I think you had better between this and the time of going to work collect together what men you can and give them a treat Thistlewood said he did not know how it was to be done for they were all so poor Brunt said D - n my eyes I have a 1 l note which I have saved from work and reserved for the purpose of treating my men and I will do it Thistlewood said he did not know where they could take them to and said he supposed they could have the room up stairs at Hobb s which is the White Hart where some meetings had been held before they had the room at Brunt s Brunt said he did not like to go there from what had dropped from my mouth as to the communications I had made then said Never mind as time gets so near I don t see what we have to fear If any officers come into the room I will take care of them - we separated shortly after Another meeting was held on Monday and on Tuesday morning Q What time was that - A About ten o clock The prisoner was there and Thistlewood Ings Hall Wilson Harrison Edwards Bradburn Palin Potter and myself - after they had met Edwards came in and communicated to Thistlewood that there was an account of a cabinet dinner in the paper to be on Wednesday night the next night at Lord Harrowby s in Grosvenor-square Thistlewood said he had seen a paper that morning and saw no account of it but in order to satisfy the meeting he proposed that the paper should be fetched Hall fetched it - it was the New Times and it turned out as Edwards had said It was then proposed by Thistlewood that a committee should sit directly to alter the plan of the assassination which was proposed on Sunday Harrison and Davidson came into the room at this interval Davidson brought in a bag of musquet balls and Harrison some powder While the paper was sent for Ings pulled out three daggers and said he had prepared them for the sole purpose of assassinating the ministers by themselves and taking it in his hand he said how he intended to do it using a very coarse expression Thistlewood proposed me to take the chair Q Before you took the chair do you remember Brunt saying any thing after the paper was brought - A Yes On the news being communicated he said D - n my eyes now I believe there is a God in calling these thieves together it has often been my prayer that they might all meet together and now God has answered my prayer Q Then Thistlewood proposed a committee and that you should take the chair - A Yes I did and Thistlewood came forward to propose a plan I called to order and said Gentlemen before you proceed any farther I hope you have given a due consideration to what fell from my mouth on Saturday morning - I had informed them that Hobbs at the White Hart had told me that two officers had been there saying there was something in hand more than there ought to be and that they had information of it at Bow-street and Lord Sidmouth s office Palin said he wanted some explanation of it On that Brunt got up said they should have an explanation and communicated to them nearly the same as I had After that he proposed that in order to do away with this there should be a watch set on Lord Harrowby s house two men were to go on the watch at six o clock and stop till nine then to be relieved by two others who were to stop till twelve the watch was to commence again next morning at four o clock and to continue till the evening when they intended to go to work The watch was to see who entered Lord Harrowby s house and if any soldier or police officer entered they were to communicate it to the committee and if no one was seen to go in it was determined the work should be done to-morrow night On this being done Brunt picked out the men for the purpose but I cannot state who they were Davidson and another were the first to watch and Brunt and Tidd were to relieve them from nine to twelve o clock On this Thistlewood came forward and said if there was proof that no soldiers or officers entered the house he proposed a plan to take them altogether He proposed that he himself should enter Lord Harrowby s door with a note in his hand to deliver to the servant saying he must have an answer to it the others were to rush in directly afterwards and seize the servants present a pistol at them and threaten them with instant death if they made any resistance Two were to go and take command of the stairs leading to the upper part of the house and two those leading to the lower part each were to have hand-grenades pistols and cutlasses and if the servants attempted to escape the hand-grenade was to be thrown in among them - one with a blunderbuss and another with a grenade were to be placed at the area After they had secured the servants Ings proposed himself to enter the room first to be followed by two swordsmen I was one and Harrison another Ings said that on going into the room he should say Well my Lords I have as good men here as the Manchester Yeomanry enter citizens and do your duty On this they were to enter the room Ings having his large knife and swearing he would cut their heads off as fast as he came to them Q Did he mention the heads of any persons in particular - A The heads of Lords Castlereagh and Sidmouth he was determined to bring away in two bags that he had provided for the purpose and one of Lord Castlereagh s hands which he intended to cure preserve as it would be thought a great deal of at a future day I wish to state one circumstance for fear it should slip my memory Ings said that when he had got the heads of Lords Castlereagh and Sidmouth he would exhibit them on a pole about the streets Thistlewood improved this plan he thought it would be better to put them on a pike and place them behind the cannon and carry them about the streets as they would terrify the people Bradburn said after they had been exhibited he would enclose Lord Castlereagh s in a box and send it to Ireland Q After they had done at Lord Harrowby s what was to be done - A Harrison was to go to the barracks in King-street and set fire to the straw with a ball which was prepared for the purpose - Wilson was to go with him from there they were to proceed to Gray s Inn-lane to theCity Light Horse barracks and take the two pieces of cannon there - they were to meet a party there they were then to proceed to the Artillery Ground unless any thing occurred to the contrary meet Cook there and take the six pieces of cannon that were there load them and bring them into the street and if Cook found himself strong enough by people joining them he was to proceed to the Mansion House and take it as the seat of the Provisional Government The cannon were to be arranged three on each side and if they refused to give it up they were to fire into it on each side The Bank was to be attacked and taken if possible and plundered but Thistlewood said the books were not to be destroyed that they might be able to see some of the proceedings of Government that they were not in possession of Thistlewood and Cook agreed among themselves that if Cook found himself able to go to the Mansion House he was to send an orderly man to St Sepulchre s church to wait the arrival of an orderly man from Thistlewood at the west end of the town and they were to return to their separate parties to give instructions to each other how they were situated Q Do you remember Harrison saying any thing about a countersign - A He proposed that there should be a countersign agreed on for the men who were to go round to the different persons to communicate to them that they would be wanted on Wednesday night The party were to go up to a man who was to be stationed at the end of Oxford-street and say B U T he was to be considered one of the party and the man was to answer T O N and inform them where the place of meeting was which Harrison was to procure and they were to be conducted to that place Q Did you go to Fox-court again in the afternoon of that day - A I did and on going up stairs I perceived a strange smell and on going into the room I saw Ings Hall and Edwards - Edwards was making fusees for the hand-grenades Ings was dipping the stuff for the fire-balls into a pot of ingredients for that purpose and Hall was laying a paper on the floor to receive the balls after they were dipped into the pot I left the room and called again in the evening I found Thistlewood there and two strange men whom I had not seen before In the course of the evening they were pretty well all there Q Davidson was to go on the watch at six - A Yes and Brunt and Tidd started for the watch at nine They called at a house where Tidd expected to meet a man and finding him there he went with Brunt and Tidd staid there When I got to Grosvenor-square I found Davidson on the watch and relieved him Brunt and I went into a public-house at the corner of a mews directly at the back of Lord Harrowby s and staid there from about a quarter-past nine o clock till about eleven Brunt played at dominos with a young man who was there - about eleven o clock we returned to watch at the square and left at twelve I had gone out of the house twice to watch Q Now on Wednesday did you go to Fox-court - A I did about two o clock and went into Brunt s room and found him there Strange came in first and two or three more whom I do not know I saw pistols in the room they began to put flints into them and on the strange men coming in Brunt proposed to go into the other room which they all did I saw pistols cutlasses and a blunderbuss there Thistlewood came in just after he looked round and said Now my lads this looks something like and looks as if something was going to be done - He clapped his hand on my shoulder and said How do you do Mr Adams I said I was not very well and was very low in spirits He said What is the matter you are not low in consequence of what you are going to do I said I wanted refreshment By order of Thistlewood Brunt sent out for some gin and beer - Ings Hall and other strangers came in soon after Thistlewood said he wanted some paper such as newspapers were printed on to draw up some large posting bills but he did not know the name of it I proposed cartridge paper and he gave Brunt money to fetch it Brunt sent out for it and it was brought Thistlewood sat down to write after a table and chair was brought from Brunt s room He wrote three bills and read them as follows Your tyrants are destroyed the friends of liberty are called upon as the Provisional Government are now sitting - James Ings Secretary 23d February 1820 They were written in large letters In writing the third bill he said he was tired and appeared rather agitated they were to be stuck up by the buildings that were to be set fire to to let the people know what was to be done Thistlewood proposed that Hall should take the pen he refused another man took it he wrote something which Thistlewood dictated but it was not finished Q Before that did Ings do any thing - A He first put a black belt round his loins to contain a brace of pistols then hung one on his shoulder for a cutlass he put a bag across each shoulder like a soldier s haversack On viewing himself he perceived he had not got his steel and said he thought himself not complete he produced a large knife with a very broad blade the handle had waxend bound round which he said was to keep his hand from slipping but he had prepared the knife for the sole purpose of cutting off the heads of Lords Castlereagh and Sidmouth Q Did the others in the room do any thing with the weapons that were there - A They all took an active part in preparing themselves with cutlasses pistols and different things Thistlewood and Brunt left the room about five o clock Palin came in and said he hoped all present knew what they had met there for he hoped they had considered what they were going to do and wished them to inform themselves whether the assassination of ministers was likely to benefit the country - and if they thought so and that the people would come over to them in consequence of it they ought to come to a determination to stick one to another and if any one was in danger to assist him He said if any flinched that man ought to be run through He was here interrupted by a tall man in the room who said I can see pretty well the meaning of your speech but you speak as if all in the room knew what you were going to do that is what I and some others want to know I am not afraid of myself nor ought any man to be afraid of his life who turns out in a thing like this Palin was going to speak but Brunt returned to the room and seeing an alteration in the countenances of the men wished to know the cause - he asked what was the matter The tall man said that himself and others wanted to know further what they were going to do Brunt saidthis is is not the time for you to know if you will go with me to a room in the Edgware-road there you shall know and I will take care that all who go with me shall have something to drink to put them in spirits The tall man said he hoped no man going on such business as this would get drunk as by so doing he placed himself in the hands of the enemies Q Was there any cupboard in the room - A There was I have seen a sword in it and tallow and pitch and oakum and materials for the fire-balls the hand-grenades were kept there till they were removed Q Who did you go away with - A I went down stairs by myself and was followed by some strange man I took a blunderbuss and a broom stick which had been prepared for a bayonet this was Brunt s I met Thistlewood and Brunt in Edgware-road they took me to the stable in Cato-street I found Davidson there sitting down and Wilson standing up I went up to the loft and found several men there The stable is the first building in Cato-street which is a little street turning out of John-street under an archway at the further end of the stable is a ladder which leads to the loft and in the loft was a carpenter s bench with pistols and cutlasses on it There was one candle on the bench - I laid my blunderbuss on it On Thistlewood looking round he said there was another room and one below Thistlewood Brunt Ings Hall Bradburn Davidson Wilson Harrison Strange Cooper Tidd and others were there Tidd was not there at first - they were all arming themselves Thistlewood went down stairs and I went after that and found in the stable Thistlewood Brunt Davidson Harrison and Wilson - I am not certain of Ings When they saw me coming down the ladder they turned round and said what good news they had got there were six or seven carriages arrived already at Lord Harrowby s and Brunt said What a rare hawl we shall have to-night He proposed that a double sentry should be put at the stable-door and nobody admitted up unless he gave the countersign He went up to the loft and Brunt perceiving that some fear was expressed at Tidd s not coming he said There is no occasion for any fear and I will venture my life that Tidd will come Ings said he would cut his throat or hang himself if they thought of dropping the concern now Thistlewood said he hoped they would not drop it for if they did it would turn out another Despard job Soon after I found Tidd in the room but I did not see him enter the room Thistlewood had some conversation with him he went to the table and said Suppose Lord Harrowby has eighteen servants what is that they will not be prepared and we are There are eighteen in the room and two below stairs which is twenty in all He proposed fourteen men should be picked out of the twenty to go into the room Thistlewood and Brunt began to pick them out On this being done Brunt introduced the gin-bottle offered me a glass and called me among the fourteen Some time before that Brunt finding the men rather apprehensive that they had not strength enough he said We have got things here that will blow the house down over their heads So bent am I on doing the job that if there are only eight or nine men I am determined to go and do it even if there were only five or six to go I will be one and if I find myself in danger I will set fire to the things and blow the house down over their heads After the men were picked out and the gin gone round I heard a noise below and some one at the bottom of the ladder cried out Halloo shew a light Thistlewood took a light from the bench and looked down to see who they were turned himself round set the candle down and seemed rather confused The officers ascended the ladder and came to the loft To the best of my recollection the first words were Here is a pretty nest of you gentlemen we have got a warrant to apprehend you all and as such hope you will go peaceably Another officer who was on the ladder behind the two which were on the top cried Let me come up He came forward Those who were on one side of the loft sidled into a little room On the officers coming into the loft the others in the room rushed towards the doorway Thistlewood was in the room I saw an arm rush from the crowd and at that moment I saw a pistol fired off - the candle went out directly the pistol was fired There was a great deal of confusion I went down the ladder into the stable and got away I went home to my lodging directly I never left it until I was apprehended on Friday morning nor ever laid my hand on the latch of the door Cross-examined by MR CURWOOD Q I think you said the last time you came here that you went home and repented of your iniquities - A I did and before that my mind was convinced I was wrong and after the murder the conviction was stronger Q You once did not believe in Christianity - A Till I received that cursed publication from Tidd I was as particular as most people about religion That book and the principles the prisoner endeavoured to instil into my mind made me a Deist His intent was to knock down the pillars of Christianity Q And you helped him to knock down the pillars of Christianity - A To my shame I did I am between forty-six and forty-seven years of age I feel a satisfaction at making an atonement to my Maker Q Did you feel a satisfaction at murdering sixteen individuals in cold blood - A I can appeal to God that my mind was always against it - I thought it inconsistent to reason altogether I had a doubt in my mind whether Brunt was as he ought to be for I was once going with Thistlewood and him to Carnaby-market and he told me that he met a man who shook hands with him and filled his hand with seven 1 l notes Brunt told me on the 2d of February in the street of the design to murder the ministers I went once with three others with the sole intent to put a stop to it - Palin was one I never saw him till the Monday Q Edwards was there very regular and constant - A Yes I saw him pull two pistols out of his pocket and I saw him manufacturing the grenades There was no regular committee on Sunday morning We went by no particular name Q Why not put a stop to it by making communications to proper persons - A I did not wish to put them to any danger MR GURNEY Q What perverted your mind - A Paine s Age of Reason and the publications of Carlisle ELEANOR WALKER I am niece and servant at No 4 Fox-court Gray s Inn-lane the prisoner lodged theretwelve months in the two front rooms on the second floor He introduced Ings to take the back room on the same floor Ings said he might bring his goods in in a week or better but never did The lodgers enter in at the side door and go up and down without us knowing it MARY ROGERS I live in Fox-court I remember a man taking the back room at 3 s per week and afterwards found his name to be Ings He paid for four or five weeks and left one unpaid One night when I was putting the children to bed I saw three men go up one of them was a a black man Brunt said he knew nothing of Ings only from seeing him at a public-house and hearing him enquire for a lodging I understood him to be a butcher - he never slept there JOSEPH HALE I am apprentice to Brunt and lived with him in Fox-court he lived in one room and the other was the workshop Ings came and took the back room Brunt looked at it told him it would do and to go down and give 1 s I knew Ings for a fortnight before that I have seen him with Thistlewood in Brunt s room On the evening the room was taken Ings came and asked Mrs Brunt for the key of the back room which she gave to him and he went in with Hall who was a tailor In the course of the evening I heard persons go up stairs and into the room The meetings were held there from this time till my master was apprehended Q Can you name some of the persons who visited there - A Thistlewood Ings Tidd Hall Davidson Brunt Bradburn Strange Edwards Potter and Adams There were others at different times - my master was generally with them Once when I passed the room door was open and I saw about twenty long poles like the branches of trees rough cut and with the bark on them - the meetings were mostly in the evening I have heard hammering and sawing going on in the room more than once They called Thistlewood T and sometimes Arthur Q On the Sunday morning before your master was taken up was there a meeting - A Yes it was rather larger than usual all those I have named were there They went away one or two at a time - my master was with them I saw Strange in my master s room after the meeting was over There was another meeting on Monday and Tuesday Q In the afternoon of Wednesday was there another - A There were several people up there some of them came into the front room I remember Thistlewood and Ings coming in Strange was there about two o clock and some persons with him They first went into the prisoner s room that he lived in and then into his workshop and there they were flinting five or six pistols They did not finish them there for one of the men said persons were overlooking them on the opposite side Brunt told them to go into the back room and they did In the course of the afternoon Thistlewood came out and asked me for a piece of writing-paper which I gave him and he took it into the back room After that Brunt came out and sent me for some cartridge-paper and gave me the money I fetched it and gave it to Brunt who took it into the back room About six o clock Brunt left the back room and came into his own room - another person was with him whom I do not recollect they went away together - I had heard others go down stairs before that After my master was gone my mistress told me to go and fetch the tea-table from the back room I knocked at the door Potter opened it and gave it out to me I saw four or five others in the room and there was a fire Q In the course of the evening did Tidd call - A Yes he came into my master s room Mrs Brunt took him to the cupboard and shewed him a pike-head and a sword and asked him what she should do with them he said he would take them away and did so - he took them into the back room Between seven and eight o clock I heard some persons go down stairs and after that a person came in and told Mrs Brunt that if any person called they were to be sent to the White Hart public-house Potter came with some others soon after and I sent them there - they knew the way My master came home about nine o clock his boots and great coat were very muddy - he seemed rather confused and told his wife that it was all up or words to that effect and said where he had been a lot of officers came in and he had saved his life and that was all Another person came in soon after I do not know his name Brunt shook hands with him and asked him if he knew who had informed the man said he had had a dreadful blow on the side and was knocked down - they spoke as if they had been together Brunt said there was something to be done yet and they went out together My mistress went to the cupboard in the back room and found several rolls of brown paper with tar and oakum four large balls made of string and cord which I have since heard called hand-grenades and an iron pot which belonged to Brunt I found some bags made of bits of flannel and two of them were full of something - there was also a large pole in the room My master came home about eleven o clock and told me to get up early and clean his boots - I did so He then asked me if I knew Snow s Fields I said No and he directed me to Kirby-street Snow s Fields to a person of the name of Potter and said he had something in the back room for me to take there we went into the back room took each a rush basket and he told me to put the things that were in the cupboard into the basket they were all put in except the pole and iron pot One of them was tied up in a blue apron of Mrs Brunt s which had been used as a curtain to the window of the back room We went into Brunt s room to look for something to tie the other in when two officers came in and took him and the things THOMAS SMART I am a watchman of St George

Sun public-house at the corner of the mews and Grosvenor-square I saw Brunt and Adams come in they had a pot of beer and some bread and cheese Brunt challenged me to play at dominos with him - we played two games I left them about ten o clock EDWARD SIMPSON I am corporal-major of the Life Guards Harrison was once in that regiment and was in King-street barracks - they are only barracks for horses not for men - he was perfectly acquainted with them There were windows which looked into Gloucester-mews which have been stopped up since the affair in Cato-street Fire could easily have been thrown into them There were two or three loads of straw within four feet of the window JOHN HECTOR MORRISON I am journeyman to Mr Underwood cutler in Drury-lane On Christmas Eve last Ings brought a sword to be ground it was a small scimitar I have seen it since in the officer s possession He ordered it to be ground sharp from heel to point and also at the back He called for it about three days after and approved of it About a fortnight after he brought me another sword much longer than the first He said the first was ground to his liking and I was to grind this in the same manner He left it in the name of Ings as I understood him - he came for it himself JAMES ALDOUS I am a pawnbroker The prisoner Davidson pledged a brass-barrelled blunderbuss with me in January and redeemed it on the 23d of February I have since seen it in the possession of Ruthven JOHN MONUMENT I am a prisoner in the Tower I lived at No 8 Garden-court Baldwin s-gardens near Brooks-market About three months before I was apprehended I saw Thistlewood at a person s room of the name of Ford He called on me about a fortnight after in company with Brunt - my mother and my brother Thomas Monument were with me After they had been in the room sometime Thistlewood said he wished to speak to me and I went out of the room with him leaving Brunt in the room with my brother Thistlewood said great events were at hand the people were everywhere anxious for a change He had been promised support by a great many men who had deceived him but now he had got men who would stand by him He then asked me if I had any arms I said No He said Every one ought to have arms - all of us have got arms Some have a pistol some a pike and some a sabre and you may buy a pistol for about 4 s or 5 s I said I had no money to buy pistols He said he would see what he could do He returned to the room Thistlewood and Brunt went away together On Tuesday the 22d of February Brunt and Tidd called on me my brother was with me I said I thought I had lost you He said The King s death has made an alteration in our plans I asked what plans he said there was to be a meeting on the following evening at Tyburn turnpike where I should hear all the particulars He then turned to Tidd and asked him whether he should give me the word Tidd said Yes he supposed there was no danger He told me when I came to Tyburn turnpike if I saw people about I was to say to them B U T and if they were friends they would say T O N He said he should be at our house again in the morning and tell me more about it and at what time it was to take place He did not call next morning but came about half-past four o clock alone He called me down stairs and told me I must go with him in half an hour - I said I could not go so soon he asked why I said I had some work that must be done He asked what time I could go I said at six o clock He said he could not wait so long and I must go with Tidd the person he brought with him the day before he said he lived in Hole in the Wall-passage leading into Brooks-street I went to Tidd s about half-past six o clock and found him at home He said he had been waiting for some more men to go with him whom he expected to be there but if nobody came before seven we should go together - nobody came He went to the corner of the room took a pistol and put it into a belt which he had under his great-coat he wrapped up eight pike heads in a piece of brown paper and took a staff about four feet long which had a hole at one end adapted to receive a pike-head We went out and along Holborn into Oxford-street When we got into Holborn he gave me the pike-heads to carry and in Oxford-street I asked him to tell me where we were going he said I should know when I got to the place - I had asked him before we left the room and he said we were going to Tyburn turnpike to a mews by the Edgeware-road I asked him if we were going to the House of Commons he said No there were too many soldiers there I then asked again where we were going to he said to Grosvenor-square I asked if any one in particular lived there he said there was to be a cabinet dinner there Q Did you go under the archway - A Yes Two persons were there - Tidd was a few steps before me he spoke to them I went into the stable three or four men were there - Tidd went in with me there was a light below I went up the ladder at the further end of the loft I found twenty-two or twenty-three people Some one asked Thistlewood about counting them he said there was no occasion for there were twenty-five There was a quantity of swords and pistols on the bench I observed only one light there A man in a brown coat who sat on a chest at the end of the bench was speaking of the impropriety of going to Lord Harrowby s with so small a number as twenty-five men Thistlewood said that number was quite sufficient for he only wanted fourteen men to go into the room and supposing Lord Harrowby had sixteen men-servants that number was quite sufficient The man in the brown coat said When we come out there will be a crowd about how are we to make our escape Thistlewood said You know the largest party are already gone Davidson told him not to throw cold water on the proceedings for if he was afraid of his life he might go they could do without him Brunt said that sooner than they should go from the business he would go into the house by himself and blow them all up if he perished with them He said You know we have that which will do it The man in the brown coat said that though he did not like going with so small a number yet as they were all for it he would not be against it He proposed that they should put themselves under the orders of Thistleword Thistleweod said every one engaged with him should have equal honour with himself He then proposed that fourteen men should volunteer from the persons present to enter the room Twelve or thirteen volunteered to go and went to the other side of the room Q Give us the names of some of those that volunteered - A Tidd Brunt Davidson and Wilson were among them Thistlewood stepped down stairs came up again and said they had received intelligence that the Duke ofWellington and Lord Sidmouth were just arrived I do not recollect anything more passing Two or three officers came to the top of the ladder and told them they were officers and desired them to surrender saying there was a guard of soldiers below I was taken into custody in the loft Cross-examined by MR CURWOOD Q I suppose you read Paine s Age of Reason - A Yes it did not drive me from Christianity because the Bishop of Landaff s answer was with it It rather shook my faith but the answer made up my mind Q How long have you known Brunt - A I never saw him till Thistlewood brought him I never saw Thistlewood but once before except at a public meeting I did not know what they were going about I thought they were going to attack the House of Commons Q To murder the members - A I do not know Q Did you not say before this they told you there was a cabinet dinner and then you was fully convinced what they were going about - A Yes I certainly thought it was to destroy the persons assembled I was forced to join them from fear Q Why not retire when they told the other man he might - A I should have been loth to take him at his word THOMAS MONUMENT I am brother of the last witness I remember Thistlewood coming to the house one evening with Brunt Thistlewood asked if he could speak with him He and Thistlewood went out of the room Brunt remained behind In two or three minutes they returned to the room Brunt and Thistlewood left together On the 22d of February Brunt called again in company with a man named Tidd my brother said I thought I had lost you Brunt said the King s death had made an alteration in their plans My brother asked what plans he said they had different objects in view Brunt asked Tidd if he should give us the plan I do not know whether Tidd made any answer but Brunt gave us the pass-word We were to go to Tyburn turnpike the next evening and if we saw any men about we were to say B U T and if any of the party were there they would answer T O N I was asked to go I neither refused or consented I suppose they expected me but they chiefly directed their discourse to my brother Next day Brunt called again between four and five my brother said he could not go just then Brunt told him when he was ready to call on Tidd at Hole in the Wall-passage He left and my brother went out about seven o clock I never saw him after JOHN MONUMENT re-examined Q Do you remember being at Whitehall - A Yes I was handcuffed to Thistlewood Brunt was in the room and the other prisoners waiting to be examined Thistlewood said When I came to be examined before the Privy Council to say that it was Edwards that led me to the meeting and that it was through Edwards that I came there I said how could I tell that falsehood when he knew I never saw the man He said that was of no consequence if they were to ask what sort of a man he was I was to say he was not much taller than myself and a sallow complexion and dressed in a brown great coat We were seated round the room Thistlewood told me that Edwards was the person who betrayed them and to pass it round the room to the other prisoners I said I should be noticed and he leant over to Bradburn who sat next to me but Bradburn took no notice of what he said He then leant over the other way to another and spoke to him I never saw Edwards THOMAS HIDEN I have carried on business as a cow-keeper and dairyman in Manchester-mews I am now a prisoner for debt I was arrested a week ago last Saturday I know the prisoner Wilson perfectly well Q Did he make any proposition to you - A He met me a few days before the 23d and asked if I would be one of a party to destroy His Majesty s ministers at a cabinet dinner he said they had got all things ready and were waiting for a cabinet dinner and that they had got such things as I never saw He said they were large things bound round with tarpaulin and cords and filled full of nails iron and other things and that they were very strong If they were set fire to they would heave up one of the walls of the opposite house in the street we were walking in that they meant to light up a few fires by setting fire to some houses and by keeping the town in confusion for a few days it would become general He said these things were to be put into the room where the gentlemen were at dinner and all that escaped the explosion were to die by the edge of the sword or some other way Q Did he mention any houses they were to set fire to - A The Duke of Wellington s Lords Harrowby Sidmouth and Castlereagh s and the Bishop of London s and one more which I cannot remember He said they should depend on me to make one and I said I would Q Before the 23d did you write to Lord Castlereagh - A I did and went to his lordship s but could not get access to him I watched about Lord Harrowby s house two or three times and at last saw him come out of his house I followed him to the Park and delivered him the letter I wrote to Lord Castlereagh This is the very letter looking at it Q Next day who did you see - A Between four and five in the afternoon I was going up Manchester-street with one of my little girls and met Wilson he said Hiden you are the man I want to see I said Wilson What is there going to be He said There is a cabinet dinner tonight at Lord Harrowby s in Grosvenor-square I asked where they were going to meet he said I was to go up into John-street to the Horse and Groom public-house and stop there or at the corner of the post till I was shoved into a stable close by He said I was to meet them at a quarter before six or six o clock and if I did not make haste the grand thing would be over before I came I asked how many were coming He said about twenty or thirty I asked if that was all He said there was another party in Gray s Inn-lane another in the Borough another in Gee s-court in the City I do not know which He said I had no occasion to be alarmed for all Gee s-court were in it I believe that court is inhabited by Irish people - it turns out of Oxford-street He said the Irish were all in it but they would not act till the English began as the English had so often deceived them Q Did he mention what place the party were to go to - A He said a party were to go to Lord Harrowby s and do the grand thing then all parties were to meet inin the neighbourhood of the Mansion House He said there are two pieces of cannon in Gray s Inn-lane which could easily be taken by knocking in a small door and that there were four more pieces in some artillery ground which were easy to be got at by killing the sentry I then left him Q Did you go to John-street that evening - A I did between six and seven o clock I take it to be near seven When I came to the gateway by the Horse and Groom I met Wilson and Davidson I knew them before and had conversation with them Wilson said You are come I said yes but I am behind the time Davidson said If you are going in Thistlewood is there I asked at what time they meant to go away from there as I must go and get some cream He said they meant to leave that place about eight o clock and if they were gone before I came I was to follow them down to Grosvenor-square I parted from them at the fourth house from the corner Cross-examined by MR CURWOOD Q How long had you known Wilson - A Five or six months I was a good deal with him at a master tailor s I went twice to the meeting of the shoemakers club I was introduced there by my friend Clark - it was on two Sunday evenings Q You never attended their private meetings - A Never I know a man named Burt but I never persuaded him to attend a meeting When my friend Clark called on me I said I dare say Mr Burt would go He knew Clark as well as I did Q Did you not invite him to go to attend this club and tell him that something was to be done for the good of his country - A I cannot say that I did Q He will be called to contradict you did you not say so - A I cannot say that I did I asked him to go but cannot say that I said anything more I did not know of the meeting at Cato-street till the 23d when I met Wilson I made a communication to Lord Harrowby before that Q Did you not inform his Lordship the place where the meeting was to be - A I did not I wrote the letter myself THE RIGHT HON THE EARL OF HARROWBY I am one of the Privy Council and one of His Majesty s Ministers Here his Lordship named the Honourable Personages composing the Cabinet Q Do these noblemen and gentlemen hold what are called cabinet dinners - A They do In consequence of the death of His late Majesty the dinners were suspended I intended to give a cabinet dinner on the 23d of February and ordered cards of invitation to be issued on the Friday or Saturday preceeding Q Before the 23d of February did your Lordship see Hiden - A I saw him in the Park on Tuesday the 22d of February I believe between two and three o clock in the afternoon He gave me a letter directed to Lord Castlereagh - this is it - looking at it - I had some conversation with him and asked him if he had put his name and address in the letter he said he had not and gave me a card of his name and address I saw him by appointment next morning in the ring in Hyde Park as he seemed fearful of continuing in conversation with me at Grosvenor Gate I passed him at Grosvenor Gate told him to go in and I would meet him at the ring which I did Q Was the dinner held at your Lordship s house - A It was not but the preparations were carried on as if it was to take place and between seven and eight o clock I wrote to the principal servant from the Earl of Liverpool s informing him that the cabinet would not dine there The persons I mentioned are Prime Ministers and employed in the administration of the affairs of Government - they form the Cabinet Council JOHN BAKER I am butler to the Earl of Harrowby By his direction I sent out invitations to a cabinet dinner to be held on the 23d of February I issued cards on Friday or Saturday the 18th or 19th - I believe it was on Saturday On Wednesday evening about eight or ten o clock at night I received intimation that the cabinet would not dine - up to that time the preparations went on I believe some carriages arrived at the Archbishop of York s which is next door between six and seven o clock RICHARD MUNDAY I live at No 3 Cato-street I know the stable in the street On the 23d of February about three o clock in the afternoon I saw Harrison go into the stable I came home about twenty minutes past four o clock and saw Davidson walking up and down by the archway for some time I got my tea came out and went to the chandler s shop then went to the public-house came out for a necessary purpose and saw Davidson pass me with two candles in his hand it might then be ten minutes past six o clock - he lit one of the candles at a woman s at No 1 I saw two persons go into the stable and three come out in the course of the afternoon Before Davidson went in I saw three go in and then saw one go in to him When I came home in the afternoon I heard a knocking over the stable door - they were nailing some sacking over the window which would prevent people from seeing into it - the stable had been unoccupied since Christmas GEORGE CAYLOCK I live at No 2 Cato-street On the evening of the 23d of February I saw Harrison in Cato-street I knew him before - I saw him go into the stable He said he had taken two chambers there and was going to clean them up I saw from twenty to twenty-five people going in in the course of that evening G T J RUTHVEN I am a constable of Bow-street On the 23d of February I went to Cato-street I got there about half-past six o clock with three officers and was afterwards joined by more I went to the Horse and Groom and while there Cooper and Gilchrist came in Cooper brought a mop-stick and left it there which I took away and have had ever since I entered the stable about half-past eight o clock and observed a man with a gun on his shoulder and a sword by his side walking backwards and forwards apparently as a sentinel - I do not know who he was I called to the party who followed me to secure him I went up the ladder and on entering the loft I found several men I saw a bench with arms swords and pistols on it and heard the clashing of arms Ellis and Smithers went up with me I saw Thistlewood in the room - he stood on the right side of the bench as I went up - I knew him before On my going into the loft I said We are officers seize their arms Thistlewood drew a sword from the bench and retreated aside to the small room there was a light in the loft and in the little room he stood fencing with the sword Smithers advanced towards him when Thistlewood put his arm forward andstabbed him Smithers fell back exclaiming Oh God I am done or I am killed I do not know which - he died immediately A pistol was fired and the lights put out immediately In the corner of the room where Thistlewood had retired to I heard a voice say Kill the b - g - rs Throw them down stairs There was a rush towards the stairs I joined in the cry and got down with them On going out I met the soldiers in John-street returned and saw Tidd about eight or nine feet from the stable door - he appeared to be endeavouring to get away I told somebody to seize him and he lifted up his arm as if to fire I saw a pistol in his hand laid hold of the arm in which he had the pistol and swang him round fell upon a dunghill and he upon me the soldiers came up directly - the pistol went off and he was secured I searched him in the Horse and Groom and found a leather belt round him and two ball cartridges in his pocket Bradburn was brought in and I searched him he had a string round his waist four or five times as a belt also six ball cartridges and three loose balls in his breeches pocket Davidson and Wilson were brought in and searched but not by me Q When Davidson came in what passed - A He d - d and swore at any man who would not die in liberty s cause - he gloried in it He also sung part of the song Scots wha hae wi Wallace bled &c Wilson said he knew it was all up and they might as well knock him on the head now I returned to the loft found several soldiers some of the police officers and four of the prisoners Q After the candle was put out in the loft was there any firing - A Yes I should think twenty or thirty shots were fired in the loft some of them were fired out of the window - there is no doubt but they proceeded from the party in the loft they were not from other parts I am not aware that any of us had gained the top except myself Ellis and Smithers I attempted to fire but my pistol missed Ellis fired once Smithers did not fire JAMES ELLIS I am conductor of the Bow-street patrol I went with Ruthven to Cato-street and was close to him On entering the stable I saw a man between the foot of the ladder and the door - he had two white belts across his shoulders in his right hand a carbine and in his left a long sword I took him by the collar turned him half round and observed he was a man of colour - he was tall and stout I believe it to be Davidson There was another man between the manger and the foot of the ladder in the further stall he had a dark-coloured coat on and appeared shorter than the man of colour Ruthven mounted the ladder I followed him and heard some person below say Above men as I thought but I heard the word men On getting to the top of the ladder I observed a number of men falling back from the bench towards the wall I observed lights on the bench and some arms I saw Thistlewood in the loft at the end of the bench with two or three more between that and the door entering to the little room he had a sword in his hand which he held at me and shook it in a threatening attitude I desired him to desist or I would fire at the same time I presented a pistol he backed into the little room Smithers followed me up the ladder and by the time I gained the top of the ladder he went forward towards the door Thistlewood made a push with his sword and stabbed him in a near the right breast he staggered exclaimed Oh my God and fell I instantly fired at Thistlewood but without effect The moment I fired the lights were put out and a rush made towards the ladder I was forced down stairs and went to the door - two shots were fired from some part of the stable and passed me in the doorway I saw a man fire from the ladder towards the manger - I do not know who it was There were some shots fired from the window towards the door where I stood as if they were pointed downward at those who came out of the door I heard a cry of stop him and saw a man of colour running pursued and took him a direction towards Queen-street - it was Davidson he made a cut at me just as I closed with him but not after he had a carbine in his hand and a sword by his side I found three or four of them in the stable Wilson and Monument were two the others I do not know WM WESTCOAT I am a Bow-street officer I accompanied the other officers to Cato-street Ruthven Ellis and Smithers went up the ladder I observed Ings at the further end of the stable I had a contest with him - while this was taking place I heard a firing and confusion in the loft The officers came tumbling down after this I saw Thistlewood come down he presented a pistol at my head and fired I put up my left hand and the ball went through my coat grazed the skin of my arm and went through my hat I made a rush to lay hold of him received a blow on my head and fell - he rushed out of the stable door and escaped I afterwards went up and found Smithers dead JOHN WRIGHT I am a Bow-street patrol I accompanied the other officers to Cato-street and afterwards assisted in securing Ings I had a conflict with him in the stable and took a butcher s knife and a sword from him - the handle of the knife was wound round with wax-end I was knocked down and received a stab in my side and he escaped - he was taken soon after JOSEPH CHAMPION I am a Bow-street patrol I was at Cato-street on the 23d of February and saw Ings standing at the foot of the ladder he called out Look out above Westcoat was endeavouring to secure him After I came from the ladder I heard a noise and on looking down I saw part of a man s body in the hay-rack I went to the rack and made the person get into the loft again - I do not know who he was Several shots were fired from up stairs I saw Thistlewood running up Cato-street waving his sword as be went along - during this time Ings had escaped I pursued him into the Edgware-road found him in the custody of a watchman and Wright We took him to Marylebone watch-house searched him and found two haversacks slung under his great-coal one under each arm I found a tin case of gunpowder and in his pocket four pistol-balls a pistol-key and a cloth case for a large knife CAPTAIN FITZCLARENCE I am a Lieutenant of the Coldstream Guards On the 23d of February I was applied to and went with a piquet to Cato-street I got to John-street about six o clock and met a police officer who called out Soldiers soldiers the door-way the stable I went on and met two men at the door one of whom presented a pistol and the other cut at me - I parried his cut we exchanged several cuts He seeing the body of thepiquet coming up ran into the stable I followed him and on entering the stable I ran against a man who cried out Don t hurt me and I will tell you all I gave him over to the piquet and ran up into one of the stalls of the stable where I took another man and gave him to the soldiers I then led the men up the ladder into the loft where I found three four and five men and a quantity of arms - the soldiers came up and took them into custody The body of poor Smithers laid on the floor SAMUEL HERCULES TAUNTON I am a police officer of Bow-street On Thursday morning the 24th of February I went to Brunt s lodgings and apprehended him between seven and eight o clock in the morning in the front two pair of stairs room I left him in custody of another officer and went and searched the back room I found a quantity of fire-balls grenades and other things in two baskets I returned to the front room and questioned him about them he said he knew nothing of them I sent for Mrs Rogers the landlady and enquired who occupied the room she said some man took it in company with Brunt I asked Brunt who that man was he denied any knowledge of him only from seeing him once at the public-house We then proceeded to Tidd s and found more grenades cartridges and balls DANIEL BISHOP I am an officer of Bow-street I apprehended Thistlewood on Thursday morning the 24th of February between ten and eleven o clock at No 8 White-street Little Moorfield s at the house of Mrs Harris He lodged in Stanhope-street Clare-market His wife and son lived there Adjourned SECOND DAY TUESDAY APRIL 25 Examination resumed G T J RUTHVEN produced the several quantities of arms and ammunition &c found in the stable and loft in Cato-street and on the persons of the different prisoners with the butcher s-knife which exactly fitted the case found on Ings JOHN HECTER MORRISON Here is the sword I first ground for Ings among those produced S H TAUNTON produced the two baskets found at Brunt s with their contents as produced on the former trials also with the ammunition &c found at Tidd s G T J RUTHVEN re-examined The arms were for the most part loaded when I found them at Cato-street I drew the charges before I brought them here They were all loaded with ball except a gun which was loaded with shot S H HANSON I am a sergeant in the Royal Artillery The powder bags are in imitation of a cartridge for a six pounder There is exactly a pound of powder in each and very fine powder Our artillery bags are made with serge and not flannel but these would answer the same purpose The fire-balls are composed of oakum tar rosin and brimstone If thrown into a building a light they would set it on fire They would burn three or four minutes It would produce a conflagration in the barracks The steel filings are part of the composition for the fusee The hand-grenade is a composition of rope-yarn tared wound round a tin-can containing three and a half ounces of powder which is more than sufficient to burst a nine-inch shell Our military grenades are made of metal but these would answer the purpose The harder they are bound the stronger the explosion would be here the witness dissected one This has twenty-five pieces of iron intermixed with the binding They would fly about the room like so many shot and if thrown into a room with fifteen gentlemen at dinner would prove destructive to the lives of many The explosion would take place half a minute after lighting the fusee Messrs CURWOOD and ADOLPHUS addressed the jury on behalf of the prisoner who made the following Defence My Lords and Gentlemen of the Jury I have a few observations to make respecting the evidence particularly of Monument It is quite useless for me to deny being in the room in Cato-street I do not intend to deny it but immediately on the arrival of Monument he approached me when he saw the arms and asked What was going to be done I replied that I was not aware that any thing was going to be done for that Edwards had not brought so many men by thirty as he stated he could bring and it was not my intention to endeavour to do anything with so few men Monument betrayed a great deal of fear and I persuaded him to go away There has been a considerable stress laid upon a number of men volunteering to go to Lord Harrowby s this I totally deny I will admit when Thistlewood addressed himself to the few men there he said they would not act he urged the necessity of going to act or it would be a Despard job Then some few men went into a small room but they never came to the determination to go the house They were endeavouring to find fourteen or fifteen men desperate enough to go to the square which I am certain they could not have done I am not so far desperate as to go to meet instant death On the other hand I wish to call your attention to two other circumstances first Adams states in order to implicate me more deeply than any other except Thistlewood that I said if there was only eight men I would go to the room and blow the house about their cars This is my Lords false Then Monument comes forward and declares I said I would go by myself and bury myself in the ruins Is this consistent Is this sufficient evidence my Lords to deprive a man of life - a son of a father - and a wife of a husband I wish to advert to another circumstance while a prisoner in Coldbath-fields when I came out of my room to the fire I saw Monument Strange Cooper and Bradburn Monument came slyly to me sat himself down by my side and whispered these words What did you say when you was before the Privy Council I said I knew nothing of the matter This induced me to ask him what he said I could say nothing said he You told me nothing Why did you not tell me more I said Was it possible for me to tell you what I did not know myself You know very well that when it was declared that every man should go into small room that would go on this desperate affair I declined Adams was the man that wanted to go to the house and him among the rest a man whom I know to be a villain and whohas come to my house two or three times I am no traitor I was determined that rather than betray a fellow-creature I would be racked on the wheel Now my Lords I will advert to a circumstance that occurred to me at Cambray my life is placed in the hands of twelve honest men it becomes me to state every thing beneficial to myself and my fellow-prisoners While I was in France I met Adams - I was a boot-closer - I assisted in closing boots for him and learning him what I could he became jealous of me and threatened to take my life and declared to his wife that if she did not make an open declaration that if she spoke to me her life was in danger he would murder her - this she did If enquiry was made nothing treasonable will be found against me while I was in the Coldstream Guards I went from Cambray to Lisle where I had worked for eighteen months together with a Mr Pulsford I obtained a little money there and came to England My wife heard that me and my son were assassinated in France and she lost her senses After I returned she came out of St Luke s and I obtained work from a master who turned out to be a relation of my apprentice who has come here to take my life he is held up as a respectable witness I will advert to some circumstances concerning his family it must be well recollected that John Hale the brother to the very man who apprenticed the boy to me who had a warehouse in Ironmonger-lane and under false pretences swindled the merchants of London out of 100 000 l and it was by a chain of circumstances I knew of what descendants the boy is I can prove he has been a villain to me The relation of his whom I worked for asked me to take him apprentice I had him on liking and could not avoid taking him as my bread depended on it or I wished not to take him I was promised seven years work with him but shortly after he was bound I was thrown out of work by his relation reducing my wages twice and I would not put up with it I went to live in Fox-court and as fast as I got work this boy spoilt it purposely About eighteen months ago my wife was not very well and I took a lodging a little way out of town and this boy robbed me of a book He was in the habit of going about thieving I can bring two boys to prove that he stole a steel from a butcher s shop He was charged in Gray s Inn-lane with robbing a gentleman of his watch and was taken to a public-house who knew me and said the gentleman must be mistaken for he knew his master well and he was liberated I do not know that it is altogether to the present question but two years and a half ago he had a brother under sentence of death in this very prison He sold the steel for 3 s 6 d and told me he sold it for 2 s 6 d I hope the Jury will well weigh his evidence I know nothing of Hiden I wish to advert to Edwards who was the first individual who drew me into it This Edwards I first saw in company with Thistlewood at the White Lion in Wych-street he shortly afterwards called on me at my lodgings in Fox-court I was short of work He called on me two or three times a day long before the room was taken When he called if I was not at home he would call again and if I was gone to a shop for work he would come after me and wait outside - this was the case at a person s house named Scott who saw him outside and said Why does be not come in This man harrassed me and even at times supplied me with money I can bring evidence to prove that he has endeavoured to drag them into the plot and told them he had a great opinion of me but I am no traitor my Lord He considered me as a man capable of being drawn into a plot and as such the more fit to be betrayed He has called with me and treated people at public-houses This was his constant practice from day to day for two months till the day I was apprehended I declare before God he is the individual who drew me into it and not Thistlewood From the different favours I received from him I certainly had a good opinion of the man When the officers came to Cato-street I made my escape the best way I could though not as a coward or a traitor I did not desert my companions I went to Grosvenor-square where this villain who will probably be the means of my being sent into another world was - I told him what had happened he seemed surprised and left the square with me Shortly after up came Thistlewood and another person who was in the room - he has not been taken nor ever will We left the square - he took us into several wine-vaults to drink merely as I suppose to identify us I had not long been in my room before a man came in and said he had received a violent blow on his side but my apprentice forgot to state that Edwards came on the stairs and called us out again We then went into Holborn and met Palin and then went to a wine-vaults opposite St Andrew s church Holborn Edwards paid for three glasses of gin and we came out Edwards called me aside and said he wished to speak with me He began to find fault with me for drinking with Palin and declared he was the man that had betrayed us all and that he was unworthy to live He declared that he had prevented ten or twelve men from coming to Cato-street whom he had depended on and that he sent Potter to wait in Grosvenor-square We walked as far as Little Britain and when we came to a dark place where he said Cook lived he again urged me respecting Palin who was very much intoxicated He said the safest way would be to put Palin out of the world and urged me to assassinate him He put his hand in his pocket and pulled out a brass-barrelled loaded pistol and offered me a sword-stick and said if we put him out of the world every thing would be safe He shewed me a constable s staff and said I will act in the same capacity as I did in Grosvenor-square If any alarm should be raised I will act as an officer and nothing shall happen I said If you are convinced Palin is a villain the weapon is in good hands Finding he could not prevail on me he said I must wish you good night for I am going to conduct Mr Thistlewood to a secret place As he had been intimate with Thistlewood I thought him the most proper person I was determined not to know where they went to and wished him good night but not without receiving an admonition from him He came and whispered to me and told me that Palin and Potter had done nothing that was entrusted to them and that the things were taken to the back room in my lodgings and asked me to have them all tied up in the morning and to send my boy with them part to Palin s and part to Potter s in the Borough with intent as I have no doubt to take their lives I tied them up as my apprentice said but afterwards altered my mind thinking that if they wanted them they might send for them Thisis all I know of the plot Edwards is the man who went about to different old-iron shops to buy swords and pistols and procured money to purchase the ammunition This I declare before that God in whose presence I shall shortly appear Monument is a spy for Government But if I die I will not die unworthy the name of an Ancient Briton Sooner than I would betray a man I would suffer a thousand deaths The Jury after twenty minutes consultation found the prisoner GUILTY - DEATH

charge of the Jury MR GURNEY stated the case and called the following evidence ROBERT ADAMS I am a shoemaker Before I was in confinement I lived at No 4 Hole in the Wall-passage Brooks-market I was in the Royal Horse Guards I left the army eighteen years ago I first became acquainted with Brunt at Cambray in France in 1815 - the English army were at that time there - I followed my trade among them I saw Brunt early in the present year at his lodgings in Fox-court Gray s Inn-lane - he was a boot-closer He proposed to introduce me to Thistlewood in consequence of which on Wednesday the 12th of January I accompanied him and Ings to Thistlewood s lodgings Brunt said to Thistlewood This is the man I was speaking to you about Thistlewood said You were in the Life Guards I said No I was formerly in the Oxford Blues He said I presume you are a good soldier and after that a good swordsman I said I once was and could use a sword now to defend myself but it was a long while since I had used a sword or arms of any description He turned his discourse on the different shopkeepers saying they were a set of Aristocrats altogether and were working under one system of government and he should glory to see the day when all the shops would be shut up and well plundered He then said Mr Hunt was a d - d coward and no friend of the people and he had no doubt if he could get into Whitehall to see the books he should find his name in them as a spy for Government and that Cobbett with all his writings was of no good to the country and that he had no doubt he was a spy equally with Hunt Brunt said he had to call on two men in Carnaby-market and wanted Thistlewood to to go with him - Thistlewood refused Brunt spoke to Thistlewood about a blunderbuss that was to be raffled for and asked him if he should be there - to the best of my recollection he said he should On this we left Q Had Brunt at any time stated to you any plan - A Previous to my going to Thistlewood Brunt told me there was a plan drawn up by two or three and he had no doubt if I would consent to join them that it would meet my approbation The plan was to assassinate the ministers the first time they met together to dine He also said We have got good information where the thieves keep their money which amounts to upwards of three millions all in hard specie and after we have done this we intend to go to that place and well plunder it Sometime after I was in Whitecross-street prison for debt and came out on Sunday the 30th of January Q After you came out of prison did you go to a meeting in Fox-court - A Yes on Monday evening in a back room on the second floor on the same floor in which Brunt lived I heard Brunt say he hired that room for Ings - there was nothing in it but a stove which was fixed We continued to hold meetings there twice a day except on Sunday evenings up to the 23d of February Q Who usually attended these meetings - A Thistlewood Brunt Ings Hall Davidson Harrison Wilson Bradburn and Edwards and Tidd occasionally I do not remember any more at this moment Q Can you tell us what passed at the meetings - A On the Wednesday night after I left prison I went to the room and saw Thistlewood and Harrison and in the course of the evening Ings Tidd Wilson and Edwards were there When I went in Thistlewood and Harrison had been in deep discourse about information which Harrison had received They said he had met a Life Guardsman who told him that all the Life and Foot Guards that could be mounted were to attend the King s funeral as well as the police officers and he said that after he left the Life Guardsman it came to his mind that it would be an excellent opportunity to kick up a row in London Thistlewood agreed to the plan and proposed that it should be done by collecting what men they had among themselves and taking the cannon in Gray s Inn-lane and the Artillery Ground and fire balls were to be made use of to set fire to the different buildings thinking it would be an excellent opportunity as what police officers and soldiers were left in London would not be sufficient to protect it Thistlewood said it would be necessary to send a party to Hyde Park Corner to prevent any orderly man leaving London for Windsor to communicate what was passing He also proposed that the telegraph over the water should be taken to prevent any communication being sent to Woolwich the plan met the approbation of those who were assembled After that Brunt and Ings came in and Thistlewood communicated the plan to them Brunt and Ings declared that nothing short of the assassination of the ministers which they had in view should satisfy them In consequence of this the project was given up Q Now do you remember a meeting which tookplace on Saturday the 19th of February - A Yes Thistlewood Harrison Brunt Ings and Hall were there On my going into the room they seemed in a study among themselves They got up and Thistlewood said Well it is agreed upon that if nothing happens between this and Wednesday night on that night we will all go to work as we are all so poor we can wait no longer He gave instructions that a committee should sit the next morning at nine o clock to draw up a plan how to act I left them there and went to the meeting next morning which was larger than usual the prisoners at the bar were both there - I got there about eleven After being in the room a little time Thistlewood said there were twelve of us and it was time to proceed to business He proposed that Tidd should take the chair which he did with a pike in his hand Thistlewood began by stating that they were come to a determination that if nothing happened between that and Wednesday night they were determined to go to work for they had been waiting so long expecting the ministers to dine together and if they did not dine together between that and then they would take them separately On this he began to propose that the two pieces of cannon in Gray s Inn-lane and the six in the Artillery-Ground should be taken and Palin was to take on himself to set fire to the different buildings - he was to be assisted by men that he was to collect himself This Thistlewood said was the outline of the plan and as Brunt had something to propose respecting the assassination he should leave him to speak On this Brunt came forward but Thistlewood stopped him saying let my plan first be put from the chair and if any one has any thing to say respecting it let him speak - it was then put and agreed to by all present Brunt came forward and said As we cannot get the ministers altogether and it is agreed to take them separately I propose that we shall get as many as we can collect and they should be separated into different parties and from each party a man should be drawn to do the deed or murder and if the man the lot fell to attempted it and did not do it if there was any sign of cowardice that man should be run through directly On that I got up myself and asked him if he thought it not possible for a man to attempt a thing of that kind and fail and was he to be run through on the spot He said No unless there were signs of cowardice this motion was put from the chair and agreed to Directly after this in came Palin Potter and Strange what had passed was communicated to them by Thistlewood and Brunt and they agreed to it Palin got up and addressed himself to the chairman saying I wish to say a few words I have paid attention and agreed to what has been proposed but I should like to know how the things are to be done as so many things are to be done at one time You talk of the West End job taking from forty to fifty men Thistlewood had mentioned from forty to fifty men to do it Q What was the West End job - A The assassination of the ministers You talk said he of taking the two pieces of cannon in Gray s Inn-lane and the six pieces in the Artillery Ground and my taking my part with the fire party I want to know how this is to be done you ought to know what men you can depend on better than I do but I can give no satisfaction what men I can get at I wish to know If I may have instructions from here to communicate to the men what has passed this morning It was agreed between Thistlewood Brunt and Tidd that if Palin could depend on his men he was at liberty to communicate to them what he thought proper - on this he sat down satisfied the chair was then left and they were pretty well all standing when Thistlewood suddenly turned round and said Oh Brunt well thought of now Palin is here you may as well take him to that spot close by and see whether it is practicable It was Furnival s Inn the back part of it is not finished yet - the back is by Fox-court They went out returned and Palin gave in word that it was a very good job very easy to be done and would make a good fire Thistlewood said it was highly necessary to get the men together and give them a treat but then said he did not know how it was to be done for they were all so poor On that Brunt turned round saying he had a 1 l note which he had reserved for the purpose and though he had done little or no work lately he would be d - d if he would not spend it on his men Thistlewood said Where shall we take them to I suppose Hobbs will have no objection to let us take them up stairs Brunt said he did not like that in consequence of what had fallen from me but then said Never mind we can go there as our time is getting so short I don t see what we have to fear from the traps Meetings had been held at the White Hart before I went to prison On second recollection Brunt said he could give his apprentice and boy a holiday send his wife out and have what men they could collect at his lodgings Q After that you separated now tell us if you had seen any arms in that back room at different periods - A Yes I had seen pike-staves in their rough state the ends were just cut Bradburn sawed the ends of them off and put ferrels on - holes were bored in them for the pike-heads After the ferrels were put on it was thought the staves would be too weak to support the pike they were again cut and larger ferrels put on Some hand-grenades were brought there ready made and some were made in the room I have seen Davidson and Harrison making them There was a tin case and some pitch melted in an iron pot and wound round with nails They were afterwards carried to Tidd s which was called the depot Q Who suggested that they should be removed - A Thistlewood said nothing should be kept in that room that if any one came into the room it might not give any information of what was going on and so they were removed to Tidd s Q Do you recollect a meeting on Tuesday morning the 22d - A Yes a meeting was held in the same room about ten o clock Thistlewood Brunt Ings and Hall were present and just after Edwards came in and stated that there was an account in the paper of a cabinet dinner to be held on the next day Wednesday at Lord Harrowby s in Grosvenor-square in consequence of this Hall fetched the newspaper by which it appeared the information was true upon this Brunt said Now d - n my eyes I believe there is a God I have often prayed that these thieves may be collected together that I might destroy them and now God has heard my prayer Ings was equally alive to it On this Thistlewood proposedthat a committee should sit directly to alter the plan of assassination that had been agreed to on Sunday Thistlewood proposed that I should take the chair I did so and called to order Thistlewood was going to speak I interrupted him and said Gentlemen I hope you have given a due consideration to what fell from my mouth on Saturday That was the communication I had made about Hobbs On this Brunt and Harrison threatened that the first man that attempted to throw cold water on the proceedings they would run him through on the spot On this I opened my coat and said Harrison if you think I am not a friend to you or any man in the room you may do it now On this Palin got up surprised at what I had said Hall and Potter were in the room Palin insisted on some explanation being given to what I had said before the business proceeded Brunt got up and said he would tell the whole he communicated to them what I had said and proposed that Lord Harrowby s should be watched Davidson was to go on the watch at six o clock with another Brunt and Tidd were to relieve them at nine The prisoners were both in the room at this time The watch was to see if any police officers or soldiers entered the house and if so to report to the committee - if none were seen to go in Brunt insisted that the business should be done that night This was settled and Thistlewood proposed that Tidd should take the chair in consequence of my interruption to the business - he took the chair Then Thistlewood came forward and proposed that himself should go to Lord Harrowby s door with a note in his hand for Lord Harrowby telling the servant he must have an answer the others were to rush in after him and secure the servants present pistols at their breasts and threaten them with instant death if they resisted They were to take the command of the stairs leading to the bottom and top of the house and two were to be stationed at the area These men were each to have a hand-grenade and if any servants attempted to make their escape a hand-grenade was to be thrown in among them to destroy them Ings proposed himself to take the lead in the room and as soon as he entered he was to address their Lordships by saying Now my Lords we have got as good men as the Manchester Yeomanry - enter Citizens and do your duty The two swordsmen were to follow - I was one and Harrison who had been in the Life Guards the other they were to be followed by other men Ings declared he would cut off every head as he came to them - he was a butcher He proposed also to cut off one of the hands of Lord Castlereagh and bring it away with the heads of Lords Castlereagh and Sidmouth and said he would preserve the hand as it would be thought a good deal of at a future day Harrison proposed that he himself should go to King-street barracks and set fire to the shed where the straw and hay are kept COURT Q Was any further use to be made of the heads - A Ings proposed that they should exhibit them about on a pole Thistlewood said the best way would be to put them on a pike-head and carry them behind the cannon to terrify the people and make them believe there was something of more consequence than they were aware of Bradburn said after Lord Castlereagh s head had been exhibited for two or three days he would make a box and send or take it himself to Ireland Q Well Harrison was to set the barracks on fire - A Yes he was to be supported by Wilson - the others were to go to Gray s Inn-lane and if any persons interrupted them they were to run them through They were to take the cannon and then proceed to the Artillery Ground and take the six pieces of cannon headed by Cook who was to load them and bring them into the street and if he was interrupted he was to fire on the people but if he found himself strong enough by people joining him he was to proceed to the Mansion House and demand it and if it was refused he was to fire on both sides Thistlewood proposed that the Mansion House should be the seat of the Provisional Government Q Cook was not to be of the party at Lord Harrowby s - A No After they had got the Mansion House they were to attack the Bank and plunder it but to preserve the books as Thistlewood said they would communicate something more than they were aware of That was all that passed material Davidson went on the watch at six o clock It was proposed that those assembled should go round to the different men to communicate the purpose they had in view Harrison proposed the word Button should be a countersign A man was to be stationed at the end of Oxford-street and the men were to go up to him and say B U T - the man in waiting was to say T O N which would shew they belonged to the party Davidson and the other man went on watch at six o clock Brunt and Tidd set off to go on the watch at nine Brunt returned in about five minutes saying Tidd had called at a house where he expected to find a man and he had met him that he was a man of too much consequence to be neglected and Tidd must stop with him and I must go with Brunt instead of Tidd I saw Davidson there We continued on the watch from nine till twelve o clock - we were not in the square all the time We went to a public-house in the neighbourhood at the back of the square at the corner of the mews Brunt played at dominos with a man there We went out about eleven o clock and stopped about the square till twelve and went home directly We found all quiet Q Do you remember going to Fox-court that afternoon - A I did I was going up stairs and perceived a strange smell I found Edwards Ings and Hall in the room making the illumination balls - Edwards was making touch-paper for the fusees Hall was laying paper on the floor to receive the balls as Ings took them out of the iron pot I went away almost directly Q Next day Wednesday you did not go very early to the room - A No I went about two o clock and found Brunt in his own room Strange came in alone and afterwards two or three others whom I did not know Some pistols lay on or in the drawers they were endeavouring to fix the flints to them On the last two coming in Brunt proposed that they should go into the other room which they did and I went also Ings came in in the course of the afternoon The different persons were busy in fixing flints to the pistols and slings to the cutlasses Thistlewood came into the room looked round and said This looks something like as if you were going to work He clapped his hand upon my shoulder and asked how I did I said I was very unwell and very low in spirits - he sent for something to drink Shortlyafter this Thistlewood proposed that paper should be sent for as he wanted to draw up some bills He said he wanted such paper as newspapers were printed on but he did not know the name I proposed to send for cartridge-paper Thistlewood gave Brunt the money and he said his apprentice or boy should fetch it - he went out for the purpose The cartridge-paper was fetched a table and chair were brought out of Brunt s room and Thistlewood sat down and wrote these words - Your tyrants are destroyed the friends of liberty are invited to come forward the Provisional Government is now sitting - James Ings Secretary Feb 23 1820 As he wrote the third bill he appeared much agitated said he could write no more and proposed that Hall should take the pen he refused - another strange man was proposed who afterwards took it The bills were to be stuck up near the different buildings that were to be set on fire to communicate to the public what had been done Q When the bills were wrote what was done - A Ings equipped himself he put a black belt round his loins another round his shoulder and a couple of bags like soldiers haversacks under his great-coat The belt round his loins was to contain a brace of pistols and the other the cutlass On viewing himself he found he had not got his steel He had a large knife with wax-end round the handle He was asked what it was for he said it was wound round to prevent his hand from slipping at the time he was cutting their heads off - he said he prepared it for that purpose About this time Bradburn came up and wished Thistlewood to send some person to the men he had collected together to send them to the spot where they were to meet Tidd as appointed he was not willing to go and said as they were Irishmen he thought one of their own country would be better than an Englishman he at last consented Brunt and Thistlewood left the room Palin came in and seeing they were out of the room he said Gentlemen I hope you all know what you have met here for and hope you will consider and ask yourselves whether the assassination of ministers will be a matter of consequence to the country if so you ought to come to the determination to stick true to each other and that man that shews the least sign of cowardice ought to be run through on the spot A tall man in the room said I pretty well see the meaning of this speech but you speak as if every one knew what we are met here for - that is what some of us wish to know I for my own part am not afraid of myself nor ought any man to be afraid of his life who turns out in such a thing as this I am the first to run that man through who is afraid On this Brunt came in and perceiving an alteration in the countenances of those in the room he wished to know the cause and was told that some in the room wished to know what they were met there for Brunt said This is not the room where you will be informed go with me to the room in Edgware-road and I will tell you and every man that goes with me I will take care to treat them with something to drink to put them in spirits The tall man said I hope nobody is going to get drunk for a man doing so runs himself into the hands of his enemies Brunt then began to make a move to go saying that Palin wanted that room for his men to come to Prisoner DAVIDSON Q Was I at the meeting in Fox-court - A I never said he was He was not there that afternoon MR ATTORNEY GENERAL Q Was he frequently at the meetings which took place previous to the 23d of February - A He was at several and was there on Sunday when the committee sat and arranged the plan The first knowledge I had of him was on the 10th of January before I went to prison Q After this took place did you go up Oxford-street - A I did and met Thistlewood in the Edgware-road Brunt and another man were with me at the time - we all went together to the stable On going in I saw Davidson sitting and Wilson standing in the stable apparently doing something to the pikes I went up to the loft and found six or seven men assembled when I first went in there might be more on a carpenter s bench in the room there were pistols and cutlasses - more men came in in the course of the evening Thistlewood counted them and made eighteen in the room and two below but there appeared to be more On my going into the room I had a blunderbuss which I laid on the bench and a broomstick which had been prepared for the reception of a bayonet for Brunt - he was in the loft Tidd was not there then Thistlewood and Brunt were talking together and Thistlewood appeared rather agitated fearing Tidd would not come On Brunt and Ings perceiving an alteration in the countenances of the men Ings began to stamp and swear saying he hoped they would not think of dropping it for if they did he should cut his throat or kill himself Brunt turned round and said he would venture his life that Tidd would come he was confident of it shortly after Tidd came into the room and I saw him talking to Thistlewood - they both appeared agitated Tidd saw me looking at them and came to me I said to him Tidd don t you think this is a pretty set out do you think it possible for these men to do what is talked of He said No it was impossible Thistlewood addressed the men in the room saying I hope for God s sake you will not think of dropping the concern now for if you do it will turn out a second Despard job There are quite enough in the room and you think there is not strength enough suppose Lord Harrowby has sixteen men-servants in the house they are not prepared and we are from going into the house to coming out will not be more than ten minutes - he said fourteen men would be enough to go into the room and fourteen men were picked out and separated from the rest to go into the room to do the murder The other six were to secure the servants at the stairs and area Q When the fourteen men were separated was any thing said - A The men stood where they were and Brunt introduced a gin-bottle Q Who were the men that were separated to go into the room - A Thistlewood Ings Brunt Hall Wilson Bradburn and some others Davidson was proposed but he was below stairs They were separated to a different part of the room COURT Q Did Thistlewood make any address to them - A Before Thistlewood spoke Brunt said You seem to think there are not enough if there are only eight or nine men I myself will go and if there are only five or six I will go for we have things here which some of you donot know of that will blow the house up and if I go and find myself in danger I will clap fire to it and blow them all up MR ATTORNEY GENERAL Q You heard a noise below - A Yes a kind of a bustle and directly after at the bottom of the ladder I heard a cry of Halloo shew a light Thistlewood took a candle from the bench and looked down turned round sat the candle on the bench again and then began to sidle into the little room The officers came up the ladder took command of the room and presented a pistol Smithers was killed the lights were put out and I escaped Q Was Tidd in the room when the fourteen men were picked out - A He was but I am pretty well sure he was not one that was to go into the room he was in the room when Thistlewood proposed that they should go on with the measure and when Brunt made the speech I have stated Q Was Brunt s speech after you made the observation to Tidd about accomplishing the plan - A Yes and Thistlewood spoke after - Tidd continued in the room I was apprehended on the 25th and when I went home I did not leave my room until I was taken out by the officer I was examined at Whitehall with the others Cross-examined by MR CURWOOD Q As some of the Jury have not heard you before just tell us whether among other virtues at the age of forty-five you renounced Christianity - A Yes I call myself a Christian now I came back to that belief about the 24th but I was convinced of its truth before Q The fear of the halter brought you to this belief - A It might have had some effect I have had communication with nobody since I was here last I never joined any political society before this I consented to be introduced to Thistlewood

know from their manner of speaking they appeared to have been together The man said he had received a dreadful blow on the side and was knocked down My master said something more was to be done and both went out together Mrs Brunt and I went into the back room and saw in one of the cupboards a lot of rolls of brown paper with tar in them and four large balls about as big as my two fists made of

three weeks after he and Brunt called on me my brother and mother were in the room In a short time Thistlewood said he wished to speak to me I went out of the room with him leaving Brunt in the room with my brother He said great events were at hand the people were everywhere anxious for a change that he had been promised support by a great many who had deceived him but now he had men who would stand by him And asked if I had any arms I said no He said You should have arms all of us have arms some have a sabre some a pike and some a pistol and that I could get a pistol for four or five

a meeting on the following evening at Tyburn-turnpike where I should hear all about it He then looked at Tidd and asked if he should give me the word Tidd said yes he supposed there was no danger On which Brunt said when I got there if I saw any people about I should say to them B U T and if they were friends they would answer T O N He said he should be at our house next morning to tell me all about it and what time it was to take place They went away leaving me and my brother in the room Q Next day did he call - A He called alone about half-past four in the afternoon called me down stairs

called with before He told me his name was Tidd and that he lived in Hole in the Wall-passage Brooks-market I left him with an impression on his mind that I should go I went to Tidd s about half-past six o clock and found him at home He said he was waiting for some more men to go with him and if none came before seven o clock he would wait no longer Nobody came I asked him where we were going he said to the mews in Edgware-road He went to a box in the corner of the room took a pistol out and put it into a belt which was round his body He also wrapped six or eight pike-heads in a piece of brown paper I did not particularly look at them they seemed to me to be three-square like a bayonet He then took a staff with a hole at the end of it as if to put a pike-head in We went into Holborn up Oxford-street As we were going along I asked him what we were going to do He said I should know when I got there I asked if we were going to the House of Commons He said there were too many soldiers near there I asked again where we were going He said to Grosvenor-square and that there was going to to be a cabinet-dinner I then understood what he meant and did not ask him any more When we came to the archway leading to Cato-street two men stood there Tidd was a few yards before me and spoke to them We passed them and went into a stable three or four men were there At the end of the stable is a ladder I went up after Tidd there were twenty-two or twenty-three persons in the room and a carpenter s bench with swords and pistols Thistlewood was there A man in a brown coat who was sitting on a little bench by the side of the carpenter s bench was speaking of the impropriety of going to Lord Harrowby s with so small a number of men Somebody had asked Thistlewood how many men there were He said there was no occasion to count them as there were twenty-five I saw Davidson in the loft after I got there I had seen him before at one or two public meetings in Smithfield I am sure of his person I never heard him speak at a public meeting I saw him the day we were taken to the Tower Q Well the man in the great coat spoke of the impropriety of going to Lord Harrowby s - A Yes Thistlewood said he only wanted fourteen men to go into the room and supposing Lord Harrowby had eighteen men servants that number was quite sufficient Then the man in the brown coat said When we come out of the house of course there will be a crowd about the door how shall we get away Thistlewood said You know the largest party is already gone On which Davidson told the man in the great coat not to throw cold water on their proceedings for if he was afraid of his life he might go for they could do without him Brunt said sooner than they should go from the business he would go into the room by himself and blow them all up if he perished with them and said You know we have got that which will do it The man then said as they all seemed for it he would not be against it and proposed all persons should put themselves under the orders of Thistlewood and Thistlewood said every one engaged in the business should share the same honour as himself Thistlewood proposed that fourteen persons should volunteer from those in the room and place themselves on one side of the room Twelve or thirteen then separated from the rest Tidd Brunt Davidson and Wilson were among them Thistlewood went down came up again and said he had received intelligence that Lord Wellington and Lord Sidmouth had arrived at Lord Harrowby s Soon after I heard a noise and saw three officers at the top of the stairs They said they were officers and told them to surrender I was taken into custody in the room One of the officers was killed Q You was examined at Whitehall - A Yes twice Both times that I went I was handcuffed to Thistlewood He said if I was asked who it was that led me into it and took me to the meetings I was to say it was a man of the name of Edwards I said How can I tell such a falsehood when you know I never saw the man in my life He said that was of no consequence for if I was asked what sort of a man he was I was to say he was not much taller thanmyself of a sallow complexion and dressed in a brown great-coat Cross-examined by MR CURWOOD Q You joined in a plan to assassinate his Majesty s ministers - A Unwillingly I consented to it through fear - I was afraid if I did not go it would be worse for me for when Brunt called in on the 23d he said if any one was in any way concerned with them and did not go he should be destroyed I knew nothing of their schemes or plans I have told all I know Q When you were in the loft did not Tidd tell you he was deceived and persuaded you to leave the party - A No I wish for his own sake as well as mine he had THOMAS MONUMENT I am brother of the last witness I am a shoemaker and lived with my brother I remember Thistlewood and Brunt calling Thistlewood asked to speak with my brother they went out of the room together were absent a short time and then returned to the room Brunt and Thistlewood went away together On the 22d of February Brunt called with Tidd my brother said I thought I had lost you Brunt said the death of the King had made an alteration in their plans - my brother asked what plans he said they had different objects in view Brunt asked Thistlewood if he should give him the outline of the plan I did not hear the answer but Brunt said we were to meet the following evening at Tyburn turnpike and gave us the pass-word We were to say B U T and if the people were friends they would answer T O N Brunt said he should call next day which he did between four and five o clock in the afternoon - my brother could not go with him Brunt said then he must call on Tidd at Hole in the Wall-passage and he would take him My brother went out before seven o clock and I did not see him again THOMAS HIDEN I have carried on business as a cow-keeper and dairy-man in Manchester-mews I was imprisoned for debt a week ago last Saturday I knew the prisoner Wilson perfectly well A few days before the 23d of February he asked me to be one of a party to assassinate his Majesty s ministers at a cabinet dinner - he said they were waiting for a cabinet dinner and had got every thing ready and that they had got such things as I never saw that they were bound round with tarpaulin and filled full of iron and other things made of tin and that they were very strong and if set fire to they would leave up the walls of the houses in the street in which we were walking They were to be lit with a fusee and put into the room where the gentlemen were at dinner and all that escaped the explosion were to die by the edge of the sword or some other weapon After that they were going to set fire to the houses of Lords Harrowby Castlereagh and Sidmonth the Duke of Wellington and the Bishop of London and one more which I do not recollect and by so doing he said it would keep the town in confusion till the thing became general I asked him how many there were going to be He said I had no occasion to be afraid for a gentleman s servant had supplied them with money and if they would act on the subject he would give them a considerable sum more I said I would be one Q After you told him that did you write a letter to Lord Castlereagh - A I did and went to his house two or three times but did not see him After that I watched Lord Harrowby from his house to the Park and gave him the letter I wrote to Lord Castlereagh - this is the very letter - looking at it I saw his Lordship next day in Hyde Park by appointment and on the following day Wednesday the 23d I saw Wilson again between four and five o clock in the afternoon - I met him as I was walking up Manchester-street He said You are the very man I wanted to see I said What is there going to be he said There is a cabinet dinner at Lord Harrowby s in Grosvenor-square to-night I asked him where I was to come he said I was to come to a public-house the Horse and Groom in Cato-street or to stop at the corner by the post till I was shewn into the stable close by I was to meet them at a quarter before six or at six I asked him if that was all that was going to be He said there would be four parties one in Cato-street another in Gray s Inn-lane one in the City or Gee s-court I am not certain which and one in the Borough He said I had no occasion to be alarmed for all Gee s-court were in it - I believe that court is chiefly inhabited by Irishmen He said the Irishmen were all in it but they would not act till the English began as the English had so many times deceived them He said there were two pieces of cannon in Gray s Inn-lane that were easily to be got at by breaking in at a small door He said a party were to go to Lord Harrowby s house in Grosvenor-square to do the grand thing which was to destroy all the cabinet ministers and that there were four more pieces of cannon in some Artillery Ground which were easily got at by killing the sentry and that after the grand thing was over all parties were to meet at the Mansion House and said I was to be sure and come early or the grand thing would be over before I came Q Did you go to John-street that evening - A I did between six and seven o clock - I think it was near seven When I got into John-street at the corner by the post I saw Wilson and Davidson the man of colour whom I had known a long time before Davidson said You are come I said Yes I was but I was behind my time He asked me if I was going in for Thistlewood was there I told him I could not go in as I had some cream to get and must get it if possible I left him and did not go in COURT Q Did you ask them what time they should go from there - A Yes they said about eight o clock and if they were gone from there I was to follow them into Grosvenor-square to the fourth house from the corner and there I should find them Davidson said Come you dog come it will be the best thing you ever was in in your life - these were his very words Cross-examined by MR CURWOOD Q I dare say you expected a good deal of plunder did you not - A No I did not intend to go I have seen Wilson very often at my friend s Mr Clark and one evening Davidson came in and said Hiden you don t come forward like the rest of the men to support the meetings I said No I don t for my business prevents me I have often been denied to them when I was at home He told me that the men who had promised to support the cause and did not would be the first they would murder and when I met Wilson I told him I would come forward for my own safety Q You kept away from them as much as you could - A I did I never went near them except twice which was at the Shoemakers Club I knew nothing of their intent except from what Wilson told me He told me nothing but what I have stated Q Last time you admitted that you knew Bennet - A I did I never did ask him to attend a private Radical meeting Q Did you not tell him he might speak or not speak just as he liked - A I believe I did Q I thought you never invited him - A I never said a Radical meeting I said nothing to him about being called on to take up arms to the best of my recollection I do not think it possible that I could say so MR GURNEY Q You had been to the Shoemakers Club - A Yes twice with Mr Clark who had lived in the same house with me I saw Davidson Wilson

light a candle at a shop about a quarter past six o clock I saw him go to the stable-door push it open and go in - Harrison was at the door at the time Davidson s coat flew open and I saw two pistols a cross-belt on each side of him and a belt round his body As he stooped down a sword appeared to stick out The pistols hung on his left side In the afternoon I saw a person nailing canvas or sacking over the railing of the door I thought it was to keep the place warm - it would prevent any one from seeing into it The stable had been empty since Christmas I saw three persons go in and one come out in the afternoon as I was passing to and fro GEORGE CAYLOCK I live in Cato-street On the 23d of February in the afternoon I saw Harrison in Cato-street I knew him before I saw him go into the stable -

observed a man with a gun on his shoulder and a sword by his side with cross-belts - I do not know who he was I went up the ladder into the loft and found from twenty to twenty-five men with arms on a bench and heard the clashing of arms I said We are officers seize their arms Thistlewood stood on the right-hand side of the bench he drew a sword from the bench retreated into a little room and stood fencing with it endeavouring to keep any one away who approached him Smithers advanced towards Thistlewood and he stabbed him - he fell dead immediately after A pistol was fired I do not know whether by our party or not - the lights were put out I heard a voice from the corner of the room where Thistlewood had stood say Kill the b - g - rs throw them down stairs I joined in their cry and got down

not certain - he was secured I took him to a public-house searched him and found a leather belt round his waist and two ball-cartridges in his pocket Before I had finished searching him Bradburn was

left side a sword - he appeared as if he had been walking sentry he had white cross belts on There was another person in the further stall nearest to the ladder but I cannot say who it was - it was a short man in a dark coat Q You say you believe it was Davidson did you observe him - A I did I turned him half round and observed that he was a man of colour I took him into custody about five or six minutes after he was in the same dress exactly as when I saw him in the stable He had a carbine and sword when I apprehended him Q Did you go up the ladder - A I followed Ruthven up and when I got up to the loft I observed a number of people retreating to the back of the room - there were twenty-four or twenty-five persons - three of them attempted to enter the little room and as I went up Thistlewood brandished his sword at me and was advancing towards me when I desired him to desist or I would fire at the same time holding up my pistol in one hand and my staff in the other he retreated just beyond the door of the little room Smithers immediately followed me and on gaining the top of the ladder he attempted to enter the little room at that moment Thistlewood stabbed him in or near his right breast His hands went up his head fell back and he exclaimed Oh my God staggered against me and fell - I immediately fired at Thistlewood but without effect A general rush and confusion took place in which I was pushed down the ladder into the stable and at the doorway a few shots were fired by persons in the stable but they passed me another was fired by a tall man in a dark coat at some person apparently at the corner of the stable I attempted to go outside the door some shots were fired from the window of the little room towards the door of the stable - the window was not immediately over the stable door At that time I heard the cry of Stop him and observed Davidson running along in a direction from the stable towards Queen-street I pursued came up with him and took him by the collar he made a cut at me but without effect Hill and another came up and assisted me in disarming him - he made no resistance afterwards - he had a carbine and cross belts on then I left him in custody and assisted in securing three or four more in the stable Q Did you take him into a public-house - A I took him into a private house first but he was afterwards taken to a public-house ROBERT CHAMPION I am a Bow-street patrol and went to Cato-street on the 23d of February I and Lee the patrol were at the Horse and Groom public-house and saw three men come in they were Davidson Cooper and another whom I cannot identify but I believe it to be Gilchrist they stood observing us over the railings for sometime - we were on the threshold of the door Two of them passed us and went into the public-house they were Cooper and the other man whom I believe to be Gilchrist - Davidson had a dark great coat on which covered him all over We passed on to Molineux-street and observed them going backwards and forwards and going into the stable As Cooper passed us at the public-house door he said he should go in and have some beer - he looked me full in the face I afterwards went round to Queen-street which is at the end of Cato-street and heard the report of a pistol I ran up Cato-street - persons were running very fast out of the stable and there was firing two men were running away and I pursued them I heard a piece go off turned round and somebody cried out Stop him I observed a man running down the street with his hand up and I went to lay hold of him but he struck at me with a sword and stumbled Ellis came up collared him and I seized him he had a carbine also - it was Davidson he had no great coat on then I handcuffed and searched him he had two cross-belts on and one round his waist I found two pistol-flints in his pocket Cross-examined by MR ADOLPHUS Q Did you go into any public-house with him - A No I kept him in my custody till I took him to the stable I believe he had the carbine when I took him Ellis came up struck him and I believe took it out of his hand but I cannot say MR SOLICITOR GENERAL Q You took him into a chandler s shop then back to the stable into the loft and there you gave him up - A Yes but what became of him afterwards I do not know WILLIAM LEE I am a Bow-street patrol On Wednesday evening the 23d of February about half past six o clock I went with Champion and saw Davidson Wilson Gilchrist and Harrison after waiting there some time I walked away Thistlewood followed me and spoke to me - he looked me in the face I said it was very rude to look us in the face Champion said he supposed the gentleman thought he knew us Thistlewood said Oh it is a mistake and turned off towards Cato-street we had been sent first as officers less known I afterwards went round and came to Cato-street then saw Davidson leave the stable and come to the corner - Gilchrist and Cooper were under the gateway then and Harrison came up to them soon after Q At half-past eight o clock did you and Ellis enter the stable with a party - A Yes Ruthven Ellis and two or three more went up the ladder The lights were put out there was a great confusion and we came down - several shots were fired down the ladder I left the stableby Ruthven s order and stopped under the gateway shortly after the military came up - some shots had been fired from the window of the loft The soldiers entered the stable BENJAMIN GILL I am a horse-patrol of Bow-street I was one of the party that went to the stable Ruthven Ellis and Smithers were before me - there was a light in the stable I saw a man standing at the bottom of the ladder he had something but I cannot say what it was - he was a short thick stout man of a dark complexion Ruthven and the rest went up the ladder I followed Nixon up who was near the top of the ladder Before I got to the top I heard the report of a pistol and Ellis came tumbling down the ladder as if he had been knocked down he knocked down Nixon who fell upon me and there was a rush from the loft I got up near the door and was pushed suddenly into Cato-street I observed Davidson coming out of the door with a carbine which he discharged at me and passed after he had passed me I saw that he was a man of colour - he had a large sword in his hand I ran after him and cried out Stop him He made a short stop and made a back cut at me with the sword then advanced forward again and Ellis stopped him I came up and gave him several blows on the wrists with my truncheon He said he was lame in his hand - I said I would cut his hand off I made a grasp at his sword but felt it cut sharp and let it go I rather think the sword was twisted round his hand with a string or I should have knocked it out of his hand It fell at last on the ground and I picked it up I took the carbine out of his other hand Q What position was he in when you picked the sword up - A Ellis laid hold of him I never lost sight of him after he cut at me We took him to a little shop in Cato-street and there left him in charge The carbine and sword are among the arms JOHN MUDDOX I am a soldier in the Coldstream Guards and one of the party that went to Cato-street I saw a man standing by the stable-door and saw him next day at Whitehall That is the man pointing to Tidd He presented a pistol at Captain Fitzclarence and fired it off Sergeant Legge secured him soon afterwards I went towards the stable-door and saw a person at the door make a cut at Captain Fitzclarence and afterwards Captain Fitzclarence attacked him and he went in at the door I followed him and in the centre of the room Wilson presented a pistol at my breast it flashed in the pan but did not go off I made a stab at him with my bayonet and secured him took him to the public-house and saw him by the light He is the man WILLIAM LEGGE I am Sergeant in the Coldstream Guards and went to the stable under the command of Captain Fitzclarence I observed a man standing near the stable with his back against the wall between the gateway leading out of Cato-street and the stable-door He had a pistol in his hand which he levelled at Captain Fitzclarence He was about a yard and a half in front of me I knocked the pistol aside with my pike and seized the muzzle with my left hand A scuffle ensued between us which should have the pistol and it went off in the middle of it I did not pull the trigger I had hold of the muzzle end he had it by the other end The ball went through the sleeve of my jacket on the right arm As soon as the pistol went off he struggled no longer for it but let go I secured the man and delivered him over to the police officers - it was Tidd I went into the stable and up into the loft the persons in the loft surrendered to the piquet CAPTAIN FITZCLARENCE I am Captain of the Cold-stream Guards On the evening of the 23d of February I accompanied a piquet to Cato-street When in John-street I heard the report of fire-arms and brought the piquet forward towards Cato-street On getting to the archway I met a police officer who cried out Soldiers soldiers the doorway I went to the stable-door and met two men one of whom presented a pistol and another struck at me with a sword we exchanged several cuts and seeing the piquet he run into the stable I ran and fell over a man He said Do not kill me and I will tell you all I gave him over to the piquet and took another man in the stable and gave him to the piquet and went to the loft and found three four or five men there with a quantity of arms blunderbusses pistols swords and pikes The body of poor Smithers was on the floor I assisted in securing them and the arms Sergeant Legge was of the party I did not see him secure the men my attention was directed to the man who cut at me I had a scuffle and the pistol went off Cross-examined by MR ADOLPHUS Did you accompany Davidson from the loft to Bow-street - A Yes he was brought into the stable I am not sure whether he was not taken to the Horse and Groom or not as two or three prisoners were Tidd and Wilson were I rather think Davidson was not WILLIAM WESTCOAT I am a Bow-street patrol I went to Cato-street on the 23d of February On going to the ladder I saw the prisoner Ings at the foot of the ladder in the stable JOHN WRIGHT I am a Bow-street patrol I went up to the foot of the ladder in the stable in Cato-street and saw a stout man standing at the foot of the ladder I took a butcher s knife and a sword from him The handle of the knife has wax-end round it I was knocked down immediately and received a stab in my right side - the man escaped Ings was afterwards taken into custody JAMES CHAMPION I am a Bow-street patrol On the 23d of February I was at the stable in Cato-street and saw Ings at the foot of the ladder He said Look out above there and afterwards made his escape He was brought back in the custody of Brooks and Maze I came up to him in Edgware-road found him in custody and took him to Marylebone watch-house I found two haversacks slung like cross belts under his great coat and a tin case nearly full of powder three pistol balls and a blue cloth

me and fired the ball went through my clothes bruised my shoulder and grazed my neck I staggered into the street and he ran on I pursued him he was afterwards taken by Moye We both seized him at the same time it was Ings I took two haversacks and a belt from round his body and a tin case nearlyfull of powder from him at the watch-house Champion took the knife-case from him I said You rascal why did you fire at me a man you never saw before He d - d me and said To kill you and I meant to do it - I wish I had SAMUEL HERCULES TAUNTON I am an officer of Bow-street On Saturday morning the 24th of February I went to Brunt s lodging to apprehend him and took him in the two-pair front room I searched the back room on the two-pair and found two rush baskets an iron pot and pike staves I asked him about the room he denied it being his apartment I called up the landlady She said in his presence that the lodging was let to a man in his presence I then asked Brunt who the man was He said he had seen him once at the public-house I then went to Tidd s in Hole in the Wall-passage about nine o clock and found a quantity of things there Brunt denied all knowledge of the baskets DANIEL BISHOP I am a Bow-street officer On Thursday morning the 24th of February between ten and eleven o clock I apprehended Thistlewood at Mrs Harris s No 8 White-street Moorfields in bed with his breeches and stockings on His coat and waistcoat were by the bed-side In his waistcoat pocket I found three leaden balls a ball cartridge a blank cartridge two flints and a small silk sash I took him to Bow-street

which were taken from Davidson I saw him discharge the carbine The sword has a string attached to it JAMES ALDOUS The blunderbuss which Davidson redeemed is among those produced DAVIDSON Q Do not you remember when I pledged it that I said it was not mine You said you would lend me 7 s on it as you knew me or you would not have taken it in - A I do not recollect it he might have made the

CURWOOD addressed the Jury on behalf of the prisoners and called MARY PARKER I am daughter of the prisoner Tidd I knew Edwards and Adams About a fortnight before the affair in Cato-street Edwards left the things which I have since heard called hand-grenades and some powder one was larger than the others Adams left word that they were to be called for again Edwards took them away and said He should get them finished He brought them back afterwards about a week before the Cato-street affair Q Were they ever taken away again - A They were on the 23d by Edwards Q Were they brought back again - A Some were brought back on the morning of the 24th about a quarter of an hour before the officers came I do not know who brought them I saw the person he was an entire stranger to me Q There was a box that was left at the house - A Yes it was corded when it was brought and never uncorded to my knowledge that was not taken away till the 24th when the officers took it I do not know the contents THOMAS CHAMBERS I live at No 3 Heathcock-court Strand I knew the witness Adams he called on me twice before the men were apprehended in Cato-street He first called about a week before in company with Edwards Edwards first asked if I would go with them I asked where He said Why you are not such a fool as not to know what is on foot I said I knew nothing that was on foot Why said Adams We are going to kill His Majesty s Ministers and we will have blood and wine for supper Q Are you sure of the expression - A Yes Edwards replied By G - d Adams you are right it shall be so Q Did Adams call on you the night before he was taken up - A No he called on the Monday before with Edwards with a bag he asked me to let him leave it I asked what it contained He said Only a few pistols and such like I said

think I knew Strange Q Did not you and Wilson go together to the Smithfield meeting - A He might but I cannot say I carried no weapon there I have known Thistlewood ever since Hunt s procession I

Wych-street I have not attended there along with him Q What was the name of the society that used to meet there - A They called themselves Reformers that was all Q Were Harrison Davidson Palin and Thistlewood at all the meetings - A I cannot say I saw Thistlewoodthere when Harrison was in the waggon - I was always in the waggon I did not see Davidson there the day that Hunt took the chair I do not know that I saw him in the waggon on other days - there might be more than one man of colour in the crowd I do not think that I did see him there Q When Edwards and Adams called on you and made this proposition you thought them a couple of furious monsters I suppose - A Yes but I never thought they would get fools enough to do such a thing I consider myself a fool but never thought they would get bigger fools than I am Q Did you not go and give information of such a thing - A No I never heard a man say a word against his Majesty s Ministers except drunken men and Edwards and Adams

accompany him to a private Radical meeting Q Did he use the expression Private Radical meeting - A Yes he used that expression at my house Q Has he endeavoured to persuade you to accompany him once or twice - A Yes and ten times and more than that - he said I might sit and hear and say nothing without I chose I never attended any public or private meeting MR ADOLPHUS here addressed the Jury on behalf of the prisoners DAVIDSON S Defence I wish to call your Lordships attention to a few particulars From my life upwards it has always been my study to maintain the character of an industrious and inoffensive man I have no friends in England but depended upon my own exertions for support I have a numerous family and for their sakes alone is my life of value to me As to the charge which has been brought against me I can lay my hand upon my heart and in the presence of that God whom I revere say I am not guilty of it As to how I came by the blunderbuss I will state I had a friend whose name was Williamson who told me that he had bought an old blunderbuss that was all over rust - he was going to the Cape of Good Hope and gave it to me to clean He said he bought it with intent to take it to the Cape but it would cost too much to repair it - I took it home with me with intent to raffle it I met Edwards whom I knew nothing of till I dined at Mr Hunt s procession that was the first time I ever went into public in my life Edwards said he would take me to a place to have the blunderbuss raffled for and promised to bring a number of people at 1 s each When I went to the place I saw Thistlewood for the second time I had previously seen him at Mr Hunt s dinner I saw Mr Adams there whom I also knew by seeing him before but I knew none of the others Mr Edwards proposed to commence raffling for the blunderbuss but as no money was tendered I would not agree - I then received a great deal of improper language and went away I went to Mr Williamson who was waiting to know the result and told him what had passed He then said he wanted to get some money and I proposed pledging the blunderbuss at a pawnbroker s He agreed to it and requested me to take it for him which I did to Mr Aldous and told him it was not my own but the man wanted 7 s on it he said he would lend but 5 s but as he knew me he gave 7 s - the money I gave to Mr Williamson I afterwards went to Mr Williamson on board the Belle Alliana which was about to sail for the Cape of Good Hope he gave me the ticket On the 22d of February Edwards called upon me and said he had been to see Mr Williamson and had given him a trifling present and that Mr Williamson had told him to get the ticket of the blunderbuss I gave it to him but told him he gave it to me He saw that I was not pleased and said I am going to sell it and if I get 7 s by it you shall have part The same evening the 23d of February he called about eight o clock and said perhaps the person would object to let him have it and gave me 7 s 2 1/2 d to get it out He told me to meet him at the corner of Oxford-street and if I did not find him there I should see him in Fox-court - I took it there He said Won t you walk in and have a glass of something with a countryman of yours I said What do you mean by a countryman of mine He said a man of colour - I never associated with men of colour although one myself as I was very well brought up and always found most of them so very ignorant - I did not go I now pass over that to the sword concern - I shall state the truth On a Monday after the Manchester massacre I met one George Goldworthy to whom I had been apprenticed in Liverpool He expressed his surprise at seeing me in London I told him I was out of employment and that there was nothing worse than being a small master as all the rest of the trade from jealousy had set their faces against me He said he had set up a little business himself a few miles in the country and that he would employ me if I would go I asked 33 s a week he offered me 30 s but said if I would go to the Horse and Groom public-house on Wednesday we could talk about it I did not know that Goldworthy was intimate with Edwards but now I find that they lodged in one house On Wednesday evening however I went to the Horse and Groom and looked into the house but did not see Goldworthy there I stopped at the corner to wait for him which your Lordships and Gentlemen must know I should not have done being so conspicuous a character if I was about any thing improper I saw severalpersons going in and out of the house but still Goldworthy did not come A little after eight o clock while I was in Edgware road up came Goldworthy He asked me if I was not surprised he did not come I said I was He then said he was going to call upon a friend he gave me a sword and a bundle tied up I do not know what was in it I said What are you going to cut my head off No said he I got it for self-protection as we have many thieves about the country At this time I had not the least knowledge of anything directly or indirectly concerning the business in Cato-street I went down the street and when I got to the corner of Cato-street I heard a pistol fired I went to see what was the matter and attempted to go away Two or three pistols were fired at me I turned round to see what was the matter and again attempted to go away I heard a cry of Stop thief I was seized and taken to gaol I never drew the cutlass nor offered to strike but gave myself up I had no belts on this was merely to catch me If the gentlemen wish my life they may have it I have ventured my life fifteen times for my country and my King and I ask you Gentlemen if it is to be supposed that I should be so vain as to attempt to join a few weak men to trample down the British Constitution in which this country has so much reason to glory It is not likely - I would scorn such an act I do not deny being apprehended in Cato street but the carbine was not in my possession it was picked up I was asked if it was not mine I said no Another gentleman said What did you ask him for you know it is I was searched and nothing found on me I was never carried into any public-house as the officers swore but Captain Fitzclarence has cleared that point The officers said that I swore at the man who would not die for liberty s cause and I appeal to Captain Fitzclarence whether he did not take me directly to Bow-street I do not pretend to say there was no plot but I knew nothing of it I was accidentally drawn into Cato-street in the way I have said but knew nothing of a plot to plunder burn or massacre I did not know that any such plot was in existence I am not such a man if my colour be against me I am not void of all feeling and would not act the murderer or the brute I will now my Lords and Gentlemen give you an instance where one man of colour may be mistaken for another as must have been my case My leisure time I employed as a teacher in a Sunday School there a similar mistake was made A person a man of colour insulted one of the female-teachers in Walworth-road the young lady said it was me and made a complaint to the committee As I found I was slighted though nothing was said I sent a letter - in consequence of it the whole committee waited upon me in a body and expostulated with me on the impropriety of my conduct It struck me with such horror I had nothing to answer and let them go away without making any defence I afterwards however set myself to work and actually traced out the person who had committed the offence and brought him to the committee He apologized and acknowledged it and begged the young lady s pardon The young lady could not look me in the face knowing how she had injured me She came with her handkerchief over her face held out her hand as a token of her regret and asked my pardon Now my Lords and Gentlemen if any thing I could say could wipe away this impression I would do it but I would as soon be put to death as suppose that you my Lords and the Gentlemen of the Crown should think me that monster that would for a moment harbour a thought to massacre any person directly or indirectly I hope your Lordships will not shew me the least mercy if you think so I can stand before my God as I do now and shall stand hereafter to acquit myself I am not that guilty man I have very few words more to say As to politics I never troubled my head with them I have a very numerous family and a wife that never earned me a penny and all my distress arises from the consideration of the helpless state of my family where it not for that I should not speak for myself But should feel like Isaiah who though persecuted he opened not his mouth As a father I must feel and I wish to discharge my duty for them I wish to live and for their sakes I wish if possible to clear up the black charge which has been laid against me First of all Mr Adams positively swore that he never saw me in any warlike appearance and that I was down stairs And then comes Mr Monument who said that I addressed the congregation and told them that were afraid of their lives to walk out and in a few minutes the officers came up You must see that that this is an exaggeration and in fact altogether an invention or would not these men who were present at the same time have agreed in the same story I admit I was in Cato-street and even admiting this what does it amount to I very well know since that Mr Goldworthy was an accomplice of Edwards but never thought he would entrap me into this snare As to myself my Lord I have served my country and done all that I could do for it I have supported my family by honest industry and can appeal to fifty people that they never knew me associate with any person at public places except one meeting at Smithfield which I attended from curiosity as a common spectator I have seen Thistlewood but not on that night or I might have supposed something was going on I know no nothing of these men I have no knowledge of these plots I do not blame the Gentlemen of the Crown I have nothing to lay to their charge I admire the way they have pursued they have done no more than their duty according to the evidence which has been brought brought before them But I say the witnesses as far as regards me are altogether false sworn I have selected a few passages from the Bible which I wish to read on the subject and these I offer not for the purpose of insulting the Court The indictment says that I did certain things not having the fear of God before my eyes Now I always had the fear of God before me and always cherished the feelings of virtue and humanity I always subscribed to the beautiful lines of Pope - If I am right thy grace impart Still in the right to stay If I am wrong Oh teach my heart To find the better way Teach me to feel another s woe To hide the faults I see The mercy I to others show That mercy show to me These verses I always admired Here the prisoner recited from the 15th to the 22d verses of the xixth chap of Deut These words Gentlemen of the Jury I wish to impress on your minds I am a stranger to England by birth but I was educated in England my father was an Englishman my grandfather was a Scotch-man I have not a friend in England I have not a relative I have supported myself to this hour spotless and it is hard to have my life taken away when I knew nothing of any plot Gentlemen when I think of this it unmans me I am no plotter - no assassin - no traitor Look well to the evidence and to your own hearts before you pronounce the fatal verdict of guilty Gentlemen the Earl of Harrowby I have known for years I have worked on his Lordship s estate in Staffordshire Gentlemen I knew him and respected him Had I known that this plot existed I would have been the first man to warn his Lordship of his danger but I declare solemnly that I knew not of such an intention I knew nothing of these dark and bloody projects - Gentlemen I have now done I repeat I will readily submit to death if you think me capable of harbouring an intention to commit the crime of high treason if that is your persuasion pronounce your verdict accordingly I hope my death may prove useful to my country TIDD S Defence The first thing I have to say is that I had the misfortune to become acquainted with Brunt about a month before Christmas by his frequently going to see Adams who lived next door to me - our window nearly joined and by that means I became acquainted with him he frequently came to my house and we kept the Christmas holidays together After the holidays he introduced me to Edwards whom I did not know before though he said he had seen me - he does not appear against me he was constantly coming to me afterwards I was always a very hard-working man working sixteen and eighteen hours a day They came and asked me to go out on Sundays as I had no other time to spare Edwards and Brunt both told me there was a certain meeting going on which I knew of before but I never attendedany after the Acts of Parliament had passed signifying that they were illegal but Edwards told me that he had certain connexious in higher situations in life who were determined that meetings should be held privately and that he had authority to state the same to all who were willing to meet to procure a reform in Parliament - I thought there could be no harm I was then taken to a meeting at Brunt s house I did not see any thing particular and was solicited to go again on Sunday when I was proposed to take the chair Certain propositions were then made and I declared if that was their intent I would never attend such meetings and I fully determined that I would never keep company with them afterwards but previous to this Edwards came up to me said he had got certain materials and Mr Thistlewood s compliments he would be obliged to me if I would let them remain in my house till he could remove them I said they should not come to my place He went away and in the morning he brought the trunk up which the officers afterwards seized When I saw him again I said Why did you bring that when I declared it should not come to my place He said It is not material for we only want it to stop a day or two On Tuesday Edwards and Brunt came to me and asked me if I kept to my determination - I said I did They added that all the meetings were frustrated that there was going to be a meeting at Marylebone and for self preservation every man was to go with some implement of defence I said I had none He said If you have not I have plenty from those gentlemen who supply me He then pulled a pistol out of his pocket and said You see I am not without arms - he also had a sword and stick which he left In the course of the afternoon on Tuesday he came and said You know where the meeting is to be held - I said No and he gave me this direction - producing it - read Horse and Groom John-street Edgware-road - During Wednesday while I was going to a shop with work Edwards and Brunt called I went home and Edwards brought some brown paper He said there was some paper which I must take to the meeting as they were things he had in case of a revolution taking place in the country which was very likely In the evening Brunt said he had several people coming to the club and as I should be at work till then he should tell them to call on me Nobody but Monument came and I went with him but I declare I knew nothing about a cabinet dinner - it was never mentioned to me I was introduced into the stable by a man I did not know and in about ten minutes the officers came in and apprehended me This is all I have to say and you may depend upon it this is a fact The Jury retired and after thirty minutes consideration returned and found TIDD - GUILTY - DEATH DAVIDSON - GUILTY - DEATH On the Third Count except the Eighth and Tenth Overt Acts Before Mr Baron Garrow Mr Justice Richardson Mr Justice Best and Mr Common Sergeant MR CURWOOD now applied to their Lordships on behalf of the prisoner Wilson who had pleaded a misnomer and begged that he might be allowed to withdraw that plea and plead Guilty to the indictment MR WALFORD on behalf of the five remaining prisoners begged that they might be allowed also to retract their plea of Not Guilty and to plead Guilty to the indictment JAMES WILSON JOHN HARRISON RICHARD BRADBURN JOHN SHAW STRANGE JAMES GILCHRIST and CHARLES COOPER being put to the bar and being severally questioned declared their wish to withdraw their pleas and to plead Guilty stating that they threw themselves on the mercy of their Sovereign which pleas were accordingly recorded On Friday April 28 the prisoners were brought to the bar and made most insulting speeches to the Court LORD CHIEF JUSTICE ABBOTT after a most solemn address to them passed the following sentence - That they be taken to the place from whence they came and afterwards be drawn upon a hurdle to the place of execution where they should be severally

depose the Queen from the style honour and dignity of the Imperial Crown MR ATTORNEY-GENERAL with MESSRS WELSBY CLARKSON BODKIN and CLERK conducted the Prosecution JOSEPH THOMPSON police-sergeant F 11 On the night of 20th Aug in consequence of information I apprehended the prisoner in Lambeth-walk—I told him I took him on a charge of felony and mentioned a portion of the charge but did not recollect it all—I asked him if that was sufficient—he said Yes and asked if I had a warrant against him—I said No it was felony and there was no necessity for a warrant—he said his name was William Dowling—I said You live at No 5 Nassau-street —he said oh that is of no consequence you know as I am going to leave there I give the Pratt-street address that will do it is quite sufficient —I took a pocket book from him and this letter marked No 1 which was folded up but not sealed—he said you will not take that letter I suppose it is only a private letter to a friend —I had been to 5 Nassau-street the day before and ties found some papers in the back-room second-floor which Mrs Dorothy Jarvis pointed out to me and I there found all these books—among other things there were two receipts for making gun-cotton— producing the letter marked book marked 2 paper 3 list of members of the Davis Confederation Club 4 a number of cards of admission to that club 5 appointment of collectors to that club 6 a book entitled National Defence Fund 7 a list of subscriptions to the club and a fund for Mrs Mitchell 8 a paper headed Defence Fund Account 9 and a letter from a person named M Manns to the prisoners taining an account of expenses attendant on the defence of Frank Looney and others Cross-examined by MR KITSEALEY Q Did you attend any of the meetings of that club A No I was very anxious to get the prisoner into custody—I shall not tell you when I received information that he was at Lambeth—it was from some conversation that I had with some of the police—Sergert West and Constable 144 were with me when I apprehended him—I do not know Sergeant Kennell a sergeant of the F division—I know Sergeant Co of the F division—it was not him that told me where the prisoner was to be found—I did not offer twenty guineas or twenty shillings to any person who would inform me where he was to be found—he did not resist in any way—I do not know positively what the word Defence Fund refers to DOROTHY JARVIS I am the wife of the landlord of No 5 Nassau-street Middlesex Hospital—the prisoner ocenpied an apartment in our house for about twelve months before 18th Aug —I know Thompson who came there to search on the 19th—the room I pointed out to him the second-floor back room was the one the prisoner occupied—I saw Thompson find and take away these books and papers Cross-examined Q Had you opportunities of knowing the prisoners character A Yes—he was a particularly quiet inoffensive man—I never herars him express any sentiments disloyal or in any way against the Queen or way sentiments relative to war or fighting CHARLES FREDERICK CHUBB I am an attorney residing in Gray s Inn I have known the prisoner about a year and a half—I have occasionally corresponded with him—I have never seen him write to my knowledge—I believe this to be his writing looking at letter No 1 —there is a difference in the writing in this book No 2 —I can point out what I think to be his writing—this entry of 12th June I believe to be his—this of 14th June appears to be a very different writing from that—the first three and a half lints of June 12th I have no doubt are his—I do not think the first four linos on 14th June arc his—I have seen this book before but very cursorily—I think the whole of the entry of the 16th is his writing except the last four lines—there is a peculiarity of style about his writing he generally wrote in a large hand but the very small hand I cannot detect—I have no doubt that this Monday 3rd July is his writing and the whole under that head—the whole under 10th and 12th of July and I believe 14th 17th and 19th—that is the whole of the page—I have not read any part of it—I have only looked at different words—I believe this under the head of meetings 15th 17th 19th of May is his writing and that of 3rd of May also—the whole of book No 6 I believe to be in his writing Cross-examined Q How long have you known the prisoner A About a year and a half—he is the son of a respectable solicitor—he is a portrait painter of very considerable talent—I have known him intimately for the year and a half—during the time I knew him he appeared a perfectly loyal subject of the Queen—I always believed him a very inoffensive man and I did not believe he had any particular view on any political subject—he was a person of very mild demeanour—he has always expressed and conducted himself as a peaceable subject The following entries were read from book No 2 May 12th Committee meeting Mr Dowling in the chair The minutes of the last meeting were read and passed The Secretary called the attention of the members to the necessity of procuring new members to the club Notice of the following motion That a committee of

Mitchell &c — Friday 16th June Mr Kenealey moved the following resolution That this club disclaims all connection with pikes daggers and pistols and will use none other than legal and constitutional means for accomplishing the object it has in view Mr Dowling moved an amendment that it be postponed to the day of judgment which was seconded and supported by—Messrs Nowlan Barry English and others Mr Kenny moved a second amendment which was seconded and after a protracted and stormy discussion the first amendment was carried almost unanimously — 12th July A resolution was moved by Mr Dowling

he would move the dissolution of the Davis club and the formation of a league club or such other body as may he deemed advisable —Several other extracts were also read Letter marked No 1 read— London Sunday My dear Ann —This has been an eventful week in my history It was only last Monday that I had made up my mind to abandon politics for a while and retire into the quiet neighbourhood of Gloucester and Wiltshire and recruit my health and purse—it has so happened that almost all my connection in London has come from these parts and these have fathers and mothers and brothers there who as all anxiously awaiting for a visit from me which I have been for the last twelve months promising to paint their portraits a nice connection ready cut and dried to my hand My friend William Chubb went down last week to spend a month with his father who is a Magistrate and solicitor to the Corporation of Malmsbury and he wrote to me on Thursday inviting me down and requesting me to fix the day Previous to my receiving his letter the events which I wrote of to John occurred On Friday evening 1 was informed that the secretary of the Felon-club was arrested and I knew immediately that my turn was next I accordingly resolved not to return home till late and to start for Malmsbury next night I spent the night in bidding farewell to some quiet English friends who abominate Chartism and where I was obliged to act the hypocrite which I am pretty well used to now and after midnight I made for home reconnoitering cautiously as went along As I drew near to my own street I perceived a figure watching me sideways I strove to avoid him but he walked up to me it was a friend he gave me a sign to keep quiet and we proceeded quickly in another direction when he told me he had discovered through a friend is the police that there was a warrant out for me and that there were two policemen in plain clothes waiting opposite my own door he and another friend had posted themselves at either end of the street outside the police so as to prevent my falling into their hands at either side it was however a very narrow escape for the police had noticed their movements I went with my friends to the private residence of one of the foreign ambassadors where I supped slept and breakfasted next morning not with his excelled however for he was not in town but with his landlord a jolly old brick who seemed quite pleased with the mystery I was introduced to his wife and daughter as a Mr Robinson and I was near getting into a little hobble by forgetting my new name an erasure was here made I scratch this out for fear of this letter being opened When I went out I learnt that two of my friends went to my lodging and burned or carried away every paper that had any allusion to political matters before four o clock on Saturday they were scarce gone when the police arrived and carried away everything they could find and among the rest Wm Chubb s letter which gave them a club to my intended route and of course compels me to forego all my connections and wander somewhere where I have no friends I am now an outlaw and there s no use in bilking the question my neck is in danger if I am canght—however I am in excellent spirits and the only thing in the world that frees me is the bad opinion that will be formed of me by Wm Chubb and a few other English friends whose good opinion I valued However my consciences is quite at rest I calculated the risk before I entered upon this business and I am content to abide the consequences I must write very little to and-you for a while and that little will come to you with the London post-mark As long as I am silent you may be sure I am safe as I will write the moment I am arrested if I am so unfortunate My friends are all astonished that am so little uneasy but I only laugh at them it is however most strange for it has always happened with me that even trifling misfortunes have preyes upon my spirits but this utter wreck of my prospects has produced a kind to reckless levity that seems almost unnatural I have met with the greates kindness from parties from whom I could not have expected it but it is only in adversity that you can know who arc your friends Whenever an of you want to write to me seal up the letter without any direction except the word forward on the upper left-hand corner and inclose it under cover to Mr J Lawler 17 Pratt-street Lambeth and in writing be cautious to say nothing that will give any clue to them if they should open it I will adopt my mother s name but do not endorse it on your letters Mr Lawler will do that Write very soon God bless you all I was delighted that you wrote to me Ask Margaret to write to me but you must not expect answers for some time Give my love to Mrs Johanna Kennedy and Mary O B —O Bother I mean Mrs - - faith I forget her name Yours ever Roderic Vich Alpine Dhu Mind always to both wafer and seal your letters seal both inclosure and cover so that Mr Lawler may know if they have been opened I should have mentioned that it was one of the Chartists a fellow named Johnson his real name being Powell who betrayed us W D To Miss Dowling M Connel-buildings 36 Jervis-street Dublin THOMAS POWELL Early in the present year I became a member of the Chartist Association I believe it was between April and May after 10th April—I continued to

locality—there was a council of management consisting of five persons—it was appointed after I joined them—it consisted of Mr Battice Mr Fowler Mr Carter Mr Owen Jones and myself—I entered by the name of Johnson and was known in the Chartist Association by that name—the council had the general superintendence of the business of the Association—they usually net in the front long-room up stairs at Cartwright s Coffee-house in Red Cross-street—about 20th July a committee was formed to meet at the Black Jack public-house in Portugal-street Lincoln s-inn-fields—it was called the Secret Committee—I was elected by the Council as a delegate—I attended a meeting of that committee on Thursday 20th July at the Black Jack—there were about fourteen persons present at that meeting—I have notes which I

Bezer said in his presence they were going to get up a bloody revolution-—on Sunday morning 23rd at ten o clock I attendee at Dennis s Cotiee-house —I found the prisoner and Rose Mullins Brewest-and Payne accompanied me—we were together about an hour before any one else joined uu—during that hour Mullns laid a pocket-book on the table with a map of London unfolded and the whole of the persons present had papers in their hands—there was also a pen-and-ink sketch of various pars of London belonging to Mullins and a portion of it marked Seven Dials—I did not see either of the other four plans—the prisoner told Mullins that he thought it was difficult for him Dowling to undertake the management of the Seven Dials—in the course of the evening Payne who occupied the chairs said Gentlemen our object is to destroy the power of the Queen and if possible to establish a republic and there was a general acquiescence in that—I do not remember the words they used—there was some conversation about vitriol and assassinating the police—I can t exactly remember the purport of it—Rose said We must first assassinate the police burn down the station-houses and build barricades —that appeared to be generally receive —at the end of the hour Allnutt a member from Greenwich and another Confederate leader came there were ten persons present—I do not know anything of this paper looking at a plan —I can almost swear this paper marked A is the one I saw in Mullins s possession—I saw him put it into his pocket-book and put the pocket-book into his pocket—I never saw anything of these others looking at others but 1 believe I my safely swear to this I was so impressed with the first sketch of it—the is no particular mark on it but I will explain how I am so positive of it—I had a view of it and I observed this drawing and also these pencil-marks for barricades—there was some conversation by Brewster about the barricades being half-way down some street in Oxford-street leading to some square—after the others came in Mullins said he was sorry they had not quite ma-tured the plans for their inspection—Payne left about half-past eleven and the meeting soon after adjourned and it was arranged they should meet at Cartwright son the same evening—we met there—Payne Mullins Brewster and Rose were there—Dowling was not—they went into a back room-1 did not accompany

delegate from Greenwich Brewster Ferdinando this was his first appearance a delegate from the Green Gate Hackney-road whose name I do not know Flanagan Allnutt and others—I sometimes made my notes when I got home the same night and sometimes the next day—as regards this particular meeting I must have made the note soon after I got home at night or early in the morning—a return was given of the number of new delegates—there was nothing at all in writing it was all done as matter of confidence one with the other—reports were given of the feelings of the members of each locality and the number of men they could depend—on as fighting men—there was a motion made respecting an advertisement to be put in the Northern Star calling on every Chartist and Confederate locality to send two delegates to meet on the following Tuesday at the Dispatch coffe-ehouse Bride-lane Fleet-street—that was adopted—there was nothing further of any consequence transacted that evening—they adjourned to the same

Stevenson a new delegate myself Ferdinando Fay and others—there was a return made from the new delegates of the feeling of the members of their localities and also the number of fighting men that they could depend on—I believe that afternoon there was a resignation of the committee that met at the Black Jack on account of the charges brought against Rose and Mullins as being spies—a new committee called the Ulterior Committee was then appointed composed of Payne Rose Mullins Bassett and the prisoner—that was the same Rose as it had been suggested was a spy—there was a talk about his election—the person who charged him as being a spy was not left out I judged it was Brewster —he was elected after discussion and an explanation—it was not stated what the Ulterior Com-mittee were to take into their consideration—it was generally understood what they were appointed for—a resolution was passed that the delegates should meet if necessary at Cartwright s on the following Monday evening—there was no meeting that evening—the next meeting was on Tuesday 1st Aug —that was the meeting which I alluded to that was to take place at the Dispatch coffee-house Bride-lane—there were thirty-four persons present all delegates or representing themselves as such Payne Rose Mullins Brewster Dowling Bezer myself Fay Thompson Donovan Lynch Fuzzon Warry Allnutt Ferdinando Raymond and others—a report was given in by the new delegates the same as before— there had tan a resolution passed at Cartwright s on July 30th that four more should be added to the Ulterior Committee to make it nine —I do not think I saw this paper there—I might have done so—Bezer gave in his return of fighting men as fifty—he came from our district Cartwright s—I cannot say what number the others returned—it was taken down either in pencil or ink—the Irish Felon Society was held in our locality and the Star Society—there was also a club called the Davis Club the Emmett Brigade and the Tom Paine s locality and various others—there were delegates from each of those localities at the meetings I have mentioned—there was a jealousy that there were not enough Irish on the Ulterior Committee and four more were added—they were Thompson Lynch Fay and Donovan—there was a discussion on the propriety of sending a person to some part of Limerick or Cork to ascertain how they were getting on—I do not know who proposed it it was not adopted—the reason stated was because it was not likely they could get any true intelligence of the state of the country—a proposition was made by the prisoner that there should be a demonstration on Sunday 6th Aug at two o clock of Chartists and Confederates on Primrose-hill to ascertain the strength and numbers of the people—it was lost by a majority of five—a resolution was carried to the effect that every delegate should return to his locality and ascertain how the members were for regularity of preparation and ready to be called out at an hour s notice—I do not know that that was a substitute for the Primrose-hill meeting—it was after that had been disposed of—a resolution was passed that they should meet at Cartwright s on Friday Aug 4th at eight o clock—Mullins stated he had seen Mr Kydd that day 1st Aug and that Mr Kydd had said if the people came out for physical force he would not be backward in heading them but that he Kydd had entered on the executive as a moral-force man and had taken the office only on that ground—that was what Mullins remarked on Kyiid s statement to him—that was received with a degree of belief—Kycid was one of the executive of the council of the Chartists of the convention that sat in John-street—I know out Cripplcgate-street district was in communication with the executive in John-street—we next

determined that they should have red scarfs—I was present and Brewster also a report was given in that evening by the new delegates of the number of men the same as before—I should tell you that the committee who were sitting Payne Rose Brewster Mullins and Bassett had some converse I tion about a circular that Mr Kydd had received stating that they were desirous of knowing how far the committee of delegates then sitting in London were disposed to send a delegate to Manchester—it was decided to do so—Mr Lacey s name was mentioned and Bassett was deputed to want upon him and Rose gave Bassett money that Lacey might go on the following morning Saturday —a resolution was passed that evening to the effect that the delegates should submit to the determination of the ulterior committee whatever it was—the thirty-two were then present—a resolution was passed that the delegates should call on the members in their localities to meet at half-past two on the following Sunday the 6th at their localities and to prevent if possible the members attending the meeting on Kenningtion common to wait there till their delegates returned from Kennington-commes—there was a meeting advertised to take place at Kennington-common that day called by Mr Dwaine—to the best of my belief it was to be at three o clock—each delegate in his particular district was to have his members—their place of meeting to keep them from going till the delegates retuned from the Dispatch Coffee-house—it being an unlawful meeting many of the members would be brought in contact with the police and they were desirous I of preventing it—there was a resolution passed that we should meet on the following Sunday at the Dispatch Coffee-house—there was also another resolution passed for every delegate to select four men to appoint then as telegraphs on the Sunday and to station them from Fleet-street to Ken-nington-common—the delegates were to be at the Dispatch Coffee-house and thus communicate with the persons at Kennington-common—I attended the meeting on the Sunday—there were from twenty-five to thirty persoss present—I do not recollect that the prisoner was present—the arrangement was carried out of having

there and others amounting to thirty—that night the ulterior committee resignes—on account of the reports in the papers of the arrest of Smith O Brien in Ireland and Mullins explained that he had no confidence in the other ✗ who were selected on the committee that he had not seen their plans—he alluded to the four new Irishmen that had been added—one or two of the other made the same statement—there—was a fresh election—Messrs Rose Mullins Brewster Payne and Bassett were elected and were called the ulterior committee—a resolution was passed that there should be a president and that the one who had the lowest post on the committee was to retire when the pre-sidcntcame in—this was a visionary president—he was not named—there was some remark made by persons present that he was somebody and nobody—he was somebody to be talked about and nothing more—a resolution was then passed that the sum of three-farthings should be levied on every member of evey locality for the purpose of paying this president to supply him with a salary—no time was specified for the payment—every delegate was to make the statement to the members in his locality—a letter was read by Mr Payne which I can only explain in this way as he read it that trade was very good and we should soon have a good order—he stated that the letter came from Mr Lacey who had been sent to Manchester—there was some degree of satisfaction expressed by many of the delegates present—they were glad to hear Lacey was going on well—a resolution was passed that they should meet on Wednesday Aug 9th at the Lord Denman

delegates of the feeling of their localities and the number of fighting men and the state of preparation they were in—I do not think anything was said about ball-cartridges or anything of that sort merely about preparation—Payne was in the chair but Mullins acted as chief speaker—he was vice-chairman and sat at the other end of the table—he called on all the delegates to declare their allegi-ance and determination to abide by the decision of the committee for the good of the people—they did not swear but some declared solemnly and some said they were determined to risk their lives and abide by the deci-sion of the committee—Payne read another letter from Lacey stating that all was going on well that he was still at Manchester or some other part of the country and there was a question asked how long he was to con-tinue there and Payne said he was to remain there as long as necessary—a resolution was passed that they should meet at Perry s coffee-house Church-street Bethnal-green or Shoreditch on the following Friday 11th at eight o clock—I went but found no meeting—I was informed that the police had been to Rose s bouse and had seized his papers and that all was up—I then went borne—I heard on the following Sunday that there was to be a meeting on the following Monday night 14th at the Orange Tree beer-shop Orange-street Red Lion-square—I attended it and I was asked why I was not at the other two meetings that bad taken place since Wednesday—I found I should say twenty-five there—I have not got their names but I think I can tell them—there was Cuffey Brewster Payne Mullins Gurney Fay Ritchie Scurry myself and others—Dowling was not there at least I did not see him there—wumey asked me how it was I did not go to the meeting at Perry s coffee house—I said I did go and there was none held—he said there was and then he told me where it was held—Payne was in the chair at the Orange Tree but Mullins was the spokesman and he was chief spokesman on all occasions—he called on us to give a return of the number of ball-cartridges that each delegate and his members had prepared—each delegate gave in his return of half-cartridges that he had prepared and also what the members of his parti-cular district had prepared—I did not take any note of the number—I think it was somewhere about 500 or 600—there was a return given in of the number of fighting men—Mullins stated that there were nearly 5000 fighting men of the Chartists alone—a return was also given in from the Confederates—I can not remember the number of them for a certainty but I think it was something bordering upon the same number—it was a considerable number—✗ said the time was near at hand—he said Gentlemen the next business is that I want every delegate to select four or six men or more as many as the can select iron his locality —there was a question asked what they were for-J do not know by whom—Cuffy answered To fire houses railway premises trains or anything —I did not put anything down at the meeting—I was obliged to be cautious not to put any thing down—Mullias looked up at the gas which goes along the ceiling and said If I look up at the gas you will at know what I mean —I was asked how many men 1 thought I could select and I said two and the other delegates right round gave in a return also—it was said they were to be men who could be depended on who would do any-thing and everything—in the course of the evening there was a propositives made and carried to send a deputation of two persons to have an interview with some of the North-Western Railway engineers and ascertain what then feelings were and whether they were willing to come over and assist the Chartists—Ritchie and Scurry were proposed and unanimously carried the purpose—I was not aware till that evening that there had been a def-erence between the engineers and the company—it was mentioned then because it was requested to know what they were going for—is 6d was voted to defray their expenses for refreshment—they left forthwith on lie mission—they were not present when the other resolutions were passed- did not see any more of them that evening—there was a resolution passed that we should meet at half-past seven at the Lord Denman on the following Tues-day evening—I went—Payne Brewster Mullins Cuffey Dowling Allnutt Fey Gurney Lacey Ritchie Ferdinando and others in all about forty were there-Lacey was there when I got there—he entered into conversation with several of us and told us that the men of Birmingham and Manchester and I think he said Liverpool but am not certain were up and were doing or would be doing that night and he had been watched all day by the police and as he was coming out of his street-door a boy came up and told him that he was watched by the police—I had never seen Lacey before I had only heard of him—he said he had been to Birmingham and Manchester and other places but I do not re-member for a certainty what those places were and he had also been watched for two hours and he gave the police the double and had reached the place safety—about three quarters of an hour after that there was a distributee colours by Brewster—they were twisted plaited ribbons and were gives a the delegates so that they might be recognised as the leaders of the people—Brewster stated so—they were to be put on the left arm—they were three colours red white and some other—I received one—Mullins was prcsent as their distribution and after that some of the committee came in—they were not-all present at least I did not see them but one or two of them spoke are told Lacey they had better retire and consult—the room up-stairs was ✗ pied by a sing-song and we had the lower room—Lacey said If yes will wait a while I will go and see at a neighbour s coffee-house whether we cannot have a room —he went out returned and said All right or some such word- and the committee went out with him—I did not go—they were gone about three quarters of an hour or it might have been an hour—the delegates remained till they returned—they went away to consult to gather-when they retured Cuffey said Now Mr Chairman you has better give the instructions as quick as possible —Mullins was acting-as chairman—Laccy went with them when they went out—I did not see him return with them and was surprised at it—Cuffey was secretary I was informed he was chosen secretary by the committee—Mullins said Gentle-men as you are aware the committee have retired and come to certain reso-lutions and decisions they have directed me to give you the following instructions and as our friend Mr Lacey has informed us that the men of Birmingham and Manchester are up and will be doing to-night and we have no reason to doubt the correctness of his statement therefore gentlemen to-morrow night you must come out to fight and strike the blow and it is necessary gentlemen that you should speak out honestly and boldly for there must be no flinching in the matter —Cuffey stood by the fireplace and said You had better put it round Mr Chairman to every one present let them answer Yes or No —Mullins on that appealed to a delegate sitting by me and said Will you come out to fight —he said Yes —he said to me Will you and I said Yes —then he said Will you addressing each in turn one by one round the room till he came to Mr Ferdenando who made a bit of a speech and explained his reasons that he could not conscien-tiously say Yes to coming out—he objected he was not agreeable in fact he said No —he gave his reason and then said No and sat down—there was one more of the same opinion—I do not know his name—he was companion delegate I understood to Allnutt who sat by his side—with the exception of those two the answer from the rest was Yes —after that Mullins said Gentlemen you must understand we shall take up four positions Clerkenwell-green will be taken by Mr Brewster the Tower Hamlets will be taken by Mr Payne and the Seven Dials and the Broadway Westminster were the other two positions—Basset and Mullins were to take those two—I do not know which was to take each—Mullins said after giving the instructions in that manner Gentlemen every delegate must assemble the members of his locality for them to communicate to their locality at eight o clock precisely —it was to be the next night—there was a question asked by a delegate I do not know who how they were to get there with their pikes and poles —Mullins said I can only say they must get them there the best way they can some of the poles were ten feet long and at twenty minates past nine to a second every delegate must be with his men at their respective positions —the delegates were to come armed—Mullins proposed and it was carried unanimously that Ritchie was to superintend and direct those men that were to be selected for the purpose of firing houses railway premises trains or anything—Ritchie undertook it—the Orange Tree was to be the place of meeting—a question was asked how Ritchie was to know these men and some person said I propose the password to be Frost and Mitchell —Allnutt proposed the word Justice —it was put and carried unanimously so that when these men entered the room Ritchie might ask them What do you want who do you want and they would make reply Justice and then he would know them—Mullins said to Payne Just take a list of the number of men and he put them down but he made a mistake and there was some little confusion with the delegates—he went round the room again and the number was reckoned forty-six—he applied to the person who sat next to me first and then to me and I said Two but I could only depend on one—he went round to every delegate and in that way forty-six was made up—Gurney was there at the time and when—I said I could select two he said Oh nonsense you can select more than that half a dozen I know I Was rather put out at his taking on himself to judge upon it in fact there Was but one man that I could depend on for the purpose—Gurney was one of the wardens before I was elected on the council—each warden has 100 men under him according to the rules of the Society—after the number of men was taken the last words Mullins uttered were May the bitterest curse of God hang on the soul of that man that shall betray any one of us —it was such a colour as this produced that was to be tied round the arm—nothing more took place that I remember—I came away—the prisoner was there that night and sat nearly opposite me—I attended a meeting on the following day 15th—it had been arranged on the Tuesday evening at the Lord Denman that our locality the Finsbury City and Clerkenwell localities were to meet Brewster at twelve o clock at the Crispin in Milton-street Cripplegate to receive the delegates from each locality—I went but did not arrive till a quarter to one—I found Brewster Gill Gurney and I believe Fay and others eight or nine altogether—I have not made a note—Brewster said it was his intention to attack the Artillery-ground and if possible to take it and he should have to fight b——y hard and that we should know by four o clock in the afternoon whether the Government had received any intimation of what was going on—there was another person with him at the time in fact it was the man who told me at Perry s coffee-shop that there was no meeting there and that it was all up with Rose—Brewster pointed to this person and said Wait on me at Clerkenwcil-green when you are all there —Brewster said Don t be afraid because you do not see the signals for a little while you might not see the signals for half an hour but wait a bit —it had been arranged at the Orange Tree that there were to be bonfires—the men who were selected were spoken to on that same evening for I spoke to my men—Brewster also said Ritchie swears so help his God he will shost the first person dead that flinches from his duty Cross-examined by MR KENEALEY Q Have you attended many of the Chartist meetings at Kennington-common and other places A I believe only one on Kennington-common that was on a Sunday—I went with son of mine out of curiosity—I should think that was not above five months ago—per-haps more but I think it was under that—I do not know whether it was before or after I became a delegate but I rather think it was before it—that was the only one I attended—I did attend at Bishop Bonner s-fields twice or three times when the meetings were on Sundays—I attended a public meeting at Milton street for a short time—I think five or six is all I have attended—I cannot say how many I attended before became a delegate—I entered the Chartist Society after 10th April—I cannot say how many public meetings of the Chartists attended before I became a member—I cannot say whether I attended any—I cannot recollect it—it was not by attending these meetings that I gat acquainted with their principles or with them—I went to Kenmngton common on 10th April—I believe that was the first meeting I attended—it was some time after that that I became a member—I never saw the prisones at any of the Chartist meetings—I never considered him a Chartist only a Confederate—I do not know that I have heard him say he was not a Chartist—I do not recollect his saying that the Charter was not worth fighting for and that it would be obtained peaceably in two years he might—I will not swear he did not say so in my presence—I should not have been surprised if he had said so—he was a very quiet speaking man and never took an active part—I always took him to be inoffensive and quiet—I consider it would nave been in accordance with his principles if he had said—I do not recollect his saying that he was perfectly loyal to the Queen and he considered her as one of the best sovereigns that ever was in England—I have met him another places besides at the committee meetings—I never heard his say a word about the Queen—there were about forty delegates present at the meeting at the Lord Denman when Mullins was in the chair and when he asked them all if they would come out and fight—the prisoner sat nearly opposite me on the other side of the table at that meeting—I had a full view of him—I will positively swear he was not one of the two who refused to fight or to say Yes —I positively swear that I heard him say yes I have not got the credentials which I got from Bezer—it was the leaf of a book which was handed by me to Payne who compared it with his book—it corresponded and he said That will do —there was no writing on it it was a plain leaf out of a book—at the latter part of the time persons were allowed to sit among the delegates without producing cre-dentials—there was a great deal of imprudence in doing so—it was not allowed when I first went among them no person then could possibly have been allowed there unless he was a delegate and produced credentials—I do not remember that the chairman at the Lord Denman said Oh that is all right —the first meeting that I recollect seeing the prisoner at was on 20th July at the Black Hart—that meeting consisted entirely of delegates and persons who delivered credentials—one person was admitted without credentials but I objected to it and he was not allowed to stop—I do not recollect that there was some conversation at that meeting about Dowling having no credentials—Dowling was there before I got there—five persons were proposed and carried to draw out five plans of operation and the five plans were to be produced on the next morning at Dennis s Coffee-house—they were to be inspected by all the delegates present and the best was to be decided on—it was usual to produce credentials as the persons came in—the chairman was in the chair at the time—I did not see Dowling produce any credentials Q What induced you first to join the Chartist body A Two things curiosity and for the purpose of obtaining information and giving information to the authorities—I joined them of my own will—I found as soon as I bad been to—the place once or twice that they were a rum lot I did not know before I joined them that they were rather a rum lot—I found it as soon as I entered—I went to the place before I joined them—I thought perhaps they would do something to me—nothing about money but something worse than money—I should say a bit of steel was worse than money—I judged that these parties would be inclined to put a bit of steel into me—I did not give them any provocation—I judged so from the conversations I heard—it was not conversations relative to myself—I considered they were of that class of persons that would not be scrupulous of doing anything—that was before I joined them—there were many men that I thought would do anything or commit any kind of deed and my impressions have been confirmed—the phrase anything and everything is not a favourite one of mine—I should say these men would have had very little hesitation in putting steel into me and particularly now—they would not have minded doing it before if they found it was necessary—I am a carpenter by trade—I live partly on property which I nave and partly upon my hand labour—that was sufficient—I am like every-body else anxious to get more if they can—my object in joining the Chartists was not to make money by betraying them it was for the good of my country swear that I had no pecuniary object in giving information against these persons—I did it merely to do my country service—I put myself in commun-ication with the police almost directly I had become associated with these men—I introduced myself to these men—I visited Cartwright s and ultimately become a member—I did not tell them anything particular when I first visited them—I mixed with them of course—I do not think I ever shouted for the Charter—I did not do so at Kennington-common—I cannot tell you five amount of money the General Delegation had in their coffers from begining to end—the money was appropriated in various ways the secretaries managed that—they could tell from their books—I should say they had a good deal more than 5l or 6l —I cannot tell how much they had not 1000l —I should say what they collected from beginning to end would amount to a good deal more than 20l —I cannot tell you the amount I was not secretary I had very little to do with the books—when I put myself in communication with the police they did not tell me to take notes of all the meetings I attended that was my own suggestion—I have never shown my notes to any person—some of these notes were made when I got home after the meeting and some were made next day but I swear none were made later than a day after and the latter part of it I can positively state when I did it—I was at work at this time—I did not make any gunpowder—I made ball-cartridges at least I have filled ball-cartridges for Gurney our warden and I occasionally cast bullets and delivered them to him—I suppose I have cast fourteen or fifteen doses for Gurney—I filled no cartridges except sixty-eight which I had from him out of his cupboard and I still have them in my possession—I did not make any fire-balls or any other combustibles—I confined myself to bullets and cartridges according to Gurney s directions—I did not make any pike-handle or any other implements for fighting Q I believe you thought these men were not going quick enough to work and you suggested that they ought to procure larger quantities of powder A I suggested what I declared according to the resolution come to at the delegate meetings—I did not suggest to them to make quantities of carbides and bullets—I am speaking of Gurney—I did not suggest anything to Gus-ney—that was merely a word that fell out—I did not say at Bow-street that I stimulated these men to cast these bullets—I never gave any powder of bullets to any mortal being save Gurney—he is now in custody—I know man named Dennis Dwaine—I do not remember having any converstion with him about the absurdity of his moral force doctrines—I do not know him personally I do not think I ever spoke to him Q Where have you been living since this A That is a question I do not know that I ought to answer—I have been partly living at Her Majesty s expense I suppose—I do not know that it has come from Her Majesty—there is not a great contrast between the style of my dinner since I betrayed these men to what it was before in fact I lived better before—I am paid badly—I am receiveing money for my support—my life has been threatened—I am not receivings much as when I was a journeyman—I am receiving only a pound a week—I am not to get a farthing if I convict these men I positively swear that—no one has told me so—I only judge so—such a thing has not been broached—I do not entertain any hope of getting any money for it I look for protection from person danger and that is all—I do not look for any promotion or pecuniary reward of any kind—I never told these men to set fire to any places—I have bait spoken of—I never told them that I did not approve of the slowness a tediousness of their proceedings—I have said I was sick of their talking they evinced so much talk and that was all that would be done with them—I might have said such words as those—I do not remember saying that I was sick of their talking and doing nothing I might—I cannot tell you what I meant by saying I was sick of their talking—words may have been spoken by me at times which I really had no meaning to—I do not remember whether it was at any of the delegate meetings that I told them I was sick of their talking—I believe 1 have stated all that I repeated myself—I do not remember saying was sick of their talking and wanted them to go to work—I did not say that I told them I was sick of their talking—I may have said so but I am not—sure—I will not say I did not say so—I did not tell them they were going too slow to work and the best way to get their rights would be to set fire to London—I do not believe any such words were ever uttered by me or any-thing to that effect—I did not in any way stimulate them to get bullets and gunpowder once I was told to speak at a meeting about making preparations or something of that sort—what I stimulated them in was in giving Gurney the gunpowder—I did not cast bullets for anybody but him—I considered that was stimulating them— The witness s deposition being read stated I stimulated them on in some respects—I gave some of them bullets and powder—I gave Gurney some bullets and powder only and not anybody else —I meant Gurney only—I swear positively I never gave powder bullets or paper to any other mortal being save Gurney—I do not think I said at Bow-street in answer to Mr Macnamara that I stimulated the people on—I meant that I stimulated Gurney—I meant to confine it to him—I used no stimulation to him except that he asked me to get some lead and powder and such like for him to make the cartridges and I did so—he said the cartridges were for use—I expected what they were for—he knew what was going on—I believe of course he intended to use them on a future occasion I suppose in fighting Q Against the Queen A I do not know about against the Queen but if a collision took place between the Chartists and the police of course he would have used them I suppose so—I made them at his desire it was his suggestion not mine—he had been a long time making these things—I am aware that Gurney is to be tried—there was a suspicion of spies—they suspected me as a spy—I can hardly tell you what I was suspected for at first—am I bound to say how they came to suspect me COCRT Of course you are A Then I will tell you how it was—a person named Rowland who is a carman to a brother-in-law of mine is a Chartist and had been for years and I was in communication with a certain party that party called at my brother-in-law s premises he saw this party and knew him and he came to our locality and charged me openly with it I vindicated myself as much as possible that was how I was charged but I cleared the matter up then and the party that charged me was bundled neck and heels out of the place MR KENEALEY Q Why not tell me that first A It was a matter that re-quired concealment and I of course kept it concealed and I did not answer the Question till I was bound to—in fact I have not given you the whole yet—I have told you how I was suspected and that is all—Rowland charged me with being a spy—I was not charged as a spy by any delegate—Rowland was not a delegate—none of the delegates were present when I was charged with being a spy—the delegates did not suspect me—they knew nothing at all about my naving been alleged to be a spy—I had some conversation about it now I remember with Mr Mullins at the Milton-street meeting—he was on the platform and I told him that some time ago I was charged with being a spy and he himself was charged—there were such foolish suspicions in the minds of the members of the locality I was surprised to find they were suspecting most of the members as spies Q Were you surprised to find that they were such fools as to suspect you as a spy A well certainly if I am to use such a vulgar epithet they were fools not to know the difference—they did not suspect me Q How did it happen that they admitted you among these delegates and to all their secrets when you had not become a member of the Chartist Society before A Because I was elected by the Council and went there—I cannot say why I was elected by the Council—the fact was the others were afraid to go—the Council consisted of Fowler Owen Jones Car-myself and Battice—Mr Battice accompanied me that night and was afraid to go to any other meeting—some stranger in the room asked me whether I had any objection to stand as one of the Council—I said no and I was proposed—I never asked him to propose me—I did not suggest it to him—I do not knew who the stranger was—I cannot tell what made him suggest it—he gave me no reason for asking me to join the Council—he did not say Powell yen are a great Chartist a determined fellow and ought to be on the Council —no one knew me by that name—he did not say Johnson —I do not think I had ever seen that stranger before—I do not think I ever saw him before that night—I cannot say whether I have ever seen him since—he was sitting by my side and proposed that I should be on the Council—he may have seen me before—I was not very much inclined to go on the Council—I never put myself forward for they were very inattentive to these matters they was not careful—they did not know where I lived nor what I was and scared knew my name—I did not say I did not wish to be on the Council—I not put myself forward—I had no particular wish not to be on the Council if I was elected I should have gone in and I was elected and did go in I knew I should have a better opportunity of getting information if I was on the Council—I was not pressing for it—I wished it to a certain extent but not to force myself in Q You wanted to dive gradually into their councils A Of course I did and to be unsuspected for the purpose of betraying them with the greaters ability—I cannot remember how long I was on the Council before I was made a delegate—I think it was a short time after Mr Williams was secretary—I cannot say to a certainty how long it was it may have been above ft months—I could tell if I had the books the time I entered but I really cannot now—I kept no note of it when I entered—I did not keep a diary of my transactions only this produced—I kept this on purpose that it should improve my memory in giving an account of every transaction that occurned—my memory is pretty good in some things and bad in others—it is goo so far as to know what did take place and no more—it was the men who went to the Orange Tree that were to use the word Justice —every delegate knew the word and was to communicate the pass-word to every man that he selected for that particular purpose so that no man could enter the room or know what was going on at the Orange Tree unless he made use of the word Justice —only one delegate was to be there and that was Ritchie the firemen were to come there and use the word Justice and he would know them—it was understood that no other person was to go there no others person had any right to go there except those men for that particular put pose—these were books kept by the delegates on two occasions—I saw them on the table—the leaves were torn out the first night of the meeting 20th July—I cannot tell whether any of those books have been used by the Crown—I have seen a person named Luke King—I was present at a meeting on 20th—July when King came—he said if I have been rightly informed you the Secret Commitee have been sitting day and night for some time past is that true or not —Mr Payne said There is some truth in it —they were very cautious what they did in King s presence—he was very much out of temper and left in a very hasty manner and went down stairs—I do not believe said a word—it was the first night I was there—I did not deny that there were any secret meetings held—how could I I did not know it—that was the only meeting that King was at that I know of—I did not get up meetings for the-purpose of getting money together—Mr Owen Jones was one that got them up—I never got a farthing of the money at the meeting on 30th July at Cartwright s coffee-shop—I do not recollect any money at all being paid that evening—Payne was in the chair I believe it was Payne—it was very seldom that Mullins took the chair Q Did you hear Dowling say that evening that the plans of the committee had been concocted in his absence and he did not understand them and as far as he did understand them he disapproved of them altogether A He might have said such words I do not know whether he did—on my oath I did not hear him utter such words—if he had I should have heard it—I do not suppose he did use them at all—he resigned that night but he was re-elected—I do not know that he gave that as a reason for resigning—if he did I should have heard it—it is very likely he might have said it—I do not know that he gave any reason for resigning I do not recollect that be said anything about it—there was a charge brought against Mullins and Rose about their being spies—that occasioned a great deal of confusion and the committee resigned—no other reason was given—there was another resignation on 7th Aug in consequence of Smith O Brien s arrest that was not on 30th July—I was present at the discussion relative to the accusation—I told them I had heard so much in our locality that I myself had been accused of being a spy and that it was so much trash to put it aside altogether—I believe those were the very words I used—they did not suspect me of being a spy—I mentioned to Mullins at the Milton-street Theatre that I had been suspected as a spy and that was the only night I mentioned it to him—I also men-boned it at the time of the discussion—I indignantly repudiated the notion of my being a spy I did not positively assure them that I was not a spy—I did not do either one thing or the other—I never gave them to think I was or was not I let the matter pass—I spoke to my men to be ready on the Tuesday night—I spoke to two men to be ready for firing one was Abel who was taken at the Orange Tree I do not know the name of the other man—I knew the man I have known him perhaps four or five years—I told him that I was delegated by the resolution come to at the meeting to find four men for the purpose of firing houses and premises and I called him on one side and spoke to him on the subject and he appeared to be disposed for the purpose—I was in conversation with one of the men about a quarter of an hour and with the other about the same time and told them for what purpose it was Q What object had you in persuading those two men to join you in this firing expedition A It was a resolution come to at the meeting to select four men each and I did not know any more except those two men—one man was disposed and Abel when I left him did not seem disposed and I never took any further notice of him—I felt bound to carry out the resolution of the delegates or I could not have led them to feel I was discharging my duty—the other man I spoke to was not a delegate—I did not want to entrap him into this—I spoke to him on the subject and left it to his own option—was doubtful whether he would do it and although he told me he would go to the Orange Tree I did not believe him and he did not go—I did not use any effort to persuade him to join in firing the houses—I told him what it was for and said Consider it —I did not endeavour to entrap the men it was just to carry out the resolution—if he had fulfilled the resolution it would certainly have entrapped him but unless I had spoken to him I should not have fulfilled that which was expected of me—I did not feel bound to carry out the resolution to the extent required but merely just to speak to the men—it was never my intention to get them to do such a thing—if they had consented to fire houses I should not have dissuaded them but it was not my intention they should do it for all that Q When did you first begin to communicate this affair to the Government A Soon after 10th April—the Secret Committee sat the very next day after I attended the first meeting—that was on 20th July—I was not in communication with the Government before that—I first put myself in communication with these parties very soon after 10th April very soon after I joined the Chartists—I communicated every movement that I knew of from time to time they knew everything—I saw something illegal in the council when I first joined them—I knew that there was a rising that was before I put myself in communication with the Government—the parties with whom I communicated did not persuade me to continue among the delegates—they did not tell me not to do so I did it of my own accord—I saw them often I did not see them regularly once a week—I do not know what has become of the man I wanted to fire the houses—I went to none but the two I never spoke to a soul besides—I did not tell him anything about firing railways—I said it was for firing houses and premises—there was not a word said about killing the police on that occasion—if I bad received orders from the delegates to get any one to kill the police I should not have considered myself bound to carry them out I merely did what I was desired with reference to firing houses I merely spoke to him—I never said they were not to consider whether there were people in the houses—this is the only occasion on which I have got people to fire houses the only occasion on which I was asked to go—if I had been asked on other occasions I should have done so—I should not have fired any houses—I only heard the men talk about a Republic once—Dowling was present then—when Payne spoke of destroying the power of the Queen I said nothing I was not on the Committee and was surprised that they allowed me to be present—Rose spoke about assassinating the police—I was in communication with the police then—I offered no remarks on the subject as I had no right to be there while they were sitting—it was business which ought to have been transacted by the committee alone—as delegate ought to have been present—I was present on one or two other occasions—they generally met before the general body of delegates and before the delegates left they consulted together—that was the meeting where they produced plans and talked about barricades—it did not occur to me that it was a curious thing that such important things should be communicated at a meeting at which I had no right to be present—nothing was said about my presence—there is no doubt there were many propositions made that were not made known to the general body of the delegates—I saw a plan to the best of my knowledge this is it produced —on my solemn oath the word fighting men was used—the very first night Mullins asked us to give in out returns of the number of fighting men those were his words—it was proposed I think by Donovan to send a delegate over to Limerick or Cork to know how things were in consequence of the difficulty of getting information at the time the excitement was going on—I do not remember Dublin being mentioned—I never heard of any communication between the delegates and the people of Cork or Limerick—when Mullins said May the bitterest curse of God hang on the soul of the first man who betrays any one of us I did not think he meant me because he did not know I was in communication—I have been a carpenter for the last ten years—I was a bed-pillar carver before that—I have made more by carpententry than by spying—the Ulterior Committee is the only name that I am in possession of as the name of the Committee—I do not remember saying there was a plotting committee—I may have called it so—I have heard it called so—I do not know by whom but the name was the Ulterior Committee JOSEPH THOMPSON re-examined On 11th Aug I searched Rose s premises—he was with us and showed us the place—I found this plan marked A this map of the City-road B a map or sketch of Seven Dials C blank forms for plans to be filled up one of Seven Dials and the other beaded Clerkenwell three recipes for gun-cotton and these two lists of numbers—I found this cipher produced No 11 WILLIAM CHUBB re-examined I believe this No 11 to be the prisoner s writing— This being read contained various marks and figures with names and words attached to them among which were Pikes Rifles Killed Shot Barricades Victory O Brien Doheny Tipperary Poison Fire English &c The papers found at Rose s being read contained a variety of names contracted with numbers placed against them signifying the various localities their number and names of the leaders among which were the following Wall 80 Bass and Nas —Lamb lo 150 Ped —Ber 50 Dean 250 Cuff Thom —Star 50 Pear -War—Irish 50 Ritch —St Gils 100 —Carts 50 Fel 100 Mitch 30 W Ty 20 —Fuzz Fa &c CHARLES TILDEN I am a brass-chaser of 26 Little Earl-street Sevendials and work for Martin and Gracy of Rathbone-place On 27th May I became a member of the Chartist club in Dean-street—Cuffey was the class-leader—each class-leader has nine men under him and gives orders to them—he gave me orders to get gunpowder to make ball-cartridges to fire on the police—he said the time was close at band that was about the middle of June—I said I had not got a gun or a musket—he said Never mind that make the cartridges up and when the time arrives break into the gun-shops and get them —some time afterwards I met him in Wardour-street and asked him how to make the cartridges—he gave me directions—about a week afterwards I went to his lodgings—he showed me a pike which he said was Mitchell s pattern and asked me to sharpen it for him but I did not—I saw this pike-handle as well produced —I went again and found him casting talks from letter-type—I saw about a dozen—he said they were to make up into cartridges—he said So-and-so had got some ginger-beer bottles with pieces of ragged iron in them and that the wives of the Chartists were to chuck them out of the windows on the police while the husbands were fighting with the police in the streets—he said the soldiers would soon be drained away to Ireland and London would be in our hands—I have seen Dowling at the Davis club—he was the Secretary Cross-examined Q When did you enter into communication with the Government A About a month after 29th May when I became a member—joined as a moral-force Chartist not for the purpose of giving information to Government—I gave information for the good of the public and myself—I believed it to be my day I did not broach the subject of the ginger-beer bottles I said So-and-so had got ginger-beer bottles with pieces of ragged iron in then and bits of tow round them and he said they were very good things to chuck out of windows—I said nothing about gunpowder in reference to ginger-beer bottles till Cuffey mentioned it to me—I did not ask him to eatrap him-but to see if I could escape any plot being laid as I suspected Plot then—he thought I was one of the right sort—I allowed him to continue in that belief till he was taken up I played the traitor all the time—I did not tell him would join in the attack on the police—I may have broached the subject of attacking the police three times—it was not four—I did not commence the conversation only about the finger-beer bottles—I did—not say a word about the police—I commenced the conversation with reference to destroying the police three times—Dowling was not a member of the club I was in—I have not been in the pay of the police—I have received no Government pay and do not think I shall—I have received nothing for the evidence I am giving and do not expect to MR ATTORNLY-GENERAL Q What was said in the conversation with Cuffey on Sunday morning A He asked if I had heard of any orders and gave me orders to get 2lbs of gunpowder THOMAS BARRETT I am a shoemaker of 17 Charles-street Lisson-grove On Whit-Sunday I became a member of the Emmett Brigade which held its meetings at Morgan s beer-shop in Praed-street and one branch in Shouldham-street kept by Broaden—I know a man named Mullins—I have heard him address meetings of Chartists and Confederates at Breaden s on several Sundays and on Sunday 13th Aug I heard him say it was necessary for each man to prepare himself for the crests that was coming and it was necessary for each man to make a small sacrifice to aid the Committee of Progress in their undertakings and they would judge by the exertions they made whether they were prepared or not—at a meeting there on Tuesday 15th Aug between thirty and forty Chartists and Confederates were present—at one time there were forty—it was staled that they were waiting for delegates from the Committee of Progress—on Wednesday 16th Aug about eight o clock I went to the Chartist meeting-house in Praed-street—about twenty of the Emmenet Brigade were assembled—it was said that they were waiting for orders they did not say for what but it was generally understood for an outbreak—I went from thence to Breaden s I got there about half-past eight or a quarters to nine and found thirty or forty persons of the same class—Mullins came in and a man named Smith clapped him on the shoulder and said My boy I was afraid you were taken —he said No they only take me with my life —he retired and a man named Cruickshank came in and placed a musket on the table—I had seen him there once or twice before—I do not know what branch he was a member of—there were two pistols and several pikes and pike—heads in the room—I heard the question put whether they were prepared and whether they had got their toothpicks which was the name they gave them—Mullins and others retired into another room—when they came back I was sitting in the angle of the room and saw Mullins look into the room and withdraw out of my sight—Smith said to me but I cannot swear whether it was in Mullin s presence that they were to be in readiness to meet their leader at Crown-street Soho-square and the Seven Dials at ten o clock—the leader s name was not mentioned—a cab which I was informed—had brought Mullins drove up to the door and he went away in it—I believe there was a question asked how they were to take their arms—the answers in the best way they could—I went to Crown-street Soho walked down to the bottom and recognied about thirty persons whom I had seen in the room Cross-examined Q What is Mullins A I believe he is a surgess—he seems to be a man of education—I think he said crisis and not cress—was not in communication with the police when I heard Mullins speak—I am a moral-force Chartist—I think it is not physical means that will carry out moral force CHARLES BALDWINSON I am a tailor of Webber-street Blackfrairs I became a Chartist last May and was elected a class-leader about three weeks afterwards in June—I had nine men under me—the usual place of meeting was Chartist-hall Webber-street—Morgan was a class-leader in the same district—I attended at the South Lambeth Chartist-hall—I know Pedley well—he was a class-leader at one time but gave it up—he used to attend the same meetings—on Tuesday evening 15th Aug I went with Morgan to a Chartist meeting at the Peacock Francis-street Westminster-road—as we went he told me that during my absence something was going on which I was little aware of but when I got to the Peacock I should hear something by Mr Pedley that something was close at hand—I had not been there for nearly a fortnight—about half an hour after we had been at the Peacock Pedley came—he said there was a general rising in the North that a delegate had come from Manchester and that we were to meet at the Peacock next evening and bring our men with us armed and those who were not armed were to be put in a position to get arms—my party was to go to the Broadway Westminster—Clerkenwell-green the East end of town and Seven-dials were also mentioned—Pedley produced some different-coloured ribbons which the leaders were to wear that they should be known by the men—this is one of them produced —next morning I went and told some of the men what was going to take place—at nearly nine o clock in the evening I went to the Angel in Webber-street—Prowton Con way Johnson and Pedley were there—I believe we got there before Pedley—when he came I saw him load a pistol—I saw some cartridges which he made up at the Peacock on Wednesday night—he gave me one—he left and the police arrived in about three minutes Cross-examined Q Had you any arms that night A A pike—head and a small pocket-pistol—I knew the men were to be arrested—I took the pistol and pike—head to take off the appearance of a traitor you may call it—I did-not offer the pistol to any man in the meeting that night—Con way had the pistol in his hand and was cutting a ball to go into it—he went out for some percussion-caps but I do not think he had it when be went out—I told my class to meet at the Peacock at eight o clock that something was to lake place—I had given information then I gave them instructions before I gare the information but I believe not afterwards—they did not suspect me hen I ceased to do so as I had none to give Pedley had to give them that night—I understand they did not think me a spy or a traitor till they were arrested—I told them to come armed if they had them and if they had not they would be put in the way to get them—I did not know they were to be arrested then—I did not give information till the same evening MR CLERK Q You gave information between two and three o clock A Yes—I had not given the least information before that NICHOLAS PEARCE I am superintendent of the F Division of Police On 16th Aug I went to the Orange Tree public-house with about twenty men—we arrived a little after five o clock went into a room in the upper part of the house and found eleven persons sitting round a table apparently in conversation—I requested them all to keep their seats—I do not think anything was said but a great many of the constables rushed into the room—more than one attempted to get away—I had a pistol with me—we secured them all—I found a handkerchief under the bench they were sitting on a little to the left of Ritchie containing three balls with tow on the outside tied round one with a string some rag and tow saturated with turpentine—I cut one ball open and found some printer s type in the middle—the things all smell of turpentine—found two knives in Ritchie s pocket—I examined him more minutely at me station—his dress and hat smelt of turpentine—he declined giving his address—he told me afterwards he had lately returned from France—the eleven men were Ritchie Gurney Sheppard Abel Richardson Burn Greesskes Scading Snowball Martin and Small Cross-examined Q Did any person come out of the Orange Tree who gave information before you went in A No—the men did not attermpt to make any resistance they quietly surrendered—it was a lone bench that I found the handkerchief under—several persons were sitting on the bench—it was in the middle of the room nearly under the centre of the bench JOSEPH THOMPSON re-examined I accompanied Pearce to the Orange Tree on Wednesday night and found this paper marked 18 in the room—Greenslade said That belongs to me —I said What is your name —he said Greenslade —I saw it corresponded with his name and kept it— read— This is to certify that George Greenslade and William Burn were duly elected to represent the

police came but he came so often I cannot recollect—one or two others were with him—I supplied them with four cups of coffee I believe Lacey ordered them—they had it in the coffee-room upstairs—they were there a quarter or half an hour—I said there was a club met there at eight o clock and they went directly—I saw Lacey there after the others left bitting in the coffee-room for an hour or half an hour WILLIAM THOMNS policeman About half-past eight o clock on the night of the 13th I was near the Lord Denman beer-shop Borough and saw Lacey and another man go in—Lacey left almost immediately

coftee-shop —I had been at Chartist meetings there and knew it was the place of meeting of the Cripplegate locality of Chartists—I found about forty people in front of the house mostly Irish labourers

coffee-house on 16th Aug —it is in the same street as the Lord Denman WILLIAM RANDALL I am in the employ of Mr Darby an artist in fireworks I have examined these balls—I opened one and found it to contain about two or two and a half ounces of gunpowder and some old nails this attached to it seems to be a slow-match—if a light were applied to that match it would be some time before it exploded—if it exploded in a crowd probably the old nails would wound people s legs and if thrown into a room there would be a great smoke and it would probably set fire to the room—but if thrown in an open place it would be quite harmless—the slow-match enables a person to hold it in their hand to light it and then it any where—I should say this match would probably burn half a minute—the outside is made of paper with a sort of wax—if it was more confined it would be more destructive NICHOLAS PEARCE re-examined I was present when the prisoner made a statement before the Magistrate—this is Mr Henry s signature to it— read—The prisoncr says I do not wish to stand here as an English factionist but as an Irish nationalist my object was not to disturb English sowty but to free my own country I feel very well my position and I mean to abide by the consequences I carried on the business of 3 portriat-painter at Nassau-street Middlesex-hospital MR KENEALEY called JOHN ENGLISH I know the prisoner—this paper of hieroglyphics No 11 is not my writing but it is an exact copy of the original which I wrote—I wrote it without any reference to the Charter—I and the prisoner agreed to hold a correspondence in hieroglyphics and I gave this cipher to the prisoner for that purpose as a short-hand means of correspondence—there was no use made of it at all with respect to the Charter—I gave it him without any solicitation on his part—my letters had been opened by the Post-office and this was a plan I thought of to write—it was more as a pastime or a little amusement—I am not a Chartist and I do not believe the prisoner is—I gave him the paper for no other purpose than my own private correspondence Cross-examined by MR ATTORNEY-GENERAL Q What are you A lithographic printer and live at 18 High-street Marylebone—I have lived there a week or two—before that I lived at 27 East-street Manchester-square for a week or so—before that I was in Ireland for about five weeks—I gave this

and went to see my friends Q I want an explanation of a few of these words— Pikes Rife Killed Barricades O Brien Mahoney Doheney Tippenry Poison Fire English what did you want these words for to correspond with your friend in London A I believed from reading the papers here that Ireland was in a state of insurrection and it was necessary to use all these horrible words if I wished to give my friend a correct account of the state of things in Ireland—I intended making a list afterwards in a dictionary perhaps—I wanted to make a short-hand of my own—it was shorter to write in cipher instead of putting the words in full—I bad a dislike to having my letters read at the Post-office and 1 did it that they might not be read and also that it might be shorter—it was purely for the purpose of giving the prisoner an account of the state of affairs in Ireland and it is a sort of satisfaction to baffle persons who read your letters—this is the prisoner s handwriting—it is an exact copy of the one I wrote—I cannot read the short-hand which is at the bottom it is a little scribbling—I did not see Doheney when I was in Ireland—I was living-at 88 Long Acre before 1 went for a few months before that in Milton-credent Euston-square—I was in the employement of Mr Moody a lithographic printer at 257 Holborn and am so—I was an articled pupil to him and have been with him nearly four years—I do

know that he was the secretary of the Davis Club A Yes—I know him to be an Irish Repealer—I used to pay a subscription to the Irish Repeal Association—I have heard him speak in public—I never heard him use disloyal language—three times is the very most I have heard him and that was in one place and daring those three times I never heard him utter anything disloyal or seditious—I meant by private when I was sitting in his company—I never beard him in public or private say anything disloyal JAMES BARRY I have known Dowling about fifteen months—I am a member of the Repeal club of which he was the secretary—that club never appointed a delegate to the Chartists—I was a member of the Davis Club—the rules of that club were settled by two eminent lawyers Sir Colman O Loughlin and Sir Robert Holmes and revised by Mr Anstey M P for Youghal who was a member of the club—that club was dissolved for the purpose of being incorporated with the Irish League on the motion of Dowling—I can swear

great approbation—I do not know whether Dowling was there—he was not secretary then—he became so about 2nd—May—a person named Crowe was a member—I was present last Session when he was convicted—I was present at the meeting when he delivered the speech on which he was convicted—I do not recollect whether Dowling was there—it was alleged that Crowe was present when somebody read a paper with the expression to hell with the Queen —it was I that read that MR KENEALEY Q Now explain it A I was reading the last accounts from Ireland in the Evening Express and there was a report of a man who was taken up in Limerick on a charge of being drunk and using seditious language and with saying To hell with the Queen —some persons laughed when it was read but there was no cheering or any manifestation of applause I was in Court when those words were proved—Mr Parry called no witnesses—I was prepared to swear Crowe never uttered those words—my reading them was brought in evidence against Crowe MR ATTORNEY-GENERAL Q What are you A I am a tailor and have lived at 18 High-street —Marylebone about a fortnight—before that I lived in East-street Manchester-square I lived there four or five months—before—that I lived at 83 Wells-street Oxford-street with a man named Dempsey—I have not been in Ireland for eight years—I am not a Chartist—I went to the Repeal meetings—the Repealers held their meetings at the same home as the Chartists but on different nights—there was no connection between the two bodies—they never communicated with each other to my knowledge—I was not present in Dean-street when Looney was sent as a deputation to the Chartists—he was a member—he was convicted last Session—I was present at his speech which they called seditious—I did not go to the police

proper—he is a tailor and lives at 37 Lark-street Manchester-square—I raffled it to get rid of it—it was quite useless to me—twenty-eight people put their names down—that would be 28s —they were not Confederates—I do not believe Mahoney is a members of the Davis Club—he was not a member of any club that I am aware of—I know nothing of the Felon Club or where it held its meetings—I think Mahoney

Chartist Association on 29th May—I belonged to the Dean-street locality—the prisoner Cuffey was my class-leader—according to the rules of the Association each class-leader has nine men under him—it is his duty to give orders—I never saw the rules in writing at the society—I learnt them from the delegates—they were not printed—I have received orders from Cuffey—in Aug last Cuffey told me to get some gunpowder to he made up into cartridges—he did not give me any money he said it would be 10d —he said they were to fire on the policemen—I said I would get the powder but as I had not got a gun it was no use getting the powder—he said never mind when the time arrived we should break into the gun-shops—about a week afterwards be came to me one Sunday morning and asked me whether I had got the powder—I told him yes and that I could not get it under 1s but I had got it—about a week after that I met him in Wardour-street and asked him the way to make the cartridges and he explained that it was twisting paper round a bit of wire or anything round—about the middle of June I saw him at his lodgings in Hollins-street and he showed me a pike—head—I said it was very blunt and was of no use and I told him I would sharpen it for him—he said very well and he got down the pole which was about twelve feet long and put himself in an attitude to make an attack—he likewise showed me a screw-hole on the top of the pole and there was a screw tied on to the pike so that it could be ready at a minute s notice—this is the pole produced —I know it by some marks in the centre and by the turning—he said it was Mitchell s pattern—about a week after that I saw him at his own place casting bullets from letter-type—he said they were to be made up in cartridges to fire on the police—I said I had seen So-and so and he had been telling me about ginger-beer bottles and I told him what was in them ragged pieces of iron-nails gunpowder done round with tow and dipped in turpentine—he said they would be very good things they were very good for the wives of the Chartists to be chucking out of windows while their husbands were down in the street fighting with the police—I recollect the time when the news came about the rising in Ireland—about that tin Cuffey told me that the soldiers were being drained away and that London would soon be in our hands—he said he hoped I should not flinch in coming out and I said I should be at my post whenever he should call me if it was in the middle of the night Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q When did you first see Cuffey about these matters A The beginning of it was after he was my class-leader about a fortnight after I joined—I had seen him many times before that—I made the application to be put under him—I was ambitious of being one of his officers—I was a private—I expected promotion—if the thing succeeded I was to be made a general or something of that—I was not to be made King—I expected to be made President of the Commonwealth—I was a Chartist before I joined the Association—I was at work at that time—I have not been in any difficulty to speak of—I bad been locked up merely for getting drunk—I was had up once seven or eight years ago—I was waiting for a companion of mine in Whitehall-gardens to go to Putney races and was standing looking at James I it being my trade to cast those figures and I was looking to see whereabouts it was put together when a constable came up to me and said I had no business to stand there and desired me to move on—I thought he exceeded his duty and did not like his manner of speakiag to me and thought I would be obstinate and there I stood all day from nine in the morning till five in the evening when I was taken up and taken to the station in Gardener s-lane—I was taken to Bow-street it was too late so they took me back again—I was not charged with picking any One s pocket—they searched me I suppose to see what they could find—I was ordered to find bail for six months—I did so—I remained in prison three weeks—I am sure that is the only time I have been in prison—I have been in a court of justice merely as a witness not for the police but on a private affair—I have been working at my own trade Q I suppose at the time you joined the Chartists you were in earnest and did not mean to inform against them A I did not know what their principles were—I joined as a moral force Chartist—I told Cuffey I had bought 1s worth of powder but I had not—I did not get paid for it—I told him I had bought it for the purpose of seeing whether I could find out anything to stop it—I was looking for an opportunity to stop it—I intended to go on with them as regards moral force but not to have any movement in the physical force because I thought it was not a right thing—I should think the gunpowder cartridges and ginger-beer bottles were for physical force—I did not fill any of the ginger-beer bottles—I reminded Cuffey of them because another man told me of them it was not Powell it was a man named Peter Cashel—I merely told Cuffey about it to see what he would say I whether there were any fresh orders coming—he might not have told me without—it led him on to think I was sincere—I was not sincere in the physical force movement—I meant to stop the progress of it if any attempt was made—I did not mention to Cuffey the way in which the ginger-beer bottles were to be used—Cuffey said they were very good things for their wives to chuck out of the windows on the police—I did offer to sharpen the pike—head—I did that from the same motive—it was not to lead him on and then to betray him that was not leading him on—I meant to stop the physical force movement that was why I offered to sharpen the pike—head—I was in communication with the officers of the Government—I was not employed by them—I first communicated with them about a month after I joined the Chartists some time in June—it was after that that I offered to sharpen the pike—head—it was said merely to see what I could get out of him to see what movements were on—it was not to see how far I could get him to go—I could not get him to go at all myself—he had orders from the wardens who were above him—from time to time during June I communicated what was going on—I was not associated with Powell—I did not know him till I saw him on this trial—I did not know he was employed—there was nobody associated with me—I do not expect to get anything for this—I do it for the good of the public and likewise of myself—if they succeeded in burning houses they would stop trade and put me out of work and I have a wife and family—they were to set fire to people s houses and if anybody opposed them they were to knock them on the head—that would of course stop trade and cause me to loose my work—that was the good I contemplated to myself by turning spy and informer—I swear that—I was not examined before the Magistrate—I was not examined at all till Saturday on Dowling s trial—I heard of Cuffey s being taken into custody when I went to his house about a quarter of an hour afterwards—I did not know he was to be taken—he was taken on the evening I went to his house—I had been before he was taken and I went after—I went alone the first time—I did not go into his room I might if I liked—he lives in a garret—I never noticed that there was a cockloft there or a loft at all—I now know there is one from what I have heard—I did not know it before—I have been into his room several times—about twenty-four times—I never noticed a trap-door there—I did not know there was one—I did not put the pole into it—I merely went to the house to get information from Cuffey—I did not know he was apprehended till I went the second time—I did not get the information I wanted—I knew he was taken because I saw his son at the door of his house—I believe it to be his son—he is about twenty-seven years of age—I ascertained from him that he was taken—I was not in communication with West the policeman at that time I did not know him then—I am now living by my work that is the only mode I have no other means—I am in regular work with Mr Martin of 18 Grezert-street—I get 28s a week sometimes less sometimes more—I have been working for him off and on thirteen years Q Then do you mean that you were in respectable employment at the time you were carrying on this additional business of a spy A Yes—I could live without being a spy—on my solemn oath I have no other means a living except by what I am earning by my labour—I have received nothing else—I do not receive anything from the prosecution only my dinner—I have received no money expect my dinner-money 18d a day which I have had since I have been here—I have not received anything else from Government—I do not expect to receive anything else except the 18d a day for my dinner while I am attending here—I have not asked for anything elseI expect to be paid for my time while I am here not while I am at work—I expect my regular day s money—I only expect to get my expenses nothing more—I never refuse anything—I should not be in the least ashamed of taking anything from the Government—I lived at 1 Phœnix-street for a year and a half up to 12th Aug —from there I went to 26 Little Earl-street and I live there now—I was to get llb of powder for the 10d —I was to make that up into cartridges—I found Cuffey casting bullets up in his garret—his wife was not there nor any of the little Cuffeys—he had no cauldron—he had a tobacco-pipe—he had a pair of pliers and a mould—he had not much lead—he was using letter type—he had thirty or forty letters—they were not capita-letters but small ones Cross-examined by MR PARRY Q You said when you were lootings King James you were thinking of going to Putney races A I did not say that I was thinking of going but I went there for the purpose of waiting for a companion of mine to go to Putney races—I had not been at Putney races before nor to any races—I have not been since—I swear that—it was a boat-race not a horse-race—I do not know Powell—Peter Cashel is not a police man MR ATTORNEY-GENERAL Q Do you recollect the day you were takes up was it 5th July 1843 A That was about the time—it was just after Mr Drummond had been shot—the charge against me was for loitering about Whitehall-gardens during the day and not giving a satisfactory account of myself COURT Q What was the name of your companion you were waiting for A I forget his name but it was the one I lodged with—he had lodged with me about twelve months—I did know his name but it is seven or eight years ago and I forget it—he was a tailor MARTHA TILDEN I am the wife of Charles Tilden—I know Cuffey—I saw him last on 13th Aug —I had seen him twice before—on 13th Aug I told him he was not to come to my lodgings—I had removed the day before because I would not allow him to come to our lodgings and my husband was too ill to be seen—he said he wanted to see him just for half an hour up at his own house—I said he could not see him for five minutes he was too bad to be seen by the doctor s orders—he asked me where we had moved to and I told him to Earl-street but did not tell him any number or any other place—I was going out to work at the time and could not stop to talk to him Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q Who does your husband wore for A Mr Martin to whom he was apprenticed—I have two children THOMAS POWELL I am a carpenter Shortly after the 10th of April I joined the Cripplegate locality of the Chartist Confederation—I was appointed one of the Council—our place of meeting was the front long-room at Cartwright s coffee-shop Redcross-street Cripplegate—I was a member down to Aug —I attended meetings of the same body at other places and made notes of what occurred sometimes the next day and sometimes the day after and on one or two occasions if not three immediately I got home—they are very short—I speak principally from my memory looking at his notes —the first meeting Fay was at was on Friday July 28th at Hopkinson s coffee-shop Saffron-hill— it was held by adjournment from a former meeting at the same place—I was present at the adjournment —on 28th fourteen persons were present—Ferdinando Mr Page from Tothill-street Westminster locality Brewster Rose Mullins Payne myself Hopkinson an Irish Confederate Mr Home his first appearance Flannagan Fay and others—a return was given in of the number of fighting men and the feeling of the members of the respective localities by the new delegates that came there on that evening from localities in the metropolis—I was then acting as a delegate for Cripplegate locality—I cannot say bow many fighting men they returned—Mr Payne was chairman but Mullins was spokesman—a resolution was passed that each member should bring 10s as soon as possible to defray the expenses incurred by the committee—the meeting was adjourned to meet at Cart-wright s on Sunday afternoon July 30th—Payne Dowling Brewster Rose Mullins Bassett his first appearance Stevenson myself Ferdinando Fay and others were present twenty-eight in all—I got there between three and half-past three o clock—returns were given in the same as before by the new delegates and the ulterior committee resigned—that consisted of five—there was some conversation about increasing them to the number of nine and some charge was brought against Mullins and Rose two of the five as being spies—Payne Rose Mullins Bassett and Dowling were elected—it was confined to five but a resolution was passed that four others should be elected at the next meeting—I never was proposed—I said I bad heard that some charge had been brought against Rose and Mullins and I thought it was better to set aside such trash and have nothing more to do with it and they were elected—I also made some remark that it was impossible for them to do anything in our movement unless they could produce a spirit of subordination among the members—I believe that was after the allegation made against the two men as spies—it was resolved that they should meet at Cartwright s at six on the following Monday evening if necessary but there was no meeting—they met next at the Dispatch coffee-house Bride-lane Fleet-street on 1st Aug —Rose Mullins Brewster Dowling Thompson Donovan Lynch Warry and others thirty-four in all were present—Payne was in the chair—Fay was there—I do not remember seeing the other prisoners—Bezer was there it was his first appearance—he gave in a report of fifty fighting men from Cartwright s for which locality he was secretary—he was not a delegate—there were other returns made—Fay Thompson Lynch and Donovan four Irishmen were elected on the committee—their club belonged to the Irish Confederates at one time but they altered the name to the Irish Felon-club—I am not certain which it was called at this time—Fay was secretary—they used to meet at Cartwright s—the reason given for adding four Irishmen to the committee was that a feeling of jealousy existed—the whole of the four spoke that evening and stated that they thought there was not a sufficient number of Irishmen on the committee and in consequence of that they were added—there was some discussion on the propriety of dispatching a party to Limerick or Cork—I forget who brought that forward it was discussed and lost at the voting— The witness here requested that every witness subpoenaed to speak against his character might be ordered out of Court —during the discussion it was said that it would be a waste of money and there would be no possibility of getting a correct account of the state of affairs in Ireland that was said by both sides—a report was given in from the delegates the same as before—nothing more was said about the Irish messenger—Dowling moved that there should be a demonstration on the following Sunday 6th Aug at two o clock on Primrose-hill of Chartists and Confederates to ascertain their number and strength that was lost by a majority of five—a resolution was passed that every delegate should return to his locality and ascertain how the members were prepared for regularity of preparation and ready to be called out at an hour s notice and to bring friends to the committee on Friday Aug 4th—Mullins stated that he had seen Mr Kydd that day and that Mr Kydd if the people came out for physical force would not be backward in heading them but that Mr Kydd had entered on the executive only as a moral force man and that he took the office on that ground—Kydd was one of the executive of the National Convention—the executive had to pay attention to the localities to look after them and receive names from them—they were in connection with the localities—that communication was received with a degree of satisfaction and surprise by the delegates—the meeting then adjourned to meet at Cartwright s on Aug 4th—I attended—there were thirty-two present—Payne was in the chair on all occasions—Cuffey was there for the first tide and Rose Brewster Gurney Mullins Bassett his second time Donovan Lynch Dowling myself Thompson and others—I have not Fay s name-there were new delegates present they gave in a report of the number of fighting men I have no numbers—money was paid by the new delegates and by some of the old to Rose as secretary—there was a discussion about what scarfs were to be worn as signs of leadership and it was decided that they should be red calico sashes—there was a conversation in committee between Payne Bassett and Mullins about a communication that had been received from Kydd and of a circular he had received desiring to know how far the delegates then sitting in London were desirous of sending a delegate to Manchester—I believe Bassett communicated that to the meeting—Payne made some remarks about his sleeping two or three nights at Lacey s house and Lacey was proposed as a proper person to go to Manchester as a delegate and it was agreed to—Bassett was proposed to wait on Lacey who was not present on the subject and Mullins gave him money for the purpose—he went off and I saw no more of him that evening—a resolution was passed by the general body of delegates that they should submit to the determination of the ulterior committee the committee of nine—it was resolved that the delegates should call on their respective members to meet at half-past two on the following Sunday at their localities and they were not by any means to leave there or visit Kennington-common that day—there had been a meeting at Kennington-common advertised in the newspapers which was not called by any of the Chartist or Confederate bodies and they were not to go for fear of coming into collision with the police and the authorities—a resolution was passed that every delegate should select four men or more for the purpose of placing them as telegraphs from the Dispatch coffee-house Bride-lane to Kennington-common to communicate information to the delegates sittings the Dispatch coffee-house—it was resolved that they should meet at the Dispatch coffee-house at half-past two o clock on the following Sunday—I attended there and was appointed as one to see the persons stationed as telegraphs—I returned to the meeting of delegates just at its close and found Payne Brewster Mullins and others there—I have no names—Cuffey was there when I returned and 1 saw him there before the business commenced—the resolution as to stationing persons was carried out—I saw every man placed—the meeting separated about a quarter of an hour after I returned—I have no note of what took place but my memory furnishes me—when I returned Page of Tothill-street Westminster was speaking on the subject of giving Mr Bund Hughes the Government reporter a sound thrashing for what he had been doing—Page was a delegate—they met again on Monday night 7th Aug at Dennis s coffee-house Great St Andrew s-street Seven-dials—there were thirty persons present Cuffey myself Brewster Mullins Rose Allnutt Donovan Dowling Fay Lynch Thompson Bassett Ritchie and others—the Ulterior Committee resigned that night in consequence of the rumours of Smith O Brien s arrest and partly from a want of confidence that five of the committee had in the new four that had been added and the four new ones complained that they had not seen the plans of the other five and the five gave a similar explanation of not seeing the plans of the others—a new committee was appointed consisting of five only Payne Rose Mullins Bassett and Brewster—it was arranged after some discussion that there should be a visionary president and that one of the committee who had the lowest votes should withdraw to make room for him when he entered on the seat of presidentship some one asked who this person was and one of the delegates said he was neither in London nor out of London and that was my meaning in saying a visionary president —Bassett had the lowest amount of votes—it was resolved that each member of every locality was to pay three farthings a head as a salary for the president—each delegate was to make that known and was to collect it—Payne who was in the chair read a letter which he said he had received from Lacey and part of it was in these words Trade is very good and you will soon receive a very good order —that was received by the meeting with satisfaction—we then adjourned to meet on the following Wednesday Aug 9th at the Lord Denman beer-shop Suffolk-street Borough—I attended—there were Payne Brewster Rose Mullins Dowling myself Gurney Donovan Bassett and others in all twenty-eight present—as I was going in I met Cuffey in the passage going away—the meeting had begun before I got there—I shook hands with Cuffey and asked him bow be was—after I arrived reports were given in of the feeling of the members of the localities and also a return of fighting men—Gurney gave in his return either 100 or 120 but I think it was 100 from our locality—Gurney was formerly in the Artillery—his duty as wardsman was to look after his 100 men—each wardsman had 100 men under him and each class-leader had nine under him I often heard that said at Cartwright s—I do not remember the numbers mentioned by anybody else that night—a resolution was passed that each delegate should be called on to declare his allegiance and determination to abide by the decision of the Ulterior Committee and they stated all except one that they would abide by the determination of the committee—I am not sure who that one was—I think his name was Horne—he gave a reason for it but I forget it—he came in nearly at the close of the business—Payne read another Utter from Lacey and in answer to some questions he stated that Lacey was still at Manchester—some of the delegates present asked how long he was going to continue there and Payne replied as long as was necessary—I think but am not sure that there was a return given in at that meeting of the number of cartridges that were prepared—I have no note of it I go from memory—a resolution was passed that they should meet at Perry s coffee-house Church-street Bethnal-green on Friday Aug 11th at eight o clock—I went and found no meeting—when I entered the coffee-room I saw a person busy in packing up some chairs—he knew me and said there was no meeting that it was all up that the police had been to Rose s house and seized his papers— the same person who told me that had been stationed on the Sunday as one of the telegraphs—the next meeting 1 attended was at the Orange Tree Orange-street Red Lion-square on Monday night 14th—I went up stairs—I have not kept a memorandum of the persons who attended but to the best of my belief there were twenty-five persons there—they were Mullins Brewster Payne Gurney Fay Ritchie Scurry Cuffey and others whose faces I knew but not their names—a report was given in from some new delegates of the state of their localities and of the number of fighting men the number of ball-cartridges that each delegate himself had prepared and also the members of his locality—the number was 5000 fighting men of Chartists alone and the number of cartridges was between 500 and 600—a question was asked about the number of Irish Confederates and Mullins said they were about the same number as the Chartists—a resolution was proposed I think by Mullins and carried that a deputation of two Ritchie and Scurry should wait on the North-western Railway engineers to ascertain what were their feelings and how far they were disposed to come over ad join the Chartists in their movement—they were to ascertain that if possible and they were requested by no means to give them the least ides what was their purpose in going there to wait on them—it was mentioned that there was a dispute between the company and the men—I did not know of that till that evening—Mullins proposed and it was resolved that each delegate should select four or six men or as many as he could get men whom he could depend on that would do anything and everything—some one asked what purpose they were for and Cuffey said to fire houses railway premises trains or anything—Mullins then looked up as the gas which was burning at the time and said If I look up at the gas you will all know what I mean —neither Ritchie or Scurry were present when that was resolved—they had left on their deputation and the sum of 1s 6d had been voted to defray their expenses in the way of refreshments—I am not certain it was put to the vote but I know 1s 6d was paid—they were not present when the last part of this occurred—Cuffey was secretary to the Ulterior Committee at this time—he stated so himself that evening—Brewster s conduct was not altogether becoming and Cuffey said As secretary I have a right to rebuke you or something to that effect—the meets adjourned to the Lord Denman on the next evening—I went about eight or a little before accompanied by Gurney—Payne Mullins Brewster Cuffey Dowling Allnut Fay Gurney Lacey Ritchie Page Ferdinando and others in all about forty were present—I saw some new faces and I believe tier were delegates and there were one or two that I knew were not delegates—Lacey stood with others near a window and he began to tell us about the people in the country—he said that the men of Birmingham and Manchester and I think he said Liverpool were up and doing or would be doing that night—that he had been watched all day by the police and that on coming out of the door a boy came up to him and told him that he had been watched by the police for two or three hours and he said he had given them the double and reached the place in safety—I had never seen him before—I asked him his name and he said Lacey—about half an hour afterwards Brewster distri-buted coloured wristbands exactly such a one as this produced was given to me—Mullins was present and I also think he distributed some—Brewster—said they were for the delegates to wear on their left wrists that their members might know them—about half an hour after the distribution as far as my memory furnishes me Fay came in and brought a person of the name of Donaldson a member of our locality who had no right to be there—I believe Fay had not been there before on that evening—Donaldson not being a delegate had no right to be present—he went by the name of Donaldson—he bad not been long seated before they called for a pint of porter—some of the ulterior Committee I believe Cuffey and Payne came in shortly after—I had not seen them before—before Fay came in there was a question asked where the Committee should retire to as the room up stairs was occupied by singing—that was after the distribution of colours—there was a talk of the Committee going somewhere else and Lacey said There is a neighbouring coffee-shop kept by a person I know I will go and see if we can have the room —he left for that purpose—he came back directly and said he had engaged the room—Payne Brewster Mullins Cuffey and Lacey then went—they were away half or three-quarters of an hour—Lacey did not return with them—I did not see him again that evening—they returned after Fay had come into the room—Mullins acted as chairman and spokesman—Cuffey said to him Now Mr Chairman you had better give the instructions —Mullins then said Gentlemen as you are aware the Committee have retired and come to certain resolutions and decisions they have requested me to give you the following instructions Our friend Mr Lacey has informed us that the men of Birmingham and Manchester are up and doing or will be doing to-night and we have no reason to doubt the correctness of his statement therefore Gentlemen to-morrow night you must come out to fight and strike the blow it is necessary you should speak out honestly and boldly for there must be no flinching in the matter —Cuffey said My time is short my men are waiting I take the western division you had better put it round the room one by one and let them answer yes or no —Mullins then asked the man on ray right Will you come out to fight —he said Yes —he-appealed to me and I said Yes —he then went round and put the question to every delegate till he came to Ferdinando who stood up and spoke and gave some reason why he would not come out—he said No —the companion delegate to Allnutt whose name I do not know also answered No —he did not give any reason—those were the only two exceptions—at this time all those I have named were present except Lacey—Mullins then said We shall take up four positions Clerkenwell-green the Tower Hamlets Broadway Westminster and the Seven Dials —Brewster was to take Clerkenwell-green Payne the Tower Hamlets and Mullins and Bassett the Broadway and Seven Dials but which each was to take of the two I cannot say—Mullins then said Gentlemen every delegate must assemble the members of his locality armed at their localities at eight o clock to-morrow night precisely —some delegate asked how they were to get there with their pikes—Mullins said I can only say get them there the best way you can and every delegate must be with his members at their respective positions at twenty minutes past nine to a second —he then went on to say that the different localities that were divided into different districts were to meet each of the four leaders who were to have charge of the four districts—Brewster was to have Clerkenwell and the City Cripplegate and Finsbury localities were to meet Brewster at Clerkenwell-green—there were different districts assigned to the four positions—Mullins I believe proposed Ritchie to be the man to superintend and direct the four or six men for firing that I have spoken of before—that was carried—I think Mullins mentioned firing that evening because there were some new delegates came in that did not understand—they were to meet at the Orange Tree at five o clock the next evening—the number of firing-men amounted to forty-six altogether and they were to meet Ritchie at the Orange Tree—a question was asked how they would know Ritchie without a pass-word and some delegate proposed the words Frost and Mitchell as a pass-word—Allnutt proposed the word Justice instead—that was carried and when each man went and opened the door at the Orange Tree Ritchie was to ask him Who do you want what do you want and the answer was to be the word Justice and by that Ritchie would know them—I was asked among the others how many firing-men I could bring and I said I had spoken to two one of those was included in the number forty-six—Gurney said Oh nonsense you can find six or eight I can find more —I was rather struck with his taking me up so soon and I said I know best —I knew I can only speak to these two men—I did not mention their names—the others were asked the same question—the delegates had put the colours in their pockets I suppose there might have been colours given to those who came in subsequently but I did not see any—I received one that night—I kept it till I gave it up to the party I was in communication with—I showed it to a person in authority about two hours after I left the Lord Denman—I remember attending a meeting on 20th July last at the Black Last or Jack I am not certain which in sow street in Lincoln s-inn-square—I do not know the name of the street—it is a house that lies rather in the corner of some street—I can hardly describe it—I do not think I have been in the neighbourhood before or since—when I attended on the 20th there were fourteen people present Payne Brewster Rose Mullins Dowling a delegate from Greenwich myself Battice another confederate Allnutt and one or two strangers—I do not know the name of the delegate from Greenwich—his name was mentioned but it has escaped my memory it was his first time of attendance—the meeting commenced about nine o clock in the evening or it might be a little later—it lasted until twelve or ten minutes past—it was in a longish room with a very high ceiling ornamented at both ends with a sort of canopy—it had the appear-ance of a club-room—that was the first meeting of delegates I attended—I was asked for credentials and produced the leaf of a book which Bezer had given me—when he gave it me he made a statement—I gave the leaf to Payne who was chairman—he compared it with his book and then said That will do —there was no writing on it—it appeared to match with what was left in the book—at that meeting a Committee of five was appointed to draw up five plans of action Fay Brewster Rose Mullins and Dowling—I attended a meeting on 23rd July at Dennis s coffee-house Great St Andrew-street Seven Dials—Dowling Brewster Rose and Mullins were there and Payne accompanied me there—there was on that day a meeting of the Committee before the meeting of the general body of delegates—some plans were produced—this produced is the very identical plan that Mullins produced—Dowling said he thought he should not be able to undertake the management of the Seven Dials—the Seven Dials is shown in this plan—I afterwards saw Mullins put this plan into his pocket-book and put it into his pocket—before that it was handed to three or four of them—I noticed there was something spoken about barricades—these lines where the crosses are were pointed out as barricades—Brewster said that to buss barricades you must build them halfway down the street—this was matter of conversation among us—there was no decision come to—a map of London was produced—they each had papers in their hands but I did not see what they were—this is the one that was discussed and talked about—after the meeting of the Committee the delegates were admitted—there were ten persons present—Payne took the chair—he made a statement previous to the delegates coming in — MR BALLANTINE objected to this statement being given it being made privately in the Committee and not in the presence of the delegates The COURT expressing a doubt of its admissibility it teas not pursued —After the delegates came in Mullins who was vice-chairman said he was sorry that the plans were not sufficiently matured for their inspection Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q I believe you went by the name of Johnson at these meetings A I did—that was the only name I went by but there was a person that called me Robinson one evening at Cartwright s—I said Call me anything you like it is all the same —that was the only night I went by the name of Robinson that is the only name I have ever gone by except my own—I am thirty-three years of age—I do not remember going by any other name I cannot at this moment say positively—I never went by any name but Johnson among the Chartists—I have gone by the name of the Welch Novice but not by any other surname—I joined this Association soon after April—I did not take notes of the meetings at Cartwright s locality—I made notes of the meeting of 20th July about two days after in this book—it did not exceed two days—I did not take those notes by the desire of anybody I took them of my own accord—I did not show them to anybody after I had taken them I am certain about that—I do not think I took notes of the meeting on 23rd I cannot remember—I have not destroyed any of the notes I made—I know these notes were taken either the next day after the meeting or the day after—these are the only notes I took handing them to the Counsel —all I put down on July 23rd was the names of the persons present—what I have stated is partly from recollection and partly from the book—what is down I put down and I have remembered the rest—I did not put it all down at the same time—the memorandum of 23rd July was all put down at the same time and with the same pen—sometimes I wrote it at different periods of the same day—I may have put down a part on 23rd and forgotten a part and put that down next day—that was not the case on each of the occasions it may have happened on other occasions—I communicated to the police from time to time what was going on—I never showed them my notes they never asked me—I never showed my notes till I went before some of the authorities—I think that was before the prisoners were taken—I do not remember showing my notes to any one as early as 5th Aug I will not swear I did not—I have never altered them since they have been shown to the authorities I forget when they were shown to the authorities—by the authorities I do not mean the Magistrate but another party I am not bound to state his name—I did not show that person my notes—I joined this Asso ciation for the purpose of gaining information and giving information to the authorities—I am a carpenter—I have always had plenty of work to do—I make about 27s a week—I have a wife and family and have a little property coming in—I was not driven by poverty to join these people I did it from a desire to communicate their proceedings—I did not communicate that desire to anybody before I joined them—I entered of my own accord—I was not desirous of having the name of spy but I was determined to acquaint the authorities with what was going on—I went in for that purpose not to betray them but to communicate what was going on—I do not like the word betray any more than I do the word spy —I considered that there were parties there that were not scrupulous of what they would do—I did it for the public benefit and nothing else—I did it for the good of my country—I did not expect to get anything by it I was not in a position to be necessitated—I have received 1l a week since I have been obliged to be kept out of the way from personal danger—there is nothing else to come I do not expect a farthing—it is not as good as carpentering—I have been a carpenter for the last eleven years—before that I was a bed-pillar carver—I have been connected with the turf and been rather a sporting man as a pedestrian—it was then I was called the Welch Novice—I am a descendant of Welchmen—I ran a race I did not lose it or win it—I did not get persons to back me—I went out for my own amusement to the place and I was asked to run to amuse the party it was merely for a draw to a public-house—that was not the only sporting matter in which I have been concerned—it was announced in the paper by a party who I knew nothing of that there was to be a celebrated runner—I went there out of curiosity it was only done to draw custom to the house—I professed then to be a bit of a runner and I profess to be so now—I was not a celebrated runner—I was also at Wimbledon once for the same purpose—the other was at Hounslow—I have also run at Croydon still as the Welch Novice—that was merely for a day s amusement and for which I was well remunerated—I believe those are all the sporting matters in which I have been engaged—I know what thimble-rig means—I was never in that line I swear that—I was never with a thimble-rig table at races I have looked on at a table—I do not exactly know what a decoy is—I have played at a table—I neither won nor lost—I was paid so much a day for playing at the table it was not at a thimble-rig table but a marquee-table where they play with balls—I expected you would ask me about this and I am willing to state everything and all I know of the affair—that was the only time I was ever at such a place—I received 30s and it was on account of my master that I went there—it was to stand at the table take the money and pretend to bet—I was young and quite ignorant of the nature of these proceedings—it was just before I was out of my time I was nearly twenty-one—I went more for a holiday—my master had a relation named Durdon and my master s brother was in the habit of attending the races with Durdon and my master said to me Tom how would you like a holiday —I said Very well master —he said Well I can get you one if you like to go you must not let the old man know anything of it if you like to go with Durdon to the races you can and you shall be paid 30s for your time and your expenses and with that I went with my master s brother who was a door-keeper and that was the only time in my life that I ever did anything of the sort—I knew that I was not in reality betting—I did not consider myself a cheat—of course I was pretending to bet in order to deceive people—I do not deny that—I never swindled persons—I never had a farthing—I do not know who did—I do not know whether there was any money won or lost—I swear that—I do not think I was in there the whole three days—it was a three day s race—it was at Ascot races—I kept running in and out of the marquee to see the races more than to stop there and there was a great disturbance with one of the parties about my going out—I was never at any other rovlette-table than that—I never played at a thimble-rig- table and never associated with those sort of men—I know Richard Pennell—I never told him that I had walked a match against Townsend the pedertrian and sold the parties who backed me because I could get more money on the other side—I never walked for any money I am certain of that merely to draw custom to the house—I was once a witness at this Court about eight years ago in the case of a party for picking a gentleman s pocket —I happened to see it—I never said to any one on that occasion that I Was frightened about being asked about my thimble-rigging—my father is dead—I have been in the employment of my brother-in-law Mr Smith—I have only been engaged a week for another party within the last eleven years—Smith keeps many men—I do not think those men knew that 1 was at all connected with this matter—I never persuaded a man to join it—they are quite capable of joining it without my persuasion—James Paris is Mr Smith s foreman—I never told him that I was employed by thimble-rig men nor anything of the kind nor that I was employed by the police against the thieves—I never said to him that I had been a witness at the Old Bailey and was afraid the Counsel would question me about having communication with a thimble-rig man and I would never appear again—I have occasionally talked to Paris about religions natters—I never expressed my entire unbelief in a God or in the Scriptures or in our Saviour nor anything of the kind I always have believed and do believe now—I told Paris that it was likely he would hear something remarkable—I do not think I told him I expected there would be a rising—he has not taxed me directly with being a spy—he has said something like it—I thought that he threw out hints but I took no further notice of it—I once got about 1lb of lead from Mr Smith my brother-in-law—that was for the purpose of casting bullets for Gurney our warden—he had asked me on several occasions for bullets—he was casting them himself and made cartridges himself—I got the lead because he wanted to get as many made as possible for him to take care of for the day of rising—I cast the bullets at my own house—one of my boys about ten years old was present—he did not know what purpose I had the bullets for—he asked what I was doing them for and of course I made him no answer—I took care of the bullets after I had cast them and gave them to Gurney—I think those were the only bullets I cast—I received 4s from our locality for the purpose of buying cartridge-paper and powder and Gurney had received 5s 8d for that purpose on a previous occasion—he did not employ me to get that—the 4s worth is all that I have bought—I am not aware that I had any nickname among my fellow-shopmen—I do not remember that I was called Lying Tom —I should say it was not likely—I never heard it—I never had it put to my face—if they did call me so it was unknown to me—this is the first I have heard of it—if they had said such a thing to my face I should have resented it and that they knew well enough—a person named Thomas Osborne worked for Smith—I never told him that there was to be a Chartist rising and never urged him to join me or others of the men in his presence—I do not remember doing such a thing—I will not swear I have not—I may have done it and forgotten it—I cannot remember pointing out to Osborne a man who would make him a pike—I remember being at a meeting at Birdcage-walk and a person named Hook was there and there was a person there who was a blacksmith and I think I did speak about such a thing then—I think I have some recollection of pointing out to Osborne a man that would make him a pike—I believe I did—I do not know what the pike was to be for—I will explain how it was—there was a meeting at Birdcage walk one Sunday morning and Osborne came up to look on out of curiosity and he entered into conversation about Pennell having slandered his character and what a disturbance Pennell bad caused in the Carpenter s Society—we fell into conversation on Chartism and Hook spoke to this blacksmith to make a pike for him and I believe I did mention If you want such a thing there is a blacksmith can make it —that was bow it took place—I think it was to Osborne I said this but I am not certain—I do not know whether he meant to have one or if he had one what he would do with it—I had no idea COURT Q What made you imagine that Osborne wanted one A Why the conversation came up about one thing or another and Osborne began his joking and talking about his being a Chartist or something of that sort and I dare say I did say that—I do not deny it MR BALLANTINE Q Do you know Alfred Carr A I do—I never old him if I could get a chance in a crowd I would rip the police s b - - guts up with a chisel nothing of the kind—Carr was in my brother-in-law s service about six years ago—I believe my father was alive at that time—Carr caused great disturbance in our house through his conduct my father and I have had one or two quarrels I never struck him I pushed him—he came and struck me a violent blow and I was so hurt in my feelings that I of course turned round and put my hand on his collar and struggled with him to kepp him away from me—I never pushed him down—I did not say to him You old b - - I will murder you —no such words ever cars out of my lips—I struggled with him—my brother-in-law came and separated us—my father was about sixty-two or sixty-three at that time—he was a strong able-bodied man—he died about two years and a half after that—I had an uncle I had had quarrels with him I have been bound over to keep the peace towards him—I may have spoken to Pennell about my father—I never told him that I hoped my father s soul was in hell nor anything of lit kind—I do not think I have ever spoken to Pennell about the Government—he is a man that is well known he has caused a great deal of disturbance in the shop from time to time—he is not in the shop now—my brother-in-law discharged him—I never told Pennell that the Government was a weak and b - - y Government and I would send Lord John Russell and Sir George Grey to the devil in a short time—I never said anything of that kind to him about a fortnight before 10th April—I do not think I saw him anything near that time—I do not believe I have seen him above twice for this six or seven months—he has been discharged a long time—the only time I can remember was meeting him one night in Pitfield-street as I was going home—I swear I did not meet him about ten minutes past six one morning about a for night before 10th April—I do not believe I did I cannot swear it—I did not stop him and ask him if he was a member of the Chartists—I do not believe I ever asked him such a question if I did it was while he was in mv brother-in-law s service not since—he never asked me to propose him as a member nor did I tell him that delegates would be chosen in about a fortnight to agitate the country—I never told him that I should get from 2l to 3l a week which would be far better than working at Smith s—I never asked him to go to Cartwright s—he did not say that the Chartists would never get the Charter in the way they were going on—I did not say to him Look at the Queen with her hundreds of thousands a year spending in waste and idleness while we are obliged to work from morning to night to get a mouthful of bread —I never spoke to him about the Queen—I may have done so when we were at work six or seven years ago—I do not believe I ever said such a thing—I never said I would blow her and the b - - y foreigner to hell—I never used such words to any person whatever nor any expressions of that kind—I never asked him to call at my bouse on the Sunday morning and I would show him materials sufficient to blow London to hell in half an hour—I never saw him to ask him such a question—I do not remember showing him any printed bill—I know James Bennett a shoemaker living at Leonard-square Shoreditch—I do not think I saw him two or three days or a week before 10th April I might it is very likely I did I cannot say whether it was two or three days it might have been a fortnight before—he was in the habit of mending shoes for me and my children and very likely I may have seen him about job to do to my shoes—I do not remember speaking to him about 10th April—I was not intimate with him and never knew he was a Chartist until 10th April—all I knew of him was that he used to mend my shoes and my children s—I do not think I asked him what he intended to do on 10th April—I cannot swear I did not—I do not think he told me he was going to Kennington Common—I do not believe I asked him if he intended to go armed—I will not swear I did not—I do not remember his replying Certainly not —I cannot swear he did not—my belief is that no such conversation at all passed—I think I saw him here on Saturday—I swear I did not say to him You are a b - - y fool if you do not as I shall go armed —I am quite certain of that—I swear that no words of the kind passed—to the best of my belief I never had a word with the man about going armed—I believe I had said to him that I had been making hand-grenades that would go halfway through an inch board that was one night coming from a meeting in Holborn—I cannot remember what night it was—it was not since these meetings have taken place—it was not so recently as Aug —it might have been between May and June but I do not know you confuse me rather in going from one thing to another I will answer any question as far as my memory will enable me—I do not think it was before 10th April I cannot say it was not I do not know when it was—I had not been making hand-grenades—it came up in conversation between Watson and him—Watson had a brass-barrelled short gun with him and it came up in conversation about grenades and the ink-bottles and such like and I remember speaking to him about it but 1 never had such a thing or made such a thing—I said so for talking sake—I do not often indulge myself in that way—he was telling me many things that I considered were stupid and untrue and I thought I would do the same—it was merely pastime—I did not tell him how they were made he knew that—I believe I did say how I made them it was all a lie—I was never called Lying Tom to my face—I never made a hand-grenade in my life—I told Bennett that I made them by putting powder into a small ink-bottle and putting a sort of fizgig gap to it—I never filled bottles with stout nails and I do not think I ever said so—I am sure I did not—I did not say that anything was to be done with these hand-grenades—I dare say we were all busy talking about their being thrown among the police I think it was so—I dare say I said to Bennett that a blacking-bottle was as good as anything half-filled with powder and well mixed with stout nails—there were many things said by us all in the course of conversation—I do not think I said that by lighting the fusee and throwing it among the police it would break the b - - s legs—I went to Kennington-common on 10th April—it was the first meeting I was ever at in my life—I did not go armed I swear that—I had nothing with me whatever—I do not remember meeting Bennett in Chiswell-street about a week after the conversation I have referred to—I do not remember meeting him at all in Chiswell-street or meeting him at all shortly after that conversation—I never told him that I had got ten men and that with four or five more I could easily take the Artillery-ground—I never told him any such thing—I never told him that I had prepared a plan or said anything to him about a plan or map nothing of the kind nor that my men knew how to spike the artillery—I have seen Bennett at Cartwright s—I do not know a person named John Westmoreland a master-lor of 75 Watling-street—I do not know Thomas Antill— Antill was here called in —I know that man well but I do not know his name—he is not a member of our locality—I do not remember asking him whether he had seen the Northern Star I will not swear I did not—I do not recollect saying to him that O Connor was a b——coward for he recommended peaceable means and that the National Assembly should be postponed—I will not swear I did not I might have said it I do not think I did—I do not remember Antill asking me what I meant by that nor do I remember asking him whether he was prepared—I never recognized him as a member and never knew his name—I have seen him in and out of Cartwright s and that is all—I did not tell him to procure arms as soon as possible and if all working men were prepared as I was they would soon upset the b - - Government—I swear no such words were ever uttered by me to him—I never spoke to him above twice—I never said anything to him about the b - - Government—I never told him if he wanted gunpowder I would supply him with it nor did he say he was a peaceable and quiet man and would have nothing to do with it—I never had any such conversation with him—he was turned out of one of our meetings at Cartwright s locality—the first time I ever spoke to him was when he impudently came into the secret meeting there and he said Why am I not allowed to be here I have a much right as that man pointing to another individual and there was great confusion at the time and astonishment at his impudence in wanting to she there without being a member of the locality—he came into the secret meeting—anybody could come in if they liked to have the impudence to come through Cartwright s back place—he was a man that had impudence enough to come and he was turned out by force in fact it was with some difficulty they got him down stairs—that was not in April—if you will lend me my book I will give you the date—I think I can refer to the very meeting referring to his book it was on Sunday afternoon 30th July—I swear 1 had no such conversation with him in April as you have referred to—I do not know George Thurston by name—there are many persons whose faces I know but not their names—I do not know this looking at a plan I never saw it before it is not my drawing—I do not know Westmoreland—I never gave such a thing as this to anybody and never drew a thing like it—I have drawn plans to ascertain what the plans were which I heard of among the different members of the locality—I heard that there was a secret meeting sitting and that there was a plan they were going to operate upon and I drew out a plan for the purpose of ascertaining whether there was plan of the kind—I believe that was about June or July—I drew a plan of one circle—I had heard that there were to be four or five mock meetings and sham demonstrations at Bishop Bonner s-fields and hearing of that and also that there was to be an assassination of the police in the night I was determined to try and find out what this secret meeting was and what plan it was they had got in operation—that was why I drew the plan—I showed it to person named Mayne and tore it up by his direction—he said I would not have you get yourself into danger you had better tear it up —he is a person who is frequently at Cartwright s—it was not before the affair in Bishop Bonner s-fields that I showed it him that was the only one and that I showed to three or four at Cartwright s on purpose to ascertain what was going on—I do not remember saying to anybody that I should want him and that he must bring something with him—I had a pair of pistols—I did have them on 13th Aug —I exchanged them for another pair in Holborn or the Strand and paid 2s 6d I forget when— George Thurslon was here called in —I do not know that man by name I know him by sight—I have no recollection of asking him if he was a Chartist—I will not swear I did not—I do not think I ever offered to sell him a pair of pistols for 6s —I will not swear I did not—I swear I did not offer to do so on 13th Aug —I do not believe I offered to do so some time in Aug —I will not swear I did not—I swear not offer them to him after 13th Aug because I think I had not had then for two months before that time—I did not offer that if he would buy the pistols I would give him half-a-pound of powder into the bargain—I never offered him any powder or any one and never gave or offered any one any powder except Gurney—I was never a member of the Wat Tyler Club—I have heard of it but do not know where it exists—I never attended any of their meetings—I do not know where it is held—I know a public-house at Hoxton—I am not a member of any club held there—I have attended meetings there—it is a beer-shop—I do not know the sign—I have only attended one meeting there that I remember—it was of Chartists—I do not know when it was—it was some time ago—I believe it was after April—I cannot say whether it was May or June—I do not know Henry Green a working-man—I recollect the meeting at Bonner s-fields—I cannot say whether it was on that day that I attended the meeting at the public-house at Hoxton—I have attended perhaps two or three meetings at Bonner s-fields—I cannot say whether I attended one on Sunday 23rd April—I know Dennis Dwaine by being at Cartwright s—I never was intimate with him—I do not think I said of him that he was a b - - Government spy—I do not think I ever uttered such words I cannot swear I did not—I do not believe I ever said he was a b - - Government spy a milk-and-water moral-force b - - and ought to be kicked out—the man gave me offence—I do not believe I ever used such words of him—I will not swear anything of the kind I believe I did not—I was not likely to use such words—my memory is Dot sufficient I may forget it—it may have come out of my mouth but it is not likely I do not think it was uttered by me—there were extraordinary characters at Cartwright s—it is a complete den of infamy and the characters there would surprise any moral man—I noticed them with astonishment from my being a moral man— Westmoreland was here called in —I knew that man in that locality—I did not give him this plan—I have talked to him about a plan—I showed him the plan which I tore up—it was not the same size and shape as this—it was a large plan—I swear I did not sketch this very plan in Westmoreland s presence—I never saw it till you produced it—I have not seen a plan about the same size and shape—I do not know what it means I have no idea—it is done with black lead pencil—I have seen nothing like it—I can hardly recollect now what mine was a plan of—it was a circle with a ring in it—nothing was in the ring—it was not filled up at all only some dots which were to represent people standing in the circle—I do not know what points they were to stand at it was merely a rough thing sketched by myself just the idea which presented itself to my mind because I heard they had got plans and were going to have meetings and I drew the plan just to ascertain what their plans were—mine was only a piece of paper just to see if there were any plans in preparation—the dots in the centre were not to represent Chartists particularly or policemen they were merely people in a circle—it was for no other purpose—I did not fill up the whole circle with dots only just a few—there was nothing written on it—lean hardly recollect whether any lines except the circular line were drawn on it—it was torn up—I have given as far as I am able about it—I do not remember any lines my memory is so bad—I did not show Westmoreland the large plan and take a pencil and sketch this small one from it—I do not remember seeing any lines at all on my large plan there were no lines at all—I know John Collins—he is a very noisy and desperate character in the locality—he does not want much encouragement to go on—I have not informed against him—I did not tap him on the shoulder one day and tell him there was a grand meeting and no one was to attend but those prepared to fight for their rights—I do not remember saying to him in my life Are you coming up stairs to-night there is a grand meeting and no one is to come but those prepared to fight for their rights —I will not swear such words were not uttered by me—I do not recollect saying to him Are you prepared or his answering I do not know what you mean Mr Johnson —I might have said such words—I swear I never said to him I have a very handsome dagger which I will make you a present of to keep against you want it —I am sure of thatI never had a dagger and never said I had one—I never said If you and others will join me I will lead you and show you the way to over throw the b - - Government —I saw him on 16th Aug outside Cartwright s—I did not see him inside—I do not know whether he was drinking a cup of tea—he was standing on the pavement—I did not say to him Don t be in a burry to go away from here to-night —I swear that—he did go away—I did not ask him to stop—he did not say I am in no more hurry to-night than any other night —I said Is there to be a meeting to-night up stairs there are a great many strangers round and he said No I do not think there is —I of course knew that at eight o clock the members of the locality were to be assembled—I merely asked Collins that out of curiosity on the spur of the moment—I did not want to know—I did not ask anybody else—I may know a person named George Medlock— he teas here called in —I knot his face—I may have seen him at Cartwright s on Monday 14th Aug I cannot recollect—I have no recollection of saying to him Ain t you going up stairs nor of his replying No I believe the room is engaged by the cigar-makers for a trade meeting —such a thing might have passed—I forget whether the room was engaged for such a purpose on 14th Aug —I do not think I went up saying to Medlock I will soon have them out —I do not recollect seeing or speaking to the man at all that night—I will not swear I did not say so—I do not recollect returning and saying I will serve out those moral force b - - rs there is Gill and another moral force b— —I do not think such words were ever uttered by me to that chap—I will not swear I did not say so—I may have said it and forgotten it—I know Gill—I was at Cartwright s on the 14th Fay and I went there together—our business was when we left the Orange Tree meeting to make arrangements for the men for firing and we went into Cartwright s back-place—Gill Donaldson Carter and two or three others were there and I was ties accused of being a spy—Carter asked me how it was that I went by the name of Johnson and not by my right name Powell—Gill said I have looked at the books and I don t see either the name of Johnson Robinson Powell it is very strange you should clear this matter up —there was some talk between us and it was arranged that Fay and Donaldson should inqnire into where I lived and what was my right name and be satisfied upon it—I believe that was all that transpired that evening and I went home shortly after—I do not know who it was that charged me with being a spy—I did not admit it—I said If you have any reason to doubt that I am not what I am go and make inquiry at my place of work my real name is Powell but I have gone by the name of Johnson so that my brother-in-law and friends should not know that I have entered the Chartists at all —I do not know Henry Green by sight I know him by name—I know Bryant—I was standing outside Cartwright s early on Wednesday evening 16th Aug —I do not know that Bryant saw me there and asked what was the matter—I never saw Bryant there at all that night to my recollection I am sure I did not—I did not say to him Don t take any notice of me I think it is a botched job by these milk and water b - - s —I do not recollect savin such words—I will not swear I did not—I never saw Briant there that evening—I do not remember saying to anybody We expect to have a turn out to-night or saying that a signal rocket was to be fired between nine and ten o clock and the people were to be turned out—I do not believe I mentioned such a thing as the word rocket or anything that night for I was very much alarmed for my own safety—I will not swear I did not say so—I do not think I said These bl—st—d milk and water b - - s must have sold the job and I think the delegates must have been nailed in Orange-street —I do not think I uttered any such words to any living being because I was desirons of screening my person from being seen as much as possible—it is not likely I should say so—I do not remember it—I will not swear I did not—I may have said it and forgotten it—I know a man named Briant who keeps a coffee-house—I think I walked up Chiswell-street and into Finsbury-stjuare on the night of 16th Aug between ten and eleven with a person and 1 believe it was the man I spoke to on the subject of firing—I do not know Ms name—I showed him sixty-eight ball-cartridges—I did not say to him that I bad 200 fire-balls to throw into people s houses—I believe I produced a small tin box from my pocket—I am not quite sure—there were not some small paper parcels in it—they were percussion caps—I have them at home now—I did not tell him they were band-grenades and that I had 200 more of them—I pulled out a pistol and showed it him—I had a sword in my coat-pocket at the side—I showed him the handle of it—I did not pull it out—I might have said You see I am well prepared for them are you —I do not believe I did—he wanted to have them from me to load them—I had this pistol and sword by me for the purposes of safety and the cartridges too—I put the cartridges into my pocket so that nobody should see them or get hold of them and the sword I carried about with me for my own-safety to defend myself if I was attacked because I suspected I was found out—I carried the pistol in my pocket—it was not loaded—I carried that to take care of it—I showed them to this man merely for pastime nothing else—I did not know that the men were then at tie Orange Tree—I knew that they were betrayed—this man was to have been at the Orange Tree for firing but he would not go—that bad been arranged on the night previous—I did not want him to go—I had given him the orders the night previous to go—I knew that the men were taken when I was with him—I know Daniel Byrne— he was here called in —I suppose he is a working man—I have heard that he is something in the coach way—I do not think I ever showed him any pistols I did not show fan any on 10th April—I do not think he has ever seen any pistols belonging to me—I do not believe I ever showed him any pistols I will not swear I did not—I will swear I did not do so on 10th April before going to the Ken-nington-common meeting or a weapon of any kind—I do not believe I did at any time I will not swear I did not—I did not generally carry cartridges about me—I do not think I ever did unless I carried them to give to Gurney—they were cartridges made by Gurney and given to me to fill with powder—they were the only cartridges I ever had in my possession—I will swear I never said to Daniel Byrne and to others in his hearing that I wished the people would assassinate the police and fire the houses I do not remember such words being used—I will swear I never said any such thing to him—I do not believe I said it to anybody I will not swear I did not—I do not think I ever said that I wished the people would assassinate the police—I swear I have not said it a dozen times or half a dozen—I do not believe I have said it three times—I might have said it but I do not think I did—I was always rather as a friend to the police and I believe that was generally known—it is possible I might have said it to Byrne but I feel quite sure I never did it was not likely I should—I was at a meeting at the Milton-street Theatre—I did not some time before that show Byrne a pair of pistols—I never showed him a pair of pistols in my life I swear that nor yet one pistol I think I will not swear I did not—I never said to him that I wished to see all the police assassinated and to have some good fires in London—I never said any such words in my life nor did I say showing the pistols These are the things that will do for them nothing of the kind—I do not believe such words or that any conversation passed with him or in his presence I will not swear it did not—I know a man named Carter—I do not remember saying to him that I should want four desperate men who would do any kind of work yes I think I did it was at the meeting in the back-room at Cartwright s on the Monday night if that was the time I was charged with being a spy—I will not swear it but I think I did—that was the order I had given to me at the Orange Tree meeting to speak on the subject of firing—I think I did say it—Carter may have said You won t have me —I do not believe he did I never asked him—it was a sort of order given to me and I was obliged to tell those who were assembled in the room—Fay was present—it was spoken privately among ourselves among the council—I do not remember showing Carter a plan of London I will not swear I did not—if I showed him any plan it was that plan of the circle and the small circle in the middle—I never showed him a plan of London I might have showed him that small plan for the purpose of ascertaining who the parties were that were drawing up some plans—I cannot recollect when I showed it him—it was not on 16th Aug or 15th or 14th—I do not think it was any time in Aug —I do not know a person named Goodfellow a tailor—I did not meet a young man on 14th Aug and tell him that I was going to Australia and wanted an outfit— Goodfellow was here called in —I never saw that man before in my life—I did not tell him that I was going to Australia that I wanted an outfit and that he was to come to the Orange Tree on Wednesday 16th nor did I give him a half-crown as earnest money nothing of the kind occurred—I never had any such conversation with anybody— a small piece of wood with a nail in it was here shown to the witness I have seen such a thing as this of my own making—I expected this would be produced—I made one like it and lent it to a person named Mayne—this appears to be the same—I will explain how it was—at a meeting at Cartwright s Brewster showed two articles of this description and I suspecting that some such articles were being made at Cartwright s made one—those that Brewster produced were twice as large as this—I asked who made them and Brewster told me he made them himself and told me they were made for the purpose of crippling the cavalry—I asked him to show me the action of then—he showed me the action by throwing them on the floor—there is apiece of lead in them which if thrown on the ground will always cause the point to be presented upwards—I have a similar thing in my pocket which I wish particularly to produce producing it —this was lent by me to Mayne and he never returned it—I made this last one within the last two months since the other has been kept away and not returned to me—it is made on a similar plan expecting that this would be produced and it is produced—I swear positively those are the only two I made—I made them in order to ascertain whether they were making such things at Cartwright s—I showed it to several persons at Cartwright s and have thrown it on the ground and on the table COURT Q How could your exhibiting that at Cartwright s enable you to discover whether they were making them or not A Because I expected there would be some produced like that MR BALLANTINE Q You did it for a trap then A I did it to detect tie parties if I possibly could who were making these sort of things to find out who they were—I did it knowing the solemn position I placed myself in—I do not think I ever said These are the things to throw among the troops of the b - - Government —I do not think the word b - - was used at all—I do not believe I said the troops of the Government or the mops of the Queen —I might have said They would do to throw among tie troops I do not say I did say so—I said that I had a large quantity at home—that was false—I wish to speak the truth now and confess what I have done—I dare say I told several falsehoods in the course of these proceedings—Gurney is in custody I went to him in his cell one of the turnkeys let me in—I believe I said to Gurney that if he would inform it would be better for his wife and children—I believe I did say those words—I am not exactly positive I am rather confused with so many questions—I cannot say whether any policemen were waiting outside—there were lots of police-nea in the yard—I did not as I came out of Gurney s cell say to a police-P nan It is no go or It won t do —nothing of the kind—I never spoke to say policeman coming out—I do not believe I said so to the turnkey or to anybody—I believe I said to Gurney that he his wife and family would all be made comfortable for their lives if he would inform and I told him to speak the truth all he knew about it—I had no authority whatever for saying that—it was untrue—it was done for him to state all he knew and for him to tell me what he knew of it—I did not mean to get all I could out of him and then tell it—I did not tell all that he said to me—I wanted him to tell all he knew about it because I thought he would be telling the truth and getting himself out of a scrape—I cannot tell what made me think so—I was not sent in—I was not requested to go—the turnkey let me in—I told him what it was for that I thought he would confess and tell all about it—I do not think that 1 said when I came out that it was no go but I will not swear—it—Gurney was put into a separate cell for me to speak to him—he was by himself when I saw him Q Have you been in England all your life A Except about three months about thirteen years ago—I went over with a friend named Rodder to New York and stayed there I think about a month—I was certainly not away four months altogether—my father was alive at that time—I did not know that he had any money at the Savings Bank—there was no charge against me about that before I went to America—I was married at that time—I did not take my wife—I had but one child—I only let two or three persons know that I was going—my father never made any complaint of some money having been taken out of the Savings Bank—there was money of my own which I drew out of the Funds—it was in my own name and I used my own name to get it out—I signed nobody else s name—it was money that had been given me by my father and put into the Stock-broker s hands in my name—I went to America a few days after I drew the money out—my father was very cross that I left my wife—when I came back I gave what money I had into my father s hands to take care of—I got back every farthing of it from him—his name was Howell Powell MR ATTORNEY-GENERAL Q You say this was about thirteen years ago A I think so—I think I had been married about eighteen months at that time—there had been some family differences and it prayed upon my spirits —I went wholly and solely to recruit my health—at the time I met Collins at Cartwright s on the evening of the 16th I knew that the parties at the Orange Tree had been apprehended—the people were talking about it all over the neighbourhood—I have not seen Carter here to-day—he did live in Moneyer-street—I have not seen Gill here—he is a shoemaker—I do not consider him a moral force Chartist—Fay was present when I said I should want four men or more to fire the town—Carter lived at 32 Moneyer-street East-road Hoxton and Donaldson lodged with him—Carter is a Chartist- Owen Jones was present at that time he is a tailor and lives at 5 Hoare-lane—I cannot remember whether it was on 23rd April that I pointed out to Osborne a man who would make a pike—it was most likely that there was a meeting on 23rd April at Birdcage-walk but I cannot remember JEMIMA HEATH My husband keeps a coffee-shop in Great Suffolk-street Blackfriars-road I know Mr Lacey—I remember the police searching my house—I will not be certain whether Lacey was there the day before that—he has frequently called—he did not come for anything particular—some persons came with him I do not know how many—they had four cups of coffee—they went up stairs into the public coffee-room—it was about eight o clock in the evening—they stayed about a quarter or half an hour tin then left—I do not think Lacey left with them but I will not be positive—I saw him sitting down in the room down stairs—I cannot say how long is stayed after the others left—it might be half an hour or longer—I cannot say whether this was on the day before my house was searched—it might be two or three days before—I really do not know—it was on a Tuesday I believe—Lacey did not come to our house on the following morning that I know of—I did not give him some pistols out of a cupboard in my house that day—I never had any pistols in my house—I did not put them into a basket for him—there were three pistols in the house but Mr Lacey never had any—they were my sister-in-law s—her name is Simmons—I took them to her a long-time ago before Lacey and his party came—I do not know whether Lacey came on the Wednesday or not—he was so frequently in the habit of coming that I did not take notice—there were not three powder-flasks there—there was only one and that is there now—I dare say the policemen saw it when they searched the house—it is an old one belonging to my sister-in-law—the lot was not sold for 10s 6d —I told several persons that she wanted to sell them as they were no good to her but she did not sell them—I to three or four constables staves at my house—a young man who lodged with me had them to paint for a gentleman named Alsop two or three months ago—he left them there and they are there now—they were for special constables—my sister-in-law lives in Church-street Bermondsey—she is a widow—her husband has been dead above two years Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q What was her husband A He once had belonged to a ship and then worked at the London Docks as a lumper—he bought the pistols when he was on board ship and that was how my sister-in-law became possessed of them—I know she has had them for ten or twelve years Nicholas Pearce superintendent of police and James Dowsitt gate the same evidence as in Dowling s case see pages 747—8 JOSEPH THOMPSON being re-examined produced the articles found by him at Ritchie s as in page 748 Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q I believe you searched Cuffeys garret A Yes—I have not produced all I found there—I have some papers but they are quite irrelevant—they are here somewhere—I have not judged of their relevancy—I have not kept them back—the landlord of Ritchie s room came in while I was searching it—it was the front kitchen—I believe he did not occupy any other part of the premises—the landlady is here—somebody showed us the room and the landlord came down afterwards—I think it was about half-past six o clock in the evening of the 16th that I searched after he had been apprehended at the Orange Tree—I did not know Powell at that time—I knew nothing of him—the landlord took up a bottle that was there—it was not on a little shelf near the powder-flask—I believe it was on the sideboard but I will not be positive—it was where all the things were standing on a shelf by the cupboard—I found that the first time I searched—I am sure of that—I went again next morning and found some tow and the little band that has been produced—it laid among some rags—I am sure I did not find the bottle the next day MR CLARKSON Q The bottle contained the powder and that you brought away when you first went A Yes COURT Q What did you find next morning A That band a piece of paper and one of these small books apparently the same that the cartridges are made of—it is not cut—I found the tri-coloured band against the window where he slept amongst some old rags and a filthy flannel shirt covered with termin—I looked at it over night but next morning 1 examined it more minutely—it was a very dirty miserable place Samuel Bohlin Anthony Rutt William Cockerill Samuel Harris Robert Smith Henry Baker John Collins Thomas Rogers and Edward Kendall repeated the evidence given by than on Bowling s trial See pages 748 9 THOMAS SLAYMAKER policeman L 124 I went to the Angel in Webber-street with the superintendent and the rest of the police—I searched George Cox and found this card in his coat-pocket— this certified the entrance of George Cox as a member of the National Charter Association on 3rd April 1848 JOHN HAYNES police-inspector gate the same evidence as in page 749 and produced the books and papers found at Lacey s from which several extracts we read referring to the bye-laws and regulations of the Wallace Brigade branch of the Chartist Association also a bill printed by Austin of Strutton Ground announcing a Sunday evening lecture at the Wallace Brigade branch held at the Charter Coffee-house Strutton Ground with blanks for the name of toe lecturer and the subject of the lecture some ladies visiting-cards cut in halves and sealed—a list of candidates for the Central Election Committee among were the names of Dr M Douall Ernest Jones Samuel Kydd Feargus O Connor Vernon Sharpe Shaw Lacey Bassett Fussell Cuffey Burn Donaldson Reynolds and others—a printed paper containing resolutions passed in favour of the Charter at a meeting at Southampton on 14th March 1848 the Mayor in the chair—and a letter addressed to Lacey from the chartists of Lower Worley complaining of the arrangements made for the defence of the Yorkshire prisoners who they were informed were to be defended by Mr Roberts for £250 and recommending that all the Chartist prisoners should be defended from one fund Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q Where were all these books and Papers found A In a box in the club-room—when Jones was taken he was talking to a man named Frederick Stokes who was remanded and discharged—nothing was found on him CHARLES WALKER police-inspector V I was at the Charter coffee-house at the apprehension of Jones—I saw him put his hand into his lefthand pocket and take out a pistol—I immediately seized hold of his hand and took it from him—I afterwards went with Kendall to his lodging at 20 Grey Coat-street and in a cupboard found four perfect pistol ball-cartidges JOSEPH THOMPSON re-examined I produce some papers which I found at Rose s house on 11th Aug —this plan was amongst them— this was the plan spoken to by Powell EDWARD HENRY EAGLE My father is collector to the Chartered-Gas-light Company I know Mullins by sight—I do not know what his profession is ray father has corresponded with him on the subject of business—I have always seen his letters and have formed an acquaintance with his hand writing MR PARRY Q Is by sight the only way you know him A The only way I have communicated personally with him respecting business when he has called at our house he lived somewhere in the neighbourhood—I have spoken to him several times—I have spoken to him about the letters I have received MR ATTORNEY-GENERAL Q Look at that plan and tell me if you believe that to be the hand-writing of Mullins A To the best of my belief it is his hand-writing Cross-examined by MR PARRY Q You have never seen him write I believe A I have not I only believed the letters I received to be in his hand-writing by his coming on that subject COURT Q He has corresponded with your father and you have spoken to him on the matters contained in those letters A Yes to the best of my belief this is the same hand-writing as those letters were These being put in were five plans the first was that spoken to by Powell with marks across the streets denoting barricades one was a rough plan of the Seven Dials one of Clerkenwell and two blank sheets headed Seven Dish and Clerkenwell The others were the two papers with the first syllables of names and numbers against them as in page 745 and two receipts for gas cotton THOMAS BARRETT I am a shoemaker and live at 17 Charles-street Lisson-grove I am a member of the Chartist Association—I belonged to the Robert Emmett Brigade—I joined it last Whit-sunday—they held their meetings at a beer-shop kept by Morgan in Praed-street Paddington and at a beer-shop kept by Breadon in Shouldham-street Edgware-road Marylebone—I know Mullins and have heard him on more than one occasion address the Chartist meetings at Breadon s—there were Chartists and confederates present—I heard him address a meeting on Sunday 13th Aug I heard him address meetings once or twice before on Sundays—at Breadon s—on 13th Aug I heard him tell the men to prepare for the crisis that was coming and that it was necessary for each man to make a small sacrifice to aid the Committee of Progress and that they would judge by their actions by the way they contributed how to act—I recollect a meeting at the same place Tuesday 15th Aug about eight o clock—Mullins did not speak then—there were about twenty people Chartists and confederates assembled there—I went from there to Morgan s and there were about twenty persons assembled there—they were waiting for the delegates to return and give instructions and orders it was so stated at the meeting—the delegates did not arrive while was there and a man named Smith took a cab and went to Kensal-green—I did not go with him—on Wednesday 16th Aug I attended a meeting at Morgan s in Praed-street—I went about eight—there were between twenty and thirty of our brigade present—they were waiting for—some delegates to come and give instructions—it was not mentioned exactly what for but it was generally understood—there were several things mentioned such as a break out —I went merely to see what was going on—I went from there to fireadon s in Sliouldbam-street and got there about a quarter to nine—I found about thirty people assembled there—Mullins came into the room while I was there—he was not there when I first got there—when he came in Smith who had gone away in the cab on the Tuesday was there—he clapped Mullins on the shoulder and said My boy I was afraid you were taken —Mullins said No they will only take me with my life —Mullins then nentaway—another man whose name I believe is Cruikshank came into the room and laid a musket on the table—I had seen him before on several occasions—I also saw two pikes and two pistols in the room—I saw no pike-handles—I heard orders given by Smith to the men to prepare and go to Seven Dials and Crown-street Soho at ten that night and their leaders would meet them there—a question was asked how the men could take their arms and the reply was in the best way they could—the word arms was used and tooth-picks as regarded pikes there was an inquiry whether they had got their tooth-picks ready—Mullins had retired when he first came into the room after what had passed between him and Smith—after a while Malhins came and looked into the room and then Smith ordered the people to go to Seven Dials—Mullins had looked into the room just before—this was after he had gone away as I stated—I did not see Mullins go away finally from the place—I do not know how he went away—he did not come in a third time—I saw a cab come there when he first arrived—the cab remained at the door—I do not know who went away in it—on the direction being given to go to Crown-street and Seven Dials the people went away in twos threes and fours at short intervals—they did not go in procession—I went to Crown-street with one or two more but I do not know their names—when I got there I saw about thirty persons about half I think of whom I had seen at

week before last—I have always been working at my trade before Whitiunday and since—I joined the Emmett Brigade as a sincere moral force Chartist—I did not join it for the purpose of betraying the people I joined—it first came across my mind to betray them when I found the villainous part they were acting—I first began to betray them three weeks or a month ago I cannot exactly say the day—I acted with them without intending to betray them up to 16th Aug at least I attended their meetings but took no Part in their proceedings—I did not communicate with the police or the authorities before the beginning of this month—it might be before but I exactly say the day—I swear that before the 16th Aug I did not communicate with the police—I cannot exactly say whether it was before 16th or after—I went as a volunteer for the good of society that was my only motive—I have not received anything for my information only for my trouble attending here and my loss of time since I have been

finding a handkerchief on me that belonged to him—Jones did not meet me and find a handkerchief on me which he chimed and I did not take it off my neck and give it him—nothing of the kind ever occurred—I believe Jones had charge of Mr Russell s rooms—I lived in the house at the time—I mean to adhere to my statement that Jones did not find a handkerchief on me which he claimed as his—I Post

cartridges as he stated—he asked me to take them to my house as they were afraid that the police had found out they had been making these cartridges—I took them to my house and left one pistol and the cartridges there—the other pistol I put into my pocket and went to Linton-place Edgware-road where Garrett resides—I saw him there and showed him the pistol—I then went to William New s house in Linton-place—he is a moral-force Chartist and would not believe they were so physically prepared and I went and showed him the pistol and cartridges to convince him—I took a dozen cartridges with me tied in a bundle—I was well acquainted with the man 1 met in James-street—I showed Garrett the pistol and the ball cartridges—I do not believe that I told him I made them—I may have told him so but I am not certain—if I did tell him it was a lie—I might have told that lie and forgotten it—I am not certain—I told him that they expected a break-out that night I meant the Chartists—I will swear the words I used were not We expect a turn-up with the police this evening —I did not tell him to my knowledge that I had been engaged all day making ball-cartridges—I think I did not tell him any such

in anything for there are orders to take any of you and you are all marked After I get my liberty there will a thing appear that will astonish the country Dear friend I am a coward and seek my own safety but do so no more now —I gave that to him when about twenty persons were congregated outside laying their heads together and constantly holding up their fists and shaking their fists to intimidate me—I wrote it as I stood and saw them in the waiting-room among the other witnesses as I stood at the window—I was not taken up but 1 did not consider I was at liberty to go among them for my own safety—I am attended by a policeman so that no one can injure me—there is only one at a time—there might be one or two near me when I walk out—I am not allowed to go out without being attended by a policeman—that is what I meant by after I get my liberty —I could do it now if I wished—I did not give New this letter to prevent his giving evidence against me—it was to prevent him putting himself forward in any assault as they were continually holding up their fists to me and insulting me as I stood in the waiting-room—all the witnesses for both sides did not stand in the same place—I did not know that William New was to come as a witness against me at the tine I wrote it—I knew it since—I saw New the night Mullins was apprehended—I am not certain when that was—it was the evening I appeared at Row-street—I called on him—I did not happen to have much money about me then nothing but what I had sold my boots for that I had in hand—I do not know that I was rather flush of money—I might have had 10s or 12s —New is a shoemaker—I told him he might have some of my goods a few worthies articles—I did not tell him that I was not going to work again—I did not give him some unfinished work to do for me—I gave him some upper leathers of boots under an understanding that I was to have the worth of them fro him—it was a job I had to do on my own account—it was not for any particular order—I had the leathers and he was to have them and to make it up to me in some way or other—I did not say to him that I was not going to work again and did not then give him some unfinished work of mine to do—I had begun to work on these upper leathers—I did not state that my uncle had sent me some money—I stated that I was going to Southampton—I did not state that my uncle had given me some

as long as I lived—two gentlemen did not come for me while 1 was talking to New—one man came—he did not take me away-l did not go away with him directly—I afterwards went and met him in the street—I

the evening of Wednesday—they were distributed round among a number of men at the Hope and Anchor public-house Lisson Grove—the man went by the nick-name of Hell-fire Jack—he was a well-known man in

Payne Lacey Smith and others whos names 1 do not know—they first met on the day of Ernest Jones trial—Mullins asked if there were anv members of the old delegate committee wbis was formed on Whit-Monday there—I was one and said Yes —he asked them to retire on one side of the room and those that were not delegates to the other—they did so and consulted together and said that it was a shaffi the prisoners should go to gaol without one struggle to release them—it was stated that the route taken from Newgate to Cold Bath-fields would be through Cow Cross and that would be the best place to attack them for they would find a friend there that would lead the Iribh out of their localities meaning Daley —a motion was made with regard to calling the delegates together from every locality—I attended meetings of the Committee up to 16th Aus and within two hours after every meeting made communications of what took place to Inspector Marks—he wrote down what I said from my dictation read it over to me and I signed it—this paper signed by me was written by my dictation and is an account of the meeting of 15th Aug KINGSTON MARKS police-inspector R I was in communication with Davis at Greenwich—he made reports from time to time of what occurred at the different meetings which he attended—I took it down in his own words—I read it over to him slowly and carefully—he approved and signed the whole of them—these are the reports produced —I sent copies of them forthwith to the authorities GEORGE DAVIS continued I have kept no note or minute of what occurred—I have no means of speaking with accuracy of what occurred without referring to the notes taken by Marks—on 16th Aug I was present when the people were apprehended at the Orange Tree—the night before that I attended a meeting at the Lord Denman Suffolk-street Blackfriars—about twenty-six or twenty-seven people were present—Mullins was in the chair and Payne Erewster Allnutt Fay Cuffey were there and Lacey for a short time—I understand be went away with the Sub-committee to a coffee-house a few doors higher up—there were others there MR BALLANTINE Q Have you any recollection except from the note A I can recollect the main substance but not the dates—I refer to the notes ii to refresh my memory as to the dates and who was present—they have not been read over to me lately—I have not read them myself—I can read and iv write but not very well The ATTORNEY-GENERAL proposed to put this paper into the witness s hands that he might refresh his memory by it Mr Ballantine fallowed by MESSRS PARRY PARNELL and METCALFE objected to this being done the paper being written by another party and not by the witness himself who could nal touch for its accuracy The ATTORNEY-GENERAL referred to two cases in the one where Mr Baron Parke had allowed a witness to refresh his nmory from the notes of the learned Judge himself and in the other where Mr Baron Alderson had permitted the notes of counsel to be used for the sane purpose The COURT was of opinion that in strictness this course was admissible if the witness after looking at the paper spoke only from his recollection and not from the contents of the paper The ATTORNEY-GENERAL after some discussion slated that he would endeavour to pursue the examination if possible without referring to the paper MR ATTORNEY-GENERAL Q Who were present at the Lord Denman the night before the people were apprehended at the Orange Tree A Mullins the chairman Payne Brewster Lacey Fay Cuffey Allnutt Ferdinando and a person named Simmonds part of the evening Ritchie Johnson and others in all twenty-seven—Lacey was there a very short time—Lacey did not come back with the sub-coraraittee—Mullins Lacey Payne Brewster and Cuffey went out with the sub-committee—they all came back except Lacey—they were absent about three-quarters of an hour or it might be an bur—Mullins said they had come to a resolution that they would have an outbreak on the ensuing evening Wednesday —that he himself meant to take the fceven Dials Brewster was to take Clerkenwell Payne the Tower Hamlets and Busbctt I think was to take Strutton-ground including the south of London—Brewster distributed tri-coloured bands to be worn on the right arai for tite delegates to appoint them as leaders—I myself received two from Brewster one for myself and one for a delegate that ought to have attended with me—they were to meet at twenty minutes past nine and to bring what arms they could get—a motion was made as to where the localities should meet on the Wednesday—one was appointed to meet at the Peacock Westminster-road another at the Crispin in Milton-street Cripplegate another at Breadon s beer-shop Shouldham-street and the fourth I think at the Buck s Head somewhere about Bethnal-green-road or Hackney-road—a motion had been made the night before that the delegates select four men that were willing to risk anything and everything to attend where Ritchie should appoint them it was merely a conversation—they were appointed to meet Ritchie at the Orange Tree from five to seven—they were called luminaries by Mullins—there was to be a pass-word—Ritchie was to say to them when they came in Do you want me and if they answered Justice he would know they were the men sent by the delegates-nothing was said about what Ritchie was to provide but that he would give instructions to these men but each man was advised to come armed if he could—we met at the Orange Tree Red Lion-square on the 14th—there wert between twenty and thirty present—Mullins Payne Brewster Ciiffey Ritchie Crookshank Allnutt Fay Johnson Pearce Simmons Fleming two Granshaws brothers and a person named Ford he was not a delegate but was bail for Ernest Jones he brought 6s 1d from a new localto started at Knightsbridge—I do not know where he lived I understood th he came from Knightsbridge-district—at the same time he came Mr Reank the editor of the Northern Star came under the pretence that he was seit the meeting but there had been reports that he was a Government spy ana they would not go on with the business till he left the room—he was asked to go down stairs—it was moved by Mullins at that meeting that each delegate should go back to his locality and pick four men out who were willing to do anything that was required of them—some one asked what they meant by it and be said be would point to the gas and they might take by his pointing what he meant and Cuffey said it was no use to mince the matter they wanted them for firing or anything that might be required of them for it was no use to mince the matter now they knew their necks were in jeopardy in fact the halter was round their necks and it was co use to say it in half words that they wanted men to fire station-houses or warehouses or anything that might be required of them—a motion was made that two delegates should be sent to the meeting of the engine-drivers of tie North Western Railway to know what iheir opinions were not to compromise themselves too much by stating their views and getting them to join the Chartists but to hear the opinions of the drivers first and if they found they were agreeable to close with the Chartists they were to bring them to tie meeting or delegates from their body on a future night—Crookshank and Ritchie were appointed to go and 18d was allowed them for expenses—a remark was made that they wondered Lacey had not come that night—they waited for him till half-past eight and then adjourned to the Lord Denman-there was another meeting that night of Confederates at Nagle s I did not attend it—Johnson attended both these meetings—I did not at that time know that his name was other than Johnson—I did not know he was in communication with the police in fact he was the last man I should hm thought of—I have not had any communication with him since except one word as I stood in Court now—the meeting before that at the Orange Tree was held I think at Breadon s—I remember two or three meetings at Hopkinson s coffee-house Saffron-hill—the last meeting I attended there was on the Sunday morning before the apprehension of the parties—there were not many delegates present—Mullins Payne Brewster Fuzzon Allnutt Ritchie and others were there I did not see Johnson—I had received a letter from Mullins on the Saturday calling the meeting—a resolution was moved by Jluliins that the meeting should be adjourned till the afternoon—a few of us had a consultation down stairs and they invited us up to the locality meeting which was held every Sunday morning—when I went in there was a motion on whether the district of Clerkenwell should turn out for physical force or not—it was put to the vote and carried that they should turn out—mention was made that a person of the name of Meriman had made a report that two nen at the head of the movement were in the pay of the Government and communicated to the police the whole of the proceedings—there was a long discussion upon it and two delegates were appointed to wait on Meriman to know the truth or falsehood of the statement but I understood they could not get an interview with him—the meeting adjourned till three in the afternoon and met at Breadon s beer-shop in Shouldham-street—there were about thirty present—Cuffey was there and was appointed secretary to the subcommittee at that meeting—there was a letter read from Lacey I understood from Manchester stating that trade was very brisk there and he was surprised that he had not received the order that he sent down which we inferred meant the money that he had written for trade was very good and he expected a very large order—an order was wanted to be sent down by the Monday night by the last train—the letter did not mention when he expected to be in town—a stranger whose name I do not know and—who I never saw before stated that the Irish brigade in St Giles s had provided themselves with a musket each and so many rounds of cartridge and were willing to assist in whatever resolution the Chartists might come to—the meeting broke up between five and six—I remember going to attend a meeting at Perry s coffee-house Shoreditch and no meeting took place because the police had seized some papers from Rose s at eight the same morning Friday some persons there told me so I do not know their names one was Donnovan a person who was there purposely appointed told me so—they were playing at cards down stairs—I did not go up—I went away with Pedley to Rose s house to ascertain if it was true I found it was so—the meeting that I attended before that was either at the Lord Denman or the Orange Tree—I think it was on the Tuesday or Wednesday before—Wednesday was the 9th—Mullins Payne Brewster Cuffey Nash Rose Pedley Johnson Donnovan Fuzzon and Allnutt were there—something was said about M Douall but it was a private conversation—Rose is a carrier by trade and was secretary to the sub-committee—Mullins was treasurer—they in general inquired whether anybody had brought any funds and the delegates made reports of the state of their localities and how many men they could depend on that would turn out to fight in case of an outbreak they did not do that at all the meetings but at three or four of them—I think the number was mentioned as 1500 at one meeting and above 2000 at another—they reckoned that the aggregate number mustered about 3000 and Mullins remarked that it was not those they depended on they did not depend on the organised Chartists but they reckoned there were about 30000 thieves and vagabonds about London who would co-operate with and assist them—on the Sunday morning before that we met at Dennis s coffee-jouse Great St Andrew s-street Seven Dials—Mullins Payne Brewster ttose and Thompson were there—I know Lynch I will not be certain whether he was there and I will not ho certain whether Fay was there—there were not above nine—I do not believe Cuffey was there—it was proposed I think at that meeting that each delegate should bring up 10s to form a fund—I was present at a meeting when the committee resigned and a fresh committee was appointed—I think that was on Monday evening the 7th at Dennis coffee-house—the committee consisted of Fay Mullins Bassett Donnovan Payne Brewster Lynch and Dowling I do not think Cuffey was a member—there were three Irish on it beside Dowling Lynch Fay and Donnovan—they resigned on account of the news coming from Ireland that the rebels had been defeated and there was some remark about Smith O Brien bull forget it—the Irishmen had been added to the committee in order that the Confederates should be fairly represented as well as the Chartists—a new committee of four was then formed with ore prospective who was to be president—his name was not mentioned but it was understood from Mullies that it was Churchill who was then in France—the four were Brewster Mullins Payne and I will not be certain about the other but 1 think it Cuffey—I know Bassett the president was to take the command of the whole committee and it was proposed by a person named Warry that a farthing should be paid by each person in each locality to support the president—at the meeting at the Dispatch coffee-house Dowling made a motion that the Confederate s and all the Chartist s localities should meet on Primrose—the Sunday but when it came to the vote it was not carried they hthougt it was premature—there was a meeting previous to this at the Dispatch coffee-house I think on the Wednesday—the Sunday meeting was at two in it afternoon—I think it was at the latter end of July—there was a meed proposed to be held on Kennington-common on that same Sunday—we held a meeting that day at the Dispatch coffee-house and had messengers from there to Kennington-common to communicate any outbreak that might place—it was to be passed along on a bit of paper written in pencil—persons were stationed every two hundred yards—it was supposed to be a meeting of Chartists it was called by advertisement by a person named Dwaine of Cartwright s locality—the men were stationed between the common and the coffee-house that had been agreed on before—I do not know who was employed to superintend them—Johnson was very busy over them-a meeting did take place at Kennington-common but there was only a politic sermon preached I believe—there were reports that everything was quiet except that two or three policemen in plain clothes were attempting to get up a disturbance—nothing further was done that I am aware of—I forget at what place we met before that Sunday—I was taken so suddenly in coming forward to give evidence that I cannot recollect for I did not think of comb forward to give evidence in this ease up to ten this morning—I have only just come from Greenwich—I attended several other meetings before that—there was one meeting at Hopkinson s coffee-house and I saw plans and like weeks a map of London there—I think Payne had possession of them and Hose Mullins Brewster Thompson and myself were there together—I cannottd when that was it was before the meetings I have poken of it was is forepart of the evening when the plans were produced—Johnson was there afterwards—those plans were just marked out similar to a map on a piece oi paper—they were rather small—Mullins explained it and pointed out thati was to erect barricades from Clerkenwell down to Seven Dials and from Seven Dials down Drury-lane to St Mary s Church in the Strand by Somerset-house and right along the Strand to Temple-bar that would form a good barricade and from Temple-bar down Fleet-street and by the water-side and they were to make sure of Chaplin and Home s premises—I should know the plan if I were to see it—this is not it looking at the one identified by Powell —there were not so many figures on it it was very plain indeed V—this is not it looking at another —they were to make a circle round from Holborn till they got to St Martin s-le-Grand and down there till they got to Clerkenwell-green and Aldersgate-street and they were to take possession of St Paul s Church—this is not the plan looking at another —it was merely in the centre of the paper scribbled out a rough plan—I attended a meeting at the Black Jack that was not my first attendance as a delegate I first attended as a delegate on Whit-Monday—I attended of my own accord at the Black Jack for Greenwich—I merely went to get information—Mullins Payne Rose and Dowling were there—Johnson came in afterwards—Dolling said he attended the meeting not being elected as a delegate but at the invitation of Mullins—Dowling was a confederate and secretary of the Davis-dub—a sub-committee consisting of Rose the secretary Payne the chairman Mullins the Treasurer Dowling and Brewster were appointed for the purpose of drawing out plans to attack the police and soldiers—it was not said how many plans were to be drawn out—I attended other meetings Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q I understood you to say in answer to the Attorney-General that you were not a Chartist A I was not when I first gave information to the police—I have become so since—I do not mean a genuine Chartist but a member of the Chartist Association—I am not a Chartist in principle merely for the purpose of gaining information—you may call it for the purpose of trickery—I was desirous of finding out their secrets and then betraying them—I was not desired to do so Q Have you carried on the business of a spy long or was this your first start in that vocation A I have carried it on since 12th March—I am not attached to the Government or to any division nothing of the sort—I never was employed as a spy at all—I employed myself—it was my own private speculation—I did not want to turn it to anything—it was merely to save destruction of life and property—that was my sole object—it was with no object of emolument to myself—I had no desire to gain anything by it—when I gave information I did not require anything for it nor had I any desire for anything of the sort—I did not expect to gain anything by it—I offered to give it up several times and wanted to retire—the superintendent and inspector begged me to keep on with it and I did so—I did not give the superintendent my notes at the end of every meeting—I saw him at the end of each meeting and told him my story—I have been paid nothing for this job—I have been at wort and have been living on that—I employ men—I have other means of living without being a spy—I keep a shop and have for seven years at 5 Strait-mount Greenwich—I am married and have three children—when I first gave information I did not expect to get anything by it—I now expect to be remunerated for the loss of what trade I shall be compelled to lose—I have not made any bargain about what I am to get for the loss of my trade—I trust entirely to the generosity of the Government—they have not agreed to give me one farthing—I mean to apply to them for compensation for what I have lost in my trade—I have lost something in my trade at present—people have suspected me of being a spy for the last month past—I have found myself pointed at—I have not found all the honest and respectable people in the neighbourhood endeavouring to avoid me—I communicated with the police previous to enrolling myself—it was not by agreement with them that I enrolled myself—I thought I could learn more—Robinson a member of the Chartist Association solicited me to join them—he is not one of the persons I have betrayed—he is a Chartist—I was not here yesterday at Dowling s trial—I was not before the Grand Jury or before a Magistrate—the prisoners have not heard one word that 1 had to say against them Q When did you first know you were required as a witness A I did not know I should be required at all—no application was made to me—I came of my own accord at eleven o clock to-day—I was not sent for—I applied myself to be made a witness—I am not brought here by the Crown or under any subpœna—it was a voluntary act of my own—the Government have been in possession of my papers and they applied to me to go as a witness and I refused—I cannot tell the exact day they applied to me it two or three days after the arrest at the Orange-Tree took place—I had not made any bargain with the Government that I was not to appear—I have sworn it and repeat it that I came of my own accord to-day having refuse previously Q Plow came you to alter your mind A Through reading the newspaper this morning and seeing the character the witness had yesterday and 1 knew no one could bring such charges against me—it was from reading the account of the cross-examination of Powell—it occurred to me that he bore rather a bad character and cut rather a bad figure—I did not want to bolster him up—I came to give the light evidence because I thought the Jury would not believe Powell s statement to be true as he bore such a bad character Q And did not you know that if there was a verdictof acquittal you would lose all your payment for this job A I did not think anything at ail about payment—on my solemn oath I did not believe that if there was a verdict of acquittal I should lose all the remuneration that I might otherwise get—I read Powell s examination nearly through not very carefully Q I dare say from what you saw of it you would hardly believe him on his oath A I do not know I would with regard to that because he told the truth—I carried a couple of loaded pistols for my own protection—I have never got up any meeting—I have never said I had fighting-men at my command—I saw Marks the inspector of police at Greenwich this morning at his own house—I went to him—I did not come up here with him I came by myself—I asked his advice whether I should come up—he communicated with the superintendent and decided if I came they would be in attendance here for me and I came MR ATTORNEY-GENERAL Q You say you saw the examination in the paper this morning A Yes in the Morning Advertiser—it was the cross-examination where he was asked whether he belonged to the thimble-rig—on reading that cross-examination I went to Inspector Marks to ask his advice whether it was requisite that I should come up whether he thought it would do any good—I was unwilling to come as a witness CHARLES BALDWINSON I live in Webber-street Black friars-road and am a tailor I became a member of the Chartist Association of the Lambeth locality about the middle of May—their place of meeting was Chartist-hall Webber-street—I became a class-leader about three weeks after and had nine men under me—on the Monday night before the men were arrested at the Angel in Webber-street I remember meeting Morgan who was taken up there—on Tuesday 15th I mot him again at the Queen Victoria beershop at the corner of New-street in Short-street between seven and eight o clock in the evening and went with him to the Peacock in Francis-street Westminster-road—we found the class-leaders of the Lambeth district thera—a person named Pedley a delegate belonging to the council of the Lambeth locality was there—I was there that evening about two hours and a half—Pedley said there was a delegate coming from Manchester and that they were up and doing in Manchester and the North of England—Pedley told us all to sit down and he asked us all if we were prepared to fight—one man smiled and said You don t mean it and Pedley said We do mean it and then he said Then we are ready to come out —he told us to tell our men to come there the next night at eight o clock with arms and those who had not arms would be put in the way to get them—we were to meet at the Broadway Westminster where we should meet the Dean-street locality—we were to come to the Peacock first—he mentioned that the other localities were to meet at the Seven-dials Clerkenwell-green and at the east end of the town—in pursuance of those directions I went about one o clock next day and spoke to six of my men I think—Conway whowas taken at the Angel was one and Prowton another—I told them what Pedley had said—I went to the Peacock by myself I believe at eight o clock and met Morgan Pedley Conway Chester a class-leader and Winspere there—Pedley brought a paper with some coloured ribbons in it which he said the delegates were to wear that tie men might know them and another paper with some powder with which he filled up some ball-cartridges—I had a pike—head and I afterwards fetched my pistol—Pedley gave me a ball-cartridge to load the pistol—this is one of the ribbons the one produced —in consequence of something that the landlady said I went to the Angel in Webber-street—I left Pedley behind but he came afterwards—he left about three minutes before the police came—I had given information to the police between two and three o clock in the afternoon—I saw Pedley load a pistol at the Angel for a man whose name I forget—he did not take it away Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q Am I to take it that up to 16th Aug you were a party in this transaction A Yes up to the 16th—I had left them for about a fortnight previous to that—I mean I had not attended any meeting for a fortnight up to 14th—I had not been in communication at all with the police before—I knew of the meeting of the 16th—it was of that meeting that I gave information—I was at the meeting and was taken into custody—I then had a loaded pocket-pistol on me—I am a journeyman tailor by trade—I gave a pike—head to Conway to take care of and it was found on him—I bought it I cannot tell when—it was somewhere about July or the latter end of June—I had it to take off suspicion that the parties might not know I had informed—I carried it inside my coat—I showed it to them and the pistol too—I never took the pike—head to the meeting before the 16th yes I beg your pardon I did once—I was not examined before the Magistrate—the prisoners have never had an opportunity of hearing what I had to say against them—I did not go before the Grand Jury—I knew last week that I was to be examined as a witness—I have never been in any trouble MR WELSBY Q Were you examined last Friday in Dowling s case A Yes George Wilson Thomas Pronger Samuel Evans William Thomas Thomas Mollison John Bambridge Joseph Hoyle William Robert Black John Johnson and William Randall gave the same evidence as in pages 750 and 751 HENRY JONES policeman On 17th Aug I was on duty on Clerken-well-green—about half-past four o clock in the morning I went into the churchyard and found this basket containing ball-cartridges produced —here are 280 perfect and about fifty unfinished—it was close adjoint Clerkenwell-green—the churchward is inclosed in a railing—there is a passage in it leading to some old houses—any one can go in at all hours of the night—I found it in a dark corner opposite a bookbinder s shop—any one into the churchyard to put them there—the gate is always open Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q Did you expect to find them A No I found them by accident Cross-examined by MR PARRY Q Had you been in the churchyard the morning before A Yes the 16th—I go into the churchyard at all times—I went in every quarter of an hour while I was on duty there—on on the night I found these I was on duty four hours from two o clock in the morning till six—I do not know who had been on duty before me—two o clock is not say regular time to come on duty but I was kept on reserve that night—I was ordered to stop at the station till I was ordered on duty—that was at two o clock—I had not been out on special duty the night before or the night before that hut the night after I went out regularly—that is my regular status—it is something out of the usual way to go at two in the morning—after I went round my beat as usual—that part of the churchyard forms part of my beat—I did not go with any intent to find anything or discover anything—I had not been there the morning before at that time nor the morning before that nor did I go the morning after MR BODKIN Q At what hour do you usually go on your beat A At nine in the evening but on 16th Aug a reserve force was kept till two o clock and I did not go on duty till two in consequence—I did nothing else than obey the orders of my principal when I went on duty that night—at a quarter past four just at daylight I found the basket—I do not go through the churchyard—there is a passage with pallisades on one side and tombstones on the other and three houses on the right-hand side and on that side there is a sort of nook this basket was set there and this handkerchief laid over is and the unfinished cartridges sticking up in it—the handkerchief enabled me to discover it by its being daylight JOSIAS CHILTON I live in Crawford-street Bryanston-square I know Breadon s beer-shop in Shouldham-street—I went into the tap-room there an 16th Aug between eight and nine o clock at night—there were eighteen or twenty people there chiefly Irish—I heard Crown-street mentioned—I took it to be Soho—I did not hear Soho mentioned—they were to meet there—I saw a gun unfolded from a wrapper—it was in pieces but it was put into the stock—I saw something similar to a sword on the table near the door with a rough handle made of wood—the people dispersed about two at a time I was there nearly an hour and a half till they had all gone ROBERT WARRINGTON I am an operative chemist attached to Apothecaries Hall Here are some forms of mixtures on this paper found at Rose s —they could be applied to purposes of spontaneous combustion—they become explosive by mixture with themselves—here are three ditierent spontaneous explosive compounds—this is a common lecture experiment illustrating a case of spontaneous combustion—it is nitrate of copper wrapped up in tin-foil and in five minutes it ignites and becomes perfectv red-hot or in three or four minutes it depends on the quantity of water used—the next is a mixture of a portion of steel-filings and sulphur which I presume are to be made into a paste that is a mixture which gives out a great deal of heat but it does not inflame—the next mixture is woollen rags steepped in a mixtuie of three parts of nitric acid and one ounce of sulphuric which is a very powerful explosive compound—when I say explosive I mean calculated to ignite very shortly—I cannot make out the last item on the paper it is nitrate of silver inclosed with pebble stones—this ball I have not looked at it seems to be a packet of gunpowder—here are some nails in it and a piece of cotton which attaches the paper together—I do not know whether it is a slow match MR PARRY to William Broom Cross Q Did you apprehend Fay A Yes—he was not searched—I took him to Bow-street station—he has been in custody ever since—I do not know that he has been searched at all—I took him at 14 Knight-street Milton-street—I believe it was his residence—it was a private house—I believe there was no name—he was at work there with his father—the house was searched by Serjeant Grey—we found nothing—the father said Fay was his son—I saw him on a seat there at work with a person who he called father and who called him son but at first be denied his name being Fay—I do not think I have said that before—tins was on the 18th—Powell was being examined when I was at Bow-street with Fay—Brannan and Grey pointed Fay out to me—I did not consider him in my custody JAMES BRANNAN police-sergeant G 20 I took Fay—I know that he lived at 14 Plough-court Milton-street—he said My name is not Fay —I said It is you must come along with me Cross-examined by MR PARRY Q Was it his father s house A His father lived in the top room he is a boot-closer—he was sitting at work—he knew me before—I knew where he resided and knew him—I had not bees in bis company more than seeing him—I have done duty there many years—I should say he knew me very well—we have spoken together—I do not wear uniform—I have not the slightest doubt that he knew me and his father also Witnesses for the Defence JAMES PARIS I am foreman to Mr Smith a master builder of Taberaicle-row Finsbury Thomas Powell is his brother-in-law—I have worked in the same shop with him seven or eight years I believe—I have known him about eleven years but only about seven years intimately—he is not a man who I would believe on his oath Cross-examined by MR ATTORNEY-GENERAL Q You are a Scotchman A Yes—I have seen Powell this morning—I did not talk to or shake hands with him—I was not within reach of him—I never heard him examined as a witnes and have never heard him sworn—I would not believe him on his oath because he is in the habit of telling so many lies—he once said Lord John Russell committed suicide by cutting his throat and that a thief took a side of pork from Mr Rowland s bhop and that two or three policemen went in search of him and Mr Rowland s wife went and made inquiry and there was no truth in it—at another time he told me that Mr Hudson a neighbour was dead it turned out not to be so—these things were not long ago—I have had this opinion of him for two years—I worked with him up to the time he left—I do not recollect seeing him last Friday—I did not shake hands with him and say I hoped Government would take care of his wife and children—I said I was sorry for his children for what he had done—I would not shake hands with him because he has told so many lies—I believe I am not a Chartist—I do not know what Chartism is—I belong to no public body or association whatever MR HUDDLESTON Q Have you been Mr Smith s foreman eight or nine years A Not all the time I was a journeyman before that I was foreman two years—I left and was away two years and a half—when I said I was sorry for him and his children I referred to his becoming an informer—I do not remember hearing him called Lying Tom in his presence THOMAS OSBORNE I am a workman at Mr Smith s Powell worked there—I believe he is a relation of Mr Smith s—I have known him three years and five months and from what I have known of his character I would not believe him on his oath if he was on his dying bed—I have heard him talk very little of Chartism—I was not in the shop much lately—about two months ago he told me there was to be a Chartist rising no one else was present—he asked me to join three or four months ago it might be three weeks after the Kennington-common meeting on 10th April not more Cross-examined by MR ATTORNEY-GENERAL Q Did you go to the Kennington-common meeting A No I was at Bishop Bonner s-fields but a no meeting—I was there on the Sunday when people were collected not during the evening—I was there on the day the police were attacked—I was there when the church windows were broken but did not see them—I did not hear Ernest Jones speak—I do not know him—I was at a meeting at Birdcage-walk—I cannot say if it was on 22nd April—Powell pointed out a blacksmith to make a pike if I wanted one—he asked whether I had joined—I said Yes —that was a lie but I would not believe him on his oath because I have found him out in so many—I heard him examined here on Tuesday—I was here to speak the truth—I was subpoenaed—I did not hear the witnesses ordered to leave the Court but as soon as I heard there were orders I left—that is the only occasion I have heard him examined—he came in one day as if he was frightened and said Lord John Russell had committed suicide—two or three days before he gave information he was sharpening a saw and broke one of the wings of the nut which it was fixed with he said there was no man at that end of the shop but me I must get another—I said You can get one for 1d and gave him one—he went out I said to one of my shopmates Depend upon it it be will say it cost 2d and accordingly he did so but a man in the countint-house said he gave it to him—I did not deny breaking it—none of the other belived and it was the same with me—I did not attend Chartist meeting before 10th April—I attended a meeting at Birdcage-walk it was quite accidental—I went two or three times on two or three Sunday mornings—it was in some ruins where houses had been built—several persons spoke—May was one—no one went with me—I did not hear there was going to be a meeting on 16th Aug not till next morning—I was never taken up—I did not take Powell s advice and get a pike—I am not at regular work—if Mr Smith wants me he employs me—I sometimes earn more than 30s a week sometimes less—I went to the meeting because it was proposed that as so many carpenters were out of employ and their tools were all popped and if they would subscribe something to get them out of pawn they could go to work and be able to be a great help to the cause—I did not subscribe I went to oppose him—I spoke—May had put the proposition at a former meeting—he was a perfect stranger to me—I did not go the next Sunday—if it was brought forward I should have told the parties he was doing it for his own self—I do not think I went four times—I have done jobs with Pennell-there was a little difference between us—I am not aware that he charged me a with taking some wood—he never did to my face and I never heard of it—I worked at Bishop s Stortford in Hertfordshire—I left there about a low affair which my parents were against me in—I brought her to London—I married her first—I never heard Powell examined on oath MR METCALFE Q Why did you tell Powell you had joined the Chartists A Because I was always afraid of him ever since I knew him—if any of us offended him he would not tell us of it nor seek revenge at the moment but would Jet it go over five or six months and then seek revenge not on us but on our tools—I cannot say that he has done so RICHARD PENNELL I am a carpenter and joiner and work for Mr Hill of Turner-street Whitechapel—I have known Powell twelve or thirteen years—I have worked in the same shop with him for a number of years—from what I know of him I would not believe him on his oath—I have heard him called Lying Tom to his face thousands of times in Mr Smith s shop—I once heard him say he would send Lord John Russell and Sir George Gray the Queen the b—y foreigner and all the family to the devil within a month—about a week or ten days before 10th April be wished me to attend at Cartwright s to be proposed a member of the society—I said I did not like the proceedings and I did not think they would gain the Charter in the way they were going on—he said they would gain it and would not be long about it—they would have it within a month or a fortnight—he wished me to propose him as a delegate if I joined as he was not known in the Society and said he could get 2l or 3l a week and that would be better than humbugging about for old Smith his brother-in-law the builder—I asked How are you going to get the Charter what do you think the Government will be about —he said We have got a weak and a b - - y Government—look at our present Queen with her hundreds of thousands a year and you and me are working at our benches from morning to night for the sake of a bit of bread —he said if I would come to his house on Sunday morning he would show me materials enough to blow London to hell in half an hour—I went a portion of the way but not liking his character prevented me going further—some years ago he gave me a printed bill about Socialism Cross-examined by MR ATTORNEY-GENERAL Q Did you ever work for Mr Smith A Yes—I was dismissed through shortness of work—that was the only reason—he did not tell me I never should have work there again—I have never required it since—I left I suppose seventeen months ago—I never heard Powell examined on his oath but I have beard him swear openly in the shop times out of number so help his God be would swear anything if he could get paid for it—I do not mean to say he would speak out openly to every one in the shop he did not like the foreman to know what was going on at all—he has told me of instances when he has been brought to the Old Bailey as a witness and has said be would swear anything that he could get paid for—I heard him called Lying Tom in presence of Osborne and Goner a carpenter and joiner but not of the foreman—I have seen him take the Scriptures in his hand and when he came to a place where Christ was named he would break it off and say We will bum that b - - r and put it into the fire —Carr and me were present—he tore out a leaf—I have seen him break out the name of Christ s disciples—when he came to a certain part he would say Here is Christ we will burn him he would break the portion off and when he came to the disciples he would say Here are villains here are some of the scoundrels and would burn them but when he came to the name of Judah he said he was the best fellow of the lot he did get paid for his job but he Powell would have done it for half the money—I have only seen him burn the paper once—I did not mention this to the attorney who examined me—I did not think of it—it would not have done for me to have told Mr Smith—I was shocked—I never spent an hour with the man in my life—I continued to work at the next bench to him—I never saw him reading the Scriptures to get any good out of was only to pick out and damage it—I suppose it was his own book—the leaves were partly missing—it was about five years ago—it may besix—I do not think Carr was present when he spoke of Judah—I cannot tell whether it was summer or winter—I think it was between four and five years ago—there was a fire in the shop—it was breakfast time—we boil the coffee there —sometimes there were five or six sitting round the fire some times two—Powell and me were the only men that breakfasted in the shop at that time—Carr was present when he spoke about Judah and the disciples—I have heard him express himself about Scripture scores of times and have told him he ought to be ashamed of himself—Carr might be present—I have never been a Cnartist—I attended meetings at Bishop Boiiner s-fields—I have been to no other Chartist meetings—I have never been to Cartwright s—I never saw him but twice in my life—I never saw the prisoners—I do not know the man s name who found me out—it was a carpenter and joiner worked for Mr Smith—I have not seen him these three weeks—I should know him if I saw him—he called on me one evening and told me to go to Dalston and gave me a card of a boot and shoemaker whose name I do not recollect—I went—it is in a street in the Queen s-road just over the bridge—I have lost the card—I saw the man twice—it was a few days or a week after the Chartists were taken—he asked if I knew anything about Powell and I told him what 1 knew of him—I did not write a letter to the Northern Star—I have lived at 51 Molyncaux-street Hoxton three years next March—I have never had any meeting of the witnesses there—I do not know Collins—a man nans Reynolds lived in the house with me and a man named Rooney and an old lady who has only been there a few days—I know Thomas Osborne—there is no angry feeling betueen him and me no more than I discharged him when I was Mr Hill s foreman—before I went to Mr Smith s I worked at St George s Hospital—I come from Wiltshire—I hive not been in London ever since—I was in Wiltshire and Dorsetshire again about three years and a half—that was six years ago—I did not know there was going to be a rising in London except from the papers—I heard nothing of the meeting of 15th Aug —I was not at Cartwright s that night—I have only been there twice in my life—I have never seen Powell there—I dropped in there one Sunday evening for a cup of coffee three years ago and again last Sunday week—I did not stop there two minutes MR HUDDLESTON Q Was it in consequence of your knowledge of Powell s character that you were asked to say what you knew of him A Yes—I saw the statement which I made reduced to writing by the master shoemaker and I put my name to it—I afterwards saw it in the Northern star—that was a statement of all I knew of the character and conduct of Powell except about his being the murderer of his father but I always thought it was robbery—the conversation about the Scriptures has occurred scores of times not a day in the week but he would bring it up but I only saw him burn a portion once—Carr was present once when he said Jesus Christ was a thief and has been there scores of times when he used such expressions—the person who came to me with the card was in Mr Smith s employ and a member of the Trades society—I saw by the papers that Powell was a witness—I can not mention half the shopmates that have heard him speak so COURT Q Where was the book kept that was torn A It was part of the New Testament—it was kept in his chest in the shop—he was not much in the habit of reading the Scriptures—on rhis occasion lie merely took hold of a leaf and said See here is a history of Christ and so on—I only saw him do it once but he broke out several portions on the same occasion but when he came to Judas that betrayed Christ he would not bum that—sometimes read the Testament of a Sunday but generally read the newspaper on a working day—he took out several parts of one leaf or it may be another leaf—I cannot say how many leaves he broke—he broke up a number of pieces but whether all out of one leaf I cannot say ALFRED CARR I know Thomas Powell well—I worked with him at Mr Smith s three or four years part of 1838 1839 and 1840—I met with him once since at a coffee-shop—from what I have known of him during that time I would not believe him on his oath not a bit of it Cross-examined by MR ATTORNEY-GENERAL Q You have only met him once in a coffee-shop for the last eight years A It may be seven years—that Was about two years ago looking at a paper —1842 was the last time I worked with him—I did not make this paper—I asked a party named Bennett in Mr Smith s employ whether it was right—I do not know whether he was the man who went after Pennell—this March 26 42 means when I left that employ—this Feb 9 40 means when Powell attempted to murder his father—I tad this to refresh my memory—I worked for Powell s father six or seven years ago—I have only worked with Powell at Mr Smith s—I would not believe him on his oath because I have found him out in so many base lies and he pulled Scripture to pieces so often—he had an old Bible and would stand up when the shop was a little cleared and begin reading it and when he came to particular passages he would say Jesus Christ was a b - - and the Virgin Mary was the biggest w - - that ever * * *—it was his continual study to tear the Bible to pieces—I have seen him cull it to pieces—at one time he brought a part of the book of Genesis picked it to pieces and pitched it into the fire—I cannot say what it was or whether our Saviour was mentioned—he said God said let us make man but I cannot swear to the words—he pushed the pieces into the fire and said they would contaminate a bawdy-house—Pennell was not there—I do not think there was any one but me—I do not belong to the Chartists—I was subpoenaed nearly a fortnight ago—directly I had it I went to Pennell s house—I have seen Powell destroy tools—I never destroyed his or my own or any of them or any one else s—this paper was put into my hand about eleven o clock to-day—I was talking to a party yesterday named Daniels to refresh my memory—I do not know whether it is his writing—he is here—I had it just to jog my memory and refer to other little things—I did not hear Pennell examined—I never attended any Chartist meeting—I heard of these meetings in the paper—I have attended no Chartist meetings since 1839 when Powell wanted to betray me—that was in Ship-yard Templebar on the first-floor on the right—I was on good terms with Powell when I left but when you were on good terms with him it was the very time he going to betray you—after be tried to murder his father he tried to spite in everything MR METCALFE Q What does this Feb 9 40 refer to A It was when Mr Powell died—Powell drew me to the meeting in 1839—he wanted to get me into trouble and leave me in a mess—he has talked about ripping policemen s guts—I attended from four to six meetings—I was never enrolled as a member—I took a card at the Lord Denman in 1839—I did not stay because 1 found the peaceable way was the best—I was employed to keep the peace on 10th April JAMES BENNETT I know Powell—I worked with him about four years ago—since then I have repaired boots and shoes for him—about 3rd April 1848 I met him at the National Hall Holborn—he asked what I intended to do on 10th April—I said I intended to go to Kennington-common—he asked me in what way—I wanted to know what he meant by it—he asked if meant to go armed—I said Certainly not the executive would have better cause to attack us and I would advise working-men not to go armed on any account —he directly said I was a b - - fool if I did not go armed Cross-examined by MR ATTORNEY-GENERAL Q Were you at the National Hall meeting A Yes and at the Kennington-common meeting and likewise at another at Kennington-common—I was not there on 6th Aug —I was not aware that there were men stationed at certain distances along the road to give notice at the Dispatch coffee-house if any disturbance of the peace took place on 6th Aug —I never heard of it—I was not then myself I was on 10th April—I attended one meeting at Bonner s-fields—I think it was on a Sunday evening—I was not there till the meeting was over—I think the police broke a few heads that day—I do not know that the police themselves had a few heads broken—I think that was the day the Church was attacked—I did not Lear anybody speak the meeting was over—I was not at the row—I was not there when the windows were broken—I was there when the police were dispersing the people—I was not present at the trial in this Court of the persons for that disturbance—I did not see the windows broken—I heard of it—I did not see it when I got there I did go near enough—I was not at the place of meeting—the meeting was dispersed before I got there—I attended one meeting at Clerkenwell—I cannot tell you when it was I should say it is perhaps three months ago—that was not the night the people walked through London—it was eight or nine days before—I was not at the meeting at Trafalgar-square—I think the meetings I attended were at Bonner s-fields Kennington-common and Clerkenwell-green—I was not at above four meetings—I was not in the procession on 29th I did not see it—I

whether there was a delegate—I never had a pike myself I swear that or a gun or pistol or anythingcf of the sort—I was only at Kennington-common once MR METCALFE Q Did you countenance physical force at all A I did not as a Chartist COURT Q I think you say Powell asked you whether you intended to go armed to Kennington-common A He did and the reason I did not go armed was because the notice was not to go armed—if the notice had been to go armed I certainly should not have gone armed—he told roe at that time whether he should go armed I am certain of that and more than that I searched his pockets in Cartwright s to see that he had no grenades about him before I went out of the room with him—he said he had been making grenades all the previous Sunday—we had not been talking about cornbastibles—I did not find any grenades in his pocket or I should not have walked with him because I should have considered him a very dangersman if he had been armed JOHN WESTMORELAND I am a master tailor at 75 Watling-street I am a real out and out moral force Chartist and have been so for forty years—I think I should recognize Powell if I were to sec him—I did see him here slightly—he is a perfect stranger to me but I think I could recognize him—I believe so from the description of his person and dress given me by the parties attending Cartwright s coffee-shop who were personally acquainted with him—I just got a glance of him in Court the other day when I was called in to be recognized—I think he was then standing in the witness-box—that was the very man 1 had seen at Cartwright s—I remember some time ago his coming into the box at Cartwright s where I was sitting—I had very little conversation with him—while he was in the box he sketched this piece of paper looking at the circular plan produced to Powell with a pencil—that was the only paper produced at that time—this was his project of organization—I think it might be about two months ago—it might be about the end of July or beginning of Aug I am not positive—it was before these men were taken into custody—he gave me this sketch at the time he made it and it appears that I kept it but I was astonished to find that I had it—I did not know that I had it until I found that he had turned traitor and then there was an agitation whether I knew the man or not—this is the same piece of paper—I saw him again at Cartwright s I think about a week after and he showed me a similar plan done on a larger sheet of paper—it was very different to this in point of finish—it was highly finished neatly done and properly executed on a beautiful clean sheet of paper—he put it into my hands for a few minutes and I asked him if he could spare it—he said No —I had no acquaintance with him and never spoke with him till be came into the box where I was sitting and sat down by my side and began to talk about organization Cross-examined by MR ATTORNEY-GENERAL Q You have been in the habit of attending

their being taken the same night—I think it was the night after at Cartwright s—I do not know Mullins—I may have seen him but not to my knowledge—I do not know him by name—I did not hear talk at Cartwright s of the persons being about to turn out on the Wednesday night—these physical force proceedings were quite foreign to my principles—I did not know that anything of the kind was going on only from what you say—I took no interest in the movement—I did not know there was a movement—I never gave heed to anything of the kind but denounced it whenever it came in my way—I have at Cartwright s repeatedly denounced physical force Q I am afraid it was not very well received although you are a popular orator A I do not care about the reception I spoke the truth—I speak as I feel the conviction of my mind—I do not know whether it was well or received how am I to know —I never heard any applause—I was not very popular I must confess for I was not at all applauded—I have met with persons who were opposed to my doctrines but they found it was not their while troubling themselves with me on that point—without presumption I hope I am considered by every one that knows me to be a highly quiet and peaceable man—I was determined to act on nothing but moral force that was to get all the people I could on the register-list GEORGE THURSTON I have been out of Court during this

Cartwright s the night the men were taken up A No I was the night before—there were not a great many persons there about the number there is generally—I do not know Carter—I am not aware that there were some persons sitting in the back room down the passage—I believe there is such a room—it is a sort of kitchen—I was never there—I will take my oath I never was in this gallery in my life—I beard that there was to be a meeting next day—I did not hear where—I heard nothing said about the Orange Tree—I do not know how many districts there were to be—I never heard about our locality going anywhere—I belong to the Cripplegate locality—I had no class-leader that I am aware of—I have not often been there—I know Gurney—I do not know that he was my warden—I never spoke to him—I do not know that there was a warden at all—it was on Tuesday evening the 15th that I heard talk of there being a meeting next day I was in at Cart-wright s and 1 heard there was going to be a something I did not

besides Johnson MR PARNELL Q Did you see a number of nags and banners at the meeting at Kennington-common on 10th April A I did— looking at the one found at Cuffey s I do not remember seeing that there THOMAS POWELL re-examined by MR PARRY I do not think I ever saw that man before in my life— looking at Henry Green may I be allowed to make a remark I was in such a state of exhaustion after my examination having been in the witness-box eight hours that at the latter part 1 scarcely knew what questions you put to me—I was in such a state bodily and mentally that I was really not myself—I have been at meetings at Birdcage-walk—I do not remember whether I was there on Sunday —23rd April last it is very likely I may have been—I do not remember at any meeting about that time busying myself in asking questions among the parties present—I do not remember saying to Green Have you got any arms or his saying No that he did not know the use of them —I have no recollection of saving to him You are not worth a d - - as a Chartist unless you have got arms —I will not swear I did not say that to him I might have said such a thing—I do not know whether I then went among the crowd and asked others the same questions—I will not swear I did not HENRY GREEN I am a ship felt-maker I am a Chartist—I know Powell—I remember a meeting held on Sunday 23rd April last at Birdcage-iralk Bonner s-fields—I saw Powell there—I was in conversation with two other gentlemen I believe two weavers and Powell came and asked me whether I was provided to obtain my rights—I asked what he meant—he asked whether I was possessed of arms—I told him I was not possessed of any except what I had on my body—Powell then said I had no right to speak a word about the Charter unless I was possessed of arms and determined to maintain my rights—he asked me if I had got a pistol first and then if I had a sword—I said I had not—he then asked where my residence was—I did not tell him—he said You are not worth a d - - as a Chartist unless you have got arms —I told him if he said anything more to me about those sort of arms I would get out of the society altogether—he then left me—I did not see him go among the crowd—I saw no more of him that day Cross-examined by MR ATTORNEY-GENERAL Q What locality do you—belong to A I belong to no locality I am a Chartist but I have not been possessed of a Chartist card or belonged to any locality since the night I and Powell joined the Wat Tyler Brigade—that is the only night I was in his company and he knows that perfectly well—I am not acquainted with the exact night but it was some time after 23rd April—I had often been to Cartwright s at my meal-times but I never joined in the locality there—the Wat Tyler Brigade used to be held at a beer-shop at Hoxton but it is broken up—I do not know the sign of the house—I remember the night the parties were apprehended—I was at Cartwright s that night with Powell and went along with him up part of Golden-lane and he showed me the arms he was possessed of and asked whether I would tell him where I lived—I am speaking of the 16th—I went with him as far as the top of Old-street-road—he showed me part of a sword and said You see I am prepared for the Government and if you tell me where you live I will bring you a dagger —he had seen me the night before in Old-street-road Fay was not there—I was at Cartwright s the night before but did not see Fay there I do not know whether he was there or not but I never saw him—I may have seen him bat not to swear to him— looking at the prisoners I believe I know every one of these gentlemen on looking at them but before you told me their Dames I did not know them—I did not see any of them at Cartwright s on the night of 15th—I do not know

clock that night—this was before the committee was postponed before the case was postponed—I do not know when the case was postponed to he did not tell me but he said it was postponed for that night—I met him twice that night first about a quarter to six as I was going home and again between eight and nine when he told me it was postponed till the next night at nine precisely—he told me that as I was not possessed of any arms I must either join the Seven Dials or the Tower Hamlets party as there were several gun-shops that were to be broken into and there I might provide myself with arms—he did not tell me where I was to get gunpowder—I had no leader but Powell—I believe he was the chief leader that I knew anything at all about—the Tower Hamlets and Seven-dials would have been strange places to me but according to what he told me I was only to mix up with the mob that was to be assembled there to get what arms I could—I went home to my bed along with my wife the night the fire was to take place—I am a regular physical force man but I would rather be at home with my wife than fighting—I did not say I was a regular physical force man because I opposed Powell s motion as to physical force—I should have been on the committee only for opposing Powell as a physical force man—I did not hear other persons besides Powell talk of the meeting that was to take place on the Wednesday—I did not listen to any one and did not inquire—I had the advice of men before me who knew very well what the case was and I took their advice and took care that no man should ensnare me—it was nothing else but reading the Northern Star that led me to be what Iwas—I was determined not to be ensnared—although Powell tried all he could be never could find out ray residence—he asked me three nights running before the job was to take place where my residence was that he might provide me with arms Q Then the job was to take place A I do not know that that was Powell s assertion—there were not many persons at Cartwright s the night before the Chartists were taken not when I was there—I believe I was there the firs time about a quarter-past six o clock and the last time about a quarter-pal eight and I do not think there were more than seven or eight—I do not know Payne or Carter I know Cuffey perfectly well—I did not see his there I have never seen him at Cartwright s—the only time I have ever seen him was at the institution in John-street—I only recollect seeing Lacey once in my life and where that was I cannot recollect—I believe I have seen Fay several times but

Chartist—I know Powell I have seen him at Bryant s coffee-house Wyndharn-street Finsbnry-square at Cartwright s and at Milton-street Theatre—about the beginning of April last he was in the habit of coming to Bryant s coffee-house and occasionally entering into conversation with the working men there—on the morning of 10th April he showed me a pistol ontsise the door in the street and asked me if I was prepared—he said he was going prepared—I said I was not and did not intend to take such things he—he did not say what he was going to do with it—I have repeatedly heard him say he would assassinate the police and set fire to the houses in London that was before or after April but I cannot recollect dates—at the latter end of April or the beginning of May Powell showed me two pistols in Tabernacle-square between ten and eleven o clock at night—I only saw the muzzles—we were talking together and he pulled them out to show me that he was prepared—he was continually urging me to be prepareu—he said he wished to see all the police assassinated and to have some good fires in London—I afterwards went with him to the Milton-street Theatre—I had formed the opinion that he was a dangerous man and went to inform persons of that—it was on 28th July—I saw him at the back of the platform speaking to Mullins Rose Shaw and several others—I cautioned them of him Cross-examined by MR

Kennington-common but did not go with arms—I understand others did which was quite against the instructions—I saw two parties give up their arms on the common when they were ordered by they

with what money I have paid in I have paid 32s —I entered for a fonr-acre share that is 5l 8s but being out of work for a length of time I have not paid the remainder—I have not been to Kennington-common again as I was stopped going to my residence by the police at Blackfriars-bridge—I was caught in the trap—I consider I had a right to go over the bridge—I cannot mention all the meetings I have been to since—if I was aware I would have had notes to meet your questions—I could bring a great deal against Powell if I had been prepared—there are many things I have heard that I cannot bring to bear and shall not attempt to specify—I was not at Cartwright s on the 15th—I have been there to have a cup of coffee occasionally—I have known the house two years—I live in Drury-tone and work in Mark-street Fore-street—I was in the habit of going there—I was not there the night the people were apprehended or the night before—on the 16th as far as I recollect I was at work in the day time and went to the Magnet in Drury-lane to have a cup of coffee and heard they were taken the same night—the people said they were taken to Bow-street—it is about twelve months since I have done any work for Mr Hill—since that I have been jobbing about doing a little on my own account—I worked for Mr Hill nearly two years—before that I worked for Mr Murray and Mr Holland—I have just made a sofa-bedstead to order on my own account—I have two rooms—I do not know Burn who is in custody—I have known Powell since the latter end of March or the beginning of April—it was before the 10th April—I did not know him before he used to go to want s coffee-house—I did not know him before March—I always knew mm by the name of Powell and never heard him answer to any other name but when I cautioned Mullins on 28th July at Milton-street to be careful of him he said That is not Powell that is Johnson —I said I deny it his name is Powell —he stood right opposite and did not say a word WILLIAM GARDNER I am a carpenter of 39 Ashley-street Hoxton I am not a Chartist or a member of any Chartist Association—I knew Powell who worked at Mr Smith s between six and seven years—I know the reputation he bears and certainly should not believe him on his oath Cross-examined by MR ATTORNEY-GENERAL Q You have not known him for six or seven years A No I have met him once or twice in the street and walked with him a few yards as he was going to his work and I was going to mine—I never heard him examined on his oath I would not believe him on his oath from the reputation he bore in the shop as a man guilty of lying and different circumstances which have taken place in the shop I was on my guard that he was a notorious storyteller—I have heard him say that the Bible was a tissue of falsehoods openly in the shop—Carr was there and Pennell and a young man named Webster—Paris was not foreman-while 1 was there—he seemed to be acquainted with the Scriptures from mentions different instances but I do not consider myself a judge—I should not consider him better read in Scripture than me perhaps as well—he explained incidssa and circumstances which I was not familiar with before by comparing one portion of Scripture with another portion to contrast it—I took no notice of it but kept on with my work—he did it offhand without the book from his apparent knowledge of the subject—I have never been a Chartist—I was subpoenaed by a man who I do not know—I do not know how they found me out I made no communication since my deposition was taken by Mr Roberts about a week since—I went to him—he was a perfect stranger to me till then—he came to my house and I went with him to his cbambers-Nicholls went with me—I had not seen Pennell on the subject MR BALLANTINE Q What was Powell called in the shop A I knew him by the sobriquet of Lying Tom —that was used in his presence and hearing—I have heard an apprentice call him so—he would say It is nonsense Lying Tom I won t believe you —I have beard little Jack say so to his face HENRY WATSON I am a bricklayer of 5 Garden-court Hoston Old Town I have known Powell from his boyhood up to this time except losing sight of him for about two years thirteen or fourteen years ago—I went to school with him—from what I know of him and of the reputation he bears I would not believe him on his oath Cross-examined by MR ATTORNEY-GENERAL Q You have not worked with him in the shop A No but I have worked at jobs with him—I have not heard him examined or make any statement on his oath—I have heard him swear that if he had his will he would pull his b - - y old father out of his grave arid strew his b - - y old bones about the street for not leaving him the money—he swore that Lord John Russell had cut his throat—that was at the bench and I heard it—he said Lord John Russell by God has cut his throat —I said I don t believe you you are such an infernal liar —that is what I call swearing if a man says by God —I considered he was perjuring himself by saying that—one day he said the Duke of Wellington was dead—he came in once and said I was with a woman and told her Mr Donald had dropped down dead won t his old woman be in a way when she goes home and tells her —one morning he said Harry We are going to Kennington-common —I said What is there to do there —he said There is a general rising there I shall go armed to it —I said I should not—he said You are not doing your duty as a man if you do not you can get a little short knife get it ground up and the first policeman that strikes you stick it into his belly and he won t give you another stroke —I cannot remember any other reason for not believing him—I did not go to Kennington-common to any of the meetings—I signed a paper which was put into the Northern Star—it was to have been given to the prisoner s Counsel—an individual I did not know left a bit of paper saying that I was to so to a street in the Queen s-road Dalston I went there to a master bootmaker I do not know his name but I can take any one there—the paper said he wanted me in a case that Powell had been doing—the master shoemaker wrote the paper but be made a mistake in the date and made me a carpenter—I did not discover that till I signed it—I did not read it before I signed it—he read it over but did not read my profession—the date was put on it but I forget it—Gill and Nicholls came to me to go to Mr Roberts—I suppose they are bis clerks by the questions they asked me CHARLES GOODFELLOW I am a tailor of 5 Half-alley Buckingham-street Strand I work for Mr

associations and have not been for five or six years—I am not enrolled now—I was once—I knew Powell in the Chartist agitation in 1839 by attending many of the meetings—on the Monday night previous to the arrest he came into the Coach and Horses High Holborn with another man while I was sitting there—he nodded to me I returned it he came across and said Well have you got any work now —I said No —he asked if I would make him a coat as he and another who were going to Australia wanted some clothes made and he could give them me to do if I could make them as cheap as he could buy them at a shop—I agreed to make them and he gave me half-a-crown to come to the Orange Tree on Wednesday between five and six o clock to measure him for a coat when he would give me the money to purchase the cloth as I said I could not do so for I had not got it—I got there about half-past five I was not particular to five or ten minutes and saw the police going round across Red Lion-square—Powell knew me by sight I cannot say whether he did by name Cross-examined by MR ATTORNEY-GENERAL Q You saw the police running across the square were you in the square at the time A Yes I could see Orange-street but not the Orange Tree—I went on and waited outside the Orange Tree according to my appointment—I was to have gone in but did not because the police went in and shut the door and would not let any one in—I spoke to no policeman—I spoke to persons there but cannot name any one—I waited about twenty minutes to see what was the matter and found out that they took some men away but I did not know what for—I went in the evening to the Dean-street locality because I had been in the habit of going there—I am an unenrolled Chartist a Chartist in principle—I have attended the meetings—I found many persons at Dean-street but not so many as usual—I do not know who they were I am not acquainted with their names—it was a public meeting and I went to it—there was talk there of the people being taken up—I cannot say whether I went straight there from the Orange Tree—I went alone—I went home first to have my tea—I staid at home half an hour—I did not leave anything at home—I went to Dean-stoet and then wrote a letter stating what I had seen there because I was endeavoured to be entrapped—I found it was a plot laid against me—I wrote it in case that after coming home from the meeting anything should be done to briny me into the plot that it should be seen how I was served—I Destroyed it the day after because it was of no use then—I did not know that I should not be taken up then but I did not want to have any more to do with it I thought I would not have any connection with it any more whatever because I felt convinced it would be hurtful to me even to come here tell this statement and I thought I should have no further use for it—I wrote it on the impulse of the moment and felt I had no further necessity for it when I came to consider my own actions—I found a party had been inquiring for me and wanted to speak to me on this trial—I had my work to attend to and could not support my wife and children unless I attended to it last Monday I met a man who I do not know—he gave me a subpoena to come here—I did not offer myself not to that party—I said when I found I was wanted I would come forward rather than see the men sacrificed—I was at Kennington-common meeting but not at Clerkenwell or Finsbury-square or when they marched round London—I have been at meetings at Bonner -fields—I have been at Dean-street three or four times—I know Barry—I was not at a meeting when a paper was read To hell with the Queen —I did not hear Crowe speak or Looney—I do not know whether the people that met at Dean-street were Chartists or Confederates—they talked of the affairs of both

or three minutes—I did not speak to him—I had known him three four or five years—I hare never seen Fay or Lacey—Cartwright s was my place—I was at home on the night of the 15th—I did not go to Cartwright s or Dean-street or to any meeting—the last time I was at Cartwright s before the 16th was one Sunday night about three weeks before this arrest—I do not know Carter or Gill by name nor Donaldson—the only public meetings I have been to are Kenning-ton-common and Bonner s fields—I have attended public meetings Anti-Con law Poor-law and so forth but none since 10th April except Cartwrigii s—a meeting was called by one of the speakers at Cartwright s inviting parties to come forward and join the association and by doing so they would be benefiting the cause of the Irish Confederation and those who did not join they considered ought not to mix themselves up with the affair unless they brought members—Dwaine was there—I got up and asked if their object was peaceable legal and constitutional—the consequence was that I was cried down by the parties—Powell who was there said That is a b - - y moral-force coward —he pointed me out cried me down and those that were in connection with him—three or four made themselves very busy—about 100 were there—I do not know their names they were strangers I never made it my business to ask names because I was suspected not being a member of being at different meetings to be inquisitive—I cannot say whether it was 4th Aug —it was on a Sunday a fortnight or three weeks before the arrest—I do not know Mullins Dowling Rose

Shouldham-street or Clerkenwell—I mistake I was at Clerkenwell at the first meeting that was ever held—it was five months ago—there was no procession then—I never attended any procession—I cannot

Wednesday—I attended no committee or anything else—I am not a member or warden of any committee—I have taken no office—I never attended a Confederate meeting—the Confederates very seldom come down to

public-house to get some refreshment close to Kennington-common about three o clock—there were only four or five in my company—when we got to the bridge we were stopped by the police—several persons went into that house to have refreshment—I was not in a crowd of many thousands—I and my friend could not pass the bridge—we left Westminster and went to see if we could pass over Vauxhall-bridge—I

other sixteen—I can read—I had seen printed bills before the meeting warning all persons not to attend—I cannot say that I saw them as we walked from the locality three or four abreast—I did not see bills all about the houses to my knowledge—I had seen them before and determined to go notwithstanding—I saw no one armed there—I did not have a struggle with the police to pass Westminster-bridge nor did any of ray party—we never interfered with them by word or act—I endeavoured to go over Vauxnall-bridge and found it blockaded with police—we did not go as far as Vauxhall but I was informed so by

appointed—I think I fell in with it at the place appointed—I did not want to be told where to meet as I was at the locality on the Sunday night before—I had no particular orders—I had no further orders than to be there to attend the meeting before ten—an order was issued it may be by the class-leader that we were not to go armed—there might be six or seven class-leaders besides Taprell I cannot tell you exactly—I cannot tell the names—my locality consisted of sixty or seventy—I have known men to be delegated—the last delegate appointed was Mr Savage—I do not know whether he went to Kennington-common with us I did not see him that day at all—I knew the delegates from other men because I knew them personally—I do not recollect their names—I knew them at the time—I do not think I ever had the rules of the locality—I have not got them I do not think I ever had them—I do not think I could have had them and forgotten them—I never did have them—there were not fifty or sixty people assemble at the locality on 10th April—there were not more than twenty and those I lost before I got to Holborn as they walked so fast I could not walk with them—when I joined the procession we went arm-in-arm—New walked with me but I lost my locality and do not know what locality I got into—they were entire strangers to me—I did not know them or where they came from—I do not think that locality had banners—I saw the banner of my own locality—I cannot inform you what was on it—I did know—I do not think we had above one or two—I was never at a public meeting where banners were displayed except on 10th April—I do not think I was—I have not often attended public meetings—I cannot tell you who carried the banner because I was not with my locality—it was not opened in the room—Abraham Dodd was our secretary—I never saw tickets referring to a house in Hatton-garden where a man might buy a pike gun or pistol cheap—I do not know the number of the house—I never heard of such a place and never saw such a card in our locality or any other or in any Chartist s hands—I never saw such a thing before—our warden was named Crispin—whether there was another I do not know—I never saw this card of the London Life and Property Protection Society before produced —I was never at the Orange-Tree orthe Angel—I first heard the men were taken into custody a few days after they were taken—I do not know a coffee-shop in Charles-street Hatton-garden—I did not see the wardens on the morning of 10th April—the best part of the people were gone when I arrived at the locality I got there late—there were not above twenty went away with me—we all arrived late—we heard as we went along that the others had gone before us—that might be the majority of the locality fifty or sixty—I went on with the rear about twenty and then I lost before I got to Tottenham-court-road MR BALLANTINE Q Had you arms with you on that occasion A No—I have never had arms in my possession from the commencement to the conclusion MR BALLANTINE to GEORGE DAVIS Q Have you ever sold guns A Yes—I have sold two within the last six months—I have sold no pikes or pistols—I know a person named John Stanton formerly a policeman of the R division—I did not press him to join the Wat Tyler locality of Chartists at Greenwich—I never asked him to do so—I never offered to sell him a pike fur 3s 6d or at all or any others—I did not offer him a brace of pistols—I had a brace of pistols to sell for 12s not my property—I do not recollect that I offered to sell them to him directly I have offered to sell them to anybody for 15s —I gave 12s for them—I have been asked the price of them and have asked 15s —I may have offered to sell them in his presence—I am boot-maker but I keep a broker s shop and deal in second-hand books as well—I am a general dealer in everything old books shoes furniture or anything that is for sale—I attend sales—I bought the guns at a sale at Mr Toolins —I am not a marine-store dealer—I did not say I had powder and shot and could supply Stanton with it neither powder nor shot not to any one nothing of the kind—I never told Stanton if he would buy them he could pay so much a week in the best manner he could—I was attending Chartist meetings at the time I offered the pistols for sale—I never told Stanton the police Intended to arrest all the Chartists and he had better have a pike to defend himself—I have had very little conversation with him—I did not tell him the police intended to arrest all or any of the Chartists—I never advised him to have a pike—I never had but two guns two swords and a pair of pistols in my possession—I have got one old sword at home now—I have not shown them to a great number of the labouring classes—they are exposed for sale in the shop and the pistols I have got now—I never said while they were lying on the counter to different people that I wished I had a place where they could practise firing them that they might serve out the b - - blue devils—I understand Stanton once met me coming-out of the police-station at Blackheath hill I did not see him—he did not speak to me—he never has done so I am certain—I did not tell him I had been there to repair the inspector s boots—I have called and showed one person a pair of boots I had to repair for the inspector but not at the time he said I came out of the station-house—I know Joseph Munday—he might be present when I tried to sell a musket to a man named Sheedey—I did not hear Munday persuade him not to buy it—I did not turn round and say Munday ought to be ashamed of himself as he knew the Chartists were arriving in London—I never made use of the expression—I saw Munday at the Druids Arms in June I do not remember any particular night—he is a Chartist and a Confederate—I offered to sell him a brace of pistols for 16s having a pair to dispose of—I cleaned them having served for years to the gun-making trade—I was to give 12s for them whether I sold them or not—he wanted to buy a pair I offered him them for 16s he thought it too much and I told him who I bought them of and how much I was to give for them—I never said they were good ones to fire—I never let them off—he did not ask me if they were good ones to fire and I did not say I should like to have the b - - old Duke of Wellington before me to try them—he refused to buy them at 16s —when the Duke of Wellington has been blamed in the Druids Arms as a bad general I have supported him—I know Henry Heath—he carries on business in the same street with me—I had a room in his house—I left about 4s or 6s rent owing but I left two tea-caddies or work-boxes as security for it till I could recover myself—it was between six and seven years ago—I swear there was not 3l 4s owing or 1l —there was nothing in the tea-caddies to my knowledge—he afterwards agreed to keep them for the amount I owed him—one was brass-bound—I did not call on him I to my knowledge about twelve months ago and ask him to help me in forming a Chartist club in Greenwich for it was formed before—I swear I never asked him or any other man to join a Chartist club—I may have asked him to come up to the meeting for the benefit of the landlord that is all—I may have asked 100 or 150 to do so in the course of my time—I swear I have not asked 500—I think Heath declined I am not certain—I never saw him there—I do not know that he refused—I will not say he refused or said he would come—he never did come—my interest or the landlord was because he was a young and inexperienced man from the country when he took the house it cost him more money than the house was worth and I knew it and took it in hand to get customers for the house and if a deputation came down from London I considered they should have their Private meetings there—I secreted myself heard their conversation and reported to Mr Mallilaew the superintendant of police what was being formed in the town—he advised that the meetings should be allowed to be held as long as nothing was going on—he said he would send policemen there and he did—I did not advise the people to come to the meeting—I took people there for the landlord s benefit as the house was doing nothing—the persons applied to the landlord for the room but not in my presence—the landlord has paid me for soliciting custom to the house—I was paid for my friendship if I wanted half-a-sovereign or five shillings the landlord has given it—there was no stipulated mode of payment—I never showed Heath some and said I brought them down from London and was going to take them to the Druids Arms—he did not say that no sensible man would talk in that way—I never begged him to go to the Druids Arms as he would there hear arguments that would convince him—I only advised him or any one to go for the sake of what they would spend on the landlord and not for any good to the selves—I did not say they would benefit by the speeches—I considered just the contrary—I do not know that it would do them harm—the speeches I am confident would do nobody any good—I do not particularly remember the birth of Her Majesty s last child—I did not allude to it to Heath—I never used any disrespectful expressions about that child to him—I never said to him Now you will see what we can do we shall soon all be ready or words to that effect—I told him I had joined the Chartists—I did not say I was one—Heath was not a Chartist—I do not believe he ever attended any meeting for the benefit of the landlord or any other party—I know parish—I do not know his Christian name—I do not know that I told him I had got up a Chartist association at Greenwich—he is a Chartist—he belonged to it before I did—I never told him so—I told him I had bought two guns at a sale and had got them cheap which I had—I did not say You shall have them cheap as guns are wanted —I said I had bought them cheap and should sell them cheap—I did not say As guns were wanted —I saw his on 16th Aug on Blackheath-hill between one and two o clock—I may have said You are the very man I want to see or something to that effect—he said What s up or something to that effect—I believe I said that was the night the blow was to be struck—I did not ask him if he would come up—I asked him to wait at the Druids Arms till I came down from London at eight o clock—he was then going to his dinner—that was to keep him out of mischief—I did not put my hand to my breast and say I am ready nothing of the kind—I never carried any thing in my breast-pocket—I thought you inferred I had something there that is why I say that—I know William Robinson of 1 Green s-cottages Skilton-street—I did not see him on Sunday 9th April to my knowledge—I saw him the Thursday before—I will not be certain whether that was the last time I saw him before the 10th for I was ill at the time—I did not then propose to him a meeting at the Druids Arms on the following Tuesday—I did afterwards—I did not belong to the Charts then and did not know what their principles were—I did not offer him a pair of pistols to go up with to the meeting that was to be held on Whit-Monday—I offered him a pair of pistols or any one else who would buy them for 16s —they were in my window—I carried them with me when I went to the meeting have never offered them for sale—I took them to the meeting I have told them of them but never offered them—I carried them in my breeches pocket loaded both in one pocket—they were pocket-pistols—they are at Greenwich—I did not succeed in selling them—I would have if I could—I told the Jury yesterpay or the day before that I needed them for my protection—if I had sold them 1 should have brought another pair for my protection and got some thing for profit—I should have taken the chance in the meantime—I do not Remember telling Robinson I had been a witness in the County Court at Greenwich it was well known—it was an action for assault—I know John Ward—he is a farrier or smith—I never asked him to attend Chartist meetings—he is leader of the Confederates—I never told him physical force was the best thing—I never advised it to anybody—I told him for the sake of his family to be careful what he was about in case he should get into trouble—I never advocated physical force—I knew the man and did not wish to see him throw himself away—I knew if he said anything I should report it—I did not say to him Physical force is the only thing or words to thai effect—I believe I asked him on Whit-Monday if he was going to the meeting at Bonner s-fields—I did not tell him I was going armed or advise him to go armed I advised him to stop at home—I told him I was going but it was not worth his while to lose his work to go to the meeting and he had better stop at home—I did not get up a raffle for arms—the pistols were attempted to be raffled but they were not because I returned the money—I originally proposed it but there was not a paper drawn—there were to be sixteen shilling chances—a person named Brewerton gave me 1s that was the only one I returned it him as it never came to a raffle—it was at my shop—I told Ward and a good many people there was to be an outbreak in London—that was to keep them away—I told them to keep away for they would never get the day—I told Ward and Sheedey so—I did not tell Ward I was going to reconnoitre the town or examine the town to ascertain the point of attack nothing of the kind—I said I would get up early with Bligh to see if there was a chance of a riot taking place and if there was we would get out of danger—that was why I went to Bonner sfields—Robinson very likely saw me tear the covers off some old books I do not remember his seeing it—I said I should give them to Blagden the landlord of the Druids Arms for wadding as he was going into the country to shoot—I do not remember whether that was to Ward or Robinson—I dare say Blagden could show you the best part of it now—I recollect Ward and Robinson proposing to dissolve the association—I cannot tell you the date—it was on a Sunday evening in July or Aug —it was through a speech made by Bligh—I opposed it—I never addressed a meeting in my life—I merely said in private conversation with three of us Why should you wish to break the meeting up —Bligh commenced it by asking the members to support Looney s wife and said the club would receive their money—I opposed a dissolution because I thought it would injure the landlord if the trade was to go away from the house—I did not say they were a parcel of cowards to my recollection—I cannot remember every word that took place three months back—I may have made use of the word coward on account of being frightened at Bligh s stating that the officers of the club were ready to receive subscriptions for the support of Looney s family—I used the word coward to prevent them dissolving the club—the club broke up then notwithstanding my calling them cowards—I did not then pull out my pistols and say if anybody attempted to take me I would blow their brains out never in my life—I had not the pistols with me—I never said what 1 would do if anybody had a disposition to arrest me—nothing was said about arresting or attempting to arrest to my knowledge—I do not believe I said if anybody attempted to arrest me I would blow their brains out—to the best of my knowledge I never made use of the term—I do not believe I said it—I have used a great many expressions—I cannot swear it—I possibly made use of the expression—it was merely to throw them off their guard but I forget it if I did-there are not billiards at the Druids Arms there is bagatelle and dominoes—I played every night or nearly so—very seldom for money but for liquor—sometimes there was a bet on it MR ATTORNEY-GENERAL Q Did you from time to time report to Inspector Marks what had occurred at the Druids Arms as well as other places A I did it was taken down by him I signed it—I have carried on the business of a broker and shoemaker near on twelve months—I was a shoemaker when I had a room at Heath s seven years ago—I was not well off when I went there but through working early and late I saved 2s or 3s and got the shop—I only went in with two or three shillings—I have been thriving since—I have been at the shop seven years next April—it was at a sale three months ago of Mr Toolm s a large auctioneer in London-street Greenwich that I bought the gun pistols and sword—I bought the two guns and sword for 4s 6d and the pistols for 12s —I did not have the old iron sword at the sale that was bought at the Druids Arms—they were at my door and window for sale and were sold in three or four days—Stanton was formerly a policeman- did not know him as one—I have known him four or five years—Le came to see people that worked for me and told me he was one—that was before the time I had conversation with him—he was not a Chartist to my knowledge then—I believe he is not now but they would not let him work as asssistant grave-digger at the parish church if he went into that house—he is assistant grave-digger merely a jobber—Munday is a Chartist and I believe a Confederate but I will not be certain he is a shoemaker—Heath is not a Chartist he keeps a shop now he did not when I first lived with him—he is a boot-closer—there is a little animosity between Wright who works for me and him because Wright had a boy apprenticed to him—Parish is a Chartist and Confederate I have known him I suppose about a month—he is a blacksmith working for Mr Mackie at Blackheath-hill—Robinson is a shoemaker and a very violent Chartist—Bligh made a very violent speech at a meeting and at the conclusion called on the persons present to contrite to the support of the wife and family of Looney who is in confinement and said the officers of the club were ready to receive the money and his fried Mr Ward—Ward was a Chartist and Confederate—he had a good situation in Greenwich in constant work and he thought by being called an officer of the club he should be arrested and loose his work and his family would be starving—he found fault with Bligh for using that term knowing there was no club formed and Bligh said You know there is no club you cannot be hurt for it and I said You must be cowards to leave it in that way —the club was never dissolved—some kept away and some came—no officers were appointed to the club—we used to meet and read the newspapers and sometimes make a speech but Bligh was the principal spokesman with the exception of when Looney came down from London—he came several times and other persons—M Manus and the two Barry s and Bailey were there—those are all the names I recollect—they were Confederates I understand from the Davis Club—Looney was not at Greenwich to my knowledge when the people walked round the town he might have been the Sunday before JOHN STANTON I am a labouring man I was fomerly a policeman of the R division—I have known Davis for the last two years—about three months ago he asked me to join the Wat Tyler Division of Chartists at Greenwich—he offered to sell me a pike—head for 2s 6d and handle it for 3s 6d and if that would not suit me he had a brace of pistols and plenty of powder and ball—he did not show me the pike—head he said he would go to London and get it for me—I was to pay for it by instalments in the best manner I could as I was out of employment—he said he had a place in London where be could purchase such tilings—he said the police were going to arrest all the Chartists and I had better have a pike to defend myself he expected perhaps the police might drop in on us some time when we were little aware of it that he had powder and shot in his possession and he could supply me or any of us that wanted it up-stairs in the club-room at the Druids Arms that he wished he had a place where they could practise firing as they would serve out those b - - blue devils only he said he thought it would annoy tie neighbours—he held a long fowling-piece in his hand—I did not speak to him or he to me when he came out of the Blackheath station he took care of that for he ran away like a dog with a tin-kettle tied to his tail

the pistols in his hand at his shop—he did not take them out of the window—I saw three guns in his shop but it did not matter what it was I wanted gun pistol or anything if I had money to have purchased it and he would have furnished me with powder and shot as well if I had been destitute—he said he had guns at 6s 6d 7s 6d and different prices—he had a large fowling-piece and a soldier s musket—he took up the gun at his shop-door and said What do you think of this do not you think this would do if it was loaded to shoot the b - - y blue devils —I went over to the Druids Arms—he came over soon afterwards—there were three men with me—John Matthews was one—I cannot recollect the names exactly now—a gentleman named Ward of Blackheath asked me questions and said You are wanted at the Old Bailey to speak the truth —I told him what I knew this morning before I started—a gentleman who was with him wrote down what I said—I do not know who that was—I saw Ward last evening coming out of the shop where he was at work—we did not talk about this—he did not say a word to me about Davis—I had not been in the habit of topping to him—I said There you are John and away I went—he is a

Chartists with—I said to him that no sensible man would talk in the way—he advised me to go to the Druids Arms where I should hear arguments to convince me—after the birth of Her Majesty s last child Davis something disrespectful in reference to its birth—about six days before 16th Aug the 11th as near as 1 can recollect he said to me Now you will soon see what we can do we shall soon all be ready

he was a Chartist not that had joined them—I mentioned what I could state to Mr Roberts yesterday after nine o clock at night—Mr Bellus who I know sent Holmes to me who was a stranger to me—I had told Bellus on Saturday that Mr Davis the great Chartist leader at Greenwich was supposed to be a spy that he had tried to make me one of himself but being such a character I could not place any faith in him provided my principles laid that way—that was why Bellas Holmes to me—Bellus is not a Chartist that I know of—I was not afraid Davis was coming as a witness—I said he was a spy because it was reported in the neighbourhood for some weeks—by a spy I mean a man to deceive another—I was not mixed up with the Chartists—Frederick Martin a carpenter came into my shop and said he would have a word about Davis respecting this spy and Davis said be would give him 2s worth—that was the first I heard—I knew Davis as a Chartist by his words and actions—I never saw him at the Druids Arms—I never was at a Chartist meeting only public meetings—only one where Chartists were mentioned—that was at the Lecture-hall Greenwich—I know Wright—he works for Davis—he has never had me up for illtreating an apprentice—I have an apprentice who is a foster child of Wright s wife and is a cripple—he was sent to the hospital from my bouse—Nature is not favourable to everybody it was no fault of mine—he was hump-backed when he was apprenticed to me—that was all that was the matter with him—he went to the hospital for a pain in his side—no one took him from my place—he went up himself several times and got advice—Wright s wife has not threatened me for ill-using him—I never spoke to her in my life—Wright has never complained to me nor anybody—it is only the boy s own temper—he has accused me of his hump-back—he has not accused me of kicking him in the side or striking him or shoving him down stairs—I have a greengrocer s shop and a coal-shed—some nuts had been stolen and I met the boy cracking them—I shoved him over some coals there—he never complained but since that he has been trying to make out that the hump-back was caused by it—he tried to raise that three months ago—there has been no illwill between Wright and me—we have always been nn good terms only while the boy was in the hospital he wanted me to bear all the expense of it and to find him in everything—everything has gone on right and at the last conversation I had with him he advised the boy to behave better—the boy fell on the coals on his hands—I was rather in a passion and cannot say whether he fell sideways or backwards—his face was towards me when he ell but he never went plump down as the wall kept him up—befell over a heap of coals and partly of wood and rubbish which had been swept up in one corner MR HUDDLESTON Q What relation was he to Wright A None Whatever—a woman had had five bastard children Mrs Wright was in the habit of nursing them Mr Wright was in the habit of fetching her back-wards and forwards and one child was apprenticed to me under false pretences—I sell firewood and greengrocery but not coals—I have given up the shoe-making two years and a half—when this happened to the boy a partition went across to part off the place where I carried on the shoemaking—he had nothing to do with the greengrocer s shop—he was apprenticed to me as a boot-maker—I caught him in the greengrocer s shop and found some nuts in his mouth—I came on him suddenly—I had missed nuts before and money—no complaint was made by the boy or his friends for two years—I had to complain of him in the meantime—I had complained to Wright plenty of times of his idleness before he brought the charge against me—he merely said when he had been vexed—if you had him here he would say I did not do it—when he complained of bis back I gave him leave to go to the hospital—the people there thought he had better go into the hospital and I allowed him—it was about a month ago—the only quarrel between me and Wright was because he wanted me to pay part of the expenses—I gave the boy 1s while he was there and took him apples and pudding and did his washing—his friends never took him a halfpenny COURT Q I suppose by the indentures you were bound to keep him A Yes—Wright said I ought regularly to supply him with tea sugar and refreshments—I said he should want for nothing but I thought his friends ought to do something for him as he was doing no work for me—Holmes introduced himself to me as a friend of Bellus whom I knew—Mr Roberts the attorney came and took down my evidence—I told him what I have told you to-day JOSEPH DUNN I am a hat-manufacturer of 128 London-wall—I have lived there about a year and a half—before that I lived at 82 Chiswell-street finsbury and carried on the same business I am a Chartist—up to Aug 1846 I was a member of the National Charter Association—I am not so now—I have attended meetings lately—I was not a member in 1848—a similar card to the one produced was used in 1846—this is not exactly the same plan of organization as was used in 1846—it has been revised since—I do not see any very important difference—the plans of organization are similar to those which existed in my time—I was a member about six years from the foundstion up to 1846 and took an active part up to that time—I held of be—I was president of the City of London branch and treasurer—I always considered the object was to obtain the Charter by peaceable and constitutional means otherwise I should not have mixed myself up with it—I never witnessed any secret proceedings in the society—there were none in ray department—there were delegates at that time—the plans for class-leaders were laid down but not acted on WILLIAM DIXON I am a collier by trade—at present I am one of the Directors of the National Land Company and live at 144 High Holborn I am a Chartist by political sentiments—I have been a member of the National Charter Association eight or nine years— looking at one of the cards produced this is a card of membership used by the National Charter Association—I never understood that its object was otherwise than to obtain the people s Charterer peaceable and constitutional means—there is something about class-leaders on this plan of organization produced —I do not see anything about delegates—this is the plan of organization now recognized—there have been revisions of it—there is nothing connected with the Association or the means which it employs illegal unconstitutional or otherwise than peaceable—there is nothing about arms in this paper—there is nothing about arms connected with the Association—it is not a secret association club or confederacy—any one may join it on the condition that he enters his name on the books and subscribes to the six points of the Charter—to my knowledge it has no secret correspondence with any other association—it was not formed for the purpose of raising insunecte or rebellion in this country Cross-examined by

style honour and dignity of the Imperial Crown MR ATTORNEY-GENERAL with MESSRS WELSBY CLARKSON BODKIN and CLERK conducted the Prosecution THOMAS POWELL In April last I joined the Chartist Association I do not remember on what day—the association was divided into different localities in London—I belonged to the Cripplegate locality the place of meeting for which was at Cartwright s Coffee-house Redcross-street Cripplegate in a front room on the first floor—the affairs of that locality were conducted by a council of five persons—I was appointed by that council to attend a meeting of a committee at the Black Jack in Portugal-street—it was called the secret committee—I have notes that I made from time to time of the transactions that I witnessed—that meeting at the Black Jack was on Thursday July 20—when I got there I found Payne Brewster Rose Mullins Dowling Allnut a delegate from Greenwich and others amounting altogether to fourteen assembled—I did not then know the name of the delegate from Greenwich I have since discovered it was Davis—I do not think I have any recollection of the persons names who attended the meeting except from this paper—sometimes I made the memorandum two days after the meeting and at the latter part of the meetings I took care to put it down when I got home on the same night—I always did it within a day or two after—I got there about nine o clock in the evening—I was asked for my credentials—I attended as a delegate from the Cripplegate locality—I stated that I was one of the council appointed to attend there as a delegate—I produced my credential which was a leaf torn out of a book which I had received from Mr Bezer the secretray of the Cripplegate locality—I gave the half to Payne who was chairman and he compared it with a book he had in his hand it corresponded with the leaves in that book and he said That will do —each delegate was called on to give a report of the feelings of the members of his locality and the number of fighting men and now they were disposed for a physical-force movement—each delegate made a return of the kind—I have not a note of the number but I remember that the number I gave in was eighty or ninety—I do not remember the numbers given in by of the others—some papers and credentials and leaves of a book in which the names of people were kept who had attended other secret meetings were burnt at the gas—at that meeting a committee of five was elected as a plotting committee to draw up five plans of action—those five plans were to he produced to the general body of delegates at the next meeting and the best of those five plans was to be selected and acted on—the five persons appointed were Payne Brewster Rose Mullins and Dowling—the meeting was then adjourned to Denny s Coifee-house Great St Andrews-street Seven-dials on the following Sunday the 23rd—I got there about ten and found Mullins Rose Dowlining and Breuster there—Payne went with me—we remained there about an hour before the general meeting of delegates took place—Mullins had a pocket-book and a map of London lying on the table and there were other plans—each of them had pipers in their hands and were busy in conversation—I did not see the papers that the others had except one plan—I had a perfect view of it—that was a plan of the Seven Dials—I saw Dowling take the plan into his hands and he said he thought he could not undertake the management of the Seven Dials—he then returned the plan to Mullins who put it into his pocket-book and put the pocket-book into his pocket—I do not recollect that anything was said about the other plans or papers which the other members had—it was not said at ill what the other plans were—I do not recollect it—Payne took the chair at this committee—I recollect him saying Gentlemen our object is to destroy the power of the Queen and if possible to establish a republic —there was a general concurrence in that observation—there was some conversation about assassinating the police—Rose said We must first assassinate the police burn down the station-houses and build barricades —there was some conversation about pouring vitriol into the policemen s faces—I cannot say who made use of that observation but I think it was with Rose and Brewster—those suggestions seemed to be generally concurred in—I saw one plan distinctly this is it produced marked A —it is the one produced by Mullins and shown to Dowling and put by Mullins into his pocket again—a resolution was passed to admit the general body of delegates after which they were admitted into the same room—five came in and there were then ten present including myself—I know Allnut—he was there and came from Hopkinson s locality which is Saffron-hill—when the other people were admitted Mullins remarked that the plans were not sufficiently mtured for their inspection—a report was then given in by the new delegates who then attended of the number of fightingmen and the feelings of the members of their locality—they were similar reports to those which had been before made—arrangements were then made to meet at Cartwright s the same evening—I went and found Payne Mullins Rose and Brewster there—they all went into a small back room on the landing of a staircase that goes down into the back kitchen—they did not admit me with them—I waited until they came out again—they were in there about an hour—the next meeting I attended was at Hopkinson s Coffee-house Saffron-hill on Wednesday July 26th—that meeting was in consequence of arrangements made on the Sunday—Dowling Rose Mullins myself Davis Ferdinando Allnut Flanagan and others in all eighteen were present—it was Ferdinando s first appearace—he stated he was a delegate from the Green Gate Hackney-road—the fresh delegates gave in their credentials—I think they were not of the same kind as I had given but written credentials—reports were received of the number of fighting-men from their localities and how far they were disposed for a physical force movement the same kind of reports as before—a resolution was then passed that Rose should wait on the Northern Star Newspaper Office and put in an advertisement calling on all the localities of Chartists and Irish Confederates to send one or two delegates to attend a meeting on the next Tuesday at the Dispatch Coffee-house Bride-lane Fleet-street— that was adopted—delegates from the Irish Confederates attended the Chartist meetings—it was announced by one or two that evening that they were from the Irish Confederates—Dowling was one of them—I have not got the names of the others—a resolution was then passed that 10s should be brought hy every delegate—I have no note of it I speak from memory—the meeting adjourned to the following Friday July 25th at the same place—fourteen persons attended—Ferdinando Page of Tothill-street Westminster Brewster Rose Mullins Payne myself and Hopkinson and Fay Irish Confederates Flannagan and Home—I believe it was on this occasion that a resolution was passed that 10s should be brought by every delegate to pay to the committee for their purposes—a report was given in by the new delegates of the feelings of the members of their localities and of the number of fighting-men that could be depended on—some new delegates joined at that time—we adjourned to meet at Cartwright s on July 30th—I attended there—there were twenty-eight persons present the prisoner Payne Rose Dowling Fay Bassett and others—Bassett was a new delegate and also a person named Stevenson—reports were given in from the new delegates as before and the committee of five the plotting committee resigned in consequence of a charge being brought against Rose and Mullins that they were spies and Mullins stated that they thought the committee had better consist of nine they thought they would be better able to carry out the objects of the committee and each member was to draw up his plan of operation—nothing was said on that occasion as to what sort of men were to be added to the committee—Payne Rose Mullins Bassett and Dowling were then elected on the committee and the other four were to be elected at the next meeting—Rose and Mullins were re-elected notwithstanding the suggestion that they were spies—the general body of delegates were to elect the—other four—on the evening that the five were elected the committee was called the ulterior committee—a resolution was passed that they should meet if necessary on the following Monday at Cartwright s but there was no meeting to my knowledge—the next meeting I attended was on Tuesday Aug 1st at the Dispatch coffee-house—there were thirty-four delegates present—the prisoner Rose Brewster Dowling Bezer myself Fay Thompson and Donovan—it was Bezer s first appearance—that is the same man I have spoken of as having given me my credentials—Lynch was there and I have put down Fussey or Fusson Warry and Allnui—returns were made on this occasion similar to the former ones—Bezer returned the number of fifty from our locality—I knew a club or society at that time called the Irish Felon-club it was held at Cartwright s Fay was secretary—I do not remember that there was a Star Club—there might have been a club called the Davis Club at Cartwright s I have heard it spoken of and the Star Club too and the Emmett Brigade the Wat Tyler and the Tom Paine localities I have heard them spoken of at various times—delegates from those societies attended our meetings—at this meeting some conversation took place about a feeling of jealousy prevailing on the part of the Irish Confederates and some of them said they thought it was not fair that the committee should be composed of Englishmen alone—after a discussion Fay Thompson Donovan and Lynch were appointed—they were all four Irish Confederates they were added to the five to form the ulterior committee—there was then a discussion about sending a delegate to Limerick or Cork and some of them made some objections to it and said it would be a waste of time and money it was impossible to send a delegate there to obtain any news on account of the disturbed state of the country and the authorities had set such a strict watch so that no person could come away with any information—the proposition was abandoned—a proposal was made by Douling that there should be a demonstration by the Chartists and Confederates on Primrose-hill at two o clock on the following Sunday 6th Aug —that was lost by a majority of five—instead of that it was resolved that the delegates should return to their localities and ascuitain how their members were for regulanty of conduct and preparation for the coming event and they were to ascertain if they were ready to be called out at an hour s notice—money was paid in in pursuarnce of the previous resolution—I paid 7s 6d in—Mullins said he had seen Mr kydd that day and he had said if the people came out for physical force he would not be backward in heading them—Mullins said that Kydd said he had entered the executive only as a moral force man and on that ground had taken office—that statement was received by the meeting with satisfaction and surprise—I knew Kydd as a member of the executive that sat in John-street Fitzroy-square—we then adjourned to Friday the 4tb at Cartwright s—I attended there were thirty-two present Payne Rose Brewster Gurney Mullins Donovan Lynch Dowling and others—there had been a meeting of the committee an hour before that at which the prisoner was present and Rose and Bassett—it was said at that committee that Kydd had received a circular from Manchester requesting to know how far the committee of delegates were disposed to send a delegate to Manchester and that they had also received similar circulars at the Northern Star-office—the committee determined to send a person and Lacey s name was mentioned—Bassett was proposed to wait on Lacey for the purpose of his going to Manchester—I saw Mullins give Bassett the money into his hand for that purpose—there was some conversation about the scarfs that should be worn as signs of officership by the committee and it was decided that it should be a red calico sash—the thirty-two delegates were then admitted and reports were then given from the new delegates the same as before and monies paid in by different delegates—a resolution was passed that the whole of the delegates should submit to the determination of the ulterior committee—there was some conversation about an advertisement put into the Northern Star by a person named Dwaine calling a meeting at Kennington-common that was objected to by the Chartist body in general it was considered that that meeting was not called by a real Chartist and a resolution was come to that the delegates should call on their respective localities and request the members to meet at their localities on that afternoon and they were to wait until the return of the delegates from the meeting at the Dispatch coffee-house and they were to take care to secure their members from attending at Kennington-common—the delegates were to be at the Dispatch coffee-house—a resolution was passed that each delegate should select four men as telegraphs to be stationed from Bride-lane to kennington-common on the following Sunday—they were to be stationed at intervals to keep up a communication between Kennington-common and the Dispatch coffee-house in case of any conflict between the police and the people—I attended the meeting at the Dispatch coffee-house on the Sunday—I have made no memorandum of the number present but I believe it was about twenty-four or twenty-five—I was appointed to station the men as telegraphs—I was occupied nearly all the afternoon in arranging them we could not get them to work—when I returned the business in discussion was just on the close—Page of Tothill-street Mullins Rose Brewster and others were there—Page was speaking about giving Mr Bond Hughes the Government reporter a good thrashing for what he had reported—it was arranged to meet on Monday night 7th Aug at Denny s coffee-house Seven Dials—I attended there were about thirty present—all the members of the ulterior committee were there—Cuffey was present and Ritchie—there was some conversation about the reports in the newspapers of Smith O Brien s arrest in Ireland and a feeling of jealousy on the part of five of the ulterior committee in not having seen the plans of the other four—Mullins explained that he had some doubts and want of confidence in the other four he had not seen their plans and some others expressed a similar opinion—there was then a resignation of the ulterior committee—they then proceeded to elect another committee and five only were appointed Rose Mullins Brewster Payne and Bassett—there was a vote taken to furnish a salary of three farthings a head by every member of the localities to pay a president—one or two asked who this president was—a proposition was made by a delegate that there should be a president and that one of the five of the committee that had received the lowest number of votes was to retire and the president take his place—a question was asked who he was and it was answered he was neither in London nor out of London he was a sort of visionary president—on future occasions there were many questions asked who he was and what was his name—it was conceived by some of the delegates as well as myself that he was to be a visionary president we could not find out whether he was a person or who he was—we could get no information about him—a letter was read by Mr Payne at that meeting and the words used in it were Trade is very good and you will soon receive a good order —he stated that it was from Lacey at Manchester that was received by the meeting with some degree of satisfaction because that was the first we had heard of Lacey since he had been sent—a resolution was passed that they should meet on Wednesday 9th Aug at the Lord Denman beer-shop in Suffolk-street Blackfriars-read—I attended—there were twenty-eight persons there—Mullins was there Rose Donovan and others—reports were given in from the new delegates of the feelings of the members of their localities—Payne was in the chair—Mullins was vice-chairman at least he acted as such—he was chief spokesman on that occasion and generally acted as vice-chairman—I think he sat at the head of the table facing the chairman—Mullins was on all occasions chief spokesman—at this meeting Mullins called on the different delegates there to declare their allegiance to the determination of the committee to risk all for the good of the people and all with the exception of one delegate gave in their adherence to the committee that they were determined to risk all for the cause for the good of the people—another letter from Lacey was read by Payne—he had the letter in his hand and read it—I cannot remember what it was about—a question was asked how long Lacey was to remain in the country and it was answered that he would continue there as long as necessary—I believe it bad been asked whether they had heard from Lacey and Payne said he had received a letter from him and he read it—a man named Gurney was there—he Has a wardsman of the Cripplegate locality—he was formerly in the artillery—he gave in his return of fighting-men as 100—a wardsman or warden has 100 men under him and there were class-leaders over every ten men—I am not certain whether it was nine men and himself or ten men and himself or whether the warden was over 100 besides himself or with himself—we adjourned to meet at Perry s coffee-house on Friday 11th Aug in Church-street Shoreditch—I went there at eight o clock the time appointed—I found no meeting—I was informed by a person there that there was no meeting—a was a person I well knew but not his name—he was not a person stationed there—he appealed to me to be occupied by packing up some chairs—he had been stationed with me as one of the telegraphs on a former occasion —he told me that there was no meeting that it was all up—the police had been to Hose s house and seized all his papers—on hearing that I returned home—the next meeting I attended was at the Orange Tree Red Lion-square on Monday night 14th Aug —there were about twenty-five persons there there might be one or two more—Payne was in the chair—Mullins was there Cuffey Brewster Gurney Fay Ritchie and others—reports were given in by the new delegates as before—a return was given in of the number of ball-cartridges that each delegate in his locality had prepared or that he knew of—it was Mullins that asked us to give in that return—I do not remember the number—the number of fighting-men were given in and put down by Payne—Mullins looked over the list and stated the number as 5000—some one asked the number of Confederates and they said about the same number—nothing was said about the number of other persons—Mullins proposed that each delegate should select four or six men from each locality for a particular purpose—some delegate asked what they were for and Cuffey who sat on the left of Payne said that it was to set fire to houses railway premises trains or anything—Mullins said If I look up at the gas you will know what I mean —Mullins asked every one the number of men they could find—he asked me—I said I could find two—each gave a number but I forget it—it was proposed that as there Was come dispute between the North Western Railway engineers and the Company that a deputation of two should wait on the engineers to ascertain their views and how far they were disposed to come over and assist the Chartists in the movement—Ritchie and Scurry were named as delegates and left for that purpose and 1s 6d was given them to get refreshment—I am not sure whether that was Scurry s first night there but I believe not—he was a delegate—a resolution was passed to meet at the Lord Den man on the following Tuesday—I went to that meeting—the prisoner was there—Payne Brewster Cuffey Ritchie Fay Gurney Lacey and others about forty altogether—I remember Lacsy in the course of conversation telling some of us in a corner of the room that the men of Birmingham and Manchester and I think he said Liverpool were up or would be up and doing that night—he said that the police had been watching him all day and that on his coming out of the street door a boy came up to him and told him that the police were watching him and that he had been watched for about two hours and gave the police the double and reached that place in safety—there was a distribution of tri-coloured wristbands by Brewster to be worn on the left wrist that the members of their locality might distinguish their leaders—I think Mullins distributed some but I am not positive—he was present at the time of the distribution—some of the ulterior committee came in and as the room up stairs was occupied by a singing party there was a question raised where they could have a room convenient for the ulterior committee to consult and come to their resolutions—Lacey said There is a friend of mine a coffee-house keeper in the neighbourhood I think we can get a room there and I will go and see if we can have it —he left came back in about ten minutes and said they could have a room and then he left with the ulterior committee—Mullins was one of those who accompanied him and Cuffey also—they were gone about three-quarters of an hour—they then all came back but Lacey—Cuffey was at that time acting as secretary to the committee and on their return he said addressing Mullins Now Mr Chairman you had better give the instructions —Mullins then took up his position at the head of the table stood up and addressed all present Gentlemen as the Committee have retired and come to certain resolutions and decisions they have requested me to give you the following instructions and as our friend Mr Laeey has informed us and we have no reason to doubt the correctness of his statement that the men of Birmingham and Manchester are up and doing or will be up am doing to-night to-morrow night you must come out to fight and strike the blow it is necessary you should speak out honestly and boldly for there must be no flinching in the matter —Cuffey then said Mr Chairman you had better put the question round the room and let them answer yes or no my time is short my men are waiting I take the western division —Mullins then asked the delegate sitting next to me whether he would come out to fight—he said Yes —he then appealed to me and I said Yes —he appealed to all rour d till he came to Ferdinando who rose up and made a sort of speech and gave an explanation why he would not and said he would not and also another one who sat next to Allnut—with those two exceptions they all said yes—after that had been gone through Mullins said every delegate must assemble the members of his locality at their localities at eight o clock to-morrow night and they were to come armed—a question was abked how were they to come with their poles and pikes and Mullins said I can only say they must get them there the best way they can —he said We shall take up four positions Mr Brewster will take Clerkenu ell-green Mr Payne will take the Tower-haralets and myself and Mr Bassett will take the Broadway Westminster and Seven-dials —I am not certain which of the two was to take either—Mullins said the delegates were to come armed and every delegate was to be with his members at their respective positions at twenty minutes past nine to a second—he also proposed that Ritchie should be the man appointed to superintend and direct the men for firing and it was put and carried that he should he the person—Ritchie was present—he did not object to it—I do not think he said anything—it was proposed that they should meet at the Orange Tree at five—that was carried—a question was put how were these men to know Ritchie and some delegate proposed the words Frost and Mitchell as a pass-word—it was afterwards proposed that the word Justice should be the pass-word and that was carried—that pass-word was to be used by every man when he went into the room and opened the door and Ritchie was to ask Who do you want What do you want and they were to make use of the word Justice and by that word Ritchie would know them—Mullins then asked every delegate round the room how many fire-men he had selected—I think the person next to me gave in his number—he appealed to me and 1 said two—I had spoken to one—he then went round the room and Payne put down the number on a piece of paper—forty-six was the number—almost the last words Mullins said were May God s bitterest curse hang on the soul of that man who shall betray any one of us —the ribbands that were distributed were exactly like this produced —I was at a meeting next day Wednesday 16th Aug at the Crispin in Milton-street—it was arranged on the Tuesday evening at the Lord Denman that the different districts should meet their respective leaders the City district the Finsbury and Cripplegate locality and some other districts were all included in one and were all to meet Brewster at the Crispin at twelve in the day to receive further instructions that was what was called the Clerkenwell district—I got there about a quarter to one and found eight or ten there—Brewster was there and Fay and Gurney—Brewster said that he meant to attack the Artillery-ground and if possible to take it—he said that they would have to fight b—y hard and he also said that Ritchie said he would shoot the first man that flinched from his duty—he said we should know by four o clock whether the Government had any intimation of what was going on—there was a man there with Brewster who I had seen before he was packing up the chairs and said there was to be no meeting—Brewster pointed to him and said That man will come to you and bring you instructions he is to be your attendant on Clerkenwell-green you need not be alarmed at not seeing the signals for half an hour or so they are to be bonfires Cross-examined by MR PARRY Q Have you used the word bonfires before A I do not remember—I believe I am thirty-four or thirty-five years old—I went by the name of Johnson in the Chartist body from the time I entered which was shortly after April 10th—I do not remember whether I had any communication with the police before I entered—I may have and forgotten it—it was about the time I joined—I entered to ascertain what was going on and to communicate it—I communicated with the police from the beginning—I do not think I did before I entered—the only other name I have been called is Robinson and I said Call me what name you like —it was indifferent to me—I may have said My name is not Robinson it is Johnson —before 1 joined I was working for Mr Smith my brother-in-law—the week before I worked for a gentleman who wanted me to complete a roof—I have worked for Mr Smith ten or eleven years except when I had a job occasionally—I have attended a race-course—I was an apprentice my master asked me if I should like to go to the races and said it would be a holiday for me—I went by his inducement—I went into a gambling-booth—I was there three or four days—I went out of the booth several times to see the races—I was paid 30s for it—I played but it was only pretence—I was never at a race before and was quite ignorant of the nature of it—I was getting 14s a week from my master to the best of my memory—it was rather a good job for I was not out of my time—I acted as a decoy—my master s brother accompanied me and invited me to go—I was not quite twenty-one years old—that is the only time I haveattended a race-course in any capacity—there is a game called thimble-rig—I have never played at it—the game at the booth was a round ball with coloum on it—I was in ignorance of it—it was a ball put into a sort of box—I pretended to bet—half-crowns were given to me and I was nodded to now and then to put the half-crowns on the colours—I knew that I was not betting in reality—I never had anything to do with thimble-rig tables—I do not consider that I have been a sporting character—I never speculated one penny about anything—I have gone by the name of the Welsh Novice—it was done more to see the country—it was about eight years ago at Wimbledon—I walked against a pedestrian to draw custom to the house—I believe I got some refreshment for it from the landlord—I have also walked in the same way at Woodend near Croydon—it was partly to bring business to the house and partly to amuse some cadets there—bets were not laid—it was to try my capabilities—I have also done so at Hounslow—I have not walked a match since that—I have been to New York because I was ill but there was some difference between my wife s uncle and me—I left her behind me—she had one child—I was to receive something from my father and she was to receive it while I was away—I was absent better than three months and returned—my father never charged me with forgery—I never was guilty of it—I took my own money out of the Bank before I went—to the best of my remembrance it was about 125l —my father presented me with it—he bad heart of a bargain three or four houses in the city and was about to leave that money which he had saved to buy them on my coming out of my apprenticeship—but instead of my having the bargain my brother-in-law purchased the houses and my father put the money he had into the East Anglian Mine and allowed me to have it in my own name—it was not in his name as well—I did not mention to my wife that I was going to America or to my father—I did to one or two private friends—I had a family on my hands and was mentally and bodily ill—it preyed on my spirits—I know Henry Watson—I do not remember meeting him on my return from America—I do not think it likely that I asked him if he knew what bad taken me there it was a private matter—I do not believe he said he heard I had gone in consequence of a forgery on my father—I do not think I said that was the reason and I wished it had been for doable the sum—I should think it a waste of time to enter into conversation with a person of that description—he robbed my brother-in-law of a whitewash brush a little time ago—I was in connection with the police seven years ago—I have come forward as a witness before on public grounds as I have on this occasion—some of the swell mob from Seven-dials picked a gentleman s pocket of a purse in St Paul s-churchyard I watched their movements and had them apprehended and at the same time there were three other parties for stealing an umbrella from a pawnbroker s shop in Coleman-street—I watched them and had them taken—I have never been with the police to watch persons passing bad money—I do not believe I met Watson near Hoxton and told him I wanted him as some one had been passing bad coin nor when he declined say Oh you will get 3s 6d a day for your time if you do —I do not remember what I got for my time as a witness it is so long back—I do not know whether this is my ribbon—I gave mine to a gentleman I was in communication with—I know Alfred Carr he was one of my shop-mates but was discharged by my brother-in-law—I recollect his carrying me to a Chartist meeting at Temple Bar—I never said if I had a chance I would rip the police s b - - y guts out with a chisel—I did not show Carr how I would do it—I had no tool of the kind at all—I was not a Chartist at all—my mind was differently occupied—that was some years back—I did not in Carr s presence have a quarrel with my father because he refused to give me some money—my father struck me I pushed him back to preserve myself and my brother-in-law came and separated us—Carr came here and assailed my character and he is a most infamous character he was discharged by my brother-in-law my sister s life was in danger through him—I did not in Carr s presence exclaim to my father You old b - - r I will murder you and rush at him strike him with my fist and knock him on the bench—Can did not catch hold of me and drag me away—I made some observations to him and he went to bis bench to work—I know Thomas Osborne—I never talked to him or any one about a Chartist rising—I pointed out to him a man who would make him a pike I do not believe I urged him to join the Chartists—there was a meeting at Birdcage-walk on a Sunday morning and a man named Smith who frequented Cartwright s locality was there who made pikes—I told Osborne he did so another man named Hook had paid him 18d for a pike and had not received it and the conversation sprung up so—I know Richard Pennell—I have not said in his presence that I would swear anything if I was paid for it or that when I was a witness here I was afraid they would get hold about the thimble-rigging and I would not go as a witness again for I only got 3s 6d a day from the police and that was not enough for I could get more money from the thieves—I did not show him three or four half-crowns and say This is what I made out of them last night —I never asked him to meet me at Cartwright s or say that delegates would be chosen in about a fortnight to agitate the country and he could propose me as one and I could get 2l or 3l a week which would be better than starving at Smith s—I would not enter into conversation with him or with any of the men in the shop because they are such bad characters I considered they would talk any nonsense by way of wasting time—he did not say the Chartists would never get the Charter by force—I did not reply The Government is a weak and b - - Government and we will send Lord John Russell and Sir George Grey to the devil in about a month —I did not urge him again to join the Chartist movement I did not say Look at the Queen with her hundreds of thousands a year spending in waste and idleness while we are obliged to work from morning to night to get a mouthful of bread —I never swore I would blow the Queen the b—y foreigner and his b—y family to hell such words never were uttered from my lips—I never asked Pennell to call at any house on Sunday morning and I would show him materials sufficient to blow London to hell in halt an hour I never used the words—I did not threaten him if he did not join with us when the Chartists turned out I would point out where lie lived and he should have a ball put through him—he was one of my shopmates about eighteen months ago—I was never called Lying Tom to my face by my shopmates I should have resented it as an insult—I know James Bennett I may have attended a public meeting with him in Holborn and walked home towards Hoxton—I do not recollect asking him whethe he intended to go to Kennington-cornmon on 10th April—I do not think I asked him whether he intended to go armed but my memory is so deficient—I do not think when he said Certainly not that I replied You area b—y fool if you do not as I shall go armed that sort of language is not likely to proceed from me at all—I may have said something about grenades—I do not remember saying I had been making hand-grenades on the Monday previously that would go half through an inch board—I do not remember saying they were easily made a blacking-bottle was as good as anything half filled with powder mixed up with stout nails and a fusee put into it and by lighting it and throwing it among the police it would break the b—rs legs or anything about a blacking-bottle—I would state it at once if I knew it I do not think I used such words—I do not think I had been making grenades if said so it must have been a lie—I do not believe I said to Bennett that I had ten men and with four or five more I could easily take the Artillery-ground as I had prepared a plan and my men knew how to spike the artillery—I cannot swear I did not I should rather think I did not—I know there is such a thing as perjury—I do not recollect Bennett feeling my pockets before I went to Kennington-common to see if I was armed I cannot swear he did not—I know John Westmoreland I do not remember meeting him at Cartwright s between April and Aug and talking to him about a project of organization—I do not think I met him at Cartwright s and said I had a project of organization which I thought would be most desirable for taking London and carrying out my plan—my memory is not sufficient to enable me to swear—I have no recollection of showing him this rough sketch of a plan produced —I swear it is not my drawing—I do not remember meeting George Thurston on the Monday before the 16th Aug —I do not think I said to him I shall want you on Wednesday you must bring something with you or his saying I do not understand you —I swear I did not offer him a pair of pistols for sale I do not recollect a person of the name—I had not a pair of pistols and could not offer them—I did not ask him 6s for them and offer to give him half a pound of powder into the bargain—I had not a single pistol—I do not know Henry Green—I do not know whether 1 attended a meeting at Birdcage-walk about the middle or end of April I was there at one or two meetings—I do not recollect going among the people at the meeting and asking whether they had got arras—I do not think I asked Green whether he had any arms nor did he say he did not know the use of arms nor did I reply You are not worth a d—n as a Chartist if you have not got arms I do not believe such words were uttered by me—I cannot swear they were not—I do not believe that after saying that I went among the crowd and put the same question to several others I will not swear it—I do not remember meeting a man outside Cartwright s on Wednesday evening 16th Aug inquiring what was the matter and my saying Do not take any notice of me I think it a botched job of these milk-and-water b—rs I do not think such words passed my mouth—I do not remember his asking the meaning and my saying We expect to have a turn-out to-night —I remember walking with a man that night who I spoke to on the subject of firing—I had a pistol with me and a sword in my side pocket—I was not in the habit of carrying a sword—I did occasionally—I could not tell what parties I might meet with in the public streets of an evening—I carried it to protect myself—I was not in the habit of carrying a pistol—I do not believe I had a pistol or sword as early as 10th April—I cannot swear I had not—I had sixty-eight ball cartridges on me which I made up for Gurney—I cast the balls and he made the cartridge-papers—I cannot say how many I made—it may have been ten or twelve dozen—I received 3s in the presence of Mr Fowler one of the council for getting powder—I had a tin box of percussion caps which I pulled out and showed to the man I was with—I never said I had 200 fire balls to throw into people s houses—when I showed him the pistol I may have opened my coat shown him a sword and said You see I am well prepared are you —I do not think I asked him for his address—I did not know it—I remember making a spike—I believe this is it— produced —Brewster produced two of them at one of our meetings—I asked what they were for—he said to cripple infantry and cavalry—he threw it down and showed me the action of it—when it is thrown this point sticks upwards—I made one like it showed it to Mr Mayne and showed him the action of it—I cannot say whether I said This is the thing to spike the horses with —I made it to ascertain who the parties were that made such things as a sort of trap—I did not ascertain that any parties were making such things at Cartwright s—I went to Gurney in his cell at the Police-station and asked him to come and give evidence for the Police and if he did he would have one guinea a week for life or words to that effect—I had no authority to say so—I did it to get him to come forward on my own account—he was taken out of one cell and put into another that I might communicate with him—I have received 1l a week—I did not enter into any arrangement as to what remuneration I was to get—I come forward on my own responsibility—I do not expect to get anything—that is as true as everything else I have said—I have a little property to live on THOMAS WILSON I am landlord of the Black Jack Portugal-street Lin-coln s-inn-fields I know a person named John Rose a currier—the Curriers Society of which he was a member was held at my bouse every Monday—Rose lived at 9 Clare-court—on Monday 17th July Rose came to my house and asked for a room for the Thursday evening following 20th July—I asked him for what purpose and he said for a meeting of a Trades Committee—I let him have the room—he came on the Thursday about eight o clock—he did not bring anybody with him—two other persons came a short time afterwards—in all I think there might have been a dozen came—he said he expected upwards of seventy—I asked why the meeting was to be held so late and he told me some of the members had a long way to come some is far from Greenwich—I saw the persons who came—I knew the members of the Trades Committee that Hose spoke of—not one of them came—Rose said it was for either a meeting of a Trades Committee or of the Trades Committee but I understood him to mean of the curriers trade the members of which I knew—they went up stairs about half-past nine and they stopped till about eleven JAMAM HEATH My husband keeps the Temperance coffee-shop Great Suffolk-street Borough The Lord Denman is in the same street—I have known Lacey three or four years—I recollect the day my house was searched—I cannot say whether Lacey was there the night before—he was there about that time either the night before or the night but one before—four cups of coffee I think it was were ordered by him on that occasion—I do not know how many persons came in with him—I do not think that they all Went out together—Lacey remained behind down stairs—I cannot say how long—I saw him sitting in the front room after the others came down SAMUEL EVANS police-inspector I searched Mrs Heath s Temperance coffee-house Great Suffolk-street on Wednesday evening Aug 16th about half-past nine o clock THOMAS PRONGAR policeman A 237 I was appointed with another policeman to watch Lacey the day before he was taken—he came out of a house in Stratton-ground and went to the house of a neighbour named Constable—he left there and went home again—he came out again shortly after went down Stratton-ground towards Orchard-street and when hewas about half way between his house and Orchard-street Constable s boy ran to him and spoke to him—Constable s boy knew that I was a policeman—I was in plain clothes—when the boy spoke to Lacey he turned round and looked towards me and went down Orchard-street into Cooper-street and New Tothill-street and I then left the other constable to watch him—that might be a direct way to the Lord Denman GEORGE DAVIS I am a boot-maker at Straits Mouth Greenwich I joined a Chartist Association called the Wat Tyler Brigade there on—24th May I think it was—it was held at the Druid s Arms in Straits Month—I attended a meeting at the George in the Old Bailey on 10th July—I did net attend as a delegate I was merely up in the Old Bailey to hear the trials—it was the day when Ernest Jones was tried—there were about twenty persons in the room—thirteen of them were delegates of a former conspiracy that had been formed on Whit-Monday—Mullins was there and rose Payne Lacey Brevvster and a person of the name of Smith of Shouldham-street—Mullins asked if there were any delegates belonging to the Old Committee present and I being one answered Yes —he said the delegates were to go on one side of the room and those that were not members of the Delegate Committee were to go on the other which we did and sat there and he and Pavne addressed us and said it was a shame the prisoner should go to prison without a struggle to rescue him—he said the van would go through Cow Cross-street on its way to Coldbath-flelds and that would be the best place to attack it and a friend who I understood from a person in the room to be Daley would lead the Irish to assist them—Mullins wrote credentials out for each of the delegates present to take to his locality to be filled up by the Scretary of the locality and to be returned at a meeting on the following Thursday night the 13th—I was not present at that meeting—I had two credentials to take one to Deptford and one to Greenwich I delivered them—a person named Morgan was elected for Deptford Bremerton for Greenwich—they went and attended a meeting at the Lord Denman—I attended the meeting at the Black Jack on 20th as a delegate from Greenwich—the prisoner was there and Payne Rose Brewster Dowling Powell and others whose names I forget—I then knew Powell by the name of Johnson—I believe Dowling was a Confederate belonging to the Davis Club—he said he came at the invitation of Mullins—at that meeting a Sub-Committee was formed to draw up a plan of attack on the police and troops—that was said at the time—it consisted of five Payne Mullins Brewster Rose and Dowling—I subsequently attended meetings of Chartists in different parts of London—I did not take notes of what took place at them—I made communications to inspector Marks of what had taken place within two hours at the furthest after every meeting and he wrote down from my dictation what I stated to him—some he read over to me and some not—I signed them all—this is my signature to this paper— looking at one —Marks read that over to me before I signed it KINGSTON MARKS police-inspector R I was from time to time in communication with the witness Davis at Greenwich—I did not then know anything of Powell—Davis made reports to me of all that occurred at the different Chartist meetings he attended both at London and Greenwich—he gave me the reports on the evening of the meeting—I took down the purport of what he stated and framed it as a report—I did not take the very words—I read them over to him and he signed them—these are the reports produced —this is Davis s signature Cross-examined by MR PARRT Q You did not take down Davis s words A Not exactly the words that fell from his lips but the purport of what he said—these are a sort of reports which I send to the authorities—I signed my reports so-and-so took place but I took from him what took place—I made a report to the authorities on what he said—it is in the nature of an ordinary Police report which I as an inspector make—I did not condense it—I gave the exact purport of what he stated—I gave the words as never as possible with the exception that I began I beg to report —to the best of my knowledge I read the whole of them to him but he sat close by me while I was taking it—he bad an opportunity of seeing what I wrote—I think he read them over as well because he sat by my side and could see what I wrote—he read many of them—I do not know which MR ATTORNEY-GENERAL Q Did you read to him correctly what you bad written A I did GEORGE DAVIS re-examined Mr Marks read some to me and I read some myself—I cannot tell what I read myself—I read some myself because Mr Marks was busy very often and he put them into my hand and at other times he would read them—when he read them over to me I sat by him—I very often saw what he wrote—I did not see all because I did not look over—I sometimes looked over his writing—I signed them all MR PARRY objected to the witness being allowed to refresh his memory from these papers as they were not written by the witness himself The COURT was of opinion that the accuracy of the papers being ascertained and being adopted by the witness at the time they were made he might as properly refresh his memory by them as if he had written then himself —I was at a meeting held at Denny s coffee-house Great St Andrew-street Seven Dials on Sunday 23rd July—this looking at one is the report I made to Mr Marks of that meeting—by it I see that Mullins Brewster Allnut Rose Dowling two from Cartwright s whose names I do not know Johnson Gurncy and others were there—it was proposed by Rose and seconded by Brewster that each delegate should return to his locality and ask the members for 10s by the next meting night to provide ammunition with—Dowling the secretary of The Davis club stated that all the funds in hand had been expended in the purchase of powder which had been distributed to the class-leaders and by them distributed to all those that could not afford to pay for it—the meeting was then adjourned to the following Wednesday the 26th at Hopkinson s coffee-house Saffron-hill—this is the report I gave of the meeting—Mullins Rose Payne Dowling Stephens Smith Pedley Ferdinando Allnut Johnson and others Were there—it was resolved at that meeting that they were to form themselves into a delegate committee and hold a delegate meeting at cartwright s coffee-house—16s 8d was handed by the delegates present a map of London and a plan merely scribbled out in the form of a map but I do not know of what place were produced-Mullins stated that he proposed barricades should be erected from the end of Tottenham-court-road to Seven Dials to barricade the whole of the Seven Dials along Holborn to Gray s-inn-lane to a brewhouse at the corner of Liquorpond-street which they were to make themselves masters of from thence to Clerkenwell-green and the Sessions-house from there to Aldersgate-street and St Martin s-le-grand to St Paul s and take Possession of it if possible and if not to burn it from there to Doctors Commons along the back streets to the Temple pulling down Temple-bar and erecting a barricade thereon from there to Somerset house and Charmg-cross across Covent-garden to Seven Dials again—Ferdinando opposed the motion saying that it was not sanctioned by the executive—Mullins stated that the executive were makin—a good thing by the agitation they were receiving 2l a weekend were sure to disagree with all those that wished to bring it to a termination and he proposed that the mob should divide into four parts one for the firing of public buildings and warehouses to cause confusion one to erect barricades and to place the stones diamond fashion one to attack gunsmiths shops and Police-stations and to assassinate the police and it was decided that a private meeting should be held at the same house on Friday mornin the 28th—I was present at Carttiright s on the meeting of the 30th—Payne was chairman—Mullins Rose Brewster a special constable in the Ea st India Dock Company s employ Dow ling Lindsay Nowlan Bassett Nash Kirby Donovan and dayman were there—each delegate was called on to describe the fleelings of his locality—Bassett stated that the men of the Wallace brigade of Chartists at Westminster were impatient for the fray and he wished to tell the committee they need be at no trouble in making any plans for attacking the prison where their friends Ernest Jones and others were confined in Tothill-fields for the respectable inhabitants of Duck-lane and Pye-street-had friends of their own in the prison and they were as ready to get them out as the Chartists were to get Ernest Jones and their colleagues the confederate delegates—a meeting was appointed to be held at the Dispatch coffee-house but I cannot recollect on what day— looking at the paper I see it was on Tuesday night MR PARRY Q Do you remember that because you see it written there A I remember the meeting taking place but I do not remember the date—I remember that on account of its being written here—this paper refreshes my memory MR WELSBY Q Were you at the meeting at the Dispatch coffee-house A Yes I made a report of the meeting this is it—it is what was either read over to me by the Inspector as what I stated had passed or what I read myself I cannot tell which—Payne Rose Mullins Brewster Fay Lynch Hayrnan Bezer and Johnson were there and I think Allnut Dowling and Fuzzon—an account was given in of the number of men of the different localities and a calculation was made of the number of fighting men—I think they amounted to somewhere about 200—they asked for more funds if any one had brought any funds from their locality and some of them said they wanted to know the use they were to be put to—on that one or two made a remark and said they were to go back and tell them that they were to be expended in providing ammunition and carrying on the outbreak—I do not recollect who it was that said it—Mullins was vice-chairman Payne chairman and Rose secretary—a proposition was made by Dowling or Fay about sending a person to Ireland to get correct information how affairs stood in that country with regard to the intended outbreak —it was not carried—at that meeting two or four additional persons were elected on the committee but I rather think it was two—Fay and Lynch were elected—Donovan was there he was one of the sub-committee but I cannot be certain whether he was added that night or not—by looking at this paper I recollect that it was four and not two that were added—they were Thompson Fay Lynch and Donovan—a motion was made by Dowling that all the localities should meet on Primrose-hill on the next Sunday morning—it was not carried—I do not recollect the majority by which it was lost but it was very trifling—I recollect Mullins saying that he had attended on Mr Kydd at Chartist-hall Black-friars-road for an explanation he had made at the Milton-street Theatre but I will not be certain whether it was at that meeting to know whether he would join them or not and that Kydd said it was no use anything of the sort and they would get themselves into trouble but in case they were successful Samuel Kydd would not be wanting—I do not recollect Mullins stating anything as to what Kydd had stated as to the capacity in which he had joined the executive—I attended a meeting at Cartwright s on Friday 4th—I recollect the date by seeing the paper—I have no independent recollection but I have a note here that I received from Rose of the Wat Tyler brigade No 1 at that meeting—I carried 2s 6d from my locality to that meeting and I saw Rose write this—I never saw him write before—Mullins and the other members of the sub-committee advised all the Chartists to keep away from the meeting that was announced for Kennington-common—they said there was no authority for calling it—it was called by two men at Cart-wright s who it was thought were in the pay of Government—Dwaine was one I do not know the other s name—a resolution was passed to meet on the next Sunday at the Dispatch coffee-house Bride-lane Fleet-street and to receive messages from Kennington-common—I do not recollect anything being said at that meeting about stationing people to transmit those messages—Cuffey was present at that meeting—a meeting was held at the Dispatch on the Cth Sunday—I was there—there were about thirty present—Payne Mullins Rose Brewster Cuffey Allnut the two Grands haws Hayman Fay Johnson and others—Johnson was sent out as a scout to receive messages from Kennington-common to see whether any attack was being made there—at a previous meeting at which I was not present so many men from each locality had been appointed to meet at the Dispatch coffee-house and were to be stationed so many yards apart or at a convenient distance to receive the messages and communicate what might be sent from the Common—they said it was after the manner of the police—information was brought from time to time and notes passed along—we adjourned to Denny s coffee-house on Monday 7th I went—Payne was in the chair—Mullins was present and acted as vice-chairman—Rose Brewster Dowling Thompson Donovan Ritchie Fay and Powell or Johnson were threre—Dowling and Thompson stated that on account of the defeat of Smith O Brien at the widow M Cormack s in Ireland they thought it was no use thinking of having any further outbreak in England and they wished to retire from the committee in consequence of which all the committee resigned—a resolution—was passed to elect a new committee and Mullins Payne Rose Brewster and a person of the name of Warry I think were elected—they said they should leave a vacancy for a person that should take the presidency of the sub-committee—nothing was said publicly as to who it was to be—it was understood to be Churchill who I was informed was then in France—I think a letter was then read from Manchester but I will not be certain—letters were red twice—one was read at that meeting—it purported to be from Lacey—it was read by Mullins—he said that trade was very good in Manchester and he expected soon to have a large order for them there to get on with their work as last as they could—the meeting was adjourned to the Lord Denman beer-shop Suffolk-street on the 9th—I went there—Payne the chairman Mullins vice-chairman Rose Brewster Dowling Fay Donovan Lynch the two Grandshaws Johnson differ Pedley and others in all about twenty-five or thirty were present—returns were made from the localities—I cannot recollect anything else that occurred at that meeting—a meeting was to have taken place on the Friday at Perry s coffee-house—it did not take place in consequence of Rose s house having been searched and his papers taken away—I went to Perry s—I saw Donovan and Pedley the delegates there—I was told by some persons there whose names I do not know that Rose s papers had been seized and his house searched and he himself had run away—I came down with Pedley to Rose s house and from there to the house Mullins occupied—I attended a meeting on Sunday morning 13th at Hopkinson s—I had received a letter from Mullins on the Saturday evening previous at eight o clock—a person named Bligh went with me from Greenwich—when I went in Mullins Brewster and Payne were in the lower room—a locality meeting was going on in the upper room at the time we went up to that meeting——Mullins Brewster and Payne went up before me—a person of the name of Fuzzon and I think Ritchie and Allnut were up-stairs—Mullins made a motion that the Clerkenwell district should turn out for an outbreak—there was a discussion upon that and it was carried that they should—a charge was made by a man named Merriman one of the lecturers that two person at the head of the Chartist movement were in constant communication with the police—a deputation of three was appointed to wait on Merriman to ascertain how that was the meeting was adjourned to three in the afternoon at Breadon s beer-shop bhouldham-street Edgeware-road—I went there were about thirty delegates present—the prisoner went with me—Ritchie Cuffey the two Grandshaws Hayman and Warry were there Johnson was not—at that meeting Cuffey was appointed secretary to the sub-committee and Mullins was appointed treasurer—a person named Nash brought a letter from Bassett at Westminster purporting to come from Lacey at Manchester—one statement—in it was that he had—ent word about the order he had given them before and he wanted it sent down by the last train on the Monday night—it stated that trade was very good at Manchester and the parts adjacent—I do not recollect that anything was said in the letter about Dr M Douall—an account of the general feeling of the localities and the number of men was given in—some person stated I do not recollect whether it was Ritchie or whether it was the delegate that represented the Irish brigade at St Giles that the Irish brigade was well armed with muskets and cartridges and ready to turn out at a moment s notice—the meeting adjourned to the 14th at seven o clock in the evening to the Orange Tree near Red Lion-square—I went there—there were about twenty-five or thirty delegates present—Payne was in the chair—the prisoner Cuffey Fay Brewstcr Ritchie Hayman the two Grandshaw s and Johnson and a person named Cruikshank were there—Mullins made a motion that each of the delegates should return to their locality and provide four men that were willing to do anything—I recollect some person asking what was required of them and Mullins said he would not speak plain but he would point to the gas they might tell what he meant by that—he pointed with his hand to the gas and said You well know what I mean by that —the gas was burning in the room—that motion was carried—I recollect a motion that a deputation of two should wait on the North Western Railway engine-drivers not to commit themselves by stating where they came from but to sound them and see if they were inclined to join the Chartist body—Ritchie and Cruikshank were selected—the meeting continued till about nine o clock—they were waiting to receive a message from Lacey when the reporter of the Northern Star came in and they dispersed the meeting sooner in consequence of some information that he brought—the meeting adjourned till seven Tuesday evening at the Lord Denman beer-shop Suffolk-street Blackfriars—I went—there were nearly thirty there or there might be more—Mullins was in the chair—the sub-committee Cuffey Payne Mullins Brewster and Lacey retired as I understood to a coffee-shop a few doors higher up in Great Suffolk-street—they were absent very near an hour—they all came back except Lacey—there were then present at the meeting Mullins Brewster Cuffey Payne Fay Dowling Ritchie Gurney Johnson Allnut Ferdinando Pedley and Grandshaw—Mullins addressed the meeting and stated that the sub-committee had come to the determination that the out- break should take place on the ensuing evening that he himself should take the Seven-dials district Brewster would take Clerkenwell Payne the Tower Hamlets and Basset or Cuffey I will not be certain which Westminster—Brewster distributed the tri-coloured bands to be worn by the delegates on the left arm during the attack—he gave me two one I was to take to Bligh a delegate for Greenwich who could not attend and one for myself—the parties were to meet at the different localities next day one at the Peacock Westminster-road another at the Crispin in Milton-street Cripplegate one at the Buck s Head Bethnal-green-road or Hackney-road I will not be certain which the fourth was to meet at Breadon s in Shouldham-street—they were to meet at Shouldham-street at twelve at the Crispin at twelve at the Buck s—head at eight or nine and those at the Peacock I think at three in the afternoon—the outbreak was to take place at twenty minutes past nine at night—a question was asked Mullins how they were to get to the different places of meeting with their arms—he told them to bring them down the best way they could to fight their way down with them—two or three motions were made as to where the four men selected by each delegate were to meet on the evening of the 15th and it-was resolved that they should meet at the Orange Tree Red Lion-square from five to seven in the evening—Ritchie was to meet and head them—Mullins called them luminaries—there was a discussion as to whether the pass-word by which Ritchie was to know them should be Frost or Jones and he decided that it should be Justice —when they came into the room he was to ask them Do you want me and if they answered Justice he knew it was correct—they were to come with what arms they could get—Ritchie produced some knives about twelve or fourteen inches long with a spring at the back—he said Mullins had bought them a job lot—I do not remember that he said what was to be done with them—I only saw three—Dowling purchased one for 1s —this produced is such a knife as those Ritchie had—Brewster stated at Shouldham-street on the Sunday that he bad got a knife fixed at the end of a stick that would cut the hose of the fire-engines in two so as to render them useless—I did not see any of these papers from the time I delivered them to Mr Marks till I saw them in Court now Cross-examined by MR PARRY Q I believe you were not originally examined before the magistrate A No I came forward suddenly on the last trial owing to the bad character of Powell—I was described by the Attorney-General as a shop-keeper at Greenwich—I am thirty-four years old—I know nothing of Powell only since he has been in Court here— The witness at Mr Parry s request read the following passage from the paper containing his account of the meeting of 30th July — Each delegate was called on to describe the feeling in the locality Bassett stated the men of the Wallace brigade of Chartists at Westminster were impatient for the fray and he wished to tell the Committee they need be under no trouble in making any plan of attacking the prison where their friend Ernest Jones was confined Tothill-fields for the men of Westminster would undertake that business themselves they had good auxiliaries in the men of Duck-lane and the parts adjacent for they had forty or fifty of their comrades in that prison and they would be as equally glad to release them as the Chartists would Ernest Jones —the expression auxiliaries is my own language—I cannot remember whether the parts adjacent was the term used by Bassett but auxiliaries was—I swear that the sentence I have read is the language word for word for I delivered it to Marks—I was not a Chartist—I did pretend to be one to defeat their plans—I did not enter with the intention of serving myself—I had not the slightest idea of doing myself a service—I went there entirely from motives of public good—I thought the Government did not know what was going on and there would be an outbreak and destruction of life and property and if I could save it I was entitled to do so—that was my motive—I have asked people to come up to the meetings but not to join the Chartists—I have sold arms in the way of my trade—I am a broker and dealer in old boots and what arms I have sold I have sold in the way of trade as a broker—I am not a marine store-dealer—I make new boots and am a translater as well—I have sold two guns and one sword within the list six months—I have tried to sell a pair of pistols but I did not—here they are producing them —I tried to sell them for 16s and I brought them to prove that I did not sell them—I never offered to sell any more arms than these pistols—I never unged men in the neighbourhood of Greenwich to buy arms of me to join the Chartist movement and to break out in insurrection against the Government—the Druids Arms at Greenwich is where the meetings were held—I first began to be a Chartist about 24th May—I was the cause of removing the meeting from Deptford to the Druids Arms—the landlord of the Druids Arms paid me for it—he left me out money when I wanted it—I had half-a-crown sometimes five shillings and sometimes half-a-sovereign of him—I believe that was because I lost my time and he made me a remuneration for it—I only once got half-a-soverein generally speaking it was rather less—I do not believe I had altogether more than 30s — during the time I was employed by Inspector Marks I was not paid by him—I was paid my expenses for going up to London but nothing else—sometimes I had half a sovereign to pay me from Greenwich to London and back and expenses incurred—the fare was 4d —that half-sovereign lasted me a week very often until I wanted more—when I asked I got it—I have had money from the Chartists but I returned their money back to the Victim Fund which is a fund for the relief of the wives of prisoners—I once got 2s and once 1s that was all—I never attempted to make victims—that is all the money I got from the Chartists to my recollection except 5s 4d which I had in hand as treasurer—I was treasurer of the locality—I have not been in the habit of playing cards at the Druid s Arms for the last three years I have played a game of cards there and bagatelle frequently that was to bring custom to the house—I employed men to work for me—I did not play to draw custom I played to amuse myself—I did not get up the Chartist Association at Greenwich—I knew a man named Paris a blacksmith at Greenwich—I did not tell him two or three months before Aug that I had bought a lot of guns at a sale cheap I told him I had bought two which I had with a sword for 4s 6d —I do not remember saying 1 had got them cheap and would sell them cheap as I thought guns were wanting—I told him I had got them cheap and would sell them cheap—I might have added that I thought guns were wanting but I do not remember—I will not swear I did not I might—I met Paris on 16th Aug about one in the day—I think I said to him You are the very man I want to see I wanted to see him to tell him to stop at the Druid s Arms—I had sold him a gun—he said to me What s up and I said This is the night the blow is to be struck —I did not ask him to go up to London with me that I swear—I told him to stop at the Druid s Arms till I came back* from London—I told him that London was to be set on fire—I did not put my hand to my breast and say I am ready I am armed —I was armed with these pistols but they were not in my breast-pocket—I was in the habit of carrying them about with me loaded and capped that was for the protection of my own life—I offered to sell them to get a profit on them—I might have offered them for sale fifty times I might have bought another pair if I had sold them the party I bought these of had a dozen pairs—these were in my window—I never offered them for sale at a meeting—I know Robinson he was the first man that got me to join the Chartists Q I thought you said you joined them yourself for the purpose of protecting life and property A So I did but he was the first man that urged me on to join them—I was protecting life and property before I joined the Chartists and giving information to Government from the month of March—I wanted a great deal of urging to join them I did not want to join them—I did it to protect life and property and inform against the parties—I am what is called a spy I am not in the least ashamed of it—I remember meeting Robinson early in Aug —I did not offer him a pair of pistols if he would go up and attend a Chartist meeting to be held on Whit-Monday—I had not a pair in my possession then—I never offered him a pair I swear that—I never in his presence urged people at Greenwich to arm—he has—I did not tell him that I was a witness in a suit at the County-court at Greenwich he knew it—I was a witness there in an assault case—I never said to him that if I had known there had been such hard swearing I would have sworn any mortal thing to have got the better of those by wretches meaning the plaintiffs in the suit—I offered to raffle these pistols nothing else—I know John Ward a furrier—I asked him on Whit-Monday whether he was going to a Chartist meeting at Bonner s fields—I did not tell him I should go there armed nor ask him to go armed—I said I should go and asked if he was going not if he would go—I attended that meeting and advised Ward to stop at home for the sake of his wife—I was armed with these pistols—I never offered to Ward to get up a ratile for arms nor ever told him I could supply him and others with plenty of arms—I did not say if a club were formed and each party paid a sum per week I could supply them with plenty of arms through a Mr Dowson I never said anything of the sort—I did not ask Ward on 16th Aug to go up to London I did not see him on the 16th—I have often told him that I was going up to London—I have often seen him—I did not tell him I was armed he knew it—I do not tell him I was going up to London to reconnoitre the town and ascertain the points of attack—I never told him that before the 16th Aug —f was never in the habit of making cartridges except for my own pistols—Ward once saw me at my shop tearing up some old books or book covers—I told him I was going to make them a present to the landlord of the Druid s Arms for his fowling-piece—I did not tell him I was going to make gunwadding—he went out with me with them in my hand and saw me go into the Druid s Arms with them Q Did you not on one occasion oppose the association being dissolved A There was no regularly organized association of Confederates they merely met to make speeches and read the papers—I told Ward and Robleson that to dissolve the meeting for the small matter they were going to do it for looked very cowardly on their part after they had been the violented men in the meeting—I called them cowards for it—that was the meeting of the Brian Boru-club a Confederate club—I did not tell the police I had prevented that—the police were in the room at the time—every one in the room knew they were policemen—I never told Robinson that I had been into a room in London that was nearly filled with ball-cartridges and that parties coming up to London could be supplied with any quantity they wanted—I know Joseph Monday—I do not know an Irishman named Fadey—I know one named Sheedy—I think I tried to sell him a musket—I tried to sell it to anybody—it was at the door—Sheedy works at the gas-house—it was not my business to inquire what he wanted it for—he might want it for any purpose—I tried to sell it for the purpose of getting a profit to keep myself—Monday did not persuade Sheedy not to buy it—I swear that—I did not urge him to buy it he was standing at the door asked me the price of it and I told him 8s —I did not tell Monday he ought to be ashamed of himself for preventing Sheedy from buying it as he knew that the Chartists were arming in London—I swear nothing of the sort took place—I often met Monday at the Druids Arms sometimes at the meetings and sometimes in the parlour—sometimes I had the pistols with me and sometimes not probably—Monday is a Chartist—I did not offer to sell him these pistols at the Chartist meetings at the Druids Arms—I offered to sell them at my own shop but never exposed them at a Chartist meeting—I never to my knowledge offered to sell him a brace of pistols at a Chartist meeting there about June—I have several times said that I had a pair to sell—I was not constantly in the habit of offering them there nor guns or swords or other arms—Monday did not ask me whether they were good ones to fire nor did I say I should like to have the b - - old Duke of Welington before me to try them I swear that—he did not buy them they were too much money for him or else he would—I know John Norman he lived at Greenwich he volunteered to come up to the Orange-Tree —I never asked him to do a little secret service work and join the Chartists—I do not know a baker s apprentice named Collett at Lewisham—I know a young man that used to work for a baker but not his name he lived opposite me—I asked him to be one in a raffle for a brace of pistols—he promised to become a member but did not—he did not give me 1s —there were to be sixteen members—I know Martin a carpenter s apprentice—I never told Collett that the pistols were not raffled for because there were so many detective police present—I swear that—that was not the cause—there were only one or two members willing to subscribe to the raffle and I would not wait—I never asked Collett to join the Chartists—I never told him or Martin that I was a Chartist—I never spoke sis words to young Martin—I never told them that I v as a Chartist and would wallow knee-deep in blood for my fellow-creatures—I swear that—I did not recommend Martin to read a tale called The Croppy or a Tale of the Irish Rebellion but he came and bid for it three or four times when I had it—I did not tell him that a Chartist Society was forming and endeavour to persuade him to enroll himself as a member—I swear that—I never kept company with Boys and did not enter into conversation with him sufficient to ask anything of the sort—he did not decline and say he would have nothing to do with me or the Chartists for he believed they were a set of

with them to do so—I was bound to tell the council what transpired—I did not say if I could get the consent of the Chartist body I did not care about the funds—they wanted to send 5s up to the secret meeting and I opposed it and they only sent half-a-crown—I know John Stanton he was formerly a policeman—I never asked him to join the Wat Tyler Brigade—I did not offer to sell him a pike—head for 2s 6d neither did I have one nor a handle nor did 1 say if they would suit him I had a brace of pistols and plenty of powder and ball —I did not offer to go to London to fetch him a pike nor tell him that the police were going to arrest all the Chartists and he had better have a pike—I did not say to him that I had a place to Practice firing in and I would serve out those b - - blue devils—I know Henry John Heath I lodged wiih him some time ago—I owed him 4s when I left but he knew where I went to and I left a dressing-case and work-box behind worth 12s which he wished to keep and I let him do

meetings—Robinson is a shoemaker—he is a Chartist and a very violent physical-force man—Bligh was chairman one Sunday evening and made a very violent speech in allusion to Ireland and wished they would burn the police-stations and at the conclusion of his speech he called upon the persons present to subscribe towards the benefit of Looney s family and stated that the officer of the club Mr Ward would receive the subscriptions—at the same time there had been some arrests at Manchester of the officers of a club and Ward said Why do you call me an officer they will arrest me and Robinson

him write once and have had letters from him on which I have acted—I believe this plan to be his—this letter is a copy of one of his letters I mean in the same writing as those letters—I have corresponded with him and have seen him write his signature—I consider this is his writing Cross-examined Q You have only seen him write once A No that was three or four months since—I have not compared this paper with any others—I never saw it till five minutes ago—I have received four or five letters from him in different writing—one that I have appears to have been written with a steel-pen and the other with a quill—I have kept but two of them—there is a slight difference in the two—this is more like one than the other—I have not sufficient knowledge to swear positively—I believe all this dark writing these corner pieces are his and this first line and the bottom one—here seems to be a small writing here but still it seems to be his—the corners are the same writing as the letters—I believe it all to be his but the words New Oxford-street —there seems a difference there and different ink—I should doubt very much the word Seven Dials being his writing—I believe the numbers of the streets to be his EDWARD HENRY EAGLE I am son of the last witness I know Mullins—I have not seen him write—I have seen letters from him acted on them and seen him on the contents—I believe this plan to be his writing Cross-examined Q Are the letters you have seen what your father has been speaking of A Yes I have been in the habit of opening them—he has never addressed a letter

you search the room again A No I brought away all I saw— paper read— This is to certify that Joseph Ritchie and John Manley have been duly elected as delegates for this locality Seven Dials and Drury-lane JOSEPH THOMPSON re-examined I accompanied Dowsett to Ritchie s and found some tow some ladles for melting lead and on the nest morning this tri-coloured band amongst some rags in a corner which Ritchie termed his bed—he was in a very destitute state Cross-examined Q How came you not to look into the corner where the rags were the first time A Because I found a flannel shirt all over vermin and I was rather particular then—I considered they were all dirty rags—I turned them over and seeing the band by daylight next morning it struck me he had been to France as I had heard him say so—I went again to be more particular—I think no one was with me the second time except the landlord s daughter—the landlord was with us the first time—one time was bout nine at night and the other between ten and twelve next morning ANTHONY RUTT police-superintendant L On Wednesday 16th Aug I went with a party of constables to the Angel Webber-street Blackfriars-road and found fourteen persons

produced in the cock-loft THOMAS BARRETT I am a shoemaker and live at 17 Charles-street Lisson-grove I was a member of the Chartist association last summer—I joined it on Whitsunday last—I belonged to the Robert Emmett brigade—they held their meetings at Morgan s beer-shop Praed-street Edgware-road and at Breedon s beer-shop in Shouldham-street—I know Mullins—I have seen him on two or three occasions at the meetings at Breedon s—there was a Chartist meeting there on Sunday 13th Aug —I saw Mullins there during the day—there were two meetings one was a private meeting—Mullins was at the latter meeting in the evening—I was not at the earlier meeting—he addressed the meeting in the evening— he had addressed meetings once or twice before that —he said it was necessary for every one to prepare for the crisis that was coming and that it was necessary for each one to make a small sacrifice to aid the committee of progress in their undertakings—I was at a meeting at Breedon s on Wednesday evening the 16th about eight o clock—Mullins arrived about half-past eight—there were about thirty persons in the room—they were members of the locality chiefly Chartists and Irish confederates—when Mullins came into the room a man named Smith clapped him on the shoulder and said I was afraid you were taken —Mullins replied No they will only take me with my life —I know a person named Cruikshank I saw him there that night he followed Mullins into the room he placed a musket on the table—I had only seen him once before that was at a meeting—I saw two or three pikes and two pistols in the hands of the men in the room just after Mullins came in—Mullins Smith and some others went out of the room—Smith came back again—Mullins came and looked into the room and Smith said they were to prepare to go to the Seven Dials and Crown-street Soho—they were to be there by ten and their leader would meet them there—a question was asked in what way they were to take their arms and the reply was in the best way they can—their arms were called toothpicks—a question was asked if they had got their toothpicks ready—after that the people left the beer-shop by twos and threes—I afterwards went to Crown-street Soho—I got there about ten—I saw twenty of thirty persons about Crown-street Soho whom I recognized—about half of them had been at the meeting at Breedon s that night Cross-examined by MR PARRY Q You are not working at your trade now are you A I have not lately not for this last month I may say except a few little jobs—when I go out a policeman goes to protect me—I might walk with two policemen occasionally but there is no necessity for two—I first communicated with the police on 16th Aug —up to that time I held with the principles of the Chartists—I will not say I was downright sicere with them—up to 16th Aug I had no thoughts of coming as a witness—I did not join them for the purpose of betraying them—I went to the police to tell what I knew—I went to offer myself to the police—I did not ask anything for my evidence and did not receive anything—I did it entirely for the good of my country—I have bad 1l a week since I have not been able to work at my trade—about six weeks or two months before I joined the Emmett Brigade I had been in Cold Bath-fields prison for the unlawful possession of a pint pot—I had not stolen it—the publican did not charge me with stealing it—he did not charge me at all—it was the policeman that charged me—he was fetched to the police-office and his wife Mrs Thorn also—I had a month—I was also in prison about four years ago for taking some bread out of a baker s cart with three more in a drunken spree—they ran away I did not and I had to suffer—I cannot remember how much bread I took because I was intoxicated at the time but I think it was three half-quarterns—it was taken from a baker s cart standing in the high road and the loaves were stuck together in one lot—I had four months—I was tried at Clerkenwell Sessions—I had no friends or any means of getting a defence up or otherwise there is not a doubt I should have got off—I knew the men that I was with very well—I was living at Wilsden at that time—I was never found in a wine-cellar at Wilsden—I was in gaol when I was an apprentice—I might have been nineteen or twenty years of age at that time—I am now twenty-eight—I was fined 23s or a month s imprisonment and I had no means of paying that money—it was for trespass in search of game—it was not called poaching—my master would have paid the money but I wished him not to do it to distress himself—I was never in prison at any other time—I know Robert Russell—he never charged me with stealing the cape of a dress nor anything of the kind—I never stele one—I sole a cape for 6d which I picked up in a crowd going up the stairs of the Princess s Theatre—I made no inquiry about it—I sold it to a parly I was intimately acquainted with—Russell did not charge me with stealing it nor with stealing a coat—I know Charles Jones—he never took from my neck a handkerchief which belonged to him—I never had anything belonging to him—I never had any arms and never attempted to instigate any one to arm—I never asked any one to arm—I never made any cartridges—I know William John Garrett—I saw him on the evening of 15th Aug —I showed him a pistol and a lot of ball cartridges—I did not tell him I had made them—I do not believe I did—I will not swear it because I might and have forgotten it but I believe I did not—if I had told him so it would have been a lie—I might have told that lie—I did not tell Garrett that I expected a turn up with the police that evening—I never said anything to him concerning the police—he well knew what was going on—I did not tell him to my knowledge that I had been engaged all day making ball cartridges—I could not have stated it because I never remember telling him any such thing—I swear I did not tell him so—I had not been making ball cartridges—I have been where I saw them made but I had nothing to do with the making of them—I was not at this time in communication with the police—I did not wish Garrett to go to the meeting at Seven Dials—I did not know there was to be a meeting there—I know William New—I recollect seeing him about the middle of Sept —I saw him on the day Mullins was apprehended—I went to his lodging—I had about me 12s at that time for which I had sold some shoes that I had made on my own account—I did not get that 12s from the police or the Government—I did not tell New that I was not going to work again—he is in the same trade as myself—I gave him some leather to make up for me to have the proceeds of it when it was done because 1 could not make up the work myself as I had to leave home—I did not tell him I was not going to work again that I had got 1l a week and was to have it as long as I lived—no such promise has been made to me—I told New I should go down to Southampton where I should get work and be able to earn 1l a week at my work as wages—I do not know that I know a lad named Gustavus Thomas the son of a carpenter—I never employed him or any boy to make cartridges for me and pay him 2s a day—I did not employ Thomas or any one on Sunday 13th and Monday 14th to make ball cartridges for me and pay him for it—I know a young man named Procter—he went by the name of Hell-fire Jack or young Bombshell among the Chartists—I did not employ him to make cartridges and say they were for some gentlemen who were going to emigrate—I do not know Procter s father—I never left a pike or pike—head for Procter at his father s house— looking at a broken one I have seen Procter show that at the meetings to show that he was prepared—I never had it in my hand—I swear positively I never left this wrapped up in paper for Procter at his father s house after 13th Aug —I never left anything of the sort—I was not in the habit of being armed—I never carried arms before 16th Aug but on one occasion and that was the pistol and cartridges when I went to Garrett—I had no arms in my house only on the afternoon of 15th—I swear that MR CLERK Q Hew did that pistol and cartridges come into your possession A Procter had been making some cartridges and he thought the police had got a clue to what he had been making—he met me in the street and asked me to take them to my house in case the police should find out where they were and I did so—I had seen Procter make some of those cartridges—I have seen this pike—head in Procter s possession on several occasions before 15th Aug as early as Whit-Monday and several others of the same description—I have seen him at the meetings of the locality pull them from under his coat and show them CHARLES BALDWINSON I am a tailor and live in Webber-street Black-friars-road In May last I became a member of the Chartist Association at the South London locality—I became a class leader about a fortnight of three weeks afterwards—I had nine men under me as a class leader myself making ten—our locality met at the South London Chartist Hall Webber-street—I know Mullins—on the day that Ernest Jones was tried in this Court I was at the George Inn in the Old Bailey—Mullins and about nine or ten others were there—I heard them say that they wanted the secretaries and delegates to meet together that day at the George—they did meet—I went and they would not let me assemble with them because I was neither a secretary or a delegate—I saw Mullins write something on several pieces if paper and hand one to each of the men that sat at the meeting to each secretary and delegate—one of those pieces of paper was afterwards brought to our locality by Pedley and on the production of that Pedley was elected our delegate to the secret meeting—on the following Wednesday evening 12th July Mullins took me and Pedley round to several streets courts and alleys and said they would be the best places to fire on the police and military as they were passing by—he took us into one of the courts and asked a woman who stood there if there was any entrance to that court—she said No and he said That will not do you must have a thoroughfare to it —we afterwards went to the Milton-street Theatre where there was a meeting that evening—on 15th Aug the day before the people were apprehended I met a person named Morgan and went with him to the Peacock in the Westminster-road—it was about eight o clock in the evening—I found a man of the name of Chester and Collins there—Pedley came afterwards—there were about a dozen there all Chartists of that locality—Pedley said there was a delegate come from Manchester and he was told to tell us that they were up and doing there—he asked us if we were ready to come out and fight and they all answered yes if he meant it—he told us we were to come to the Peacock on the following evening and to bring all our men with us armed or not armed—he said we were to meet at the four different quarters—our locality was to meet at the Broadway Westminster—the other three quarters mentioned were Clerkenwell-green Tower Hamlets and the East-end of the town—in consequence of that I told my class-men what Pedley had said—Conway was one and Prowton another—I went to the Peacock on Wednesday evening about eight—Pedley came afterwards—Morgan and Conway were there and Winspeare—Pedley brought several ribbons of different colours—red and white were two of the colours—there were three—he said the delegates were to wear them that they might be known by the men—I saw Pedley with some cartridges that evening—I had a pistol there and a pike—head—Pedley gave me some cartridges for my pistol—I loaded it with them—that was at the Peacock—I went to the Angel for the pike—Pedley came afterwards—it was there that I saw the cartridges and I saw him load other men s pistols—Pedley had left two or three minutes before the police came with two men with loaded pistols—I had given information to the police that afternoon about half-past one or two or from that to three Cross-examined by MR PARRY Q When did you first think of giving information to the police A Not till the afternoon of the 16th—I was as accomplice up to the 16th—I was arrested and let go—I swear I was not on friendly terms with the police till that afternoon—I swear I bad no communication with the police before that—I bad not been at the Angel that afternoon placing some of the cartridges that were afterwards found under the table—I had no cartridges—I had a pistol and pike-bead—I did not always carry them about with me—I did not act with them with the intention of betraying them—I intended to work with them and did so—I remember about Tuesday giving a pike to Conway one of the men who was taken at the Angel with it on him—I did not give it him for the purpose of its being found on him—he had one—that was after I had been in communication with the police—I had bought it about June last—I get my living by hard work by tailoring—I was working with a man of the name of Gwynn at this time—I worked with him about six years off and on up to this time—I have not got anything for this—I have ll a week to support my wife through being thrown out of bread—I did not make that arrangement with the police before I gave any information—I do not expect anything else—I do not want anything else—I should not object to any more money if it was offered me—I got about 4s 6d a day regular wages if I earned it—I am paid by the piece HENRY JONES policeman 138 On the morning of 17th July I was on duty and went into Clerkenwell Churchyard about half-past four o clock—it is part of my rounds—it adjoins Clerkenwell-green and is enclosed from it by an iron railing—there is a passage through the Churchyard to three houses that are in it—that is accessible to persons at all hours night and day—behind a wooden paling underneath a bookbinder s window I found a basket containing 280 rounds of perfect ball cartridges and about fifty imperfect ones—this handkerchief was lying over the basket producing them JOSIAS CHILTON I live in Crawford-street Bryanston-square and know Breedon s beer-shop in Shouldham-street On the night of 16th Aug I went there between eight and nine o clock—there were about eighteen or twenty persons there chiefly labourers and I should rather think from their dialect they were Irish—I heard something said about leaving there and going to Crown-street to meet their parties—I saw a gun unfolded from a wrapper by one of the persons that brought it in—it was in two parts stock and barrel—I saw on the table near the door a sword blade and a handle—the people were desired to disperse two or three at a time—they went away on that two or three at a time—I was there about an hour altogether THOMAS MALLISON I live in Shouldham-street next door to Breedon s beer-shop—from my room I can see into Breedon s—on 16th Aug about half-past seven o clock I was at my window and saw about fifteen or sixteen people arrive at Breedon s—they appeared to come in threes and fours—when I first looked there were six or seven persons at the door—the number increased—I should say eighty or a hundred came in threes and fours—they went in—there were not more than sixteen outside the door—I could see into Breedon s room from my window—it was crowded—I should say there were forty or fifty there or from that to sixty—while looking I observed the bright blade of a pike jerked up by some party or other above their heads—I saw from four to six inches of the blade—I went round to the station and gave information to Mr Walker—previous to that I had seen a cab arrive with three persons in it and a bundle three or four feet long was handed out tied round with a lightish cloth and a piece of string which excited my suspicions—the bundle was taken into Breadon s—I could not see what it was JOHN BAMBRIDGE policeman D 105 On 16th Aug about nine o clock in the evening I was in Shouldham-street and placed myself in a yard and also on a roof from which 1 could see into Breedon s beer-shop—at a few minutes after nine I saw about sixteen people in the room—one person was keeping the door—the window was opened and one party addressed the others and told them to come themselves and bring as many other friends as they possibly could with them JOSEPH HOYLE policeman V 95 In Aug I was stationed in and about Seven Dials—on the evening of 16th about a quarter to nine o clock I saw about twenty people assembled standing in twos and threes in the Seven Dials—the number increased to about forty—I have been on the beat some time and have a general knowledge of the persons that live in the neighbourhood—the people assembled appeared to be strangers—about half-past nine the number had increased to about sixty and I thought it right to inform my inspector WILLIAM ROBERT BLACK police-inspector F On the evening of 16th Aug about half-past nine o clock I went to Seven Dials with a party of police—I found from 100 to 150 people assembled standing talking in twos and threes—the greater number appeared to be strangers in the neighbourhood—we dispersed them ROBERT WARRINGTON I am chemical operator to the Society of Apothecaries looking at the two receipts found at Rose s —the first of these is pounded berytes of copper wrapped in tinfoil sprinkled with water and wrapped in paper—that is a mixture which is commonly exhibited in lectures on chemistry for the purpose of showing spontaneous combustion of tinfoil—when put in contact with nitrate of copper and moistened the tinfoil becomes red-hot and bursts combustion would take place in between two and five minutes—the whole being wrapped together it could be thrown anywhere and would exhibit no appearance of its combustible nature until it burst—the other is steel filings and sulphur paste woollen rags dipped in naphtha sprinkled with nitric and sulphuric acids vegetable pitch—there seem to be two mixtures here—the first is a mixture very often made for the purpose of producing intense heat but no ignition would take place—the second would form a very powerful combustible mixture directly the acids were poured on the woollen rags so steeped they would burst into flames—then follows Nitrate of silver inclosed with a few pebble stones —I cannot conceive that that would produce any action at all—if it means fulminating silver that is a very common mode of exploding pebble stones but it would produce no effect—it is what is called lunar caustic WILLIAM RANDALL I am a firework-maker I have examined these balls—they contain about 2 1/2 oz of gunpowder mixed with small tacks or nails—there is a small piece of cotton which goes inside the ball which I suppose would burn about half a minute before the ball exploded—there is no string it is merely bound round with brown paper seamed with pitch—there is what is called a slow match which communicates with the powder—if you lighted the slow match probably half a minute would elapse before it exploded JOSEPH THOMPSON re-examined I apprehended the prisoner on this charge on 18th Sept —I found him at 4 Tatham-court John-street East-street Old Kent-road—I had been searching for him for some time—I went there about nine o clock—he was on the first-floor—I got into the house by a little stratagent and he came down stairs with a bonnet and shawl on and dressed apparently as a female—I suspected he was a female until he spoke—he held out his finger and said I will surrender and he surrendered quite guietly Cross-examined by MR PARRY Q Did he say Here I am A I do not think he did—the first words he spoke were I will surrender Witnesses for the Defence GUSTAVUS THOMAS I know Barrett who has been examined here as a witness—on Sunday and Monday 13th and 14th Aug I was employed by him to make cartridges for a person going abroad—he told me they were to be sold to the blacks—by cartridges I mean bullets and powder put into paper and screwed at the end—I was to make as many as I could—I cannot tell how many I made there was such a quantity and he made some himself—there was about half a bushel altogether—it took me part of Sunday and Monday evening—he paid me 2s for the Sunday and 1s for the Monday evening—they were made in Barrett s house—I live with my father at 16 Harrow-road—Barrett s house—is 17 Charles-street James-street Edgware-road—Barrett was there part of the time—he saw me make some of the cartridges and made some himself—a person named Procter was there doing the same thing Cross-examined by MR ATTORNEY-GENERAL Q What business are you A A carpenter—I had known Barrett I dare say six weeks before 16th Aug —the first time I met him was in the Edgware-road—he was talking to me and invited me to have half-a-pint of beer with him—that was the first time 1 had seen him—that was about a fortnight before I made the cartridges—he invited me down to see him—he spoke to me very friendly—I never saw Procter before I saw him at Barrett s—I do not know whether he is the person they call Hell-fire Jack —I have never heard him called so—he made as many cartridges as he could as I did—I suppose he was paid the same that I was by Barrett—he left before I did on the Sunday evening—there was no one else there—I do not know what became of the cartridges—I was here at the last trial but was not examined—my father brought me here—he was reading the paper and I told him it was a man named Barrett who employed me and he said it was no more than right that I should come to state it—my father is not a Chartist—the solicitor knew I was here at the last trial MR PARRY Q How many times had you seen Barrett before you made the cartridges A About three times—he spoke to me first—he entered into friendly conversation with me and asked me to take some beer—that was the beginning of my knowledge of him CHARLES PROCTER I live at 8 High worth-place Marylebone with my father and am a painter by trade I have known Barrett who has been examined here about five months—I was employed by him on Sunday 13th Aug in his kitchen—I was out of employment and he came to me on the Saturday and told me if I liked to come and work for him he would pay me 2s for my day s work—he did not tell me what I was to do till I got there—I went on Sunday and Barrett me and a youth that 1 saw there were making some ball-cartridges—I had seen that youth frequently with Barrett six seven or eight times I am positive of that—when I went into the kitchen Barrett told me to make some ball-cartridges—he said they were for a gentleman emigrating—I did not know how to go about it and he showed me—I saw a pistol in the room and an iron railing bent at one end and sharpened up at the other—my father showed me a thing similar to a pike-staff—this is it produced it was sharpened—the handle was not then broken—my father did that in my presence and threw it aside and forbade my speaking to Barrett again—I have never to my knowledge been called Hell-fire Jack —I should have remembered it if I had—I am a Chartist—I never saw this pike before I saw it in my father s hands—if Barrett says I was in the habit of using it at the localities of the Chartists it is false Cross-examined by MR ATTORNEY-GENERAL Q Did you attend the meeting at Kennington-common A I did not I was not a Chartist then—I became one after that—I was at the Bonner s-fields meeting—I was not there when the people attacked the Church—I went home when I heard the meeting was forbidden—I was not at the meeting when the people walked round the town—I have attended about thirty meetings since I became a Chartist in John-street Convention Rooms Mr Morgan s in Praed-street Cartwright s and Breadon s not at Webber-street—I belong to the Maryle-bone locality—I never had a class-leader—there were a great many class-leaders in that district one for every nine men COURT Q Were you a class-leader A No I do not know what I was any more than a Chartist Q What is a Chartist A Why it is an individual that wants a fair day s pay for a fair day s work MR ATTORNEY-GENERAL Q And how are the Chartists to get it A By peaceable and social means by petitioning I suppose not by fighting or using such things as these—I am not a physical force Chartist—I do not know a person of the name of George Procter a bomb-shell maker—I am a painter by trade—I never saw a bomb-shell—I never made any—I never made cartridges before I made them for Barrett—I had known Thomas I should say about three weeks or it might be a month—I do not know whether he is a Chartist—I have seen him in Breedon s in Shouldham-street—I never saw him at Cartwright s—I have seen him at Morgan s in Praed-street with Barrett—I do not remember seeing him anywhere else—the Emmett Brigade met at Morgan s—it was established for social petitions—it was named after Robert Emmett a man that was hung some years ago—I do not know what it was for I suppose because they were the strongest and were able to do it—I have seen Thomas at Barrett s house two or three times I should suppose—we used in general to meet every night at Cartwright s—I have not seen Thomas there every night about twice—I was a member of the Emmett Brigade—I heard the people were taken at the Orange Tree on 16th Aug but I had nothing to do with it—I was not at Breedon s that night I was at home with my father—I did not know there was to be a meeting on the 16th—I never heard of it—I did not hear they were taken till the next day—I did not attend that night or I should have known it the same night—I had some work and thought it better to attend to that—I never had any pistols—I saw one in Barrett s kitchen on the Monday evening as we were finishing the cartridges I had never seen it before THOMAS PARIS I am a blacksmith and live at Greenwich I know Davis who lives at Greenwich—he is a boot-maker and broker and keeps a general sort of shop—I never saw him work—whenever I saw his shop it was composed of shoes guns swords and such like—I did not pay particular attention to it that is what I did see—I was only once in the shop—there were a great many second-hand things—there was an old stool—I bought a gun of him not very long before the 16th of that month that the conspiracy broke out—I do not know whether it was Aug —I recollect meeting Davis on 16th Aug about one o clock as near as possible—he said to me You are the very man I want —he said This is the night the blow is to be struck —he asked me to come up and put his hand on his breast and said I am all right or all ready and turned up his coat and showed me the tri-coloured ribbon Cross-examined by MR ATTORNEY-GENERAL Q Are you a Chartist A I do not know whether I am a Chartist or not—I am a man for equal justice—I do not know whether you can make that a Chartist—I belong to that body—you may turn principles into anything you like—the Chartist principles are founded on justice and truth—I belong to the Wat Tyler Brigade—I do not hold any rank I am not a class-leader—Davis was my class-leader—I do not know who my warden was—I do not think Mr Ward was Bligh was—Davis was not my class-leader Young was—I have never been in a Court like this—I am a stupid fellow—I think Davis was a class-leader he was the head one altogether I believe—he was a man over 100 I believe—he was the delegate sent up from Greenwich but he elected himself—I knew nothing about the tri-coloured badge before I saw it on his coat—I do not know whether it was in his coat or hat but when he said He was all right or all ready he showed it me—I bought the gun because Davis told the locality there was to be a fight or revolution and 1 thought I ought to be ready as well as the rest—I said there would not be a revolution no one else but Davis told me so—I said it could not be because I did not see the people were prepared for it—I bought the gun because I considered it was cheap and I could get the money for it any day—he had the gun in his shop for sale—I only saw that and another one—I saw an old sword and some very good pistols—he always had plenty of pistols—I always saw a pair of pistols in his custody when he came to the meeting—I never examined them—there was an old sword and another sword—I do not know where he bought the guns—mine was an old Queen Anne piece a real rum-un—I gave 6s for it—it is a little short piece—I know it to be a Queen Anne piece because I was informed when I was a little boy when I saw an old piece that it was a Queen Anne and it was the same sort as this it was very old-fashioned REUBEN COLLETT I live at Mr Taylor s in the Kent-road—I am a baker—I am in my 21st year—I am not a Chartist—I have never been asked by Davis to become one—I know Davis s shop—I have seen pistols there—I did not raffle for them—they were not raffled for—I did not invest a shilling in a raffle and have it returned to me because it did not take place—I did not invest any money at all—I remember a raffle being proposed—Davis told me the reason it did not take place was because he could not get members enough—I know Martin—I was at one time with him in Davis s company—I have heard Davis say he was a Chartist—I did not hear him say he would wallow knee-deep in blood for his fellow-creatures FREDERICK MARTIN I am apprenticed to a carpenter and live at Green-wich—I am twenty years old—I know Davis—he asked me to enrol myself as a member of the Chartists—I declined—he asked me to raffle for a pair of pistols—I know Collett—I was with him on one occasion in Davis s shop when Davis said he was a Chartist and would wallow knee-deep in blood for the rights of his fellow-creatures—I am quite sure of that MR ATTORNEY-GENERAL Q Collett was close by A No he was not there at the time JOHN MATTHEWS I am a bricklayer s labourer I have known Davis about eighteen months—I have seen him at the Druid s Arms in Greenwich at the Chartist s meetings there and have seen him urge the people present to get arms—I never heard him ask them to get arms—I have seen him with pistols in the room offering them for sale or to be raffled for Cross-examined by MR ATTORNEY-GENERAL Q Are you a Chartist A No I do not attend the Druid s Arms frequently—I go there sometimes after my work—I do not belong to the Wat Tyler or Emmett Brigades COURT Q How came you to be at the house A I have used it there years—these were not private meetings of the Chartists—I have been in the parlour and have gone up-stairs and sat down as other people might JOHN HANKS I am a carpenter and live at Church-passage Greenwich I know Davis—I remember being in his shop about the latter end May or the beginning of June when he said half-inch chisels would be very serviceable to run into the bowels of the police—he asked me if I would fight for my country for a fair day s wages and a fair day s work—I was passing when he pointed to a musket—he said These are the things that will settle the special constables —I was one myself—I have known Davis near eight years—from what 1 know of him I would not believe him on his oath Cross-examined by MR ATTORNEY-GENERAL Q He knew you if were a special constable I presume A Yes he knew that at the time he talked about the hall-inch chisels and the gun—he invited me several times into the room where they met and when he began to talk about pistols and guns I said it was disgusting to me—I never beard him examined on his oath—I would not believe him on his oath because he tried to draw me in and put me into difficulties and I was satisfied it would not be carried out because I knew very well that the Government would overpower such a movement—it tvas beyond all reason that any such thing would take place in this country as burning and assassinating the people which was spoken of when I was in the shop—the reason I did not join was because I did not approve of their transactions—I did not go to the police and give information—there were more people present than Davis talking about it—there was a man named Blagden—I do not know Bligh Robinson or Ward—I was satisfied that a dangerous meeting was going to take place—at that time there were a great many depredations committed on the shopkeepers and I joined the special constables to protect my own property—I did not go to the police I had enough to attend to my own business—I was satisfied it was very well known to the police because the police were round about the house where the meetings were continually—that was at the Druid s Arms in Straits-mouth—I thought it was not my duty to give information—I keep a broker s-shop—I deal in old clothes—I am a carpenter by trade and keep an old clothes -shop as well—I do not deal in guns—I have never had any MR PARRY Q It was Davis talked about assassinating the police and burning the houses A Yes he wanted me to come to the Druid s Arms and join them on several occasions—he asked me about three times JOHN STANTON I am a labouring man and live at Greenwich I know Davis—I have known him the last two years when he lived at Mr Hanks s house—I was a Chartist at that time I am not now—Davis asked me to become one about four months ago—he asked me to join the Wat Tyler division—he offered to supply me with a pike—I was to pay for it by instalments—he said he would fetch it from London as he was in the habit of going to London every day—he said he had a pair of pistols and was going to raffle them but if I liked to buy them I might do so—he said I had better provide myself with arms because I would not know when I might be attacked by the b - - blue devils—I saw him at the Druid s Arms several times—he was there every meeting-night—the meeting of the Confederates was on Sunday and the Chartists on Tuesday—he said he wished we had a place at the back of his bouse where we could practise firing for the purpose of getting us into organization Cross-examined by MR ATTORNEY-GENERAL Q Were you examined on a former occasion A I was I then gave nearly the same story—I am a labouring man—I was formerly in the police—I left it to go to work on the Greenwich Railway—I was not dismissed—I was fined on several occasions before I left—I got 18s a week on the railway and my overtime and as a policeman I got 19s a week not my clothes—my overtime sometimes came to 10s and sometimes I worked eight days and sometimes nine days in a week early in the morning and late in the evening—ten hours makes a working day—we used to work overtime till ten at night sometimes—I joined the police when they first went to Greenwich about seventeen years ago—I was reported two or three times—I do not know about being reprimanded—I might be reported early in 1832 by police-sergeant Parry for being absent from my duty—I do not know that I was again reported in the same month for being absent—I was not that I know of reported for being in a public-house and taking a pensioner to the police-station to sleep—I was not fined 5s —I was not dismissed for being drunk—I gave in my resignation and the superintendent sent Sergeant Herring to take my clothes that was in 1835 MR PARRY Q In addition to having overwork had you your Sundays to yourself A Yes and Saturday night as well and only one master I had five or six in the police and I was not up all night at least if I was I was paid double for it—there is one thing that I forgot to mention and that was after Mitchell had been sentenced Davis took up the newspaper and read and said What do you think of this Stanton —I said it was a bad job for the family—he said Mitchell was transported for fourteen years I wish I had my wish I would go to the Houses of Lords and of Commons and blow all the b - - s up into the heavens —I forgot to explain that last time I was here JOHN PINEGAR I live at Greenwich and know Davis quite well I remember hearing of Mitchell being convicted in Ireland—I saw Davis about that time—he had not quite done reading the paper when I went in—I asked what they had done with Mitchell—he said they had transported him for life or something of that sort and proceeded reading the paper—he did not say anything more that day—at another time I heard him say that he would be one to go to London to blow up both Houses of Parliament with every b—r in them and the b - - Queen too—that was some weeks before at the Druid s Arms not at any meeting Cross-examined by MR ATTORNEY-GENERAL Q Did he say that to you privately or generally A Privately—simply to me no one else was in the room at the time—he treated me to a pint of half-and-half at the time—I bought a gun of him—he told me things were coming about and we should all want a gun and if we did not get a gun we should all get killed—I innocent like gave him 6s for it—I bought it because if any one was coming to take my life I was in duty bound to protect myself—I did not know who were coming—I was a member of the Wat Tyler Brigade—I did not expect they were coming or the Emmett Brigade or the Felon Club—I have shot sparrows in my own ground—I bought the gun to shoot it did not matter what if they came to take my life—Davis told me we should all be fetched out of our beds and I said if that was the ease I should want a gun to protect my wife and family and to protect my garden—I have shot cats and a dog as well—I bought it to protect my wife and family—it was too long to take in the streets it was five feet long I could not load it—I had not got anything to take into the streets—I do not recollect at all where I was on 16th Aug —I recollect the day the persons were taken up at the Orange Tree—I was in town on that evening I heard something was going on in the evening and walked up to London-bridge and round some of the streets I cannot say which I am a stranger in London some man showed me where to go—I met him in Church-passage Greenwich—Davis did not advise me not to come up he advised me to go up—I did not go to the Orange Tree—Davis did not tell me not to go—next morning he said It was a very good job you did not take my advice and go to town —I heard something was to take place I did not know what—I heard of fires and other things from Davis not from any one else—I do not know who it was that I met—he said be knew me well and I said if he was going up to town I would go—we met two or three on the road—I left my gun at home—no persons that were with me had anything that I am aware of—I did not see anything—when we got to London we called in Bermondsey as we came and had two pots of beer—there was no one else there but a man singing songs—we staid in the public-house till half-past eleven and then came to London-bridge and where we went then I cannot be positive—I do not know the road—I did not go into any other house till 1 got to my own house—we went over London-bridge and came over another bridge—I do not know what bridge I believe it was the next one—this person took me—these were three of us altogether—I do not know Webber-street—I then went home MR PARRY Q What time did you start to see what was going on is London A After ten o clock—I met another man just as I had started—I had been at work all the afternoon not the whole of the day—after I left off work at half-past five I went home and had my tea—nothing was to be seen when we got up to London—we got up about twelve or one o clock WILLIAM DOW I live at Blackheath—I know Davis Between May and Aug he asked me if I was a Chartist—he has asked me to become a Chartist and to go to the Druid s Arms—I never did—he has frequently pressed me to do so—on the Saturday before Whit-Monday I saw Davis with a pair of pistols—he told me he was going to a meeting at Bonner s-fields and should take his pistols and use them if it was required—he asked me whether I had any arms—he did not to my knowledge offer to sell me arms—he said I ought to have arms—I do not remember his offering to supply me—I remember his saying on one occasion something about that he would do his best to destroy the present Government as they were bringing the people to starvation—not those exact words—he said the country was in a sad state and we were all coming to poverty—he did not say anything to my knowledge about doing his best to destroy the present Government—he said it would be better for me and my family if I joined the Chartists—I declined it WILLIAM JOHN GARRETT I live at 19 Linton-place Edgeware-road and am a shoemaker I have known Barrett about twelve months—I remember his coming to me on the evening of loth Aug —he asked me to go with him to a meeting—he did not say where it was to be—he showed me a pistol and about sixty cartridges—he said he had been making the cartridges—I asked him where he got them—I do not recollect his saying anything about the Seven Dials—he asked me to go to the meeting with him—he said he expected a turn-up with the police that evening—I did not go Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q You have been a Chartist a great number of years A I have—I belong to the Marylebone Locality—that is not the Emmett Brigade—I attended the demonstration on 10th April—I went from my own house—I called at ray locality and the principal part were gone and I went with the remainder to Kennington-common—I did not reach the procession till they were turning into Holborn and I joined it there and we all marched arm-in-arm three or four abreast and then went to Kennington-common—there were a great many sixty or seventy thousand—we went to take the national petition—I do not know that before that I saw notices in the street warning people from attending that meeting—I do not know that I swore at my last examination that I did—I do not know whether I did or not—it was given out at the locality that no man was to carry even a stick and I do not know any man that did—I tried to get over Westminster-bridge on my way home and could not—I waited 3nd tried to get over Vauxhall-bridge and was told it was all blocked up with police—I waited till the police left and then caroe over Westminster-bridge MR PARRY Q I dare say you saw a great many well-dressed people at the meeting as we l as working men A I did RICHARD PINNELL I am a carpenter and live at India-cottages Hoxton Old-town I have known Powell for the last twelve or thirteen years—I recollect his speaking to me between April and August about the Government—he said it was a weak and b - - Government and we meaning the Chartists would send Lord John Russell and Sir George Grey to the devil within another month —that was a week or two before 10th April—he alluded to the meeting that was going to take place at Kennington-common—he had asked me to go to Cartwright s and become a Chartist—I declined and said I would not have anything to do with them—I recollect his saying Look at the Queen with her hundreds of thousands a year spending in waste and idleness while we are obliged to work from morning to night to get a mouthful of bread —he said I will blow her and the b—foreigner and the b - - family to hell —I suppose he was alluding to Prince Albert—he said if I called at his house next Sunday he would show me materials sufficient to blow London to hell in half an hour—I have beard him express his opinion on religious subjects many times and from what I have known of him I would not believe him on his oath—I have heard him called Lying Tom to his face scores of times—he was never known by any other name Cross-examined by MR ATTORNEY-GENERAL Q Are you a Chartist A No—I was found out as a witness by one of the men in Mr Smith s shop—I do not know his name he called on me and told me to go to some gentleman s house at Dalston I do not know his name—I never made any inquiry about it—that man wrote a letter which I signed and it was published in the Northern Star—a card was left at my house for me to go to a street in Dalston—I have not got the card here I have lost it—the number of the man s house and the name of the street was written on it that was all—I live about a mile and a half from Dalston—no further message was left with the card than that this party wished to see me at nine o clock that night—what I understood was that this stranger had been at Mr Smith s shop and the men there told that stranger that I had worked with Powell a length of time and they thought it was likely if he would call on me that I might give some information and I went—I do not know the man s name—he was a shoemaker—at least I saw some shoes in his house—I was not examined by an attorney—I do not know Mullins I never saw him—I never knew Cuffey or Lacey or any of the men—what the man wrote and I signed was all correct I believe—I would not believe Powell on his oath because I have heard him swear that he would swear anything if he could get paid for it—that was in the shop times out of number within the last thirteen years—it is about nineteen months since I worked with him—that is not my only reason for not believing him—I would not believe him on account of his bad actions respecting religion—I have heard him call Jesus Christ a thief and the Virgin Mary the biggest wh—that ever walked—I have seen him break up certain portions of Scripture and put them into the fire—when I was last here I gave as a reason for not believing him on his oath that I had seen him take the New Testament from his box and wherever the name of our Saviour occurred cut it out and burn it—I have seen him do so on several occasions—he did not have fresh books—I have known him go out of a morning to buy a rasher of bacon and he would bring it wrapped up in a piece of the New Testament and as he was reading it he would break it and I have seen him do it in a book—he tore out the part where Christ s name was—he did not throw the whole leaf into the fire only that part—he would break off that part and throw it into the fire—I did not on the last occasion say he cut it out—he broke it off not the whole page—he only broke out those portions and also wherever the name of the Apostles occurred—I have seen him take the book out of his chest for the purpose—I do not think he was in the habit of reading it—he kept it in his chest but he made all sorts of sport of it—I never associated with him—I did not dare to complain to his brother-in-law Mr Smith—I have worked with him twelve or thirteen years and in that time it may have happened once or twice in twelve months or it might not happen once in three years but I know it did happen in many instances during the time I was there—I cannot say how often—perhaps it might have been a dozen times in the whole time—I should say it was—I would not believe him on any account because I know he is capable of anything that is bad—he never did a good action in his life—I believe he would hang his wife and family for 4d —he would do it for anything in the shape of money—that is my belief on my oath MR PARRY Q Did he tear the part out with his hand A Yes—I have seen him do it more than once and when throwing it into the fire he said We will burn that b - - —always when he got into conversation about religion he would use that and other opprobrious expressions in reference to our Saviour—I have heard him say speaking of his father if he could get at the old b - -—he would get hold of his bones he would pull them out of the grave and strew them about the streets and he hoped and trusted his old soul was in the middle of hell burning—I have heard him swear that scores of times with his eyes rolling about and his arms shaking like a madman—when I say I have heard him swear I mean I have heard him say So help me God JAMES BENNETT I live at 9 Leonard-square and am a shoemaker I know Powell—I met him at the National Hall Holborn on 3rd April and walked home with him—he asked me what I was going to do on 10th April—I told him I intended to go to Kennington-common—he asked me if I intended to go armed—I said no certainly not I considered any man an injurer to the cause that went armed—Powell said I was a b - - fool if I did not he should and every man ought or something to that effect—he said he had been making hand-grenades and that they had penetrated halfway through an inch-board—he had tried the experiment in his own back room—I did not ask him how they were made but he told me—he said a ginger-beer bottle or any kind of bottle half filled with powder and half with hard nails or any kind of substance I think it was ginger-beer bottle he mentioned and by throwing them among the police they would break the b - - s legs—he said they were to be corked up and a fusee put to them—I met him a week afterwards and he asked me how the Chartists were getting on—I said the country seemed in a very agitated state—he said he had ten men and he wanted five more good men as they were and he could take the Artillery-ground easily—I asked him how it was possible that so small a quantity of men could take the Artillery-ground—he said the men he had understood spiking the artillery—I do not know what he meant by it but I believe those were his words—he said he had a plan for taking London or something to that effect Cross-examined by MR ATTORNEY-GENERAL Q What society do you belong to A The Whittington and Cat—I am a Chartist—I have been so nine years and shall be to the day of my death—I am not a physical force man I go by Feargus O Connor s instructions who I understand is a moral force Chartist—I was at the Kennington-common meeting—I did not go armed I should have been a fool to have done so the executive issued orders that the people should not go armed—if they had issued other orders I should not have done so—I cannot say who are the executive—I obeyed them because they were elected by the people—they were to govern the people—I understand the six points of the Charter—I do not know what the executive were elected for—I obeyed them because I considered them a moral set of men—I obey any moral set of men although I do not know them—they give their orders by issuing an address—the address is not communicated to the wardens of the different localities—I learn them from reading the pamphlets—they are printed they are not sent round to the Chartists—the orders are published in the Northern Star which I have taken in for nine years—I would as soon go without my dinner on a Sunday as go without my paper—I read the Northern Star and of course if there is an article in it that I approve of of course I take notice of it—I have got it impressed on my mind there are nothing but moral orders given there—there are no orders but an address or something of that kind—if an address is issued by the executive I expect to find it in the Northern Star and no doubt the Chartists look in it for their orders MR PARRY Q Is the executive the governing body of an association formed for obtaining the six points of the Charter A Yes it is formed for obtaining the Charter by peaceful and constitutional means—I am a member of it and shall continue so—I subscribe to its funds and have done so for nine years—the executive is elected by the members of the association and they act accordingly COURT Q Will you just say what the six points of the Charter are A Universal suffrage vote by ballot triennial parliaments no qualification of members payment of members upon my word I forget the sixth at present—this is the first time I was ever in a Court and I am rather put about MR PARRY Q Equal electoral districts A That is it—I think that was a point when I first joined it and I consider it one of the grandest points DANIEL BYRNE I live in Shoreditch and am a sofa-maker I know Powell—I remember his showing me some pistols on or about the 10th April—he told me he intended to arm himself before going to Kennington-common—I have heard him talk repeatedly about assassinating the police at the coffee-shop where I take my meals—he said he hoped the people would assassin-ate the police and fire the houses—I remember his saying on one occasion when he showed me a pistol These are the things that will do for them I wish to sec all the police assassinated and to have some good fires in London —I have seen him with pistols twice—I have repeatedly heard him at the coffee-house urge men to arm Cross-examined by MR ATTORNEY-GENERAL Q Were you not at the Milton-street Theatre in April A I was on 28th July—it was a Chartist meeting—Mullins was there—I went up to him and cautioned him against Powell knowing him to be a dangerous man knowing what he had done to other men—I cautioned Mullins Rose and Shaw and other men on the platform against Powell because I believed him to be a spy—I cannot mention the other persons names there were a great many—I did not take particular notice whether Bezer was there he might or might not have been—Shaw is the man who was convicted—I did not see Brewster there or Ritchie—I do not know Gurney or Lacey at least I never saw Lacey before he was in the dock—there were a great many there but I do not know their names—I have been a Chartist since 1839—I went to Kennington-common by myself not in the procession—I was caught in the trap at the bridge and will never go to a Chartist meeting again over the bridges—I thought I had no right to be prevented going to my house—I found 1 was prevented going to my house and that is the reason I will not go over there again—when I cautioned Mullins against Powell he said That is not Powell it is Johnson and I denied that his name was Johnson—I had always known him by the name of Powell—I heard him answer by that name—I never heard him called Johnson before that JOHN WESTMORELAND I am a tailor carrying on business at Watling-street City I am a real six-point moral-force Chartist—I remember Powell coming to me and saying he had a project of organization that he thought would be most desirable to act on for taking London and carrying out his physical force operations—he gave me this paper produced —on one occasion he showed me the drawing of a plan—he did not give me that—he introduced himself to me—I never saw him before Cross-examined by MR ATTORNEY-GENERAL Q How long have you been a Chartist A Upwards of forty years—I am a moral force Chartist—I have been in the habit of attending Cartwright s and speaking occasionally—I do not know about being ill-received when I spoke my moral force doctrines I spoke what I conceived to be the truth—I have heard my doctrines applauded very much by certain respectable men who attended there—till this miscreant came among us we were all real moral force Chartists and nothing else—he made impressions on some unfortunate individuals but not on many I am sorry to say many became victims to his insinuations—I heard something of a meeting where the people paraded but I know nothing about it more than hearsay—I never made a speech out of window in my life it is all a mistake—I have subscribed to the defence of these prisoners because I considered they deserved to be supported from the villanous conduct of this miscreant—they were unsuspectingly lead into the mischief they hare been guilty of—I do not know any of the prisoners personally—Mullins was not a member of Cartwright s meeting to my knowledge—I never saw him before—I presume he was lead into it by Powell—I know nothing of it from my own knowledge THOMAS CLARK I am a Chartist Some months back I was connected with the executive but am not now—lam still a member of the National Charter Association—I believe there are at present in that association what are called class-leaders—I know the rules of that association—this is a prospectus of the association looking at it —I believe it was formed on the plan of the Wesleyan body—I was at the drawing up of the rules—as far as I know its objects are peaceable and lawful George Thurston Thomas Oaborne Henry Watson and Alfred Carr were called upon their subpœnas but

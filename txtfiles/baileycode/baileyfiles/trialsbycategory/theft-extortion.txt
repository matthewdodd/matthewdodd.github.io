carried from me to her Mrs Brian I only said if he would make a Confession he would save his own Life and he told me he would confess to no one but her self Henry James I was sent by my Mistress to see for the Prisoner one Day and I found him with Thurston at the White Swan in Leaden hall street I told him my Mistress wanted him he charged me to take no Notice who was with him and Thurston said pray don t but I came Home and told my Lady that the Prisoner was with Thurston upon which she was very much frighted After this I went to call a Constable he was at a Barber s and there I found Thurston they were talking of the Thing I believe for I heard Thurston say he would not do such a Fact for 10 000 l Mrs Alderson I had an Information that the Man at the White-Swan had taken up the Stone after the first Letter was found upon which I sent for him and he own d he came that Night and look d under the Stone for the Money but he told me he was drunk or else he should not have done it This gave me however a bad Opinion of him and I order d my Servants never to go to his House to drink About a Fortnight after the Prisoner was abroad and I sent my Footman to look for him he brought me Word he was drinking with Thurston at his House When the Prisoner came in I ask d him who he had been drinking with He told me he had been with one whose Name I did not know I let him know that the Footman inform d me he had been with Thurston the Prisoner replied - then he s a Rascal for his Pains - if he had not told you I never would In a few Days after this I discharg d him and when he was gone I look d over some Bills of his and imagined the Hand-writing of some of them bore a Resemblance with the Letters upon which I enquir d after him again and he was taken up Thurston The first Time that ever I saw the Prisoner in my Life was when the Lady sent for me to her House he was then call d into the Room to speak to Mr Mispley about these Letters They ask d me if I had not search d the Place for the Money I said I was that Night disguised in Liquor and a Gentleman being at the House and saying there had been Threatning Letters sent to Mrs Alderson and that there was a Watch set both within and without the House I had the Curiosity to go down to see how the Watch stood I own d I went down and that I saw no Watch and that I did kick up the Stone At that Time I did not know where the Lady liv d nor her Name but I did kick up the Stone indeed On the Sunday after I went to an Alehouse the 3 Crowns to enquire for the Prisoner I saw him and asked him how his Lady did and whether she was easy or had any Mistrust of me When the Lady s Footman came to enquire for the Prisoner at my House I don t remember my ordering him to deny he was with me for I took no Observation of the Thing I never rested Night nor Day since this unfortunate Affair and as I desired the Thing should be found out I desired the Prisoner to let me know if any body should be taken up about it I told my Customers the next Day what a foolish Thing I had been guilty of Mr Hunter Constable The third Time the Prisoner was examin d by Sir William Billers he said he was in Company with Thurston and another Man and they asked him if he would be privy to a Letter to get Money at first he said he demurr d but being asked a second Time he consented He was asked if he knew the other Man that was with Thurston and he said No Prisoner I was fuddled when I was examin d by Sir William and when I wrote the Letter from thence to my Mistress William Billers inform d the Court that the Prisoner was in some Confusion when he was examin d but in his Opinion he was not in Liquor that after he had promiss d to tell him the whole Truth he confess d that he had agreed with Thurston and another Man to send a Letter to his Mistress but would not make any farther Information unless he might be sworn Brian Scott John Miller Anthony Warren and Mrs Alderson had no Reason to mistrust the Prisoner before this Affair Harry Tudor took him to be in Liquor when he was examin d Upon the second Indictment Mr Hunter the Constable depos d that he took the Prisoner about 9 in the Morning that as he was following him he observ d him to shuffle something into his Breeches upon searching him they found the Things mention d in his Breeches which he told them he had taken from his Wife in order to sell them The Goods were sworn to by Mrs Alderson s two Maids The Jury acquitted the Prisoner on the first Indictment and found him Guilty on the second Transportation See summary

The word blunt was mentioned - I thought he meant money I said What is blunt - he said he must have four sovereigns to take to the other person I asked him where the other person was and why he did not come with him He said he was to meet him at the Coach and Horses or Mail Coach in Fleet-market or Fleet-street The officer came and took him He wrote on a piece of paper Thomas Whitney Northumberland-court Fenchurch-street WILLIAM COLLYER I am an officer I was sent for on the morning of the 18th of January a little after ten o clock When I entered the room I asked him a few questions about his business - he answered as the last witness has stated He said he came for four sovereigns to take to the man I took him in charge He said he was no thief and I need not confine him as such I said if he did not make a better tale out before the magistrate he would be committed I advised him to send for his friends to speak for him The prisoner in his defence stated that he was going on an errand and had occasion to stop at the corner of Bell Square that the prosecutor also stopped for the same purpose when another man came up and accused them Dowsett said if he would let him go he would give him any thing The man asked for 5 l from each and Dowsett said if he would come home with him he would give him what he demanded But when he got close to his house he said he did not think he had so much but if he appointed where to meet him he would bring him the sum on Wednesday The man refused to wait Dowsett said if he came to-morrow he would meet him and the prisoner That he went in and the man kept menacing him the prisoner about what he would do if he did not procure him some money Being terrified he did not know what to do The prosecutor did not come out and the man getting outrageous at his not coming out a female answered out of the window that Dowsett was not at home but had left word for him to call at nine o clock next morning when he said the prisoner might fetch him to meet the prosecutor at the Coach and Horses at nine o clock or bring the money That he the prisoner never spoke to Mrs Dowsett nor did he use the word blunt at the house GUILTY Aged 17 Transported for Seven Years

I have lived there six months I took the business of another person On Wednesday the 2d of March I had been employed on business all day till half-past nine o clock in the evening and then went out to get a little fresh air - I went through New-street Covent-garden and saw the prisoner Mould on the same side of the way I met him I walked a little way he turned and followed me perhaps twenty yards and finding he pressed me I turned round on my way home he repeatedly pushed against me the whole of the way down St Martin s-court I went into my house and pointed him out to Baxter my shopman Mould was then standing looking in at a ham and beet shop about fifteen yards off on the opposite side of the way In consequence of what Baxter said I went out and followed him up the court and lost sight of him half-way up St Martin s-court he crossed the court and on looking back I found he was gone On the 6th of March a gentleman dined with me and about a quarter before nine o clock in the evening I went out a little way with him and parted with him at the corner of Air-street Leicester-square - I went along Coventry-street and met Mould whom I recognized as having met before as I stated he put his hand to his hat and said How do you do Sir I took no notice of him but crossed the road he crossed also and then put his hand to his hat again saying How do you do Sir I am the lad you met the other evening you have taken indecent liberties with me and if you do not give me some money I will give you in charge Q I do not ask if you gave him any thing but what did you do after that Q I proceeded in a direction for St James s-square along Charles-street and saw several carriages driving about the square and understood the Duke of Norfolk was coming out of a house there I waited to see him and while waiting the prisoner Mould pushed up to me again - upon which I turned short round and went home and on my way home he accosted me at the corner of Charles-street and said This won t do you must give me something more or I ll give you in charge I was exceedingly agitated at such a charge at which one must recoil with horror I told him he might take me or my life or what he pleased I then went home On the 9th of March I met him again in Holborn about two o clock in the afternoon opposite Little Queen-street he touched his hat with his hand andsaid How do you do Sir I made him on I reply - I had occasion to go into different shops and while there I observed him - I saw him looking in at the window of Mr Collett an ironmonger in Middle-row where I was - I afterwards went to Wilson and Co druggists Snow-hill and saw him there he followed me from there to Mr Biggerstaff s my brother-in-law s in Smithfield just as I got to his door he came before me put his hand to his hat and said How do you do I gave him no answer when I came out from Mr Biggerstaff s he was standing on the opposite side of the railing I went from there to another brother-in-law s Mr Lever s No 15 Smithfield he followed me to the door and just as I got inside I saw him walking up and down before the window I left that house at the back entrance in order to avoid him Q Were you out on the 21st of March A I was going to Mr Griffiths No 2 Pullen s-row Islington and met Mould about twenty yards on the City side of Templebar - he touched his hat and said How do you do Sir - I said nothing to him I afterwards went to Mr Clark s in Fleet-street - intending to get him to assist me in taking him having determined to do so as he said in Fleet-street I am the lad that met you the other evening and you injured me very much - and if you do not give me something I will give you in charge I then determined to get assistance and take him - but Mr Clark was not at home while I was at Mr Clark s I observed him looking through the window I waited about twenty minutes Clark did not come and in order to avoid him I sent for a coach which I got into - and observed him running down by the side of it down Fleet-market and about Smithfield-bars he got up behind the coach - I desired the coachman to flog him off I proceeded in the coach to Mr Griffith s and there discharged the coach George Mr Griffiths servant came to the door - I merely said to him Let me out your back way for there is a fellow lurking outside I wish to avoid - I went out the back way Q On the 24th did your receive any communication from Mr Griffiths A Yes and went to Mr Biggerstaff s in order to meet Mould Mr Lever my brother-in-law had come for me with a message from Mr Biggerstaff - I understood I was to meet the prisoners in an hour I had an officer ready to take them but they did not come to Mr Biggerstaff s On the morning of 25th a note was brought to me by Mr Griffiths s servant and in consequence of that note I went to the terrace on the Temple with the note I got there in about ten minutes when the prisoner Denman came up and said Have I the pleasure of addressing Mr Cozens I said That is my name - what is your business his reply was that he had written a note to me which of course I had received I said I had and in consequence of that note I had come to meet him at the appointed time Q Had you received any other note to lead you there but that A None I observed the prisoner Mould standing under the clock Denman stated that he had come to me respecting some very unpleasant affair between me and that youth pointing to Mould that I had taken indecent liberties with him - that he Denman was a respectable stationer residing in Edgware-road that he had brought up a large family respectably - that the youth pointing to Mould had returned a few evenings since and communicated to the whole of his Denman s establishment that a gentleman had taken indecent liberties with him a few evenings since whom he since understood to be me - that he could not suffer such a slur to remain over the character of himself and his family and as the youth was going to sea he wished the affair to be compromised and demanded of me as a compromise 5 l he said We must have 5 l he said he had once fitted the youth out for sea and had been at a great expense with him that he had unfortunately got into bad company and frequented ale-houses but that he had promised to reform and he was about to re-fit him for sea He again said If you will give us 5 l this affair shall be entirely buried in oblivion and you may rely on it you shall never hear any more of it he said We must have 5 l I merely stated that I was not a rich man - that I was a tradesman and could not afford to give so much upon which I took out two sovereigns and about 10 s in loose silver from my pocket Denman held out his hand for the two sovereigns - I said I shall not give it to you - I shall give it to the person who has accused me Mould then held out his hand and I gave him the two sovereigns which had been previously marked Denman then said You must make up the other as soon as you can for we must have 5 l - I immediately gave a signal which had been agreed upon and Wainwright who was waiting came up and took them into custody There had been a plan to apprehend them the sovereigns had been marked and delivered to me for that purpose I went afterwards to Denman s lodging in Clement s-lane with Mr Harmer s clerk Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q You refused to give Denman the money but said you would give it to the person who accused you A I did I have lived in London at various periods probably five or six years I never saw Mould before the 2d of March I went no further than New-street that night he pushed against me in the street five or six times - I did not collar him he did not speak to me that night When I met him on the 6th he pushed against me but not so much as before I recognised him when he addressed me Q Was it not day-light A No it was about a quarter to nine o clock on the 6th I recognised him by the light of the lamps in Coventry-street I did not give him in charge nor ask why he pushed me there were thirty or forty people in St James s-square - he only pushed against me once in that crowd Q Why not take him in charge - he had not accused you of any thing then A Yes he had I had no cause to give him in charge on the 2d He pushed me purposely five or six times I never saw Denman till I went to Temple-terrace he told me there that the other had said I had taken indecent liberties with him MR BRODRICK Q Was Denman close by when you said you would give the money to the person who had accused you A Yes and after I gave it to Mould Denman said We must have the other to make up the 5 l Before I came to town I lived with Mr Pitt a surgeon at Brighton My father was a banker at Watlington in Oxfordshire - I was brought up there and apprenticed to Mr Hopewell of George-street Portman-square The letter alluded to was here read To Mr Cozens Jun 82 Smithfield Private Sir - In consequence of private information calumniating your character I am truly desirons of an interview and having called several times this day March the 24th and not finding you at home has induced me to request your attention to this You may rely on every confidence and honour attached to the name of u gentleman by meeting me by twelve o clock to-morrow morning on the Temple-terrace Temple I will endeavour to adjust matters now existing The affair of this communication is on behalf of a distressed youth of last Sunday fortnight s connection I am Sir your s respectfully W J SMITH If you cannot see me this day I shall fully expect you tomorrow at the time appointed GEORGE BAXTER I am shopman to Mr Cozens On the evening of the 2d of March I remember his coming home and speaking to me it was after half-past 8 o clock I cannot particularly recollect the time I said something to him which induced him to go out I saw a person who he pointed out standing under a lamp on the opposite side I merely saw the colour of his coat JOHN LINCOLN I am porter to Mr Lever No 15 Smithfield bars One day in March about three o clock Mr Cozens came to master s house and after he had come in I observed Mould walking backward and forward and looking in at the window I went to the door he came up and asked if the gentleman lived there who had just come in - nobody but Mr Cozens had come in I said he did not and did not say where he did live Mould walked into the shop again about a week after and asked if Mr Thomas Cozens had been there we said he had not The shopman asked him if he had found out where Mr Cozens lived he said he thought either at No 82 Smithfield or No 2 High-street Islington that he got up behind a coach but Mr Cozens looked out and asked the coachman to whip him down - he went away Prisoner MOULD You told me he was not within that you knew what circumstances I had come under and that his brother had been taken up on the same ground Witness - It is all false I did not know Mr Cozens had a brother JOHN ALVIN I am apprentice to Mr Clark a shoemaker in Fleet-street On the evening of the 21st of March Mr Cozens came to our shop Mr Clark was not at home I was doing something to the window and saw Mould at the corner of the window he appeared to be noticing a person who was coming down our stairs I afterwards got Mr Cozens a coach Mould still stood at the window and appeared to take great notice of Mr Cozens as he got into the coach he appeared to follow the coach till I lost sight of him MARY FOSTER I am servant to Mr Griffiths No 2 Pullen s-row Islington On the evening of the 21st of March Mould knocked at our door I asked what he wanted he said he wanted a gentleman I said What do you want with him he said it was not fit for any woman to know I told him he must wait and shut the door GEORGE AVERY I am servant to Mr Griffiths On the 21st of March between eight and nine o clock in the evening Mr Cozens came to master s house in a coach he appeared very much frightened he came into the passage and asked me to let him out our back way which I did Mould came to the door in about a quarter of an hour - nobody had called in the mean time he asked for the gentleman who had come in the coach I said he was not in the house he said he was sure he was in the house for he had been at the door ever since he came in and that he could not get out the back way because of the New River he said he would fetch an officer and have the house searched I said he might for he was not there On the 24th of March between ten and eleven o clock in the morning both the prisoners came in the house Denman asked the last witness if Mr T Cozens was there - I came up and then he asked me Mould was by I said he was not Denman said he had received a letter stating that he was residing at this house No 2 Pullen s row I said he did not but he might find him at No 82 Smithfield I looked round at Mould and said You are the young man who was here the other evening He said Yes I am I said I knew your face again They thanked me and went away I followed them straight down St John-street-road and saw Denman go into the George and Dragon public-house Mould went into a shop and got some paper and went over to him I made the best of my way to No 82 Smithfield and informed master what had happened and saw both the prisoners opposite to No 82 Smithfield three-quarters of an hour after I had left them in St John-street SARAH JESSOP I am servant to Mr Wells who keeps the George and Dragon St John s-street-road On the 24th of March about ten o clock in the morning two young men came in and wrote a letter Mr JOHN BIGGERSTAFF I live at No 82 Smithfield and have been married to Mr Cozens sister 11 years On the 24th of March in the afternoon the letter produced was brought to my house before that I had received information from Mr Cozens I opened the letter and stated to the lad who brought it that Mr Cozens would meet them according to appointment Mr Cozens has a brother Robert who is about twenty-seven years of age I have known the family thirteen years I never knew any criminal charge made against Mr Robert Cozens Mr WILLIAM GRIFFITHS I am in partnership with Mr Biggerstaff and have been acquainted with Mr Cozens family eleven or twelve years On the 24th of March the day before the prisoners were apprehended a man called at No 82 Smithfield and asked me if Mr Cozens was there I cannot positively swear to the man but believe it to be Mould and believed so when I saw him in custody next day WILLIAM WAINWRIGHT I am an officer In consequence of a plan which had been laid I attended at the Temple and apprehended the prisoners before that I saw two sovereigns marked at Mr Harmer s office and given to Mr Cozens A signal being given by Mr Cozens on the Temple I went up and seized both the prisoners and gave Denman to Lloyd and in Mould s right hand found the same two marked sovereigns - I had seen them talking to Mr Cozens ANDREW LLOYD Wainwright s evidence is correct I searched in Edgware-road to find such a person asDenman a stationer and called at all the should which appeared to sell stationary I searched and made diligent inquiry but could find nobody of the name DENMAN S Defence My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury my not having pleaded guilty was with a conviction of my innocence of any felonious intention of extorting money from Mr Cozens having once swerved from the paths of rectitude two years ago - the press has held me up as a youth lost to all morality and I was obliged to do as I could for a living about six months ago I got a situation with a doctor at Lambeth but he was unable to support me fearful of being arrested I was obliged to go into obscure lodgings to avoid an arrest If my fellow prisoner has mislead me I am sorry for it but I trust that merely which has always been held out by His Majesty will be extended to me I knew Mould by having seen him in Covent-garden with salesmen where he lived but being mislead he swerved from the paths of rectitude - He came to me one night and stated that he had known Mr Cozens before Christmas and that Mr Cozens had actually given him a pound or two at a time - that he had seen him a night or two ago and he had promised to serve him and would I write to Mr Cozens to assist him wishing to serve him I wrote and certainly did not wish to put my name to the letter I am the son of a military officer of some rank who has fought the battles of his country I was mislead by a set of fellows who kept a gaming-house in the vicinity of St James s and was ruined but it was not for money for myself that I acted in this business If no commiseration can be shewn to me I must bow to my sentence but I am innocent of any felunions intention I had met with the patronage of His Majesty to a literary work of great magnitude but His Majesty s official letter having fallen into the hands of some gentlemen it was withheld from me DENMAN -

I told him the report had been so but I did not believe it he said he had heard many such reports and if he offered such a thing to him he would make him repent it - he would make him pay for it he said more than once that he would make him pay for it before he came into the service which was on the 7th of July I think master had broken his arm and went out of town in consequence of the accident this conversation took place before he left town Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q When did this conversation take place A I think three or four days after the prisoner came into the house - I am sure he did not come into the service before July he remained in master s service till the 10th of September Q How many times did he go out of town in company with the prosecutor A I do not know - I have been with master nearly three years Q Were you with him at the time of the present charge A No - I lived with him four years two years ago and then left him - I returned in July the prisoner and I both came the same night - I was aware such a charge had been previously made against master - I had left on account of ill-health - I did not inform master or any body of the conversation I had with the prisoner - I was first told to come here and give evidence the day before yesterday - I know nothing of the bill being found in September Q Did you hear a word from your master or any body about your coming here before last Tuesday A Not positively master broke his arm on the 11th of June I believe - I called there a few days after accidentally and heard he wanted a servant - I had called many times since I had left him and he had spoken to me about coming again but I was in service when he left town I do not know where he went he left town with the prisoner more than once - I cannot say how many times my master first told me I was to come here - I have not been examined by his attorney COURT Q Were you not examined by some gentleman previous to coming here A I was asked a few questions - I do not know whether it was taken down RICHARD ANTHONY SALISBURY I am in the sixty-eighth year of my age and live at No 18 Queen-street Edgware-road Some years ago I was accused by a person of an attempt to commit an unnatural offence upon him - I was not brought to trial the man s name was Tomes About the middle of June last I broke my arm in three places and crushed my hip - I could not turn in bed for some weeks - I keep two men servants but at that time I had but one he was going to leave and I wanted additional assistance - I had seen the prisoner repeatedly before that working in the garden of Mr Jenkins in the New-road where I was in the habit of buying plants knowing the prisoner there I engaged him he brought me a written character which I knew to be true from other circumstances he had before that applied to me to recommend him to another situation and in consequence of my accident I engaged him for four months positively and said if the situation suited him I would do something more for him - I was labouring under the effects of my indisposition all this time and required the constant attendance of a man servant and now I can put on my braces but cannot button them or my shirt my nerves are so paralysed - I shall never have the full use of my hands again - I left town and took the prisoner with me not only for assistance for myself but for recreation for him and to introduce him to the gardens - I went to Maldon Wells to the Well s House which is an hotel the prisoner went with me this was in September On Sunday morning the 9th of September I went up into my bed-room between eleven and twelve o clock and to my surprise I found him dressed for travelling when I expected to find him in his usual morning jacket - I expressed my surprise and he said Sir to be plain with you I must be off if you will give me 50l I will go off to Liverpool and never give you any more trouble but if you do not I will accuse you of an unnatural crime Q Did he explain whether Liverpool was the end of his journey A Not at that time I told him he was a villain to go to hell and leave my presence he immediately left the room - I was sick and a full hour before I recovered myself - I then went down and inquired after him he was not to be found I sent all my servants to seek him - I did not see him again at Maldon - I was at that time in my usual morning dress when I put on my coat and waistcoat I found a letter in my waistcoat pocket looking at one - this is it it was in the pocket of my dinner dress clothes - I can swear it is his handwriting - I had opportunities of seeing him write before - I travelled post all night and arrived in town on Monday- I drove to an hotel and next day went to my residence in town but I went to consult my attorney as soon as I came to town - I did not sleep at home till next night my servant presented me with this letter looking at it the morning after I slept in town the direction does not look like the prisoner s writing but the contents I have no doubt are his I had gone to my house early on Tuesday morning and laid down and got up at eight o clock I went to Bow-street on Monday night about the letter I received at Maldon and then again on Tuesday about this other letter I remember going home on Wednesday night the 12th of September in company with my servant Scott when we got to Queen-street the watchman was going past ten o clock I told Scott to stop and get something which he did and while I was walking by myself I saw the prisoner he came over the street to me and immediately said Will you give me the 50l I said Go along with you villain I will hold no converse with you - I was alarmed and the watchman was at a distance - I retreated and saw Scott coming - I then went on wishing to get into my own house - the prisoner came up again and said If you will not give me the 50l I will accuse you of an unnatural crime but if you will I will be off to Dublin and you shall hear no more of it - he said this in a very loud menacing passionate tone the last time but not the first - Scott was close behind me the last time and there was a man named Smith there I did not know him at that time but he was coming the other way - I think he must have heard the words Morton uttered - he might have been heard across the street - I said I would give him in charge he took to his heels and ran down Seymour-place and I rushed into my own house - I afterwards consulted Mr Adams he thought fit to get an indictment and we went and got the bill - Mr Smith left his address we wrote to him but he was not to be found then we had a warrant against the prisoner before this I employed people to search diligently for him I left the business with my attorney - he was taken a long time afterwards I had a letter from an attorney named Woolley before he was taken I attended at Bow-street on Saturday the 10th of October to identify the prisoner but he was not there - I attended again on a Monday in November and saw him - I had in the mean time been in communication with the Magistrates at Bow-street as so to attend them if I was wanted Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON Q You say the prisoner was taken a long time after you obtained the warrant on your oath was he taken at all or did he surrender A He did not surrender Smith took him into custody he is an officer and got the warrant from the other officers - I found the bill in September - I had a warrant before that and another after finding the bill - the Magistrate gave it to Taunton and he let Smith have it Q On your oath do not you know the warrant never was executed A No I did not desire it should not be executed - I know he was taken on the Monday - I do not believe that he voluntarily surrendered to the charge - there was an appointment made by Woolley his attorney to meet me there but whether he came in custody I do not know - I did not see him come - I believe he was there before me - I did not see him till he was in the office - I believe he was in custody but I do not know the forms of the place - I went to the Portugal hotel Fleet-street on coming to town - I did not sleep there or sleep at all I was so agitated - I passed the night partly at the hotel and partly walking up and down and at five o clock in the morning I got home - I had not spent much time at the hotel - I went to Bow-street on the Monday evening I got to town about twelve o clock on Monday morning then went to consult my attorney and went to Bow-street at seven o clock in the evening when they met - I staid there an hour at least Q Where did you go to from Bow-street office A I am not certain I went to a public-house opposite - I do not know the sign - I am a gentleman living on my fortune - I have some times been in a common public-house- I took some coffee and remained there perhaps half an hour - Scott was with me he did not take coffee with me I will not swear that - I walked homeward after that - I continued to walk homewards till twelve o clock it might be nine before I left the public-house - I walked up and down Portman-square - I had my reasons for not going home I was unhappy and walking relieved me I was relieved in some degree at twelve o clock Q Why did not you go home at twelve o clock A I did not choose it - I was unhappy and went meditating I was in a nervous frame of mind that is the only reason I give for not returning home - I felt no inclination to go home - Portman-square is near my residence but I walked up and down Edgware-road till five o clock and then went home - I was better at five o clock but not much - Scott left me in the street I cannot recollect the precise place probably near some of the streets turning from Oxford-street before I got to Portman-square - he might leave me about nine o clock I cannot say - I paced the square several times - I got home at five o clock I have always the key of the area-gate - all my servants were in bed when I got home - Scott and the female servant were in bed Q How came you to go home then A Because I chose my mind was materially relieved Q Were you not directed by your attorney to go home as fast as you could A He might - the prisoner came into my service early in July - I once told him when I saw him at Jenkins nursery that I knew a situation that would suit him - I do not recollect telling him what situation it was - I had seen him at the nursery frequently before I told him this and he had applied to me two or three times before I hired him for a gardener s place - I swear that he was not an acquaintance of mine - I had seen him there and I have recommended gardeners to some of the best places in the kingdom Q Had he introduced himself to you A He had come and asked me the name of plants repeatedly - he was told I was a botanist - all the men at Jenkins know that when he asked me to get him a situation I said I would if I could and about a fortnight before I hired him myself I told him I knew of a situation which would just suit him - I do not know that I told him whose place it was on the 6th of July I went to Jenkins and told him I would take him myself Q Did you not tell him that was the situation you spoke of A No but I had seen him a handy clever fellow I said he would have to take care of the plants in my courtyard and do a great deal in the house besides and I wouldgive him all the instruction in my power that his wages would be 40l a year and if he behaved well they should be 50l Q Did you tell him that after your decease he would be provided for A I told him at my decease all my servants would have a sum left them if they had continued a year with me which by my will they are entitled to he told me he was in a destitute situation I said he should have 5l in advance and he had a sovereign of it I cannot recollect telling him he should have 5l that evening Q Did you not tell him you had a woman making a silk waistcoat for him A That was afterwards I did tell him so - he wished to have one like mine it was soon after he came because he had not clothes to appear in - he had clothes of every description made for him I ordered a blue coat for him when he came into my service He brought some plants home to me Q When he brought them into your parlour did you not tell him to try on the silk waistcoat A I cannot tell - there were two silk waistcoats which do you mean Q Which did he try on when he came to you with plants as the servant of a market-gardener A That was the blue one Q On that occasion did you give him 5l A I believe I might I do not know whether I gave him the first or second - he had 10l in advance I have no garden at my house - there are between two and three hundred plants in pots every upper servant I have had used to take care of them Q Give me the name of one A The last man I had turned out insane James Crawley who is now with Lord Foley used to take care of them Q On the 13th of July did you give the prisoner a brooch A Yes a very handsome one similar to one I have here - they are called diamonds but I believe they are not I did not give him a chain seals and key - they were to be deducted from his wages - the brooch was a gift I let him have an old coat of mine in July - it was too small but he wore it a few days till another was made for him I went to Seven Oaks in company with him in my own carriage as my servant and companion his behaviour was such I treated him with uncommon kindness Q Did you not pass him off at Seven Oaks as your intimate friend A No but he was a very amusing man he would tell several stories like Denisan in the Arabian Nights that was not entirely the reason I took him in my carriage for he had the tooth-ache very bad and he is an incomparable mimic he can take you or any body off he said Will you allow me to amuse you by seeing how I can behave myself like a gentleman I took him to the Duke of Dorset s garden and took his arm there as I was lame and wanted assistance we did not go into the gardens - we walked round I wanted assistance to walk up the hills in the Duke s park Q Was he equally serviceable to drink punch with you A Yes I passed him off as my friend at the Crown Inn - we slept in a double bedded room there at his particular desire - no infirmity of mine made it necessary the reason he assigned was that he should be ready to assist me Q On the oath you have taken it is my duty to ask after taking your tea and punch and retiring at that inn did you not ask him to come into your bed A Never never nothing like it I never said any thing about***** nor had we any conversation about women on that journey I am quite sure he was particularly delicate with me and never talked on any b-w-dy subject nor did I to him - it is all an invention of his own I missed some rings when I arrived in London in August and wrote to him on the subject I addressed him J Morton Esq to indulge his whim and frolic at his request and because I had represented him as my intimate friend I have repented it but once since I do not recollect telling him I had made an Esquire of him and would do more for him yet I believe I did take him to the Bank with me in August - he might go I did not tell him he was to do all my business for me I said he might have to do business - we went to Blackwall together - I fed him on white-bait and we had punch together I bought him a gold ring - I do not recollect whether it was the same day or what I gave for it I told him at first that I would make him look like a gentleman Q Did you on the 4th of September order him to come to town to buy a gold keeper A Yes I went to Mr Walker s but could not get one I bought silk stockings and gloves I do not recollect whether he went arm-in-arm with me I went to Worcester with him about the 5th of September the carriage was at my door at nine o clock and the prisoner was told to get up behind and he got inside at Kensington - it was his wish I did not take Scott that day as he was ill and thought he might be unwell on the road - his going was talked of I do not know whether I told him why I did not take him Q Did you on that occasion give the prisoner 25l A Yes to pay for the journey I do not recollect how much it was - I will not swear it was not 25l I did not tell him the cheaper he travelled the better as he should have the rest when he got there or that if he got off a large portion of the expences I would put the rest in the Saving-bank for him I travelled on to Oxford and met Dr Williams a professor of botany - I did not introduce the prisoner to him as a young gentleman fond of botany but as a young man fond of gardening and botany I do not believe I introduced him as a gentleman - I might I will not swear I did not I did tell Dr Williams I and my companion were on a botanical tour we had a double bedded room at Woodstock at his desire I got a medical mixture for him at the next house and it relieved him he said he had an eruption in his shoulder - I told him he must rub it - I did not see him do it I was in the same room but the curtain was drawn - I swear I did not see him use it he was in the arm-chair by the side of his bed - I was on the other side of the room and in bed I did not see him naked - he always saw me in bed before he undressed - I had supper and punch with him I never went by a different name on my travels with him - I know nothing of the name of Malcolm - my family name is Markham I had 10 000l to change it and have the King s sign manuel to do so Q Did you tell the landlady your name was Markham A He wished it to be done I am acquainted with the classics - I have read Virgil in Latin and Homer in Greek - I recited passages to him and he began to learn Latin I have heard him lessons I have been charged with a similar offence before Q Now on the oath you have taken before your Maker and as you shall answer it before your Maker did you ever at Woodstock Oxford or any other place take any indecent liberties with the prisoner when you slept in a double bedded room A Never MR ADOLPHUS Q Was he to be your servant out of livery A Yes - I let him have these things because he was not fit to be seen the clothes were to be deducted from his wages I made him these presents at his desire he wished to appear a gentleman and to dress like me I never introduced him to any individual as my companion nor took him to any party of friends as my equal he always waited on me as my servant but when we were alone this familiarity took place On our journey to Seven Oaks and Maldon I had 250l about me and he said it would be safer by sleeping in a double bedded room and he wanted me to buy pistols Q You say you walked the street in great agitation - had you not been out of bed two nights A Yes - I went in at five o clock and went to bed I left the warrants to my attorney and left word with the Magistrate where I might be found at any time I was never out of the way but was always ready to meet this and the former charge I went to Bow-street expecting to meet the prisoner and Woolley MR CLARKSON Q How often had you seen him write A Repeatedly in the house - he has written copies and bills and several verses which he took down I swear both letters are his writing - part of the second letter is in pencil but it is all his MR ADOLPHUS Q Were any proceedings taken against you on the receipt of the first letter A No MR CLARKSON Q Were there never any proceedings from any person on his behalf A Yes from a man named Barton - that was shortly after the receipt of the first letter The letters being read were as follows - First Letter Holywell House September 9 1827 SIR - I have to let you know that owing to the treatment I have received from you since I left London I am compelied to take an opportunity of vindicating my character and declaring your guilt to the world at large I leave here with the intention of proceeding to London and from thence to a gentleman s residence who will vindicate my cause you may depend on hearing from me by letter on your arrival in London until which time I intend to exercise my faculties to the utmost in making an appeal to the tribunal of justice of my country where I doubt not I shall have justice done me As I cannot consent to s-d-y being committed on my person I find it useless stopping longer in your service I am your injured Servant J MORTON N B I intend to prosecute as far as the law of my country will allow so that you have very little to expect and the sooner you proceed to London the better for you Second Letter SIR -

he did not take any thing from him in my presence The prosecutor was cross-examined by the prisoner at considerable length a minute statement of the particulars would be indelicate he denied having gone with him to Hyde-park and other places for any purpose when witness was seriously ill the prisoner had made tea for him and he believed had eaten at his table his wages were 1l a week -

i e SIR - I am extremely sorry to be under the disagreeable necessity of waiting on you but under the circumstance I cannot help it the serjeant that was with me at Drury-lane Theatre on Wednesday night has threatened to report me to the officer of my detachment for taking such a compensation from you for the insult I received and does further declare that I must return you your money and lodge a complaint against you directly so what to do I know not I am sorry from the heart that a man like you of seeming respectability should be guilty of the like I have said all that I could to him but am afraid to no purpose I have taken this plan to mention it to prevent any person from hearing the conversation a few moments conversation with you would be advisable away from the house - I am Sir your most obedient WM SHUTTER Corporal To Mr Haurum against the Staute &c 2nd COUNT like the first only calling it a threatening letter &c 3rd COUNT like the second only stating that he did deliver a certain letter demanding with menaces and without any reasonable or probable cause certain money with intent &c MORGAN ORAM On the 6th of January I went to the 2s gallery at Drury-lane theatre with two little boys - there was a very great crowd at the door the prisoner was there - he called out to another soldier Houston this person has assaulted me I said It is false if you say so any more than being pushed against you which you know was the effect of accident the crowd being so great - I was then holding the youngest boy with my two hands to prevent his being hurt in the crowd the other boy was further on - the other soldier turned round and said Never mind now stop till bye and bye after a little while he turned round again winked at the prisoner and said Keep your eye upon him this was before the doors opened and just as the doors opened he said Take off his excommunication the doors opened there was a great rush and the little boy cried out - I said to the prisoner Do take care and don t hurt him he immediately took him up in his arms and said he would take him into the theatre - I took some money out of my pocket to give the prisoner to pay for the boy s admission and in my confusion I gave him the 6s 6d which was all I had in my pocket - when I got to the pay-place I told the eldest boy he must wait there while I went back for some more money as I had given it all to the soldier or had dropped it - the prisoner took the little boy into the theatre and I went back for more money in a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes I went back and took the elder boy into the theatre - I looked for the prisoner on account of his having the child and saw him about half way down the gallery sitting by the side of the little boy - the gallery was so full I could not get near him at all but I called to him and told him to take care of the boy till the play was over which he did and when it was over he brought him to me - I gave the prisonersomething but I am not certain what it was I was so agitated from the threats he had made use of in the first place - he did not make use of any then I took the two boys home to the City - nothing else passed between the prisoner and I on that occasion I have no idea what I gave him - it was a little change on the Friday following the prisoner brought me a letter to No 6 Tavistock-street where I live - he had not known before where I lived the little boy will state how he came to find me out - when the prisoner brought the letter he said Take it and read it and come away from the house I want to speak to you - I read it and the officer has it this is the letter - I went up Charles-street with him and he said the serjeant obliged him to come to me for some more money as the paltry sum I had given was not enough - I said it was a shameful and a scandalous thing to come to me for money when he knew he had no charge against me but being pushed against him - he said he knew that but he was obliged to come as his serjeant would not be satisfied without my sending him a couple of sovereigns - I said it was a very hard case indeed as I had not so much money by me - I had not above a sovereign and 1s 6d - he said he could not help it if I did not send more he should he obliged to come again and under the threats be made use of I took out the sovereign and three sixpences and gave him - I said that was all I had he said he would try if that would satisfy the serjeant and walked away with the money On the Friday following a little boy brought two letters one inclosed in the other nearly to the same purport as the other was - I went out and found the prisoner in Charles-street waiting for me he said he was sorry from his heart to have to come to me but his serjeant obliged him to come to get some more money - I said it was a very great shame that he should come in that way for money when he had acknowledged the last time he saw me that he had no charge against me he said he knew that but his serjeant obliged him to come or else he would report him and he should get flogged - I said he had extorted money from me and he wanted to extort more - he said he should be sory to do that but he had had a long walk he had just come off duty and he hoped I would give him something - I offered him 2s 6d which had been marked as I had in the mean time told my landlord who had told a gentleman of it and this plan had been arranged - the prisoner refused to take the 2s 6d Mr Tate came up and took him into custody - he was very much confused and begged to be let go Mr Tate gave him to an officer Prisoner Q What was the cause of our first interview A It was quite accidental - I was pushed against you by the crowd as any other person might and that would not have happened if you had not turned almost facing me Q What money did you give me A Six shillings and sixpence to pay for the boy because you took him in your arms - I did not know I gave you the whole 6s 6d I told you to pay for him nothing else I certainly said I would see you after the performance to take the boy home or words to that effect - when you brought the boy I gave you something I do not know what Q Did you not on your examination deny giving me any thing but the 6s 6d at the theatre and the 1l 1s 6d in the street A I could not recollect every circumstance COURT Q Did you say you had not given him any other money A I believe I said I could not recollect the circumstance Prisoner When the play was over he gave me 10s in a paper Witness I cannot say what it was - I do not recollect putting it in paper I believe it was in paper COURT Q What did you mean by saying you would see him when the play was over A To take the little boy of him - I do not know what I gave him it might be a few shillings - I cannot swear whether it was less or more than 10s Prisoner When he gave me the 6s 6d he said Take this I will give you more after the performance is over but do not expose me Witness I did not say such a word I said I would see him when it was over when he was at the pay door COURT Q Did you say you would bring more money A No I do not know what I got when I went home - but whatever I gave him was in consequence of the threats he made use of Prisoner On the examination I asked him what money he gave me when the performance was over and he said none Witness I believe I said I could not recollect COURT Q Did you deny giving him money at the end of the play A I believe I said I could not recollect the push was quite accidental and not in any indecent manner CHARLES JAMES ORTON My father is a deputy seacoal meter I went with the witness to Drury-lane theatre on the night of the 6th of January I saw the prisoner in the street standing near the door - I heard him say Mr Oram had assaulted him Mr Oram said it was false it was the crowd pushed him - the prisoner said he had assaulted his person to the best of my recollection - Mr Oram was rather behind him the prisoner said to another soldier Come out the other said Never mind the prisoner then said Houston keep your eye upon him - we went into the theatre when the door was opened which was in about half an hour I went up stairs rather before Mr Oram - when he came up he said he was afraid he had lost his money I said Have you had your pocket picked he said he must go back and get some money I waited for him - the other little boy is my brother Mr Oram came back in about ten minutes and paid for me and himself - the prisoner took my brother in I did not take notice how he got money to pay for him - after the play was over the prisoner brought my brother to Mr Oram who had waited for them and Mr Oram told me to go down and wait for him - he came down with my brother and joined me I know of nothing else Prisoner Q How long have you known him A About twelve months - he took me to the play because my father had not time to go Q Have you ever been alone with him A Yes out walking - he never took any liberties with me COURT Q Attend to that did he ever take any liberties with you A No - I never had an idea that he was a person likely to commit any indecency WILLIAM ORTON I was at the theatre on the 6th ofJanuary there was a squeeze in the crowd before we got in - I saw the prisoner and heard him say Mr Oram had assulted him I understood he had pushed against him- Mr Oram said it was a story he had been pushed against him - the prisoner said to the other soldier This fellow has assaulted me and the prisoner said he would fetch some one to take Mr Oram away - the prisoner took me to the third or fourth seat in the gallery I did not see how he got any money - I did not see Mr Oram give him any - the prisoner paid for me I did not ask how he came to have the money for me - Mr Oram said to him Good night when it was over I did not see him give him any money Prisoner Q Did you not see him shake hands with me A Yes Prisoner That was the time the 10s was put into my hand ROBERT TATE On the 15th of January about half-past three o clock Mr Farrow of Tavistock-street who is Mr Oram s landlord told me of this circumstance - I stood with him some time and a boy came into the shop Mr Farrow said Here is a note on the business I spokeabout - I said I knew what soldiers were and I advised Mr Oram to go and tender the prisoner some marked money and I should follow to hear what he said - I followed him and saw the prisoner join him near the end of Bow-street they walked up Bow-street and turned down a passage into Long-acre - I was as close behind them as I could be without treading on their heels and could hear their conversation from time to time - I heard Mr Oram say it was a most false accusation there was no ground for it and it was very unjust that he should take the steps he did - the prisoner said he was sorry from his heart or soul but he was obliged to do it - he did not believe him guilty of the charge but was compelled to it by the serjeant I think I followed them into Longacre and being fearful they might turn down a court I took the prisoner as I knew Oram was a timid man - I had seen Oram before this - I should observe I had seen Oram offer him 2s 6d and the prisoner said it would not he worth his while to take so small a sum as he had come a considerable distance - I took the prisoner and brought him to Tavistock-street - I was very much excited at the time - a Police-man was sent for and took him Prisoner Q How long have you known Oram A I should think eighteen months or nearly from seeing him at Mr Farrow s Prisoner This gentleman when on his oath at his examination said he had known him eight or nine years JOSEPH ROBINSON I am a Police-man - I took the prisoner at Mr Farrow s from Oram he said that he had taken improper liberties with his person at the entrance of the 2s gallery COURT Q What did Oram say A He said he had come to the house under a pretence of accusing him of taking improper liberties with his person to get money and he desired me to take him to the watch-house - the prisoner said on our way to the watch-house that the prosecutor had taken improper liberties with his person at the entrance of the theatre and he confessed he had received some money - I believe he said 6s at the entrance of the door then 10s and then a sovereign and three sixpences Prisoner Q Where you present at the examination A Yes - Mr Oram certainly did deny that he gave you the 10s JOHN EALES ROGERS I am an inspector of the Police and was at the watch-house when the prisoner was brought in this letter was delivered to me by Oram -I went up the same night to the riding establishment in St John s-wood where I understood the serjeant was and I took him before the Magistrate the following morning but it was Corporal Houston he corroborated the statement of the prisoner as to what he said took place at the entrance of the theatre - I heard the prisoner say Oram gave him 6s 6d before he went in and when he came out 10s wrapped in paper but Oram denied giving him the 10s Prisoner s Defence On the night in question I was at the theatre door and was insulted by Oram he gave me this money not to expose him there was 6s 6d which was just sufficient for him and the two boys he told me when the performance was over he would see me again I brought the boy out and he handed me the paper with 10s in it he put out his hand and shook hands with me and in a low tone of voice he said Here is 10s don t expose me I saw no more of him till the day he gave me the 1l 1s 6d on his examination he denied giving me the 10s and therefore must be allowed to be a perjured man which I hope your Lordship will allow me to have the benefit of ALEXANDER HOUSTON I am a corporal in the Light Dragoons and was at the theatre - I heard the prisoner say Oram had insulted him and he had his hand on Oram s shoulder I was about a yard in advance of them the prisoner said Come out I could not get out but I saw Oram tremble like an aspin-leaf - I said Keep your eyes on him in a few minutes the doors were opened - I saved a place for the prisoner - I said Where is Oram he said He is safe enough he gave me this boy as a pledge and he gave me 6s to pay for the boy and me and 2s 6d to drink after it was over he said He has given me a cartridge we went to a public-house and opened it and found 10s in it - in going down the street he said I was obliged to borrow money for my admission and I have no more money on my person than this I never desired him to go to Mr Oram and get more money of him nor ever had a moment s conversation on the subject till I was brought a prisoner to Bow-street - I did not know Oram s name till I heard it before the Magistrate - I did not say Take off his excommunication GUILTY Aged 22 Transported for Life

it is licensed by the Magistrates for concerts and I have a large room in which they are held twice a week On Tuesday evening the 13th of December I had a concert and was in the room the greater part of the evening I was in conversation with Mr Arundell a carpenter and Mr Blunt an attorney I was sitting facing the fire place in the second part of the room while I was in conversation the prisoner came up and had a little conversation - he was quite a stranger I had not seen him before to my knowledge when he spoke to me I spoke to him but I cannot say what passed but I am pretty well sure he sat down at the table - I remember passing a joke with Mr Blunt and I think the prisoner went to another part of the room I did not see him again till the concert was over when I was having some conversation with Mr Bell respecting some deeds Mr Blunt was drawing up the prisoner came and sat very close to my side I wished the conversation to be more private I said it was very unfair for him to come and sit by me while I was talking to those gentleman on business I told him his company was quite a bore and there were other parts of the house where he might go to he said where could he go I said You may go into my parlour if you think proper he said May I go into your parlour I said Yes and he went into the parlour - it is a parlour for company I do not know whether there was any one in it then but I should think there was as the concert-room was cleared when I had done speaking to those gentleman I put the lights out and went to the bar - I stopped there some time I then went into the parlour where I saw the prisoner Mr Blunt and several other persons - I do not remember saying any thing particular but I passed a similar joke to Mr Blunt to what I had done in the concert-room I do not remember joining in the conversation I sat in the elbow-chair laid my head on my hand and dozed into a sort of sleep - I might awake once or twice in the course of the evening but did not join in the conversation when I awoke the last time I heardthe prisoner and Mr Perry going away I went to open the door for them but they were before me and got the door open before I got to them I bade them good night and the prisoner said something to me about masonry the prisoner and Mr Perry went away together I closed my doors went round my house and went to bed I saw no more of the prisoner that night - I was not alone with him that evening at all and to my remembrance I had never seen him before on the following Saturday an old man brought me this letter wrapped up in this case - this is the letter but I never read the whole of it because there is so much of it - I was in the bar when it came Dr Newman and two more respectable gentlemen were there I took off the case and laid it on the bar table I opened the letter sufficiently for Dr Newman to read a word or two and I said Here is a nice little letter I thought it might be from some of my family for money I went into my parlour and read part of it I could not understand it I turned it over three different times to know if it could be for me or not and the last time I turned it I spelt my own name letter for letter WILLIAM TAYLOR I was a clerk in the office of Mr Collins No 33 Spital-square for fifteen years I left him at Christmas I know the prisoner perfectly well and I believe this letter to be his hand-writing Cross-examined by Mr CLARKSON Q How long have you known him A Five years last December I am sorry to say that he has been given to drink for the last two or three years but he has had considerable sums of money of mine and I have found him honest Letter read SIR - The occurrences of the other evening are still fresh in my recollection to what the relate a moments reflection will present or in other words an attempt most deliberately made by you of a most disgusting and abominable character which my resistance and the dread you apprehended of an exposure rendered abortive any thing short would have rendered me equally culpable as yourself Much as I have heard that there are in existence creatures bearing the outward form of men and addicted to those bestial propensities I had nevertheless in a great measure discredited such realities until the affair of Wednesday morning unveiled that doubt and awakened the too horrible conviction that I had at length unhappily fallen into the hands of one of the detested advocates and perpetrators of a crime loathsome and abhorrent and in one too of all others on whose unsullied reputation this every thing is staked and dependant entirely upon public opinion for patronage support and protection The circumstances under which it was at tempted I need not here detail being of so gross and flagrant a description that the recollection of them can never be dislodged from my memory indeed I have not been well since and on the most serious and mature deliberation and I have not been hasty in forming my resolution that it is but a right to which decency has a privilege to enforce that so during and insulting an outrage should be submitted to magisterial investigation for the effectual suppression of advice of the blackest die unpardonable an the eyes of Heaven and horrifying in those of men I thought it right however are I proceed to extremities to put you in possession of my resolution with a view to your being sufficiently impressed with a proper sense of the situation in which you have placed yourself your character and reputation - it is I say for you to consider and weigh well the consequences how you stand and how your interest may he effected not only as it regards your moral character as a christian individually but in your public and accountable capacity as a licenced victualler will fall under the servest lash of well deserved reprehension and subject yourself to the contempt of all your friends your family connexions and the derision of the world Should I repeat it this affair once get buzzed abroad that the worthy host had himself made an attempt of the kind and with fastened doors securely and carefully barrid by his own hand under his own dwelling a licenced receptacle for refreshment and entertainment in the hearing of his own family and servants and that upon the person of an occasional visitor unwarily entrapped within his fangs the name of Hemingway would become as odious as the wretched miscreants who but a few moments since expiated their crimes amidst the execrations of thousands Upon deep consideration of the purport of this letter which I have sent to you in private not wishing to risk the possibility of its falling into other hands than your own by the post You must be aware of the very perilous precipice on which you stand and it is by your answer for me to know whether you wish to hazard the result of the affair being made public by an application to the Magistrate for a warrant it being a criminal charge and of a capital nature my deposition must be registered on oath to obtain that document for your apprehension which when once done you will only have yourself to blame nothing on my part can afterwards he allowed to impede the regular course of justice Need I say more to point out clearly to you the rain that must be the inevitable consequence of disclosure The affair as yet I pledge myself is unknown to any mortal on earth even my own wife has not had the slightest intimation of the matter Is it not for your interest character and peace of mind to let it remain so How many in your fine in your neighbourhood would glory at your shame and exult in your disgrace on your character as the proprietor of a house peculiarly privileged yet under peculiar restrictions depends every thing the hazardous speculation in which you have embarked must fall into ruins in the estimation of its frequenters The probable suspension of your licence may be the disasterous result and independent of the awful consequences attendant on conviction and placed at a criminal bar on a charge of so revolting a nature must mar for ever your future prospects - your credit with your brewers and distillers would be fast upon the wane and you will never regain that respect which your condition in life otherwise entitles you to but entail upon a rising family a dreadful stigma which time can never destroy I am Sir your obedient Servant J T MORGAN 1 Sydney-street Mile-end 16th December 1831 P S The bearer of this will wait your convenience to bring back your answer if you wish any reasonable time to do it in say so and send the letter inclosed privately to me either at my house or 35 Spital-square Norton-falgate MR ADOLPHUS to MR HEMINGWAY Q What passed between you and the bearer of the letter A I called him and said Have you any knowledge of the person who sent me the letter he said He is a lawyer in Spital-square I said Oh dear or Dear me or God bless me he has sent me a letter of a very disgraceful nature and wishes me to give him an answer - how to give him one I do not know tell the person to call upon me he went away and in less than a quarter of an hour the bearer of the letter and the prisoner came to my house - the bearer came in and said I was wanted outside I went outside and saw a very about man - I advanced towards him and said Do you want me Sir he said No the prisoner came into my house in a very few minutes - I had told the messenger to tell him tocome in I was in my parlour - the prisoner opened the door and said he wished to speak to me privately I took him up stairs into the saloon where the concerts are held - he then said he had sent me a letter and began to accuse me of the guilt of the letter he said I have sent you a letter and I shall accuse you of the whole of it I said For what and began to talk to him respecting what I had read of it he said I was guilty - he did not say of what but he alluded very strongly to a base purpose he said he should abide by what he had written - I replied I have never insulted you in my house nor any other person to my knowledge I told him I could swear it and would swear it which I did and asked him if he thought I was an Atheist or a Deist - he said No I then lifted my hand with a firm resolution hit my hand on the table and said So help me God and so help me Jesus Christ you never was insulted in this house by me or by any other person or may 1 drop he said my swearing would have no effect he was a lawyer and his oath would be taken but mine could not only by evidence which I could not obtain - he then began to talk of my credit with my brewer and distiller and how glad my neighbours would be to hear of it this was on Saturday evening - he said there was a better was of setting it if I would give him something in the shape of a 10l note not even his own wife nor any creature upon earth should know it I told him I was not prepared to give him 10l but to call again some night next week - he proposed Tuesday I said that was a concert night he had better make it Monday - he agreed to call on Monday he said he would walk into my parlour and call for a pint of porter or ale till I saw him - he begged of me not to show the letter to my wife or any other person but I do not remember that he said why - he then left and I went below to my parlour Mr Hickmott was there and before he went away Mr Perry came I made an arrangement with Mr Perry for the Monday evening on Monday evening I saw the prisoner again - Mr Perry was there in a small anti-room between the club-room and the saloon he was there in pursuance of our arrangement - the prisoner came into the parlour and called for a pint of ale I came down when I heard the bell ring once and the prisoner walked up stairs with me - Mr Perry was then in the gallery of the saloon and the prisoner was in the saloon under the gallery just at the edge of it so that he might be seen a person in the gallery could hear the conversation in the saloon and see the person if he thought proper I said to the prisoner My good man you ask me 10l for what I am not guilty of - it is a deal of money to give away for nothing knowing myself not to be guilty nor nothing like it or words to that effect I am a family man the father of ten children and I have a good wife - you must have made a mistake when you left my house and gone somewhere else he said No he had not - I said You must have gone somewhere else - I will allow you might he in liquor and probably went to a bawdy-house he said No I did not I said There or somewhere else you must he said I did not by God Then said I I will say no more but for my own peace of mind allow me to ask you one or two questions - Did you after you bade me good night return to my house again he said Certainly not Sir Did we pass five words together during the whole time or the whole night while you were in my parlour with me he said Not on this business but on commercial business we did I then said Can you suppose or think in your own mind that I am a man who would he guilty of so abominable a crime as you formally accuse me of he made some reply but he moved somehow at the time and I did not distinctly hear it but I think it was No in a low tone of voice - I put the question and did not care about his answer I said If you will walk into my anti-room which is private I will endeavour to get you 5l he said nothing less than 10l would do - I showed him into the anti-room where there was a little fire but no light in going down stairs to get a light I saw Mr Perry at the bottom of the stairs without his shoes there was no light in the saloon COURT Q Then how could Mr Perry see any person there A He was close to the window which would show a light - there was no lamp outside but you might see the shadow of a man s person I could see the top of the table plain enough MR ADOLPHUS Q What did you say to Mr Perry when you saw him without his shoes A I asked him to walk up stairs as I had a word or two to say to him - I showed him into the anti-room where the prisoner was and asked him if he had any knowledge of the prisoner s person the prisoner and myself were the only persons who had been in the saloon while Mr Perry was in the gallery I am quite certain of that - Mr Perry said Yes he had a knowledge of him from last Tuesday evening the prisoner then said Yes sir I think I have a knowledge of you I remember you - I then said to Mr Perry This person has accused me of a very bad crime Mr Perry said Indeed I then put out my arm pointing to Mr Perry but could not recollect his name though I had said it a minute before - I said Mr - Mr - he said Perry - I said How to tell you I cannot tell - the prisoner said I thought you were acquainted but I perceive you are not as you don t know his name and as you seem determined on its being made known if you don t begin allow me I said Yes any body but me - the prisoner then began to tell Mr Perry in some sort of way of my ill usage to him and said I had acknowledged to it within the last five minutes Mr Perry said Indeed sir I did not make any remark - Mr Perry then said Before you go any further allow me to ask what might your name be and the prisoner said as far as I can recollect that his name was John Thomas Morgan And pray where do you live sir he told him as far I can recollect at No I Sydney-street Mr Perry then rose from his chair and said Then John Thomas Morgan you are a d-d infernal liar you are no man and have not an once of man s flesh about you - I then said to him You are a thief you are a robber - you are a murderer you have robbed me of my peace of mind upon hearing the noise my wife came up and begged me not to be in a passion - the prisoner then went on his knees raised up his hands and repeated what he had said to Mr Perry that I had acknowledged to it within the last five minutes Q Had you acknowledged to it A May I be a corpse in the presence of God if I did I did not - I could not we then all left the room - the regular officer whoI have there on all occasions when I have company was in the passage and I said to him Take this fellow or man into custody and I went with him before the Magistrate WILLIAM PERRY I am a plasterer and live at No 8 Turner-street White Horse-lane Stepney I was at the prosecutor s house on the night of the concert on the 13th of December I saw the prisoner there - I was not much in Mr Hemingway s company that evening I was not sitting with him the prisoner sat on my left hand from the time he came into the parlour till we left the parlour together the prisoner was not alone in the parlour with Mr Hemingway at any one moment till we went away together the prisoner and I were the last persons in the house- he was after me but close to me I opened the door and he followed me - we were the last two persons in the house - when we got out I went to the right and he went to the left I saw him go beyond the house and bade him good night - I heard Mr Hemingway fasten the door of his house before I bade him good night in consequence of what Mr Hemingway said to me I went on Monday evening into the gallery of the concert-room I think it was from eight to half-past eight o clock - while I was there Hemingway and the prisoner came into the concert-room there was no light in the room for me to see the prisoner but I knew him by his voice - I heard the conversation which passed between them I was there for that purpose and had taken off my shoes that I might make no noise- when they came in Mr Hemingway said My good man you ask me for 10l which is a great deal of money and you know that I am not guilty he said I am a man of family the father of ten children you must have been mistaken and gone somewhere else - the prisoner said he had not he said You must the prisoner said No by G-d I did not I went straight home - Mr Hemingway said nothing further on that subject but he said Do I look like a man that you would suspect of being guilty of any thing of the like the prisoner said Certainly not Mr Hemingway then said If you will retire with me into the anti-room I will go down and see if I can get you up 5l the prisoner said Nothing less than 10l will do they left that room and went into the anti-room - I then came from where I was and met Mr Hemingway on the stairs I had not then put on my shoes - I then went into the anti-room Mr Hemingway introduced me to the prisoner and asked if I knew that gentleman I said certainly I did from what had occurred on the Tuesday previous - he said Here is a very awkward circumstance occurred here with me I said What might it be he said Upon my word I can t tell you he said Mr - Mr - Mr - I said Perry is my name the prisoner said I see you are not very well acquainted if you will allow me I will tell Hemingway said Any one but me - the prisoner then said that Mr Hemingway had put his arm round his neck kissed him gone down on his knees unbuttoned his breeches and behaved in an indecent manner to him on the Tuesday evening I said Is it possible that he has done this he said Yes and he had owned it within the last five minutes I said You will excuse me what is your name he said John Thomas Morgan Q Had Hemingway owned any thing of the kind A No certainly not - I then rose up from my chair and said You are a d-d infernal rascal and have not a bit of man s flesh about you - out of this house you shall not go but under the protection of an officer Mr Hemingway then began to call him a rogue a liar and a rascal in a high tone of voice and stamped with his feet Mrs Hemingway came up and begged her husband not to be in a passion as he had got everything provided I then desired her to leave the room but prior to her coming up the prisoner fell on his knees and called his God to witness that what he said was true Mr Hemingway followed his wife down - the prisoner followed him and I followed him I took hold of his coat and gave him in charge of the officer Cross-examined by Mr CLARKSON Q Were you at the house between the Tuesday and the Saturday A Yes I went there one night and was there on the Saturday night I suppose as late as twelve o clock I have seen Dr Newman - he is not here I went on the Saturday night about eight o clock - I went there on the Sunday I first heard of this transaction on the Saturday about the time I went in I saw the letter - Mr Hemingway and I made an arrangement on the Sunday that I was to go into the gallery and that he would bring the prisoner into the saloon that I might hear what transpired and that he would put such questions to him as we thought proper and one was to ask whether he looked like a person who could be guilty of such an officer which the prosecutor did and the prisoner said No not at all he spoke that as loud as he did the rest - he did not say it in a muttered tone that the prosecutor could not hear I should think not I could hear it very plain - the prisoner was under the gallery the window was on my left hand and the prosecutor stood close against the window on one side of a table - I cannot tell which side the prisoner stood one was farther off than the other but I cannot say which was furthest - I had never seen the prisoner in my life till the Tuesday but I knew his voice by having so much conversation with him I cannot tell whether the answer the prisoner gave to the question whether the prosecutor was a man likely to commit such an offence was so low that Mr Hemingway could not hear it he was not a quarter the distance from the prisoner that I was - I should consider he must have heard it - whether he paid any attention to it I cannot say he might be in that state of mind that he could not pay attention to every word - we had prepared an officer below the same officer was in the habit of attending the house - I was perfectly sober on the Monday evening I had only had a glass of gin and water while we were waiting for the prisoner I was sober on the Saturday evening - I was not drunk on the Tuesday I might be rather fresher than I was on the other two nights - I had taken more than I generally do I swear the prisoner left the house that night at the time I did and Hemingway and him were not alone any time that evening - I had not lost sight of them they did not change their room after they came from the concert-room they were in the parlour and they were not alone there JOHN STANFORTH I am a constable I am in the habit of attending Mr Hemingway s concert-room I never recollect seeing the prisoner till one Monday evening I forget the day of the month I was sent for on the Sunday evening to be there at half-past five o clock and I staid till past eight THOMAS DREW I am an inspector of Police The prisoner was delivered to my custody on Monday the 19th of December about nine o clock at night I took from him this paper - he said Here is the copy of a letter or the letter I cannot be certain which RICHARD TILLVER BLUNT I was at the concert at the prosecutor s rooms on the 13th of December I noticed the prisoner and the prosecutor - they were present part of the time I saw them in the parlour - there were other persons present there I recollect some jobes passing WILLIAM CASEY I was at the concert-room I staid there pretty late and then went into the parlour - I saw the prisoner and the prosecutor there was no moment in which they were alone CHARLES MOODY I was in the parlour I do not know whether I was in the concert-room the room was nearly full - there was no moment in which they were alone Prisoner s Defence My Lord and Gentlemen - When you shall hear the strict and undeviating line of honesty which I have hit her to pursued with oredit to myself and satisfaction to my employers I trust that you will not suppose that I would all at once invent and write a letter involving such consequences as it does my prosecutor has undeavoured to support his own case and blacken mine but in the eyes of God he is the only guilty man - the letter was written in my own hand and subscribed with my own name and residence - the bearer was ordered to answer any questions on my first interview with the prosecutor be expressed his earnest desire to have it made up and appointed me to meet him on the Monday when he placed the witness in ambush to get rid of the adium himself and to place it on any shoulders when the inspector asked what I had I voluntary took out the copy or draft from which I took the letter with only a few verbal alterations Did this look Like guilt Should I not have destroyed it if I had been guilty Whatever may be the consequence of this prosecution I have not acted designedly wrong if I have erned in writing the letter instead of bringing the prosecutor to the bar of justice it was done in ignorance of the consequences of it Perry passes much of his time at the prosecutor s but it was utterly impossible that he could tell what took place between one and two o clock on the Wednesday morning he was intoxicated and might have gone out I had myself gone out once or twice and what inducement could he have to watch me away not a soul was moving in the horse when the prosecutor let one out at twenty minutes to two o clock and no eye but the eye of Omniscience was witness to what was done GUILTY Aged 32 -

I took him into a gin-shop and gave him 11/2d worth of gin - I paid for it and left the house and when he came out he asked me to give him something to eat I said I was but a servant and could not afford it but I lived close by and if he would come to the house I would see if there was any victuals and if there was I would give it to him I rang the bell and went to get him some broken victuals which was left for my supper I gave it to him -

that was on the 29th of June they told me had been - and he came again about eleven o clock and I asked how he dare come at that time of night - he asked me to lend him a sovereign I refused and said I knew nothing of him he said he had heard of a situation and wished to get a few things - I refused and almost shut the door in his face and told my fellow-servant if he came again I would kick him away from the door - he has annoyed me ever since I relieved him last Monday he came first about five o clock and asked me to lend him money I said I would not and told him not to come to me again he came again in less than two minutes and put this letter into my hand and said he had somebody waiting for him and would call on Wednesday for an answer between twelve and one o clock I opened it and showed it to Clark my fellow-servant - I afterwards showed it to the officer looking at the letter I can swear this is the letter Prisoner Q Can you deny that I never stopped in the house all night one Friday last January until Saturday morning I went into the house and stopped there all night and came out in the morning at half-past seven o clock - I was going along the young man came up to me at a picture shop and jogged me by the arm he went away - I followed him he said It is a very fine night is not it and said Are you going this way I said yes he said We will walk together and he asked me to drink he walked down Blackfriar s-bridge to Bankside and there he committed what was highly improper he put my hand into his trousers and said he thought it was not safe in the street but he would let me in for the night if I chose soon after we went over the bridge into a house and came out with an old lady dressed in black - he said Come along she is quite deaf and cannot hear a word he went with her to Great-turnstile and he did a similar thing and when he got to his house he said I cannot let you in the family are not all in bed if you will wait and knock at the pantry window over the door when you see a light there I shall be there - I waited and saw a light and the watchman asked me the time I said it was about twelve o clock the prosecutor said Go round to the front door and I will open it - I went he said Take off your shoes - I did so he went into the second door he said I must put the chain up to the door he went in the kitchen and said Will you mind having something to eat and brought me slice of bread and cold mutton - I eat about a mouthful of it and left the rest till morning he let down the bedstead out of the wardrobe and we went to bed - I awoke about half-past seven o clock we got up I eat the rest of the mutton and went out and that night he did similar to what he did before Prosecutor I never went further with him than the shop to give him the drink Prisoner You took the old lady to Turnstile she asked who I was and you said I was a friend of somebody named Sard Prosecutor The old lady I took to Little-turnstile not Great-turnstile - it was her son s I relieved him before I took the old lady home - I took her to Princes-street I never on my oath let him into my master s house no let him pass the night in the same room as myself Prisoner I can describe the room to you Prosecutor He came and asked me if I was alarmed one night about eleven o clock going to bed if I hadheard somebody at my pantry window I said I did and had heard them use very bad expressions and I called my fellow servant up - I never let him in further than the passage - when he came to the end of the passage I gave him the mutton and sent him off - he did not stop in the house five minutes - he came to the pantry window I asked how he dare take the liberty he said he saw the light and supposed it was me going to bed and a person saw him get up and look into the room and anybody looking through there can look over my room Prisoner He said to me in the morning You can call sometimes when you are at leisure and I called three times and I asked him first to lend me sixpence he said he had not got less than a sovereign I said then he could not lend it to me he said he was obliged to maintain an old mother after that I was going down Holborn I saw a young man who said Don t you know a person at No 10 New-street at the King s printing-office I said I did he said His name is Robert if you will have the goodness when you go there to take a note for me and there is 6d for yourself and he gave me this letter Prosecutor It is false he says I went to Great-turnstile with the old lady I took her to Princes-street - he said the man s name was Bennett who gave him the letter and he would bring him forward Prisoner A young man asked me if I knew the young man living in Shoe-lane - a lowish young man and if I would take the letter he would give me something to drink I asked him what sort of a letter it was he said nothing particular he should stay outside till I took it and he did he stood opposite on the other side of the way while I took it in and the prosecutor asked me who that young man was Prosecutor On my oath I did not ask him who the young man was I did not see any young man Prisoner He asked repeatedly who he was the young man stood close to the door that was the person who gave me the letter for him he said There you can take the letter now and I went and gave him the letter and staid until he read it and he said I have not got any money if you want any recompense for what I have done why not ask for it in an open way I said I did not write the letter he said who did - I said Why that young man there - he says if you don t give him money he shall send somebody for it he had said If you will call on Wednesday between twelve and one I will give you 5s that is all I can spare I said That is the young man who sent the letter he said I know nothing of him and when I went out the young man was gone I asked where he lived he said in Cromer-street but it is said no such person lives there Prosecutor He did not tell me he received it from another young man nor that a young man was waiting Prisoner He asked me who sent the note and said I will give you 5s if you will come on Wednesday Prosecutor I never opened the note till he was gone he said he would leave it and he or somebody would call on Wednesday between twelve and one o clock I showed the note to a young man and asked him if I had not better have an officer in attendance He said by all means and my brother-in-law wished me to go to the Lard Mayor I went but it was not office hours the prisoner came for the money and was apprehended when he came to the door I asked him to come in he would not I asked him again he would not and then I asked him what he wanted of me and he asked for some recompense for what I had done Prisoner Did you not say you would give me some recompense for what you had done A Never on my oath- he told the Lord Mayor Bennett wrote the letter letter read for which see indictment WILLIAM MARCHANT I am superintendant of the nightly watch The prosecutor came to the Mansion-house last Tuesday evening and showed me the letter - I consulted the Lord Mayor about it and he desired me to take the man into custody I went to the house about eleven o clock on Wednesday morning and staid till about half-past twelve when the prisoner came to the door and the prosecutor said Come in he asked him twice he refused to come in he then said What is it you want of me he said I want some money for what you have done to me and at that moment I went and took him I examined the outer part of the house which leads to the prosecutors bed-room - any body could get up by laying hold of the rails and see all over the room when he was going to bed he don t shut the window shutters because there is a dead wall facing his bedroom and he says he never shuts his shutters because it should not be dark in the morning his bed does open with folding doors right opposite the window anybody can see it by looking in at the window I did not ask the prisoner any questions I delivered him to another officer I knew nothing of him before Prisoner There is no iron rails that side of the house and it is too high to reach without a ladder the foot of the bed comes nearly to the window there is folding doors in the counter and two cupboards on each side of the fire place Witness Anybody can see over the window with the greatest ease and see all over the room Prisoner There is no hole in the wall where any body can put their foot in and get up Witness The window is about five feet ten from the floor anybody laying hold of the window to raise themselves up can see it Prisoner There are spikes outside Witness That I don t know I tried myself to get up to the window and did and could see with case all over the room Prisoner You could not see inside the kitchen by looking in at that window for the kitchen is not in sight Witness The kitchen lies on the left the prosecutor sleeps on the right a person can see all over his bed room Prisoner I could not get up there I was not out of the house till half-past seven in the morning JURY to MARCHANT Q Did you go into the young man s bed-room A Yes I did and then viewed it from the outside - the bedstead opens with folding doors and lies down right opposite the window Prisoner I could see the drawers which are under the beadstead there are two large drawers under the bedstead and I could not see them when the bed was down - nobody could see them because the bedstead being down would hide them WILLIAM MARCHANT Before the bed is let down they can be seen but after the bed is down I should say they could not be seen Prisoner I could not see into the kitchen which wasfacing the door it is on the ground-floor there is very large old fashioned clock there Witness There is a Dutch clock in the kitchen Prisoner I was at the kitchen door when he fetched the light to go into his room Witness The clock could be seen from the kitchen door Prisoner s Defence I can say nothing further than I have said which is all perfectly true and what the young man says is perfectly false every syllable of it - I saw nobody when I left the house but when I went home I was asked where I had been all night and I said I had been at Paddington - my mother asked where I had been to - I said I had been to a theatre at Paddington - the officer says I asked for money when I went - I said I wanted some recompense for what he had done - I never mentioned money WILLIAM MARCHANT When the bell was rang the prosecutor went and opened the door and said Come in and he said No I wont come in he asked him twice he would not come in and he then said What do you want with me - he said I want some money from you for a recompense for what you have done to me Prisoner I rang the bell the young man asked me to walk in and I said I would rather not being in a hurry he said You had better walk in and I said no I would not and he said What do you want with me I said I wanted some recompense for what he had done the officer said walk in and I went in the parlour and the officer said You are in custody I said very well WILLIAM MARCHANT I took him into the parlour certainly and my brother officer who was with me said You are in custody Prisoner When I was in the parlour a woman came in and began kicking up a row and when I went on the Saturday night they said he was out and would not be home till late and when I saw him he said I should not have come so late he said When you come this way you can call again and he has made one or two appointments to meet me WILLIAM MARCHANT The maid servant certainly did call him a brute GUILTY Aged 16 -

t18341016-15  1489 HENRY LAST alias Smith was again indicted for that he on the 1st of October at St Botolph without Aldgate feloniously did deliver to Robert Alexander Collins a letter demanding money of him with menaces and without any reasonable or probable cause which letter is as follows - Sir - With my friends wishes I again write to you concerning the money which I have received of you which is 2l Sir I should thank you to give me a final answer and that is whether you intend to give me the full amount of my loss which is more than you may think for The clothes which my uncle bought me for the sea amount to 2l 4s my wages 3l 15s the full amount 5l 19s Now Sir it is determined by myself and my uncle if the money is not paid some time this week he will write for the captain to come to London if such should be the case it will cost you 20l besides disgrace you for ever but Sir my uncle do not now who it is nor shall he now if all things go wright to my mind but i shall expect to have the full amount Sir the captain have wrote to my uncle concerning the villainy that some person or persons have been guilty of as the case is something similur to that of Mr Barnes and the soldiers Sir i can assure you unless you pay me the full amount something serious will occur but i should be very sorry for such a thing as it very possibly might ruin you for ever but Sir perhaps you would rather pay a little than pay a great dell but you can please yourself and act as you please but by God almighty if the money is not paid me by three o clock to-morrow afternoon dread the consequences 3l 19s is my demand I remain your humble servant Henry Smith - against the Statute &c 2nd COUNT like the first only calling the letter a certain writing MR CLARKSON conducted the Prosecution ROBERT ALEXANDER COLLINS I am a ship-chandler and live in East Smithfield I never saw the prisoner to my knowledge before the 23rd of September - on the 1st of October I was in the neighbourhood of the Minories and saw him there waiting at the corner evidently watching my coming out of Mr Richardson s the grocer s shop - he came up to me and put this letter into my hand - I read it in his presence and said to him I thought you told me you were going into the country - he said he had been advised not to go - I made an appointment to meet him again in Fenchurch-street that afternoon - this was about ten o clock in the morning - I then proceeded to the Thames police-office and saw Mr Ballantyne the magistrate and in consequence of directions I obtained there I went into the City and Herdsfield was sent with me - I marked a sovereign - I met the prisoner in Fenchurch-street at three o clock - I went up to him and said You are here waiting - he said Yes - I said What a villain you must be to give me this trouble - he only laughed at me - I put the marked sovereign into his hand - Herdsfield then came up and took him into custody - I gave him the sovereign under the decided impression of fear - it was arranged that he should be taken into custody by my giving him the marked sovereign - I had no apprehension when I parted with the sovereign because he was to be taken into custody - I never supposed he would take any step for the purpose of extorting money - I gave him that sovereign for the purpose of having him taken into custody - I was under no apprehension The letter was here read for which see the indictment Cross-examined by MR JONES Q When was the first time you saw the prisoner A The 23rd of September was the first time to the best of my knowledge that I ever saw him in my life - I swear that positively - I am a ship-chandler and have a warehouse - I never gave permission to any person whatever to sleep in that warehouse Q In the early part of this year for instance did you happen to meet with any sailors or others in a destitute condition A Not to my knowledge - I meet with such persons every day - I was never applied to to allow persons to sleep there - I have been applied to for relief almost every day by persons of one sort or another - I never told any body that I had seen the prisoner before - I swear positively I never spoke to the prisoner before in my life and never saw him to my knowledge - I never gave him permission to sleep in my warehouse never at any time in my life - I never gave him any money before the 23rd of September - I never gave him any bread and cheese nor any victuals Q Did you ever say to him If you come about half-past nine or ten o clock I will let you in but do not let any of my people see you stand about the gateway but walk up and down on the other side of the way and when the shop is closed you can walk through A Never - I do not know a person named Dixon nor John Pettigrew that I know of - not by name - I never gave money or victuals to the prisoner before September nor any articles of clothing to my knowledge - I will swear positively I never gave him a waistcoat or any thing - I did not go into my warehouse between four and five o clock one morning in July and see any persons who had been sleeping there Q Did you on any morning in July say to any person in your warehouse Put up the rug and things in the same state as you found them otherwise my servants may suspect that somebody has been sleeping there A Never - I have no such things in my warehouse - I never said so to the prisoner nor any thing like that overnight to any body - I never to my knowledge saw the prisoner till he put the first letter into my hand - I never gave permission to the prisoner and another young man to sleep in the warehouse nor on any boxes there - I never told him or any person that before he left the warehouse in the morning after he slept there he must look out to see if the watchman was off his beat Q I understand you to say you never on any occasion attempted to take any liberty with this man A Decidedly not - he never said to me Come Sir this will not do for me - I never said to him I hope you will not take any notice of what has occurred and gave him 6d - not give him biscuits and cheese saying Take this I hope you will never notice what has occurred MR CLARKSON Q Did you authorize any body to go to the attorney for the prosecution to see the letters in this case A Never - the person now standing behind the Counsel came to see them - I told him they were in the hands of my solicitor - I never authorized him to go and see them - I have a shopman named William Walker - Manning is my porter - he does not keep the keys of the warehouse - it is his duty to lock it up at night and open it in the morning - I never saw the prisoner to my knowledge till the 23d of September - there is not the slightest foundation for these abominable insinuations MR JONES Q Did you not give the prisoner authority to go to your solicitor to see the letters and give him the name and number of the street A I told him the street he resided in - he said Oh that is where Mr Harmer formerly lived - but I never gave him permission to go to see the letters THOMAS HERDSFIELD I am a City officer In consequence of information I went on the 1st of October with the prosecutor to Fenchurch-street - he had previously marked a sovereign - the prisoner was sitting on the step of a door in the street - the prosecutor went up to him and he rose up - I saw something put into the prisoner s hands and I took him into his custody - I found a sovereign in his right hand which I produce - I have had it ever since - he would not at first give the sovereign up but I said he must Cross-examined Q Did any words pass between Mr Collins and the prisoner A Not in my hearing - I saw something pass but I cannot tell what it was JURY Q In what state of mind was Mr Collins when he left you to give the sovereign A Much the same as he is now - he was not alarmed that I could see MR COLLINS This is the same sovereign THOMAS MANNING I am porter to Mr Collins and have the care of the warehouse from six o clock in the morning until nine o clock at night and sometimes later when we are busy - after locking up the warehouse I goand hang the keys up in the shop - I never knew the prisoner to sleep in the warehouse - he could not have gone into the warehouse while I had charge of it - I have been in Mr Collins employ about two years Cross-examined Q You lock the warehouse at night and hang the keys in the shop where your master can have access to them A I always hang them in the shop - the shopman mostly has the keys - my master can get to them at any time - I shut the shutters and the shopman locks the shop doors - I shut the warehouse up - the gates of the warehouse lead into the street Q Is there a passage through the house or shop into the warehouse A There is a yard - if I had taken the keys home with me and my master wanted to get to the warehouse he could not have got to it from the shop without breaking locks open as the place was bolted and locked- the yard door was padlocked and bolted - the key was along with the other keys - if my master took the key of the padlock he could get into the warehouse without going into the street MR CLARKSON Q Does Walker the shopman sleep on the premises A Yes - the prisoner never slept in the warehouse to my knowledge - Walker and I once let in a young baker who was destitute unknown to our master - we let him in twice but unknown to master - nobody ever slept there to my knowledge except in those two instances - we let the baker out on both occasions in the morning unknown to master - nobody else was ever let in to sleep or be there any part of the night to my knowledge MR JONES Q You never told your master of it at all A Never up to this moment - this is the first time I have mentioned it in his presence - he has never asked if any body slept there - I locked the young man in the loft before I went home and let him out in the morning for he had no place to go to MR CLARKSON Q Had you any motive for letting him sleep there except from motives of charity knowing he was destitute A None whatever WILLIAM WALKER I have been shopman to Mr Collins eighteen or twenty months The warehouse keys are placed in the shop after Manning has locked it up - I sleep on the premises every night on the floor between the shop and warehouse - a passage leads by the head of my bed to the warehouse - a poor baker was allowed to sleep in the warehouse two nights unknown to master - I know of nobody else ever sleeping on the premises during the time I have been there - I have slept there ever since I was in his service - nobody could have been brought to sleep in the warehouse without my knowledge - nobody except the baker ever slept in the warehouse or loft Cross-examined Q What time did you generally go to bed A From ten to half-past eleven - the porter locks the warehouse up and hangs the keys up in the shop and I lock the shop up - I am not in the habit of going out on business for my master in the day time - my duty is in the shop - I was never out during the day in July last - never for an instant - I take my meals up in the parlour - I never go out with bills or to collect accounts - we give no trust - I have a holiday on Sunday - I am about the warehouse- it is impossible that a person could be introduced into the warehouse in the course of the evening without my knowledge - I look over the warehouse every night before it is locked up - it is impossible persons could sleep there - they must come through the side door by the shop - the gates are not open in the day time only when a truck is going out- we go through a small door to go out through the passage out of the shop Q Must you necessarily and unavoidably go through the shop to get to the warehouse in the daytime A Yes - if the truck is going out the porter puts it out at the gate and returns through the shop - the gate is wide enough to admit a cart - several trucks stand there belonging to different tradesmen in the parish - they can come for their trucks without my knowledge but our place has no communication with that - the gate has nothing to do with it - the yard has cottages up it - upon going through the gate I could not go into the warehouse without going through the shop - I get up at six o clock in the morning - my master gets up about seven or eight - I never knew him to get up earlier than half-past six o clock - I never found him up when I got up - it is impossible for any body to pass from the shop without my hearing them at any time of night - the keys of the warehouse are locked up in the shop and the key of the shop is in my pocket all night - I first saw the prisoner when he was at the Mansion-house - I never saw him about the warehouse nor in the street - it is a street of extensive traffic - I am always in the shop or from the shop to the door - we have a window looking into the street - I attend to my business in the shop - I never told my master about the young baker up to this moment- I never had any conversation with him about this prosecution - he told me to attend here and at the Mansion-house - I went to be a witness if I should be required - I have not had a word of conversation with him on the subject of the prosecution Prisoner s Defence The prosecutor gave me clothes before I went to sea - he has given me clothes several times to go to sea with and several times he has given me victuals when he has seen me stopping about and three nights he gave me leave to sleep in his loft with a young man who is at sea - when I took him the letters before he looked at the first letter he gave me 2s and told me to meet him in the afternoon and he would give me a sovereign - before he gave me a sovereign he took me into a gin-shop and called for a quartern of gin which he gave me and told me if I met him at three o clock he would give me the sovereign - he gave me another on the Friday and then he shook hands with me and bid me good bye and told me to go home and send a brace of partridges and a hare up to him for a present and he would give me more money at another time as trade was very bad with him he did not take 5s in a day - he shook hands with me and bid me good bye and said he hoped I should not trouble him any more yet - I went home when I gave him the last letter I told him I would take him before my uncle- he said Very well meet me at three o clock at the same place - I was waiting for him there - he came to me and offered me a sovereign which I refused at first and he pressed me to take it - he said I will make it up 5l to you but I can give you only this sovereign at present - instead of his going with me to my uncle he went round to the Mansion-house and brought an officer and took meinto custody - he pressed on me not to let the charge be known and he would be a good friend to me JAMES DIXON I live in East Smithfield and get my living by selling things in the street fruit and oysters sometimes - I keep a stall - I know Mr Collins s shop and warehouse and know Mr Collins - I have seen Mr Colling as he passed the prisoner nod to him and ask him if he had any thing in view - this was about the month of July last just close to my stall opposite St Katharine s dock gates about one hundred yards from Mr Collins warehouse - I have seen this occur numbers of times as he passed my stall - one morning as I was coming from market I saw Collins give the prisoner some rashers of bacon and some biscuits I have frequently seen him nod to the prisoner and ask if he had any thing in view MR CLARKSON Q How long have you been acquainted with the prisoner A It was about the beginning of July that I first saw him - I have no acquaintance with his family - I do not believe he lived at any place in particular in July - he did not keep a stall - I believe he was destitute - I live in May-pole-court opposite St Katharine s gates - I am married - my wife gets her living in the same way that I do - she keeps no stall - she stops at the Marquis of Granby - I deal in every thing as it comes in season - the person standing behind the Counsel is the prisoner s uncle as far as I know - I believe it was this day week that I first saw him - he called on me - I only knew the prisoner by seeing him sitting on the steps by the side of an empty house where my stall is with the lumpers - I did not know where he lived - I never told him where I lived - I cannot tell whether he knew nor how the uncle found his way to my house - I can write - I do not write letters - I was not at my stall to-day nor yesterday - I have been at work as a bricklayer s labourer for my landlord Mr Hurn No 1 May-pole-court for the last three weeks -

I never beat a carpet in my life except when I was a gentleman s servant - I cannot exactly mention the last day I was at the stall at St Katharine s dock gates - I have been there within the last two months selling oysters ever since they have been in - when the prisoner s uncle and brother called they asked me if I remembered two young men at the dock gates countrymen being about there - I told him I did - he asked how long it was since I saw them - I said To the best of my knowledge about three months since I saw one of them - he asked if it was Henry - I said I did not know their names they were quite strangers I only knew them by asking where they lived and where they came from at different times - he asked if I ever knew him sleep at Mr Collins s warehouse - I said I never did - he asked how long it was since I saw him last - I said to the best of my knowledge about three months when the prisoner went away from the dock gate he told me he had got a schooner and was going away - the uncle asked if I knew where he went to when he left the dock gates - I told him he told me he had got a schooner which laid in the London docks - I do not recollect saying any thing else - the uncle asked if I had ever seen him speaking to Mr Collins - I told him that I did - he did not say any thing to me about a letter - the gentleman who was with him spoke about a letter but not to me - Mr Garrett told me the day before yesterday what the charge was against him - he did not mention the letter to me the day he first called to the best of my knowledge - the uncle mentioned about the letter to the young gentleman who was with him - when they questioned me I heard the uncle say that the letter corresponded with what I said Q That was his nodding and asking him if he had any thing in view A Yes they had no letter in their hands - I have got my living for the last three weeks by working for my landlord at 18s a-week - when I went to Mr Garrett on the Saturday he gave me 1s to get a drop of beer going home - I think it was last Saturday -

he gave me his direction where to call on him and I called - I believe the other witness who is coming is tollman to the London Dock Company - his name is Pettigrew - he has been always tollman there during the five years - I saw him first about this the day after Mr Garrett called on me - he came up and asked if a gentleman had been to me - I told him there had - Pettigrew did not go with me to Mr Garrett s house nor did we meet there - I have never been in Mr Collins s warehouse myself - I do not know that I am to receive any payment for attending here - I do not expect any - there was no promise made to me about it - I have not said I expected to be paid for my loss of time -

I have seen nothing else pass between them- I am sure the prisoner and Mr Collins are the same persons MR CLARKSON Q What was the expression A How do you get on - I never heard him say Have you any thing in view Q Did not he sometimes say Have you any thing in view Dixon says that is what he said A I might not have heard it when Dixon was there - I never heard it - I have known Dixon upwards of three years - I cannot say exactly - I have known him four five or seven years - I have not known him ten years - it may be between four and five years - I do not know any body belonging to the prisoner s family - I have seen him and another young fellow there when I was taking toll four or five months ago - he never said any thing to me about a letter which he had written - I never heard of it until this time Q Do you mean to say to-night is the first time you heard of a letter being sent written or delivered by him A Yes Mr Garrett his uncle has been to me in East Smithfield - I saw him yesterday evening in Back-church-lane at my residence - I first saw him about a fortnight ago - he came to me in East Smithfield at the toll place - I did not know him before - I do not know how he found me out - he never said a word about a letter - he talked to me and gave me a glass of ale at the Phoenix - he went there with me - we had a glass of ale together nothing else - I did not see him again till yesterday evening which was the second time I ever saw him in my life - he did not take down any thing I said to him - I do not know who is to pay me for coming here - I did not come for gain - God will I hope pay me for speaking the truth - I have never received any money from Garrett - I was in company with Dixon last night about half an hour at my house in Backchurch-lane - he came to the house at six o clock - this gentleman was with him Q If Dixon swore he never was in company with you and Garrett together is that true A At the door we were in company together and talked together - Garrett told me to come here at five o clock this evening - Garrett never mentioned the letter - I never heard what the prisoner was charged with nor for whom I was to appear nor what I was to say - the prosecutor sometimes nodded to the prisoner and sometimes said How do you get on - if he was in a hurry he would nod his head - if not he would say How do you get on JAMES GARRETT I am clerk to Mr Comyn the barrister and have been so twenty-six years - I am now in my twenty-sixth year The prisoner is a nephew of mine by marriage - I ascertained from the prisoner where Dixon lived - this was the day after he was committed and in consequence of that I went to his house - as far as Mr Collins has stated he is correct but he did not state all - Dixon has stated perfectly correct the interview I had with him - I went down to Mr Collins as I had not decided about doing any thing - I went down merely to know the nature of the charge - Mr Collins was not within - when I did see him I asked if he had got the letters - he said he had not that they were at his solicitor s who was Mr Wooller in Hatton-garden somewhere - I understood him to say No 30 and the name of Tomlins was on the side of the door - I went from his house to Mr Tomlins and found it was No 40 - I wished to know the nature of the charge and what it was - he then said Very well Sir you are quite at liberty to see them - I went to Mr Wooller but I have never seen them till I saw them in Court to-night - I never held out any promise of money to the witnesses to give evidence here - I told them over and over again it was not in my power to do any thing for the lad - that I had a very large family of my own and had not 1s to spare nor had either of his relatives - they said all they wished was to come and speak the truth - I gave Dixon 1s when he came up to identify the prisoner at the prison COURT Q How could you know you and he were speaking of the same person if he did not know who he was A The prisoner gave me a particular description of the persons for he did not know the names of any of them - he gave me a description of several persons whom I have not been able to find - they said they had seen two lads together but could not tell who it was till they saw the prisoner - I never gave Pettigrew any thing except the glass of ale MR CLARKSON Q Look at that letter whose writingis it A I do not think it is the prisoner s - I never saw his writing in my life till this occasion till I saw this statement which he gave me - looking at another letter I cannot tell whose writing this is - I have no knowledge about the handwriting - I think it is the prisoner s - I can pretty well say it is by the small i - it does bear the character of his handwriting - I think it must be his - I do not know why I should have any doubt about it - it is not exactly like the writing I have seen of his - I should say the first letter is the same handwriting but written with a different pen COURT Q Do you mean you never saw the prisoner s writing before to-day A I saw it in his statement which he sent me - I have spoken to him about his statement - I have been in Newgate with him several days - he said the statement was in his handwriting MR CLARKSON Q Now look at the first letter have you any doubt that is his handwriting A The character of it certainly is very similar to the statement I received from him - I believe it to be his handwriting - I think I need not have any doubt of it being his - they are written with different pens - I have known him since he was a boy - he has been voyages to sea and has been about in different situations within the last twelve months - at the beginning of this year he was some time in a public-house - he left that I think in the spring and then went into the country - he was there a little time and the next I heard of him was about Midsummer - I do not know how he got his living then - I do not know what he was doing in July until about the 21st September he returned to London from an eight weeks voyage - I only know that from his statement - he did not tell me where he had been - I did not write to the captain of his vessel to know about the villany practised - he has other uncles - he made no communication to me on this subject - he knew where I lived Q In July last did he complain to you that Collins or any body took him into their warehouse and attempted to practice indecencies on him A No - I knew where he lived - I never supplied him with clothes to go away with - he has an uncle or two about Ipswich - he did not come to me after he returned from the eight weeks voyage to complain of being ill-used by Mr Collins - I first heard a suggestion on his part on the subject of the prosecutor from receiving a letter from him when he was in Newgate - I never heard of the charge until he was fully committed - he did not send to say he was going before a magistrate - I went to Mr Tomlins office in Hatton-garden on the Saturday as the prisoner had been committed on Thursday- I represented to Mr Robinson that Mr Collins gave me permission to see the letters - Mr Robinson expressed the greatest readiness to show them but said they were gone to your chambers and he expected them back on the Thursday and that if I would call I should see them - I did not tell Mr Robinson I was his uncle and very likely he thought I was a friend of Mr Collins s - I called a second time at Mr Tomlins office - my nephew the prisoner s brother was with me then - when I went the second time I did not see Mr Robinson - I saw a clerk who said I am sorry Sir to find you come here with a falsehood for Mr Collins never authorized any body to see the letters MR JONES Q Have you or not been on habits of intimacy with the prisoner A When he has been in town he has called on us occasionally and had a meal JOHN PETTIGREW re-examined At the different times I saw the prisoner he was in company with another lad - I have seen him return what Mr Collins said by making a bow - that was all the notice he took - he did not say how he got on - Collins never stopped but went on - there were various persons about the gate - it was not addressed to any other person - I am satisfied it was addressed to the prisoner because he has told me with his own mouth that Mr Collins was good to him - that was before any charge was made to the prisoner Q In what way did he say he was good A By giving him victuals to eat at different times MR COLLINS re-examined It is occasionally my custom to give away broken victuals and biscuits at different times to poor people when I am clearing my shop I instruct my servant to give away what there is to poor people and if I am at home I do it myself - I sometimes know persons I give things to and sometimes I do not - sometimes five or six distressed sailors together apply for the damaged provisions - one person brings another - they do not require much introduction COURT to WALKER Q Have you a place called the loft A Yes - nobody slept there except the baker - the warehouse and loft are all one - I sleep in a room leading to the warehouse - the loft is an upper part of the warehouse - nobody can get to it without going through the warehouse Prisoner The witness is not Collins s shopman he is only backward and forward - there is him and another young man - there is a young man who has played the same tricks with a young man who was with me - Collins s man has served the same trick to a young man who is at sea JAMES ROBINSON I am clerk to Mr Tomlins who is attorney for this prosecution - I have known Mr Collins from eighteen months to two years and where he lives - we have had business from him during that time and this young man was serving in his shop with an apron on when I went there as if acting as shopman and he has been up to our office at times with messages from Mr Collins GUILTY -

any reasonable and probable cause MR CLARKSON conducted the Prosecution SIR ALEXANDER HOOD BART On the 10th of August I received this letter at Mr Green s hotel Prisoner Q Are you not aware of my relationship to you A No I am not aware that you had any expectation from Lady Briport—you have received money from me—you wrote me a begging letter—I received a letter from my relations at Brighton and in consequence I wrote this letter to Mr Green from Wooton—I know nothing about your letter to my sisters and my mother—I know you applied to them for money and was troublesome at the door COURT Q You are doubtful whether he is any relation to you A It is impossible that I can say—I thought him a dissolute person—he has had money from me and my family but was never acknowledged as a relation JAMES GREEN I am the proprietor of Green s Hotel in Serie-street—I received this letter from Sir Alexander Hood—the prisoner came to my house on Monday week he wished to have the letter read and my eldest son began to read part of it and the prisoner said Read the whole letter I will go down and horsewhip Sir Alexander well and after I have done that I will shoot him I will blow out his brains —I did not give him into custody then but I was sorry that I did nosy—he came again on the Wednesday and I gave him in charge—I had five him money by direction of Sir Alexander s family and had he conducted himself properly he would have had more—I know his handwriting—this letter and the envelope are both his writing Prisoner Q Have you given me money for Sir Alexander Hood A Yes and I think more than once—and I have given you money from Lord Hood—you many times conducted yourself very improperly at my house I thought at one time if you could have got a knife I should have felt it—I have seen your writing more than once and I remarked to my family that you wrote a good hand THOMAS READ I am a clerk in the Twopenny Post-office—this letter is addressed to Sir Alexander Hood Brunswick-terrace Brighton—it was put into the twopenny post in Blackfriars-road on the 10th of August and taken to the Twopenny Post-office it was then transferred to the General Post to be forwarded to Brighton—it has the regular post-mark on it WILLIAM BOKENHAM I am a clerk in the General Post-office—this letter was duly forwarded to Brighton by the post-office—it has the London post-mark on it—I have no doubt it went in its regular course THOMAS JONES I was in the service of Sir Alexander Hood on the 11th of August—I was with his family at Brunswick-terrace—I received this letter on the 11th and paid 1s 5d for it—it was forwarded to Lady Hood and she forwarded it to Sir Alexander Letters read Sir Alexander Hood is sorry to trouble Mr Green upon the subject of that worthless person who has been such a nuisance to his family Samuel Hood He has been to Brighton and alarmed Sir Alexander s family in his absence and fortunately no gentleman being then present to advise them he was not placed in the hands of the police but they were induced by threats to say in writing that something might be given him through Mr Green His apparent desire was to go to Spain if therefore he should put himself under the command of an officer in that service Sir Alexander requests Mr Green will advance to such officer or acknowledged Spanish agent in London to be paid only when he is in Spain and then only for clothes and necessaries five pounds but on no account to himself and sir Alexander will immediately upon Mr Green s having done so send the amount Sir Alexander thinks it advisable to have him watched by the police and requests Mr Green if he is on the same opinion to mention the name of some vigilant person of that description to whom he may write to take him up if he comes into the country again obtaining money under false pretences and threats The five pounds can only be paid through one of the established agents so that there may be no cheating The person is no relation of Sir Alexander s us he calls himself —Wooton Glastonbury August 10 The prisoner s letter was then read Green s Hotel Monday August 20 SIR I have just read your infamous epistle to Mr Green This is the second time you have endeavoured to swindle me out of what you promisled in writing which I can and will produce to the world Shame Shame can you Sir stoop to deceive and defrand a distressed relative If you call on Mr G in London you shall have some money When I get there I find I am to go to Spain—and when I should have got there I should find Sir Alexander s word as much respected as it was at London You have deceived me once before this when you sent me to Plymouth there years ago You shall not I swear by the great God of Heaven deceive me again with impunity—no you have goaded me to desperation by insult deception and falsehood Perish I must for I have no means of existing but you Sir who promise but to deceive shall not live to exult over my misfortunes Were I to go to Spain I should go as an officer and the promise made to me for your mother of yourself must be fulfilled without conditions the promise was made to me on that I left for London None but those lost to every feeling and principle of honour and honesty would thus basely for the sake of a few pounds forfeit their written pledge I write to you once again Sir from here and I now state to you that the assistance promised me at Mr Green s must be given without any conditions and then Sir neither you nor any of your family will hear from me again I wait until Wednesday morning If I have not any communication at Green s I will call upon you at Brighton My doing so will at least give me an opportunity to prove that I did not take advantage of your absence and it will most likely give me an opportunity of stating publicly that you in my opinion and in the opinion of many hundred others either cajoled old Lady Bridport into giving you all her property or made the will yourself the world will then have an opportunity of knowing Sir Alexander s chartacter as it really is not as it may appear at this moment superficially If the 5l promised is handed over to me punish me for a perjured liar if I ever make an application to you again I will call on Mr G on Wednesday morning if I have no reply from him I shall leave London directly for Brighton that at least I may die at your threshould the victim of your veracity and honour but I will not die alone worthless as you have dared to call me I will prove that my carcase will be as valuable as the proud Sir Alexander Hood s You drive me to madness Sir by your brutal and unmanly conduct Why did your mother promise if you or she intended to deceive I wish to go to Spain but not in the way you propose I would much sooner blow your and mine own brains out than submit to your ungenerous conditions Why not have said at once when I was at Brighton that nothing should be done for me why dishonourable cheat me into a belief that I should have it on my arrival in London why inhumanely trifle with one who is almost starving—is this an aristocratic feeling No no man of honour would forfeit his word even a tradesman would have more honour than to shufile in the paltry was you have twice done with me But rest assured Sir that I am not to be played with like a child You have by your insulting letter roused feelings that even I regret to say possess my wind in an excruciating degree I repeat Sir Alexander that if you will allow the 5l promised to me to be given to me on Wednesday next that I will immediately embark for Spain and never trouble you or your family again and will give Mr Green an undetain to that effect viz to leave England in three days from thence I am sure after the promise made to me at Brighton it will be impossible for you to refuse compliance with this request and if I do not fulfill it punish me as I should then merit but which I do not I thank God yet deserve —SAM HOOD Sir If you will permit Mr G to hand me over the 5l I will engage to leave England in three days from that time and give an acknowlegemeant that the money is advanced to me for that purpose and that purpose alone and not to be applied to any other than forwarding my departure for Spain this Sir will be sufficient and will enable you to punish me as I should disserve if I appropriate the money to any other purpose To accept the money under your conditions would be to blast my hopes and prospects at once and I might as well stop and perish here us go abroad without a hope of rising in my profession I am Sir your obliged but cruelly treated relative SAM HOOD The prisoner in a long address stated that he had made frequent applicaions for pecuniary assistance—and that upon hearing the letter produced read to him

law with transportation MR BODKIN conducted the Prosecution JOHN HASLET I am clerk to Mr White I have seen the prisoner at Mr White s chambers very often for the last two years—in the first instance Mr White generally saw him but not latterly—I learned from the prisoner the object of his visits to Mr White it was respecting a woman and a child—he said he had done something for Mr White—he has often said he came for money—I received three letters one from a boy and two others—this letter came to my hands it is dated the 31st of December—it must have been then that I received it—I have seen the prisoner write—I believe the whole of this letter marked A to be his hand-writing and the address—it is not the letter named in the indictment—the prisoner came to Mr White s the day after this letter came the 1st of January—he brought this letter B delivered it to me and desired it to be given to Mr White—I am sure it is in his hand-writing the whole of it and the address—I received this letter C from the prisoner on the 2nd of January and this also D I cannot say on what day—it bears no date—it was since the other letters—I could not say that that is the prisoner s writing it does not appear to me to be like the others Prisoner Q You tell his Lordship that Mr White has not seen me latterly what do you call latterly A I should say two months—this letter D does not appear like your hand-writing—I am positive as to the others Q You said I said I had done something for Mr White A You told me you had procured abortion—I cannot say when you told me so it is within six months—these letters were not enveloped to me—Mr White was on the Midland circuit—I remember his receiving one letter then but cannot say I remember two SAMUEL STANILAND I am an attorney In the course of last year I was consulted by Mr White on this matter—I was present on the 9th of December at Mr White s chambers when the prisoner and his attorney and Mr White were present—I produces a release that was executed on that occasion I saw the prisoner sign it this is it—4l was given to the prisoner on the execution of that release and and acceptance of Mr White s for three months which is not due yet—the prisoner did not state that he had any other claim on Mr White—I saw the prisoner again on the evening of the 11th of December at my office—He said he came to me as the attorney of Mr White and requested me to ask Mr White to let him have 50l —he said he had an opportunity of getting in to business in London and he wanted this sum to buy the fixtures—I told him I was surprised at the request and refused to be the medium of communicating that to Mr White—he then asked if I would request Mr White to give his acceptance for 50l which I refused to do—he came again the following evening but I would not suffer him to come into my house—he came again on the 30th of December—he came into my room—I immediately arose from my chair and said I can have no communication at all with you and made him go out of the house Prisoner Q Do you remember the day of the week the 11th of December was on A No I do not exactly recollect the day it was between nine and ten o clock in the evening—you said you had taken a house and wanted 50l to buy fixtures—you brought a medical bill—I advised 30l to be given you if your release was given COURT Q Did you understand that an action had been brought against Mr White A Yes for 60l Prisoner Q Was it not for medical attendance on that female A I don t know—you had a letter when you came on the 30th of December and said Allow me to show you this letter which you had in your hand—I said No I won t see your letter —this was about seven or eight o clock in the evening—the prisoner did not state to whom the letter was addressed—I stopped him from proceeding—I turned him out Q Do you recollect when this release was signed my applying to Mr White and yourself with respect to the arrangement for the support of the child he first promising 10s a-week A It was arranged that Mr White should pay 1l a month—that was on the 9th of December when the release was given—you did not deliver a message to me on the 30th of December from the party to request Mr White to pay her monthly—I was never at Huish-court in my life—I did not send there to Mrs Dixon to prevent her from coming here HERBERT JOHN WARD I live in Water-street Bridewell In December last the prisoner was treating with me for a house—he referred me to his friend George White of Essex-street a barrister—the fixtures were to be included in the rent—there was a treaty about some furniture which came to 50l —he first referred me to Mr White as to his character and proposed to take this furniture at 50l and to pay me by an acceptance of Mr White s to that amount—I objected to make any application to Mr White—the prisoner was to do so—I called on Mr White on the 28th in consequence of the prisoner s direction for the acceptance—It was to be drawn by the prisoner—he refused to give it and stated he had informed Mr Cook he would not—I wrote to the prisoner on that day and he came to me the day following Prisoner Q Did you not have an interview first with Mrs White A No—she came into the room before I left—Mrs White said You will certainly not accept a bill not recommend that man —but I should say that Mr White had declined the acceptance before Mrs White came into the room Q Did you not tell me that Mr White was indisposed when you first called that there was no fire in the first-floor office and Mrs White came and asked you up stairs and she would introduce you to Mr White A Not one item of what you have stated is true she did not do so nor did I tell you so—the servant introduced me up stairs—this is my hand-writing— read 2 Water-street Bridewell Precinct December 22nd 1835 Sir Mr Leblanc who is the superior landlord of the house No 2 Tudor-street has this day made inquiries of Mr White and is satisfied with his statement as to your respectability and I have therefore directed the notice To let to be taken down Mr Leblanc is going out of town on Thursday in the middle of the day it is therefore desirable with a view to immediate possession that the agreement with his as to rent fixtures &c is completed at the latest on Thursday morning If you can come to down to-morrow Wednesday I think it will expedite the matter Yours respectfully H J WARD Directed to Mr Cook Surgeon Ilford Essex Prisoner Q I believe you had twelve months more to expire A Yes I had—I handed your reference to Mr Leblanc he being in the profession I thought him more likely to make inquiry—he told me he had made inquiries—I remember your signing a document in Mr Leblanc s office—I gave possession to Mr Leblanc—I was not present when possession was given to you—my late brother was a tenant of Mr Leblanc —I am his executor—after the reference was stated to be satisfactory I proposed to you to take this furniture GEORGE THOMAS WHITE Esq I am a barrister and live in Essex-street This letter A came to my hands on the 31st of December last this one B on the 1st of January and this one C on the 2nd of January Prisoner Q Do you remember my applying to you at the latter and of November 1834 to inform you of the health of a young woman whom you had been cohabiting with to whom you had administered medicine of a serious description A On several occasions I remember your calling on me you told me you had been to the overseers of the parish of St Dunstan s about the woman s child COURT Q Did he mention her name A Yes Mrs Cook Prisoner A Do you remember calling at her lodging at one o clock the following morning A The morning I called at her lodging I think was the latter end of October—I found you and her and her child in bed together between one and two o clock in the morning—I think it was some where out of the York-road—I have never seen it since—you had the appearance of a man coming out of bed—you had your coat and trousers on—I said Here is a sovereign for Mrs Cook —I went up stairs and saw the lady and her child in bed together from which you had come shortly before no doubt—I do not think there was any thing the matter with the woman—I did not give her any medicine—under any pretence—you did not tell me there was a disease in the uterus Q Do you recollect asking me if I would be kind enough to procure a more convenient lodging nearer to you and if I would let you know where it was you would feel obliged A I never said any thing of the kind I believe you brought the woman to the neighbourhood of my chambers for the purpose of extortion—I did not meet you night after night in the street—I went to meet you one night at the corner of Earl-street I did not find you there Prisoner I met him every other night and he handed me from 2 to 3l a week for the purpose of carrying this poor woman through her abortion Witness It is utterly false—I did not visit her with you in the character of a physician—I do not remember your calling in a Mr Hart a surgeon accoucheur—you once sent me a prescription which I could not read not understanding medicine—I burnt it—I remember on the 1st of last March giving her 7l 10s to convey her home to her mother in your presence—I said I would pay 5s a week for the child not 10s—I did not advise you to try and get an appointment under Col Evans you said you were going to Spain and I wrote to him—you did not call and say you would go if I would furnish you with the 50l and the 60l for the medical bill Q Do you remember accepting a bill for 30l which not being honoured I was arrested on A I do not believe you were arrested—I told the attorney you were not worth arresting—you told me the writ was issued—I remember writing a letter to Mrs Woodhouse—I promised when the bill was cashed to remit the difference—the document I indorsed was for 22l 10s I believe it became due on Saturday—I believe it was presented—a man of the name of Wettenholm came to me to accept for 100l or 150l for you and to take your counter acceptance—of course I refused I would not have accepted the 50l COURT Q Had you in point of fact been under any promise or engagement to furnish the prisoner with money to the amount of 50l A I was under no engagement—I had made no promise—I had determined never to do so after the 9th of December—he never had any legal demand against me—I became acquainted with the female by meeting her in the Stand she was standing looking about—I went to a house of ill-fame with her—I saw her once afterwards Prisoner Q I believe you stated your circumstances to her that you were poor but would introduce your friend Mr —— of—— to her who was very rich and you did not mind going with a female to whom he had been A I never uttered such an expression—I don t know that he was rich Prisoner Do you remember her telling you that she had had a child by Mr Cook the surgeon A I don t recollect that but the name of Cook was mentioned afterwards Prisoner When I returned from the country I was at Maidstone —I found the party in question was pregnant—I asked her by whom—she said Mr White of King s-Bench-walk Temple —I requested her to make him acquainted with her situation MR BODKIN Q You have stated that this man never had any legal demand on you A Never for any purpose whatever on my solemn Oath—I never had any transaction which could occasion a debt—he has abtained money from me in large sums and down to a shilling and once 26l on an absolute promise that I should never hear any more of him or Mrs Cook and in a short time he came and said he had his pocket picked of the last 7l —I saw the woman once in the Strand and once afterwards I did not again till after the circuit when she came in a state of pregnancy and said You are the father of this child —I then got Mr Power to interfere—I asked him whether I had better submit to avoid publicity COURT Q Do you happen to know when she was delivered A On February the 7th 1834—I was told so by the prisoner and before the end of that month I made a contract to pay them 30l —in that case they should keep the child—I said Rather than have the thing made public or go before the parish officers I will pay 30l —and before I left for the Spring circuit of 1834 I paid the prisoner the balance of the 30l and he promised I should never hear any thing more of him or the child—In March 1835 I paid 7l 10s on the representation of the woman and the prisoner that she was to return to her friends at Aylesbury—and that 7l 10s was to enable her to do it Q What money in all has the prisoner got from you A Not less than 120l in hard money MR BODKIN Q To whom did you pay the 7l 10s A To herself in the prisoner s presence—I was going out of town the same day the 1st of April and had another application—shame at the connexion I had with the woman and above all shame at the connexion I had been forced into with this man occasioned my giving the money Prisoner Q Do you remember asking me when it was over whether I would bring the fœtus to you A No—I did not say whether it was a dog or a cat I did not want to see the little b— COURT Q Had you any connexion with the female after the birth of that child in February 1834 A No—I had not Prisoner Q Had you not two days before taken her to No 56 Shoe-lane and said Say you have been out for a pound of candles —and did you not after the abortion take her about in a coach A I had nothing to do with the child she was bearing when you said she had an abortion—I have not said I had no connexion with her after the birth of the first child—I went to 36 Shoe-lane and had no connexion with her—I did not go there two or three times—I don t recollect what I gave her—I think it was a sovereign—I don t recollect telling her to pay for the room out of it—I did not tell Mr Staniland that I was the father of the first child—I offered the 5s a week as the price of peace—I did not say I would give 50l independent of the medical bill EDWARD FLETCHER I am an officer I took the prisoner into custody on this charge in the street—I accosted him and said How do you do Mr Cook he said My name is not Cook my name is Humphrey —I said Never mind you are the man I want —I took him into custody The letters were here put in and read Letter A Addressed to G S White Esq No 39 Essex-street strand — Sir I have

dated the 9th of December 1835 Prisoner Defence I will prove by a witness a respectable female that I had the promise held out by Mr White a long time before to give me 50l the reason I did not mention it at the time of the release was that it was a confidential communication—I can bring those witnesses forward which I consider essential to me and must abide by my Lord s and your decision SARAH HARRIS I am sister to Mrs Woodhouse with whom the prisoner was connected I came to London with the prisoner and remember going to Mr White s chambers in Grange-walk for the endorsement and acceptance of a bill for 22l 10s —it was the latter end of September—I saw him write but not on that occasion—I remember the prisoner being about to enter into business with my sister and 40l or 50l was wanted—Mr White said he would pay the money—that was at the latter end of Sepetember—he promised to pay 40l or 50l to my sister Mrs Woodhouse—he wrote a letter to that effect which was returned and she declined accepting the offer ELIZABETH ADNUM I first became acquainted with Mr White my meeting him in the Strand near Somerset House—I was just returning from Kennington where I had left my little girl which Mr Cook is the father of in care of an aunt of mine—he asked me where I lived—I did not give my address—he asked me to go and take some refreshment with him—I went with him and took wine and gin and remained till near two o clock in the morning—he told me that he was married and gave me his address No 9 Buckingham-street Stand and likewise his chambers Prisoner Q Was I in town when you first saw him A No—it was the latter end of May or the beginning of June—I saw him the next evening about nine o clock and was with him till the same time about two o clock—he wished me to leave you to leave my friend as he was poor and to have himself and his friend—I took a letter to Mr Carvill the overseer—Mr White visited me in the character of physician—he wished to do that to take off suspicion—he used to send me from 2l 10s to 3l a week for my maintenance—he has given me 2l himself—after I recovered my health I went with him again—he took me in a coach COURT Q Is it correct that you had one child of which the prisoner is the father A Yes—a little girl—I miscarried with another child last November twelve months—I had another previous to that—a little boy who is now living—the miscarriage was after that—I was between four and five months gone at that time—I did not live with the prisoner for some time—not till November 1834—I was living with him when he was in town unknown to Mr White—I have gone by the name of Mrs Cook at times—I do not go by that name where I am now lodging—I occasionally go by the name of Mrs Cook—I came up from Aylesbury with the prisoner—I lived with him till my little girl was four months old—I was then living at No 6 New Church-court Strand MARY DIXON The last witness lodged at my house—I never saw Mr White COURT Q Did Mr White call at any time to your knowledge A I never saw him in my life—I only saw an account of a bill which was to be charged—I heard his name Prisoner Q You saw the child after it was born A Yes—it was quite wasted—I should think it had been dead a month before it was born COURT Q What date was this A December 1834—I should think it was about a four months child—I cannot say whether the woman was quick with child it was a very small child—the mother told me she had slipped down stairs and hurt her back and she was ill from that time Prisoner I had been a medical practitioner for 15 years in one town but business failed and I took a stituation at Aylesbury as an assistant—I became acquainted with this female and when she became pregment I took her to town rather than be exposed GUILTY

t18371127-98  98 MICHAEL NUGENT and GEORGE KAIN alias Jackson were indicted for that they on the 3rd of November at Ratcliffe feloniously did threaten one Francis Harrison to accuse him of the abominable crime of b - - with a view and intent in so doing to extort and gain from him certain of his monies and property and by intimidating him by the said threat did unlawfully and feloniously extort and gain from him 7s and 6d his monies —2nd COUNT for threatening to accuse him of attempting and endeavouring to commit the said crime MESSRS CLARKSON and BALLANTINE conducted the Prosecution FRANCIS HARRISON I am a watchmaker and jeweller and live in Broad-street Ratcliffe On Friday the 3rd of November about twelve o clock in the day I was in Schoolhouse-lane—I had fetched a clock from a customer and had it with me—the prisoner Kain came up to me—I turned round and saw Nugent with him—they were together—Kain said to me Don t you know me —I said No —he said You must recollect me from what took place last night —I said No what was it about —he said You must recollect —he said that I had indecently used him—he said You took hold of my person —he did not mention what part of his person—I told him he was mistaken and to go about his business—he said he was not mistaken I was the man—and he said Give me some money or I will expose you —Nugent was close to him during this—I walked on—he said that the one who was with him was his witness—Nugent must have heard that—I walked on toward my house which was about two hundred yards or more than that—they continued to follow me but I did not look round—they followed me to the bottom of the lane and then Kain said Come come stop —I stopped and asked him what he wanted—he said You have used me in a s - - way and asked again for money—I told him to come on to my house and explain—he said No—I am as b - - wide awake as you —I walked on till I got to my house—they continued to follow me—I went in doors—I called my wife into the shop—they must have heard me call her—she was close to the shop in the passage—the front door of the shop opens into the street—the prisoners did not go into the shop they stopped at the door but I opened the glass door and told them to come in and they both came in to the outer door—I then asked them what they wanted with me—Kain said he wanted money—he said Give me some money and we will say nothing about it—if you do not we will expose you and punish you —my wife asked them what they wanted the money for—I repeated to her that they had accused me of an indecent assault and wanted money for it—I refused to give them any money—they frequently said they would not go away without they had some money—Kain said that Nugent was his witness—he said that loud enough for Nugent to hear—my wife appeared to be very much flurried and said in their hearing that she wished me to give them money to get rid of them—I refused at first to do so but seeing her state of mind and being much agitated myself I said Give them some and she gave them 8s —I directed her to do so in consequence of the threat that had been used—after she gave them the money she said had they not better give a receipt or they would come again addressing herself to them—Kain said Yes we will give a receipt —I think my wife gave the money to Nugent but they both stood close together—I was very much intimidated by the accusation before I directed her to give them the money—I wrote the receipt—this is it looking at it —my wife put a slip of paper into my hand—I said What am I to write —Kain said Clear of all charges —I asked him his name—he said George Jackson—I then wrote the receipt and gave it to Kain—he handed it to Nugent who looked at it and signed it on the left-hand corner—he then returned it to Kain and said Make a mark and Kain made a mark—I wrote this George Jackson —that was the name he gave me—this is the paper— read Nov 2 1837 George Jackson received 8s and begs pardon for this unfounded charge George Jackson ✗ his mark and Nugent —after this my wife said You will not come again —Kain said This is clear of all charges —just at this time my servant Elizabeth Lowitt came in—next morning before twelve o clock I went to the Thames police-office and got a warrant—about six o clock in the evening I had a policeman at my house—I saw the two prisoners at the shop window—I went round directly and opened the door—Kain said A ynt you going to give us something —I asked them both to come in and they did so after some hesitation—I then closed the door and Ellis the constable directly took them into custody—he tied each of their arms together and Kain said to me This is as close as we were under the bridge —I never had any communication with the prisoners in my life until they attacked me the day before in the street—I never gave either of them a watch—I have three children the youngest is six months old to-morrow—I have lived in my present house since 1823 and within a few doors of there since 1818 Kain He gave us a watch Witness I did not Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q After they got home to your house did both you and your wife refuse to give them any money A We both refused at first—they said they would not go out till we did give them some money—Nugent made no reply when Kain said he was his witness—my wife was very much flurried and said we had better give them some money and get rid of the fellows—I said No we cannot give them any money —I wrote the receipt out of my own head—I put in the words apologise for this unfounded charge out of my own head—I was afraid from what they had said that they would make the charge against me Q On your oath was it not because your wife was fluried that you gave them the money and not from any real fear that a charge would be made against you A It was from fear in my own mind as well—we were both very much flurried and I was flurried in the street—I objected to give them money in the first instance knowing they were trying to rob me—I certainly continued to object for some time but I was nearly as anxious as my wife to get rid of them my flurry was so great—I refused to give it them at first as I thought they would perhaps go away when they found me obstinate—Kain appeared the principal person—he spoke the whole time—all that I heard Nugent say was Make a mark and he wrote his name first COURT Q Were you alarmed at the whole transaction —were you in fear of their making the charge A I was very much alarmed—I would not have parted with the money but through fear GEORGE ELLIS I am a constable of the Thames police In consequence of Mr Harrison having come and made a complaint at the office on Saturday the 4th of November I received a warrant to apprehend the prisoners and went to the prosecutor s house with it about four o clock—I remained there till six o clock at which time the prisoners came—I asked what they wanted with that gentleman pointing to Mr Harrison who was behind his counter—Kain said He knows very well what we want we have come for some money —I immediately took them into custody and fastened them together—on my doing so Kain turned round to Mr Harrison and said This is as close as we were when we were under the bridge —I conveyed them to the station-house and on the way there Kain said Oh Harrison is a guilty man or else what made him give us the money and watch —I asked Kain how much money—he said 8s and we have given a receipt for it —this was said in Nugent s hearing—they were fastened together at the time—I asked Kain how long ago it was since he first saw Mr Harrison—he said About three weeks ago in the Ben Jonson s Fields —he said that Mr Harrison came up to him and said he wanted * * *—he then said I went under the bridge with him —he did not say when—he said it was three weeks ago when he first saw him—he said he went under the bridge and there Harrison * * *—I said Did Harrison give you any thing —he said no bat Mr Harrison was going to charge him with a robbery and he turned round and ran away—he said I have never seen him till last Friday and here is my witness —I asked Nugent what he saw of the case-he said he followed them over the fields and saw them go under the arch of the bridge together * * *—they neither of them said what day or week this was—I did not ask them to fix the day Cross-examined Q Did the statement of what occurred under the bridge immediately follow his saying it was about three weeks ago that he first saw him A Yes it did—I said nothing more to them when I first went into the shop than What do you want with this gentleman —they were inclined to be very impudent and to make use of foul language and there being females in the shop 1 told them to be quiet—I was dressed as I am now not as a policeman—I belong to the Thames police—I had never seen them before—I have no doubt they knew I was an officer by living in the neighbourhood COURT to- MR HARRISON Q Did you ever meet these men in Ben Jonson s Fields A Never—I never gave either of them any watch or any money except the 8s I have mentioned—I never went up to Kain in Ben Jonson s Fields and say what has been represented—I never went under a bridge with either of them—there is not one word of truth in all they told the officer ISABELLA HARRISON I am the prosecutor s wife On Friday the 3rd of November about twelve o clock I was at home—my husband came into the passage to me and I went into the shop—the two prisoners came in by my husband s desire and my husband said they had charged him with having committed an indecent assault and that they wanted money from him—I gave them some by his desire—we were both very much frightened and I said You had better get rid of them —he walked up and down the shop knocking his hands and said Get rid of them get rid of them we must get rid of them —I then suggested something about a receipt and the receipt was given—I did not see them again till Ellis took them into custody Cross-examined Q Did you at first say you had no money A Yes—I said I have no money what am I to do —I got the money off the table—I said I had none as I did not wish to give them any—my husband said there was no occasion for a receipt from such fellows ELIZABETH LOWTIT I am in the prosecutor s service On Friday the 3rd of November I had been for a walk and came in with the children about one o clock—I saw the prisoners coming out of the shop door—on the following day master went before the Magistrate and while he was gone the prisoners both came to the house—I opened the door to them—they asked if Mr Harrison was in—I told them he was not and asked them what they wanted with Mr Harrison—they said that was their business and not mine—they said they were not going to be put off in that way—I told them to come again at four o clock and they did so—Mr Harrison was not at home then—I told them to come again at six o clock—they did so and were taken into custody MARY ROLLINSON I am the wife of Henry Rollinson who keeps dairy in Brook-street Ratcliff opposite School-house-lane On a Friday morning Mr Harrison came to my house for a clock—it was half-past eleven o clock when he went away—our house is three or four minutes walk from his—I believe it was the 3rd of November—after he had been gone Kain came into our shop alone—I had seen both the prisoners before he came in by the dead wall opposite my house just before Mr Harrison came for the clock—when Kain came he asked me who that gentleman was who had just gone out—I told him he was a clock-maker and lived in Broad-street and told him his name—Kain then went out and joined Nugent—they appeared to talk together and then ran down School-house-lane MARTHA DOUGHTY I am the mother of Mrs Harrison and live in their house Mr Harrison keeps very good hours—he is a very regular man—I remember his going out to supper on the 24th of October last to Mr Ruston s—with that exception I have not known him out so late as eleven o clock for three weeks before this transaction—I can say so for six months and more than that before—he is a very regular living man good husband and a good father—he was very regular in his hours while his wife was lying in about six months before—I think he left home about eight o clock the night he went to sup at Mr Ruston s JOSEPH RUSTON I keep the Anchor and Hope Tavern in High-street Wapping On Tuesday the 24th of October the prosecutor came to my house a few minutes after eight o clock—my house is about a quarter of an hour s walk from his—he left about five minutes after twelve o clock—I know Ben Jonson s Fields—that is about two miles or two miles and half from my house ELIZABETH WORTLEY I have been lodging in Mr Harrison s house for ten weeks last Monday I remember his going to sup at Mr Ruston s on the 24th of October about eight o clock and I heard him come in about twenty minutes or half-past twelve o clock—with the exception of that one night he has never been out after dusk since I have been there to my knowledge—he is a regular attentive man to his family Kain s Defence It is impossible for a lodger to tell what time a man comes in—I said nothing about its being last night when I met him—it was about three weeks back that it occurred—I met him at Ratcliff-cross—I lived at a fishmonger s in the highway—I and this young man were coming home and met the prosecutor in Ratcliffe-highway and then the question he put to me was I want **** GEORGE ELLIS re-examined Ratclift-cross is about a quarter of a mile from Harrison s house and a

5 shillings his monies —2nd COUNT for robbing him of the said monies —3rd COUNT for menacing and demanding his monies with intent to steal the same MATTHIAS WILLIAM CUNDALE I am a chemist and live at No 12 Great Chapel-street Westminster I am single and live by myself I first saw the prisoner Fletcher on Friday the 27th of November—between seven and eight o clock that evening I was looking in at a picture-shop in the Strand at the corner of Southampton-street and somebody pushed against me—I moved to the other window and felt the push again from somebody I did not know who—I did not see Fletcher there—I then went into the City and on my return home about ten o clock through Spring Gardens Fletcher tapped me on the shoulder and demanded 1s and said if I did not give it him he would instantly charge me with an attempt to commit an unnatural crime—being frightened I gave him the shilling—I did not say any thing—he said before I gave it him that he wanted it to ride home with to a lady that he lived in the Regent s Park with—he said nothing more after he got it—on Sunday night the 29th of December between ten and eleven I met the two prisoners together in Pall Mall—Fletchersaid You are just the chap we want and then they both asked for something to drink Fletcher first and Chittem afterwards and Chittem said if I did not give it them they should press the charge that Fletcher had persevered in on the Friday and under the fear and dread of being accused of such a crime I gave them drink—first of all I tried to take shelter from them by going into a public-house in Duke-street they came in after me and after we had got into the parlour they ordered a pot of half-and-half a glass of rum and water and two cigars—they left the house first—I staid behind and paid 1s for the articles—it came to 1s 4d but I had no more money in my pocket and could not pay the demand for the cigars—when I went out I saw nothing of them till I had got across the Park in my way home—when I got into James-street near Buckingham-gate Fletcher accosted me and said he wanted 1s —he said he was Lord— s servant that he was locked out from the barracks and if be did not have the 1s he should press the charge against me still— Chittemwas with him then —I told him I had no money with me that if be wanted any he must come round to where I lived—they walked round James-street into Little Chapel-street—Fletcher remained behind there and Chittem came round to the door—I opened the door and went into my house—I went round the counter got 1s 4d out of the till and came round with the intention if I saw a policeman of giving them in charge—Idid not see one and gave Chittem the money—he said nothing but went away—Fletcher was then in Little Chapel-street not within sight or hearing—on the 13th of December Fletcher came to my house by himself and said he wanted 2s —I gave him the 2s and when he had got the 2s he said it was 5s that he wanted and not 2s —I gave him three more shillings and he went away—on Saturday the 19th between nine and ten at night I was proceeding up Strutton Ground Westminster and saw the two prisoners—Itried to avoid them by going down Artillery-place and round into Little Chapel-street home but when I got into Little Chapel-street Fletcher first of all came up—he called Chittem by the name of Jem who then came up and when they were both together Fletcher said he wanted a sovereign—I told him I had not got any money—he said he must have it and if I did not give it him he would go round to every neighbour in the place and tell them that I was such and such a character—upon that through the fright and fear of being accused of such a thing as that I went over to a neighbour very nearly opposite and borrowed a sovereign—he lent me a half-sovereign two half crowns and the remainder in shillings—Ihad first of all been to my own house but had not the money—I gave the money to Fletcher in Chittem s sight—Chittem directly said that he wanted a sovereign for he had had an accident to break the window of his master s carriage and he must have it—I told him that I had not got it—he said he would press the charge he would go round as Fletcher bad said and tell the neighbours I was such and such a character—I then went down to a friend of mine in Tothill-street and borrowed another sovereign—they followed me—on getting the sovereign I gave it to Chittem and told him if ever they came down again I should instantly give them in charge but that was not in Fletcher s hearing—I saw them again on Thursday the 24th of December as I was in my shop—they waited about half an hour before any notice was taken of them—I then told my father of what had taken place and asked him instantly to go out and speak to them—he went out and spoke to Fletcher—I saw him but did not hear what he said—myfather came in and told me something—they both waited about an hour after that before they went away—I suppose they went because they were tired of waiting any longer—on Monday morning the 11th of January the prisoner Fletcher came to my house about eleven—he was very abusive and used a great number of bad words—he said that I was a s— and that he would not go away from the place till he had given me in charge—I told him he had better go about his business if he did not I would most assuredly give him in charge—he still staid—I sent a girl that was cleaning for me in the house through the premises of a next door neighbour to fetch a policeman—she came back and said she could not find one—a friend then went out saw a policeman and brought him in—Fletcher pushed open the door rushed into the parlour and there he staid bullying and abusing me till the policeman came—I gave him in charge to the policeman—Chittemwas not there then—he was taken up the same afternoon and was brought to Queen-square between four and five—I did not order him to be taken but Mr Burrell the Magistrate did—I had never seen either of the prisoners before this occurrence Cross-examined by MR DOANE Q How old are you A Twenty-seven—I am in business for myself in Great Chapel-street and shall have been so twelve months next March—I have occasionally gone about town by myself but not a great deal—I have been with my father and friends—for the last twelve months I have been keeping company with a lady and when I have gone out I have gone out with her—I was born and bred in London but from fifteen or eighteen years of age I have lived a little way out of town—the station and police-office are very near my house—the first time I saw Fletcher was on the 27th of November—I had gone into the City on business that evening a friend had sent for me—itwas between seven and eight o clock that I was at the picture-shop—I was two or three minutes at each window—one window is in Southampton-street and the other in the Strand—I felt a push there but did not see Fletcher then not till I returned from the City—I saw him at the corner of Spring-gardens by Drummond s the banker s—it was there he touched me on the shoulder—I went home by the Horse-guards up King-street Charles-street and Delahay-street—I did not go through the enclosure or into the Park at all—when I saw the two prisoners in Pall-mall on the 29th between ten and eleven o clock at night I had been with two friends part of the way into the City—after coming out of church they went home and had a bit of supper with me and after supper I accompanied them as far as Hungerford-market or rather better Q How was it you found yourself in Pall-mall from the Strand—that was not in your way home A I had been in an ill state of health for some time and had not been out except on Friday for the last eight or nine months and I thought a little variation in the walk as it was not very late would not hurt me and I proceeded down Pall-mall instead of the old way—the public-house I went to is at the corner of Duke-street and Jermyn-street—I do not know the sign—I had been there before but not for the last two or three years—if I wanted a drop of ale or any thing as I passed I used to go in—I did not know the landlord or landlady—I suppose I was not half an hour in the public-house with the prisoners—I should say it was not more than half-past ten o clock when I got there—I went into the parlour first and they followed me in—there was one gentleman in one of the boxes nobody else—there was no waiter—I think the person that was in the box brought the drink—I presume he was the landlord—the prisoners and I all sat in one box—I went into the box first Fletcher followed me on one side and Chittem afterwards—he sat on the same side of the table as me—I sat in the corner and he rather higher up and Fletcher was on the other aide—we had a pot of half-and-half first—the prisoners drank of it I did not touch a drop of it—I bad a little of the rum-and-water which came in afterwards—the prisoners ordered it—I took a drop of it—they would not let me go away from the place—after the person waited on us he still staid in the same place—he did not sit down with us—he was in the room all the time till within I think about five minutes of starting—he brought in the rum-and-water—Ipassed the bar as I went into the public-house—I did not notice any body there—I walked straight in—I will swear I was not there an hour—Idid not take particular notice of the time but it was as near as I could judge half an hour—they left about five minutes before me—I staid a little while after they went thinking I should not see them—after they had gone out I went to the end of Jermyn-street down St James s-street and through St James s-park—if I had gone the other way I should not have had to go through the Park at all—I went into the Park at the Stableyard-gate and out at Buckingham-gate—it was not getting on for twelve o clock for I was home at a little after eleven—I did not notice the time when I got home but I had heard either the Abbey or St Margaret s clock strike and I got home about ten minutes after that—I was at the corner of the Park I dare say when I heard the clock strike—a young man lodges with me he is twenty-four years of age I believe—no other male—my father does not live with me he only comes occasionally—itwas in James-street that Chittem demanded the 1s —that was the first I noticed of them after I left the public-house—they were before me—when I saw Fletcher on the 27th I did not tell him where I lived nor did I tell them when at the public-house Q But they were before you on your road home when you got to that street A Yes—it was not far from my house—they were walking—Chitteminstantly accosted me and said he wanted Is for a bed that he was in Lord— s service and had been locked out of the barracks—Fletcher had told me on the Friday evening that he was in the service of a lady in the Regent s-park—I had not asked him his name or what he was—my father lives at Sand s-end cottage Sand s-end King s-road Fulham—I did not go to tell him what he had happened because I had no one to leave in my place—Idid not write to tell him—I thought this a very extraordinary thing but the fright and dread of being accused of such a crime and being subject to fits as I have been I had one only last Sunday and they said they would never come near the place again I thought it would have died away and no notice be taken of it—I did not name it to any one before I named it to my father—I did not go after the prisoners to see where they lived—the phrase they used the fourth time I saw them was Such and such a character —it was on that occasion I borrowed the money—I borrowed one sovereign of Mr Beasley a linen-draper in Great Chapel-street—he is not here—that sovereign Fletcher had—the one I gave Chittem I borrowed of Mr Jacques a plumber and glazier in Tothill-street Fletcher Q When you met me in the Strand what were the words you used to me A I did not see you in the Strand—I did not say to you How nice your boot-tops look —I did not walk with you down the Strand and ask you whether Chittem was a young man out of York-shire nor that I thought I knew him—I did not ask you to have a glass of ale with me in Cheapside—I did not take you to a cofiee-shop at the back of the Mansion-house as we could not get any ale—I went to an upholsterer s shop at the back of the Mansion-house—that was my friend s—Idid not tell you to wait for me—I did not go with you into a Tom and Jerry shop and have two pints of ale—I did not invite you to ask Chittem to come on the

Chittem to come to my house on the Wednesday following and I would let him know about the situation—nothing of the kind—no mention was made of any situation—I did not ask you for your character—I did not know whether you were in or out of a situation till the morning you were taken into custody—I did not come to you at any Mews—I did not want to pull you about or take hold of you in an indecent manner—I never laid a finger on you—when you was given in charge you set up this defence and denied it in the presence of a witness now here—I did not run away as you resisted—you did not give me a

prescription he called to Chittem who was by the side of him Jim and he came to him immediately—theywere not given in charge that night—I do not rightly know why perhaps from the confusion of the business—in fact I did not then know what their business was—it was after they were gone my son told me—we were very busy then—when I asked Fletcher his business he said He knows what I want or what I want him for I canot exactly charge my memory which—they remained a considerable time after I returned to my son but he did not tell me till they were gone—he did then and I advised him to apply to a

he wanted—he said he wanted that villian pointing to the prosecutor—I asked him what he came and kicked up a disturbance at the house for why not take other proceedings if he wanted him—he said he would not go till he had him at Queen s-square with him—I advised him to go away but he would not—I asked the prosecutor in Fletcher s presence what he came there about and he said he had given Fletcher money at different times—he said at one time he gave him one sovereign and 5s —Fletchersaid What did you give it me for —the prosecutor said To get rid of you not thinking to hear of you again —Fletcher said Do you think you would have given me the money if you had not done such a crime —Mr Hunt a friend of Mr Cundale s then came in and asked Fletcher what he meant by kicking up a disturbance and extorting money from him previously—he said That villian is not fit to live and called him all manner of bad names and said he would not go without him—Mr Hunt went and looked for a policeman and when Fletcher saw that he wanted to go—as soon as Mr Hunt went to look out of the door he was going—I asked him to stop a minute or two knowing what my friend was about and a policeman came and took him Fletcher I never mentioned any money—how could you hear me mention any thing if you were not there you said just now you never saw me and the prosecutor together Witness I meant

Mr Cundale s—I went and saw Fletcher—Itold him it was on Mr Cundale s charge that I apprehended him and that he must come before a Magistrate with me—he said it was Mr Cundale that ought to have been taken and not him—he made use of bad expressions and the crowd called Mr Cundale bad names such as a s—I took Fletcher to the police-office Fletcher Q Did not I give Mr Cundale into custody to you first A No—you resisted going to the station—after I took you you said you gave Mr Cundale in charge—that was after he had preferred his charge to me for extorting money—I cannot say exactly when

me whether I would give him a shilling and handed me his card to call upon him in Kingsgate-street where I should find his tale was true—this is the card he gave me—I saw no more of him for above four or five months when he came up to me as I was crossing Finsbury-square towards Windmill-street—he addressed me—I did not know him at first—he wanted me to read a paper about his failure in trade in Wild-street and said he wanted a little assistance to enable him to get to Exeter—I then gave him 5s and he left me—I saw him again I should say four or five months after at my counting-house door when I drove up in my chaise in the morning—he said Good morning or something to that purport—I asked him what he wanted and went into the counting-house—I remained some short time and when I came out he was there still—he addressed me again and said he had been very ill he was just out of the hospital—I told him I knew better for I had seen an account in the papers of his having been convicted of felony and imprisoned three months—he said he supposed I was glad to hear of it—I said Not particularly so —he began to cry and asked me for a little money to help to get him to Cornwall to his friends that he might retrieve his character—I gave him 30s —nothing else passed—he left me—I heard nothing more of him till he sent me a letter by an old lady—I received a letter previous to this at the counting-house—the first I had was dated the 6th of Jan —it came by post in this envelope—I have never spoken to the prisoner about that letter—I do not know his handwriting—this letter dated the 14th of Jan was brought to me by a woman—I do not recollect that I had any conversation or correspondence with the prisoner afterwards about that letter—I do not recollect that I saw him till I received the next letter—I saw him a few days after receiving a third letter dated the 20th—I do not know that I ever spoke to him about the letter of the 14th—I cannot recollect when I saw him after the 14th—it was within a month about a fortnight I think—it was in Hungerford-market—we had very little conversation—he wanted more money— I do not recollect having any interview with him at all after the letter given me by the old woman —he said he wanted more money and I gave him 30s —he said nothing about my answering his letters—I did not answer the letter of the 14th but I gave the old woman what he wanted—I told him not to send letters to me by the old woman for I should give her in charge as I knew where she lived from the reports in the newspapers—that was after the first letter she brought—I called her the old woman —she had only brought me one letter at that time—I am quite sure of that—it was after receiving the letter of the 14th and before the 20th—I told him I knew her character and where she resided that I had seen an account of his trial and where he was convicted and of her being the keeper of a low brothel in Shire-lane—he said she was a respectable woman—I told him that he lived with her—he made no answer at all to that—there was no further conversation to the best of my knowledge—I gave him 30s again to get rid of him—I had given the old woman 30s when I

January in Hungerford-market—I spoke to him on that occasion about the letter of the 14th or rather he first mentioned it to me—he said very little that day—no reference was made at that time to the letter of the 14th—no reference was made to the 30s demanded in that letter—the 30s mentioned in the letter of the 14th I gave to the old woman but I gave him 30s afterwards—I had no conversation with him with reference to the 30s which I paid to the old woman on receiving the letter of the 14th—I mentioned to him about receiving the letter of the 14th —I said if he sent the old lady with any more letters I should give her in charge—I did not mention the date of the letter nor describe it to him—he acknowledged having sent the letter by the old woman—when I taxed him about where she lived and said he must not send her any more he did not deny it—he did not say he had sent it—he said nothing about sending any letter to me—I had no conversation with him about the letter of the 14th except what I said about the old woman—the letter of the 25th was delivered to me by the old woman—this is it—also this letter of the 10th of May that was delivered by the same old woman—I saw him a few days after receiving the letter of the 25th of Jan about eleven or twelve o clock—he observed to me I had better let him have the £20 and not trouble me again as I knew he had a charge to make against me—I told him he ought to know better than to be annoying me as he was—he said I had better have sent him the £20 that was asked for in the letter and he would not trouble me any more if I gave it to him—I told him I could not afford it— I did not show him the letter —he said You had better you know I have a charge to make against you —I then told him I would give him 5l and make it up in a few days if he would promise not to annoy me again—I appointed a time to pay him the other 15l and left him—I saw him again in the Strand some time at the commencement of April when he asked me for more money

t18430821-2257  2257 GEORGE WILLIAM HAMILTON was indicted for feloniously sending to Jessie Hopper a certain letter demanding money from her with menaces against the Statute &c MESSRS CLARKSON and BODKIN conducted the Prosecution ELLIN SHAW I live at No 1 Derby-place Bays water in the service of Mr Hopper as housemaid—he has two grown-up daughters Miss Jessie and Miss Emily—Emily is the oldest—the house faces Kensington-gardens—there is a gate almost opposite the house leading on to the broad walk of the garden—the young ladies occasionally walked there On the 6th of July the day the Queen held a drawing-room I saw Miss Jessie come in from a Walk between twelve and one o clock I think—I had not seen her go out—shortly after she came home the prisoner rang the bell—I answered it—he asked me if that lady who had just entered the house had lost any thing as he had just picked something up at the gate—I went and spoke to Miss Jessie returned and told him she had not lost any thing—he said he was sure it was hers for he had picked it up close by the gate—he held his finger in his hand as if holding something—he said he should not show me what he had found as it was his intention to advertise it the following morning if the young lady found she had lost anything and looked in the newspaper she would there ascertain what it was—he asked if the young lady lived there—I said she did—he then left—his hair was very thick over his face but it is now shaved off—he had a very large beard both on his upper and under lip—I was examined before the Magistrate—he had his beard then—on the 20th of July between nine and ten o clock at night I heard the coachman s bell ring—I then received this letter from Mary Chandler the coachman s wife and gave it to Miss Emily—the coachhouse and stable are a little way down the garden—they do not join the house Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q Are you prepared to swear it was between nine and ten o clock you received the letter A Yes—I heard on Saturday that the prisoner had shaved since I saw him but I know him—there is still the same countenance—I do not know whether Miss Jessie had gone out alone on the 6th of July—she came up stairs alone—her sister was not in the house ELIZA GILES I am nursery-maid to Mrs Puddick of Coburg-terrace Bayswater who is an acquaintance of Miss Hopper s On Monday the 17th of July I was in Kensington-gardens with mistress s child and saw a tall stout man there with a high forehead and long mustachios and a great deal of hair on his chin over his lips and below—the prisoner is the man—his mustachios are now cut off also his whiskers and beard—there was nobody with him—I took him to be a foreigner and could not think what he was looking at—he was on a seat on the right-hand side—he did not get up but looked very hard at me—I was playing at ball with the child—I went down to the bottom of the garden and came up again—he was then on a seat on the left hand—he looked at me very hard—I came straight out of the garden—I know Miss Emily Hopper she had been in the garden that Monday and spoke to mistress s child on the left-hand side of the garden—on the next day I went to the gardens again and saw the prisoner and a woman with him about the middle of the gardens—the woman stopped me and said What a pretty child —I said Yes ma am —she asked me the little girl s name —I said Fanny Puddick —the prisoner then asked me was not Mrs Puddick a friend of Mrs Hopper s—I said I did not know as I had not been there long—he then asked was not that Mrs Puddick that lived round in Porchester-terrace —I said No Mrs Puddick my mistress lives here facing the gardens —he then asked Was not that Miss Hopper speaking to the little girl in the gardens yesterday —I said Yes sir —he then asked how many Miss Hoppers there were—I said I only knew two Miss Emily and Miss Jessie—he asked their names before I told him—then he asked if there were any more—I said I do not know —the woman then asked the child to kiss her and she did not like at first—he said no more and I passed on—I recollect his telling the woman that was Miss Hopper speaking to the child yesterday in the gardens Cross-examined Q You were not examined before the Magistrate A No I told Mr Mills a friend of mistress s what I knew five or six weeks ago who came there—I believe he had seen this in the newspaper—Mr Hopper had made no communication to me Q Now do you mean on your oath you have no doubt that is the man A Why it is between five and six weeks ago—I cannot say exactly he had a blue coat and white trowsers—I think he is a large make MR CLARKSON Q Do you believe him to be the man A Why he had a broad face and I do not think the prisoner has—I did not look at him exactly not to know him as I ought to know him in the gardens—he seems to be altered if he is the man—he was much stouter—he had his hat on when I saw him MARY CHANDLER I am the wife of Richard Chandler coachman to Mr Hopper I live with my husband at the stables—on Thursday night the 20th of July between nine and ten o clock there was a ring at the stable bell—I answered it and found the prisoner at the gate—I am sure he is the man—it was not very dark—the lamps are near—I did not open the gate but looked through the hatch—I did not notice whether he had a beard on—I looked through the rail and saw only the upper part of his face—he gave me a note which I gave to Ellen the housemaid—this is it—I saw him at the police-office and said I was sure he was the man—I heard him speak there and knew his voice Cross-examined Q Is it by his voice you recognize him A His voice and appearance—when I went in I said That is the man —he was not pointed out at all—he was sitting down in the police-court in custody—I was fetched there by Shaw the housemaid—she told me the man was taken—she did not say it was a man with a great beard—I did not know he had a beard before I went to the office—I had no conversation with Ellen about him—all she said was the man for bringing the note was taken up—I was taken quite at a nonplus—it wanted twenty minutes to ten o clock when I received the note—I know that as my husband wanted me not to answer the bell as he thought it a runaway ring—I looked at the clock before I went—I gave the note to Ellen immediately MR CLARKSON Q When you were sent for to the police-office did you know you were going A Not till I was fetched—the prisoner was sitting there and another man by him—I believe there were several waiting in the office—I pointed him out myself and am sure he is the man MISS EMILY HOPPER I am the eldest daughter of Mr Thomas Hopper I live with him opposite Kensington-gardens—he is an architect—the family consists of my sister Jessalina and my brother—our house faces the broad walk of Kensington-gardens—I and my sister were in the habit of frequently walking there—on the 10th or 11th of July I received a letter by post which I destroyed but I made a copy of it—before that I had heard of the servant making an inquiry whether my sister had lost anything—I took no notice of the letter—I remember the 20th July the day on which a letter was left at the house—I can recognize the prisoner perfectly well—I saw him on that 20th July about half-past nine in the morning in Kensington-gardens—I was at home—I saw him from the window commanding a view of the gardens—he was on one of the seats in the gardens with a female—his appearance is very much altered since that his hair has been removed from his face—I have not the least doubt of him—soon after I observed them the same woman I saw in his company came to the door of the house—she did not ring the bell at first—I cannot say whether she saw me at the window—she spoke to the servant—about the middle of that day I was in Albion-street near our house—I saw the woman again and the prisoner with her—on the evening of the 20th July I received this packet from the housemaid—I found a letter inside the outer envelope addressed to me—this is it—and another letter inside it in a sealed envelope this is it—I opened them both—my sister had left town the morning the letters arrived—a family named Ross live next door to us and we are on habits of intimacy—on the 28th of July this letter arrived by post at my father s house in the envelope as it is now COURT Q Why did you copy a letter and destroy the original A I thought it an extraordinary letter when I read it—it mentioned about a dress of Lady Somerset—I tore it up but thought it so strange I afterwards collected the pieces and copied it JAMES WOODHOUSE I am a clerk in the house of Coutts and Co bankers I live at 9 Cobourg-place and am acquainted with Mr Hopper s family—I had some conversation with the young ladies on the subject of the annoyance they had been exposed to and on Saturday the 29th of July I saw the prisoner opposite the house on the other side of the Bays water-road looking up at Mr Hopper s window moving about in a very bold impudent swaggering manner which attracted my attention—I went over towards Mr Hopper s house—the prisoner has been shaved since that—at that time he was very much like a foreigner having a beard from his chin and mustacnios on his lips—I only went inside Mr Hopper s gate—I think the prisoner did not see me go in—I tried to prevent him—I merely went to the side door and asked if that was him—I came out in a moment and he had got nearly a mile before I overtook him towards London—there was a woman with him—I gave him in charge of a policeman whom a gentleman sent for—I said I gave him in charge for writing and sending these letters to Miss Hopper—he begged me to walk two or three steps from the policeman to speak to me—I did so and he entreated me for my sake and my sister s sake not to have him taken by a policeman—he called me Mr Hopper and told me to consider the feelings of my family for the lady s name would be published in the newspaper if he was tried—he assured me he was employed by Mr Bell a respectable gentleman to indict this house and he assured me he would subpoena my sister—I said several times to the policeman and himself that he had sent scandalous letters to this family and he did not deny it—he said Yes yes but consider yourself consider your sisters —the woman went to the station-house—she begged in his presence not to be taken saying she had only delivered the letter it was very hard she should be taken for only delivering the letter and having nothing to do with the writing and he said if I persisted in having the woman takes he begged I would first take the witnesses to her house and have it settled there that she kept a house in Somerset-street and was the landlady Cross-examined Q I suppose you were somewhat excited A Yes as I had a hard run—I was not otherwise excited—I cannot recollect my exact words—I charged him with writing scandalous letters—he took me aside and said Yes yes &c —he had denied writing them before the policeman—I then said he was a villain or something to write such infamous letters to girls when he had appealed at the same moment to my pity for this woman—he said Yes yes but consider yourself and the young ladies —I do not mean to say that he explicitly denied it but you worry and agitate me so and I have been worried and agitated enough—I had not spoken to the prisoner previously to giving him into custody—I had walked by his side—he perfectly knew that I was accompanying him—he did not speak to me nor I to him—I asked a gentleman on horseback to go for a policeman—I was walking with him about twenty minutes or more MR CLARKSON Q Why was it you kept walking with him till a policeman came A In hopes that I could irritate him to take hold of me and then I could have taken the law into my own hands—as soon as I saw the policeman I gave him into custody—it was at the time I called the policeman that he called me a step or two aside to speak to me—it was when I said he was a villain and had sent these scandalous letters to the family that he said Yes yes —he used that expression a great many times Q Was the observation Yes yes but consider yourself and the family in answer to your suggestion that he had written infamous letters or in answer to a suggestion that he had had no pity on the family A They were both connected it was in answer to both COURT Q Did you in the course of the conversation with him speak to him of having written infamous letters to the family A Yes he only replied to that by begging of me to think of myself and my sisters HENRY PHILLIPS I am clerk to the justice and acted in that capacity at the prisoner s examination on this charge—he made several remarks during the examination—at the end of Miss Emily Hopper s examination the whole of the letters were read—the prisoner said The letter signed by Mr Bell I have had nothing whatever to do with I have witnesses to prove that I was not in or near Derby-terrace on Thursday week —the examination was on Saturday the 29th of July—the Thursday week before that would be the 20th—when James Powell the constable was examined and referred to a letter which was not read at that moment the prisoner said That letter I admit it is signed George William Hamilton —Powell was examined by the prisoner—I will read what he stated I am a constable of the C division 186 I did not hear much that you said but I heard you say you wished to settle it at the station-house he Mr W said he would not charge the woman then you wished him to press the charge the woman seemed to be glad to get away you did not say before he charged the woman he had better take his witnesses to her house to be satisfied whether she was the woman or not you said you had written a letter to a gentleman saying you should subpoena his daughter as she could give important evidence respecting the house I did not hear you say you wrote any other letter —Then the prisoner said That letter I admit it is signed George William Hamilton —this is the letter I that was then produced and read—at the end of the first day s examination I think it was proposed for him to be remanded and he said if he was he should have witnesses to prove that he was not near Derby-terrace—he mentioned Mr Bell several times—he said on one occasion that he had been employed by Mr Bell—I never heard him say he should produce Mr Bell—I do not remember that he said who Mr Bell was—he was remanded and brought up a week after—he did not then produce any witness—Mr Flower the attorney appeared for him on that occasion Cross-examined Q Was Miss Hopper in Court on the first occasion A The prisoner said Miss Jessie Hopper is here she had better be put into the witness box —I did not see him point to any one—nothing was said denying her presence Letters read — Miss Emily Hopper Private Madam I inclose you a letter for your sister Jessie and if you have the least regard for her reputation as well as that of your own you will forward it to her immediately for I tell you that your characters depend entirely on her answer to it and that answer must be sent to me before twelve o clock on Tuesday next If you wish to read my letter to your sister you can do so but if it is shown to any other person her character is blasted She knows what I mean and I dare say you do the same at all events you can guess the cause of her being sent into the country If this fails in reaching you I shall send one through the channel of Mr Ross s family Your obedient RBELL All communications must now be sent to me at 39 Somerset-street Portman-square You are perfectly at liberty to show this to your father or your brother but if you do Jessie is for ever damned in fact the whole family therefore judge well before you act rashly The letter addressed to Miss Jessie Hopper was as follows — Do not flatter yourself that by going into the country you will avoid the necessity of paying me I assure you you will find out your mistake and the longer you defer it the more you will eventually have to pay for my time is valuable I saw you leave Derby-terrace this morning and one of my men accompanied you to the end of your journey and will remain there until I relieve him It certainly appears as though you cared very little about your reputation or indeed that of your family or you would have made some proposal to buy my secret long before this but perhaps you have not fully understood me I will therefore be as plain as possible with you and I expect you will give me a decisive answer before twelve o clock on Tuesday next You must be aware that I have been at great expense in watching your movements for so long a time and what I now have to ask is this—will you pay me for the expense and trouble I have been at and keep all a secret or will you refuse to pay me and hare all your friends know your mishaps Your father I suspect knows it by his removing you from home but whether or not I shall tell him all as well as the rest of your friends and neighbours unless you pay me for holding the secret I have used you too well for had it been some persons they would have at once disclosed all but I feel anxious to give you a chance of saving your reputation from utter ruin and yet you neglect the opportunity I have given you My object was merely to wish to save your character from being blasted but if you don t care about it let me know and I shall apply elsewhere Perhaps you think that my word alone will not be credited but I am fully prepared for this as I have several witnesses all of them respectable householders ready to identify you should my word be doubted but I know you dare not compel me to produce them At present none of them know who you are or where you live but all of them can identify you from a hundred others In fact one of them is a gentleman living exactly opposite the house both him and his wife saw you several times and he knows both your face and that of your friends You had better let him see this and hear what he says I don t suppose he would like the affair known either by your father or in the public papers but this will be the case I assure you unless my expenses are immediately paid I do not wish to compel you to pay me if you do not feel anxious to do so as I am quite sure of being paid by some one or another I merely give you the chance of purchasing my secret which you will admit is worth knowing This is very kind on my part but as I said before I would rather sell my secret to you and save you from ruin than sell it to others who would expose you and your family However do just as you please Should you not write before twelve o clock on Tuesday I will explain all to your father and your brother besides all your friends both in the neighbourhood and elsewhere Besides the editor of the Satirist newspaper would gladly purchase a secret so well authenticated as mine is This certainly would amuse your friends Your having neglected to write has compelled me to send this to your sister Emily and if she reads it it will be your fault You know my determination and I will only refrain from exposing you when you have made me some offer for the expense and trouble I have been at In case I am out of town you must write to me care of Mr Hamilton 39 Somerset-street Portman-square —P S Your sister has carried a very high head with my messenger but I dare say when all is known she will be glad to hold it a little lower An advertisement may perhaps bring you to your senses To Mr Hopper —Somerset-street Portman-square July 27 —Sir I beg to inform you that I have received instructions from Mr Robert Bell of George-street to subpoena a daughter of yours Miss Jessie Hopper as a witness against a brothel in this street which Mr Bell and others have authorized me to indict at the ensuing Session and which brothel your daughter has frequently visited during the last two months in company with an officer who will also have to appear as a witness for the prosecution As I imagine you are ignorant of these proceedings I have thought that the better plan would be to inform you of Mr Bell s intentions before any further steps are taken in so disagreeable a case and I would advise you to put yourself in communication with Mr B immediately as it is his present determination in case I should not be able to serve your daughter with a summons to produce his witnesses in Court to prove that your daughter visited the house for an immoral purpose Therefore whether she appears in Court or not the exposure will be equally as great I should not have given you this notice had it not been mentioned to me that your family are highly respectable and actuated by a wish to save you all from so disagreeable an affair—I trust you will give me credit for having done so —remaining sir yours most obediently G W HAMILTON SAMUEL JARMAN I am clerk to Mr Humphreys the solicitor for the prosecution—I have searched the roll of attorneys in the Queen s Bench and Common Pleas from the year 1810 down to the present time and in the Exchequer since attorneys have been admitted to practise there and do not find any person named G W Hamilton or George William Hamilton on either of those rolls MISS HOPPER re-examined My sister Jessie is very ill indeed and quite unable to attend here—she is confined to her bed by illness and has been so ever since she was at the Police-court MR BALLANTINE Q When did you see her last A This morning—she is at Bayswater COURT Q Is she able to attend here A No she is not—she went out of town on the 20th of July for three or four days—she was at the Police-office on the 29th when the prisoner was examined—she was not examined—she has been very ill ever since—she was taken very seriously ill that evening and has kept her bed ever since—a medical man attended her MR WILLIAM WADHAM COPE I am governor of the gaol of Newgate—the prisoner was brought in on the 5th of August—he then had a beard and moustachios—his appearance is very much altered since then—last Monday I saw him in the cell-yard and drew the attention of the Sheriffs to him—he had then been shaved and had a handkerchief tied round his face—I observed to him that he had shaved himself that the turnkey had put into my hand a knife which I produced and I asked how he had got it into the gaol as it is the practice to search prisoners when they are brought in to take from them any weapon they may have about them—he said that he had it at the New-prison scraping his nails with and that a prisoner there told him he would not be allowed to bring it into Newgate but if he was desirous of doing so he could put him up to a plan by which he might effect it and that was by concealing the blade between the sole of his boot which he told me he had done and had come in with it in that way—he said that was the knife with which he had shaved himself Cross-examined Q We understand his beard was very remarkable indeed A It was it covered nearly the whole of his face but was rather thin in places—it was such that seeing the face for a moment would certainly excite my attention GUILTY Aged

t18440205-583  583 JAMES SMYTH was indicted for feloniously sending a letter to Thomas Robinson demanding from him money with menaces without any reasonable or probable cause —6 other COUNTS varying the manner of laying the charge MR CLARKSON conducted the Prosecution THOMAS ROBINSON I am butler in the service of a nobleman About three months ago I was residing with my master at Brighton—I there became acquainted with the prisoner by meeting him in the street accidentally—we fell in conversation about the different sights that were passing in Brighton—I met him and conversed with him several different times—he did not know I was in service—I did not know how he was getting his living—I never visited him or he me we merely spoke casually in passing—I came to London on the 2nd Jan—we put up at Grillion s hotel Albemarle-street—about a fortnight after I came to London I met the prisoner in the Strand he recognised me and said What you have come from Brighton or something similar to that—I said Yes —we entered into conversation a little time in walking up the street together—it was raining very hard—I asked if he would like a glass of ale—he said he should prefer a glass of gin and water and I gave him one at a public-house close to Charing-cross hospital—before we went to the public-house he asked if I would take a parcel to Brighton for him—I said with great pleasure for I should be returning there—he said it was a present that he intended to give to the person where he was lodging in Brighton who had behaved very civilly to him—he asked me my address in town—I told him where I was staying—I then parted with him and went back to Grillion s hotel—I think this was about the Wednesday and on Saturday the 27th he came to the hotel—there is no room or place of reception there for the servants except the front ball where persons are passing to and fro—I had a bed-room there—my master was labouring under a disorder for which he had undergone an operation—about nine o clock or a quarter to nine on the evening of the 27th the prisoner came to the hotel—he was shown up to my room—he did not bring any parcel for me—he said he would send it—we were talking together in my room for twenty minutes or half an hour—his conversation was about travelling where he had been and what he had seen at Ireland Liverpool and several places and about what he bad seen at Brighton—I never took or attempted to take any liberty of any kind whatever with him during the time he was in my room or in my company—I went down stairs with him and let him out—I should say he did not drop in my room any brown pocket-book with three 5l Bank of England notes in it—he could not have done so without my finding it—he did not drop any on the stairs nor were any such afterwards found—on the following Monday morning about eleven I received this letter—it came by the post—as soon as I had read it I went down to Mr Grillion and asked his advice about it which he gave me—that was about ten minutes after Ireceived it—when I met the prisoner in the Strand he gave me this card of his address Mrs Walters and Mrs Hunt s private lodging-house No 116 Drummond-street opposite the arrival side of Euston-square station Cross-examined by MR WILDE Q From whom did you receive that letter A The waiter at the hotel WILLIAM SQUIRES RABBETH I am clerk to Messrs Wright and Smith attornies Golden-square Iwas applied to on this matter on the evening of the 31st of Jan —a letter came to our office directed to the firm which inclosed a letter which I have and which brought my attention to this—I afterwards saw Robinson on the subject and received from him this card and one or two letters—the letter in question I received from Mr Wright—in consequence of an arrangement that was made I went to Grillion s hotel and saw Robinson—in consequence of what he told me I went to Vine-street station procured the assistance of Mount the constable and went with him and Robinson to No 116 Drummond-street the address on this card—I knocked at the door and asked whether a person named Smyth lived there—I found that he did and was at home—I was asked into the passage and the prisoner came down to me—I introduced myself as a friend of Mr Robinson s—he asked me to walk in which I did into the back parlour—I told him I understood he made a very abominable charge against Mr Robinson—he said Hush hush there are gentlemen in the other room they will hear what you are saying —I told him that rather than avoid any exposure in such a disgraceful matter I had called to endeavour to arrange it—I produced a letter to him not the one in question and said I believe that is your handwriting Mr Smyth —he said it was—I then asked whether he had written a letter dated the 28th of January in which he said he had lost 15l and claimed three 5l notes—he said he had—I asked what was the reason that he claimed those three 5l notes—he said that Mr Robinson might have settled it at that time if he thought proper—I then asked if he had written a letter the following day in which he claimed 30l —he said Yes I certainly did write the letter —I asked why he wrote that second letter—he said that Mr Robinson had not acted in a gentlemanly manner and that was the reason he had doubled his demand or the reason why he asked 30l —I said I thought it was a great pity a thing of this sort should become publicly known that I had seen Mr Robinson but unfortunately all the money he had in his pocket was 5l but I had promised to go to a friend of mine and get 20l more in which I had failed—he then asked if I was a friend of Mr Robinson s why I did not pay the money myself at the same time adding If your friend won t advance money why don t you go and get it —at the latter part of the conversation I drew my purse from my pocket and said All the money I have is about 7l or 8l —I then produced a 5l note and said Will you take this on account and I will pay the other 25l in the course of to-morrow —he said I have no objection to take the 5l providing you promise me faithfully to bring the 25l to-morrow —I asked what time it would be convenient for me to see him and one o clock was fixed—I gave him the 5l note of the Brighton Union Bank—the policeman was waiting opposite the house at this time—I asked the prisoner if he would be kind enough to show me the way to the door for the purpose of giving notice to the policeman—all the story about bringing the money to-morrow was a scheme for the purpose of giving him into custody with the note on him —he came to light me to the door—he put the light down on the ground—I took off my hat which was the signal agreed upon with the policeman—he came up immediately and I gave him into custody—Robinson was waiting a door or two from us—I made a motion to him and he came up and identified him—when the policeman came up the prisoner ran from him down the passage and into the back parlour—the policeman and I followed him—he made a motion with his arm as if to throw something out of his hand and as I followed him in a piece of paper dropped on the table—I took it up and it was the 5l note I had given him—when I gave him into custody he said Hush hush don t make a noise this thing may be settled Cross-examined Q I believe he had neither hat nor coat on at this time A He had no hat he had a coat on—he did not intimate to me at the door that he was desirous of getting his hat and coat—I am sure of that—he did not say when he had got his hat and coat he should be ready to go with me—I swear that he rushed into the room again—I cannot say for what purpose—I went with a lie in my mouth in order to catch him—I did not show him the letter of the 28th THOMAS ANDREWS I am the prisoner s brother-in-law I am satisfied tbat this letter is his handwriting Cross-examined Q Have you been on intimate terms with him A Formerly but not very lately Letter read — Sunday 28th January 1844 Mr Roberson Sir It gives me the greatest pain to be under the necessity of writing to you on a subject I am now about to do but I think it better to apprize you of the circumstance before writing to his Lordship your master as I lost on Saturday night in your bed-room or on the stairs of the hotel a small brown pocket-book containing three 5l Bank of England notes of which I have not the numbers and having a call for a large demand of cash on Wednesday morning will I assure you greatly injure me and that dreadful insult offered by you on that night in wishing me to let you commit such a crime on my person as you did is much against you and unless you forward to me the sum lost by Tuesday night my solicitor will write to his Lordship on Wednesday morning concerning your base conduct I am bent on going to the utmost extremity of the law should you fail in sending it to me at my lodging 116 Drummond-street Euston-square by the time named I feel so disgusted with you that I sincerely hope you will not attempt calling on me for a man of your years to be guilty of such a crime was you now here I am sure I should give you in charge return me what I have lost and keep out of my way and no one shall ever hear of it Mr Roberson Grillion s Hotel 7 Albemarle-street Piccadilly London JOSEPH MOUNT police-sergeant C 6 Mr Rabbeth applied to me for assistance to go with him to Drummond-street and about nine o clock on the 31st of January I went to the house with him and Robinson I remained outside while Mr Rabbeth went in—we had agreed upon a signal to be given—after he had been there some time he gave the signal and I went in and took the prisoner in custody by his direction—I saw a piece of paper in his hand which he dropped on the table—Mr Rabbeth picked it up and gave it to me—it was this 5l note which I produce GUILTY Aged 33 — Transported for Twenty Years

cadet in June 1790 On the 20th of June I lodged at No 19 Bury-street St James s my family being in Hampshire—I had been at Offley s in Henrietta-street and was returning home about half-past ten o clock at night—I was passing down Hemming s-row on the north side and the prisoner came up to me—until then I had not seen him at all—I never had any communication with him either that evening or at any other period in my life—he was dressed in uniform—he endeavoured to whisper to me and stooped—I rather drew back and did not hear distinctly what he said—I think he uttered some words—he then asked me what hour it was—I replied I did not know exactly but it was past ten o clock—he two or three times attempted to whisper again but I always drew back and continued on my way home—I went through Green-street Leicester-square Panton-street into Jermyn-street—I found he was following me and did not choose he should know where I lived—I turned round and said Which way are you going for I am going in the opposite direction —I turned back from going towards my lodgings and came into the Haymarket and began to inquire for a policeman—I turned into Piccadilly and seeing a cigar shop I went and asked where I could find a policeman—he was then looking in at the window—they told me where to find a policeman and as I left the shop door a young man who I had never seen before took me by the arm and said Sir I will protect you —I proceeded down the Haymarket towards my lodging—I observed to the young man This is the way to my lodging I don t wish the man to know where I live —he turned round and said to the prisoner What do you mean by annoying this gentleman —he said I know what I mean —I returned to the Haymarket and there were two or three empty cabs near the curb-stone—the young man said Get into one of the cabs and you will get away from him —I said Not for a thousand pounds if he had met with a young man he might frighten him he will not frighten me I will go through it and have him punished —when we came to Regent-circus I saw a policeman and said This young man has been annoying me —the prisoner ran up and said I charge this person with making an indecent assault on my person —he said that it was in Orange-street at an accommodation place for making water—he used those words either in Regent-street or at the police office—I had not been in an accommodation place that evening with the prisoner or any person—he said he was making water in one place and I in the other that I bent round and put my hand on his private parts—so help me God there is not a syllable of truth in that—I was then taken into custody—Ioffered bail and he was sent away with a letter to his commanding officer—I was brought next day before Mr Hardwicke at Marlborough-street—the investigation was gone into—I was discharged and he was given in charge—he made a statement there which I heard Cross-examined by MR PRENDERGAST Q You have been in the army many years A I have been an officer since 1793—I was going westward towards my lodging when the prisoner accosted me—I was in Hemming s-row on the north side—I had not been in Orange-street—the prisoner accosted me in Hemming s-row—I did not go into Orange-street but crossed I believe it is called Green-street through Leicester-square Haymarket into Jermyn-street where I stopped and spoke to him and came back into the Haymarket to look for a policeman—a great many people were passing in Hemming s-row particularly—when I found he persisted in following me— I had heard of cases of this sort being made against people and they being nervous large sums of money extorted from them —I was determined he should not find out my lodging and turned round into the Haymarket and Piccadilly and saw the cigar shop—I went from Leicester-square into a street I do not know whether it is called Panton-street—I was twice in Jermyn-street once with the witness and once before by myself followed by the prisoner—I told the person at the tobacco shop that the man had persisted in following and annoying me—the first time he said I had done anything to him was to the policeman—he had not said a syllable to me before that—he had tried to whisper to me several times and might have said something but I drew back—I did not wish to hear what he said—I did not wish to speak to a person who attacked me in the street in that way—I never asked him what he meant by following me—I asked which way he was going and I would go in an opposite direction—Brealey asked what he meant by annoying me—he said I know what I mean HENRY STEVENSON I am assistant to Mr Beale tobacconist Piccadilly—I was serving in the shop on the 20th of June about eleven o clock—the General came into our shop and asked if I could inform him where he could get a policeman as the soldier outside standing at the window had been annoying him—I told him where he would most likely find one—he went towards where I told him and returned saying he could not find one and afterwards went away—I saw the soldier looking through the window—the prisoner is the man Cross-examined Q How many persons were in the tobacco-shop A Two gentlemen and myself—my master was not there—I did not ask the prosecutor what the annoyance was CHRISTOPHER ROBINSON police-constable C 31 On the night of the 20th of June I was on duty in Lower Regent-street and saw General Thackeray and the prisoner there—the General said in his hearing I give this man in charge —before he could state what he charged him with the prisoner said I give this

caught hold of my private person THOMAS STORE BREALEY I am assistant to a chemist and druggist I was passing through a court leading from Orange-street on this night—I did not see the prosecutor in Orange-street—I overtook him in Panton-street and followed him up the Haymarket—the frequent application the General had made to the prisoner to go away and not to annoy him made me follow him—the General went into a tobacconist s shop—the prisoner was standing at the window—the General came out looking about for somebody I went up and offered him my assistance—we went to look for a policeman but when I got to N - - street I wished him to get Into a cab but he would not—we met a policeman as the prisoner was following close behind us—the General spoke first and said in the prisoner s bearing I give this man in charge for annoying me —he was in such a state of excitement at the time he appeared unable to say all he wanted—the prisoner said I give him in charge for indecently assaulting me —he did not explain what the indecency was till we arrived at the police-station Cross-examined Q What are you A I have been assistant to a chemist and am at present doing nothing—I was taking a walk that night and smoking a cigar in Regent-st —I had left the chemist s two or three months—I first saw the prosecutor in Panton-street which comet from the Haymarket into Leicester-square—he was walking along looking behind him several times—the prisoner was a very short distance off—I heard the General repeatedly ask him the way he was going—I was going home—I lodged in Norton-street Fitzroy-square—I have now a situation as assistant to a druggist at Newbury Berkshire—I was six years and a month with Savory and Co Bond-street—when I asked the prisoner what he meant by annoying the gentleman he said I know what I want or what I mean whether I said What do you want or mean I do not know but it was one or the other GEORGE FROUD police-inspector I was on duty at the station in Vine-street on the evening of the 20th of June—the prisoner and prosecutor came there—I gave the prisoner a letter directed to the commanding officer of his regiment and told him to deliver it to the Commanding officer—it was folded up but not sealed—next morning the prisoner produced the letter from his pocket—he came to us about nine o clock before he went to the Magistrate s office and asked me if it was necessary he should attend at the Magistrate s office—I said Yes certainly you have charged this gentleman with an offence and you must appear —he said he had been advised not to attend by one of the non-commissioned officers as it would bring the regiment into disgrace—I asked him if he had delivered that letter he said he had—he made a statement in my hearing before the Magistrate—he knew the contents of the note—I read it to him Cross-examined Q I believe he said if he attended before the Magistrate he should want a letter from you A No he did not—I gave him the letter overnight to ask the commanding-officer to allow him to come—it was not written at his request—it is the order of the Commissioners when a soldier is charged or charges any person to write immediately to the commanding-officer WILLIAM BISHOP I am clerk to the Magistrate at Marlborough-street Police-court—I produce the book containing the evidence given by the prisoner on the 21st of June it is in my handwriting and is a correct statement of what passed—he was sworn before he made the statement—it is not signed by him—I can recollect what passed by refreshing my memory by these notes—I recollect his making the charge—I have a partial recollection of what he said—I took down from his mouth what he said accurately— reads — I am a private in the second battalion of Coldstream Guards between ten and eleven o clock last night I was proceeding towards my barracks down Orange-street I had occasion to stop at a watering place while so doing the defendant came into the adjoining watering place there is a partition he looked round at me then put his hand round and caught hold of my private parts I said What do you mean by that you d—d old scoundrel he made answer Don t make a noise for God s sake and left the place immediately I followed him he went into a tobacconist s shop between the corner of Whitcombe and Regent-street he came out in two or three minutes caught hold of a young man s arm and they walked on he said to me Which way are you going I made him no answer he stopped and said I am going the reverse way to you he turned round to the right I still followed him he stopped and asked me what I was following him for I told him I wanted to get a constable he turned back again I followed him to Regent-circus when I gave him in charge on cross-examination he said I made a charge on the 12th of July last against a gentleman named Williams of a similar nature I never made any other charge of this sort against any person I have never been summoned to appear against Williams I did not report this case at the barracks last night —the Magistrate discharged the General—the prisoner had made a charge against Williams at our office The letter to the commanding officer was here read stating that the prisoner had charged Major Thackery with an indecent assault and that he must appear before the Magistrate the next morning MR PRENDERGAST to GEORGE FROUD Q Did you hear the prisoner say anything about the charge against Williams A I was not aware of it till he told me himself the same night—he said he was on duty at Marlborough-house Pall-mall and the party accused was brought to the station MR CLARKSON Q What did he say became of that case A He said he never had anything more to do with it the party was held to bail—he was aware he had to go to Marlborough-street next day where he had preferred this charge—it occurred in July last year MR PRENDERGAST Q Did not the prisoner ask you what had become of that case A I asked and he said he could not tell—I believe he said I might find out by looking at the book COURT Q Did he say where the alleged offence occurred with Williams A Yes at Marlborough-house Pall-mall where he was on duty—he said he charged Williams with the same offence—there is a watering-place in Orange-street with three partitions—it is immediately facing the end of Hemming s-row—he said he was in the watering-place and the general put his hand round and caught hold of his private parts—he said I asked him what he meant by it and he left and he followed him—he said nothing as to his construction of what the prosecutor had done what he understood he meant Cross-examined by MR PRENDERGAST Q Is Panton-street in a straight line going from Hemming s-row A If you turn a little to the right it leads you into Green-street—Orange-street is immediately facing the end of Hemming s-row—it is not a direct line from Hemming s-row to Panton-street—Green-street is COURT Q Was the prosecutor going in his way home till he was interrupted by the prisoner A Certainly—Orange-street is separated from Hemming s-row by Castle-street but the watering-place is at the further end from Hemming s-row John Farrow serjeant of the Coldstream Guards John Freeman eating-house keeper Chelsea Charles Brett gardener Chelsea and John Clements hair-dresser Cambridge-road Mile-end gave the prisoner a good character GUILTY Aged

t18461026-2014  2014 JAMES NEWBERY was indicted for feloniously threatening to accuse Edward Davis Protheroe of an unnatural offence with intent to extort money other COUNTS for sending a threatening letter with a like intent MESSRS BODKIN and DOANE conducted the Prosecution EDWARD DAVIS PROTHEROE Esq I am member of Parliament for Halifax—my estate was at Turnwood in Dorsetshire—I have lately sold it—in 1845 during the season I resided in John-street Berkeley-square—I had previously resided in Chapel-street Grosvenor-square—when I left John-street I had some articles of furniture—I arranged with my valet to leave them on the first and second floors of his house and I was to make use of that lodging until I got a new house—in Nov 1845 having left my valet in the country I hired the prisoner temporarily for the job as valet—he went out of town with me—I resided at the house of my aunt at Exeter and afterwards at Cheltenham—I staid at my father s house there and then came to London for a day and then we went down to Turnwood—he was with me one month from some time in Nov until Dec —we returned to town together—I returned with my regular valet—the prisoner had his account paid at Turnwood and parted with me at the Nine Elms station—I lost sight of him for some months except seeing him once or twice in the street I heard nothing of him for three months I believe—I had delivered to me at the Traveller s Club two or three or perhaps four small notes from him requesting the loan of 1l or 2l —I immediately destroyed them—I paid no attention to them—as well as my memory serves me I saw him in the street afterwards and said I was surprised he did not know better than to write to me for assistance at the Traveller s Club that any servant however short a time he had been with me ought to know that he should apply at my lodgings—about July last he called on me at my lodgings at Cottage-road Chester-square—I do not remember what part of the month it was—I should say it was the end of July—I had some conversation with him—I do not think Sir George Hamilton s name was mentioned—he asked me for assistance which I declined alleging that I thought an able smart and active servant ought to have got a place if he chose and I was displeased with his having written another letter to the Traveller s Club asking for a small sum of money after I had forbidden letters to be sent there—I met him in the street in Aug as I was going to the House of Commons—nothing was said on that occasion about Sir George Hamilton—he asked me to give him a written character—I said As long ail am in London any gentleman who pleases to apply to me will hear whit I have to state that you have lived with me a month or six weeks and as far as I know are a decent respectable servant I rather object to giving a written character I will think of the matter —while he was staying with me I rather believe I inadvertently gave him reason to suppose I had more power of getting him a place than I really had—he says so and it seemed to be impressed on his mind—I forget how it arose—I said When a gentleman a friend of mine returns from abroad if you are a good coachman or groom it may be in my power to recommend you and I will do so —Sir George Hamilton at that time was abroad—on the 3rd of Sept he called on roe for a written character—I was in the act of writing it when he called to ask for it—he was bad up into the room—I delivered the character into his hands—this is it—it is dated 3rd September— read— James Newbery was engaged by me last winter to wait on me during my valet s absence He served me at my then house in the county of Dorset and travelled with me to Halifax and when there be always conducted himself with perfect propriety honesty and sobriety during the two months he was with me and I should think would make a superior and valuable servant—EDWARD DAVIS PROTHEROE Cottage-road It in mistake about Halifax—at the time I wrote it I was under the impression that he had been with me longer than he was—I was anxious to give bio the benefit of the best testimony I could having learned from him my character would be of considerable importance to him as his late master bid failed and was out of the way—I made the best character I could—he received the character and I was very much surprised that he did not thank me for it—he complained that I had not got him the situation with my friend and I think he said I had recommended somebody else that I had hired all Sir George Hamilton s servants and one word from me could have got him a place and that I had also bought his horses—my answer was that I had new hired a single servant for that gentleman that unquestionably I had been ready to recommend him but it was a question whether I could recommend him since that period that I had given advice to the stud-groom with regard to sending horses abroad but he might learn that I had not bought any horses for him that Lord Villiers was the person who was employed to buy them—he repeated the same statement doggedly adhering to his assertion—that gave me the impression that he was endeavouring to pick a quarrel or that he was not in his right mind— I have condensed the conversation —as he went out of the room he said something the meaning of which I could hardly understand but which received its explanation from his subsequent conduct—he stood with the door half between him and me—he said I shall call at the Travellers or something of the sort—I think I went out of town and did not go to the Travellers that day—on the next day the 4th this letter was brought to me from the Travellers Club—I believe it is the prisoner s writing—he has stated that it was— read— Sept 4th 1846 Sir I feel very much disappointed in not having the place with Sir George Hamilton after having promised me I should have thought after what has passed between me and you you would have got me the place I shall go to the club or clubs which you belong to and tell them what you are which I can prove I shall likewise let your father and mother know what you are and likewise the public and if you do not do something for me I shall acquaint a lawyer of it you know very well what you wanted me to do to you it is right the public should know who are these persons you said that if I left my mistress you would do something for me you have driven me to do what I have done and you have acted very unhandsome to me I can return to you and if you do not answer by return of post I shall tell the committees of the clubs which you belong to and if you like to vin-dicate yourself I am to be found in Mason s-yard Duke-street St James s certainly I shall disgrace you my address is James Newbery at Mr Collins s Mason s-yard Duke-street St James s —on the receipt of that letter I am not very clear as to the dates as I was going out at that time I took the name and direction down and left the note at home—on my return from the City I stepped into Brooks s-club and wrote a letter to him which I did not send because I thought I would condense it—I afterwards wrote this letter—I accidentally retained the draft of it— read — 12 Cottage-road Chester-square Sept 4 1846 Some one has written in James Newbery s name a threatening letter to Mr Davis Protheroe Mr Davis Protheroe cannot believe that the letter is written by James Newbery The letter is sent to Mr Davis Protheroe s lawyer who has orders to prosecute the writer if necessary Probably the letter is written to gain the benefits of a prison or of transportation—one of which would certainly follow a prosecution if this be the case the writer s wish will not be gratified as Mr Davis Protheroe will treat this and all other letters with perfect indifference and the writer may take what course he likes it will not have any effect on Mr Davis Protheroe Mr Davis Protheroe does not believe it comes from James Newbery as only yesterday morning he received what alone he asked for—a letter of recommendation testifying his good conduct when on a job in Mr Davis Protheroe s service and James Newbery only expressed some disappointment that he had not got a place as coachman to Sir George Hamilton on which he heard from Mr Davis Protheroe that he had never hired one servant for Sir George Hamilton and had recommended James Newbery in the winter when he thought he might suit the place There being therefore no assignable reason nor motive for such an act Mr Davis Protheroe cannot believe the letter comes from James Newbery who must be simply mad if he wrote it Mr Davis Protheroe s answer to the writer is that he will pay no attention to this or any other such letter It is a threatening letter threatening letters are punishable with im-prisonment or transportation and nothing else will they ever get —EDWARD DAVIS PROTHEROE P S Mr Davis Protheroe bad mentioned to James Newbery that letters should be sent to his house and not to the Travellers Club out of kindness as he thought it only creditable and respectable for a servant to seem to have the power of calling on a gentleman at his house It is no annoyance if annoyance is intended for letters to be left at clubs they are often lost and the writer is the sufferer Mr Davis Protheroe s intention seems to have been misunderstood and his good-will thrown away —To James Newbery MR PROTHEROE re-examined On the next day the 5th of Sept the prisoner was shown into my room very much to my surprise—I said Have you received a letter from me in answer to one which you wrote to me —he said he had not—I said I have got a copy of it I am in a very great hurry and have scarcely time to say a single word perhaps the best way is to read what I have written unless you should not receive it —I read the draft to him—I cautioned him not to interrupt me as I was in a very great hurry-while I was reading the passage about my power to get him a situation which is longer than in the letter he repeated the assertion that it was in my power by a word to get him a situation—I thought he really was not in his senses on the subject—before he left the room he said it was all very well when a man was in prosperity and well to do people were his friends but in adversity or poverty no one would give him a guinea and he would serve me out as well as other persons—I said Whatever other persons have done to you I have discharged my duty to you as a gentleman and a master —he said I had behaved in a very ungentlemanly manner to him—I said I must decline saying further—I rose and left and he left the house—I left town on the 7th or 8th I think I left to go to Richmond I left the very night I wrote the letter —I received this letter just before I left my lodgings to go to Cheltenham—it is in the same handwriting as the one which he acknowledges— read— To E D Protheroe 12 Cottage-road Chester-square Pimlico Sir —I have now done what I stated to you I should do that is I have wrote to one of the committee which is Captain C C Berkeley and told him my address if he wished to see me to state further particulars —JAMES NEWBERY —I staid a few days at Cheltenham-when I returned I was prepared at that moment to go abroad—I had my passport ready but I received this letter which arrested my progress—I wish in reference to the last letter which was read to state that in the conversation I had with him he muttered something about writing to Mr Berkley and the Travellers Club— read — To the Gentlemen of the Travellers Club I wish to inform you E D Protheroe is guilty of that crine which is forbidden by God and man I also consider it my duty to let the members know what sort of a man he is for the short time I was with him I have convincing proofs of E D Protheroe it is well known the steward of the other club which he belongs to lost his place through accusing him of an unnatural offence which I can prove he is guilty of I sent him a letter on Thursday of what I intended to do and what I have now stated in this letter I hope the gentlemen of the club will take into consideration what sort of company they are in if he E D P likes to take me up I am to be found at Mr Collins s Mason s-yard Duke-street St James s —on the next day I came to town late in the evening and lost not a moment in ascertaining whether my solicitor was in London and put the matter in his hands—on my solemn oath there is not a particle of truth in the assertions the prisoner has made against me The prisoner cross-examined the witness at great length respecting different acts of familiarity and indecency having taken place between them all of which the witness solemnly denied THOMAS STEVENSON I am valet to Mr Protheroe and have been in his service twenty years—I am a married man—I was married last year—I was down at Mr Protheroe s house at Turnwood when he brought the prisoner as a temporary servant WILLIAM HILLIARD I am porter at the Traveller Club—I know the prisoner In Sept last he brought a letter to the club for Mr Protheroe—I do not recollect the date—I think it was in the early part of the month—the letter was conveyed to Mr Protheroe s house or delivered to a servant of his—at the time he brought the letter I think he remarked that Mr Protheroe had not performed a promise that he had made to him which was obtaining him a situation with Sir George Hamilton—I saw him several times afterwards—he came and asked questions as to who the committee of the club were—I handed him a list of the club—he looked it over and selected two names—one was Captain Barclay and the other Mr T P Courtenay—ha said from the disappointment he had received from the non-performance of Mr Protheroe s promise he felt so aggravated he should certainly write to those two gentlemen and acquaint them of a certain thing respecting Mr Protheroe not naming what it was but a certain thing —that he would be disgraced by such statement or words to that effect—he said on one occasion I think on that I am sorry I did not take the 5l and moreover stated that he was determined to see the thing out and unless Mr Protheroe satisfied him he would disgrace him—for that the steward next door that was the Reform Club had lost his situation through making an accusation against Mr Protheroe but his was on a stronger foundation and he should certainly follow it up unless Mr Protheroe satisfied him—I supposed he meant some emolument—I said I thought he was acting an unwise part that at all times a servant was placed in a weak situation against a gentleman let it be what it might—his answer was he was so firmly satisfied and could so firmly establish it he would not refrain from it unless he was as I understood provided for—it amounted to that Prisoner I deny saying anything about making any emolument Witness I am quite certain he said it EDWARD DAVIS PROTHEROE re-examined I never made any tender or offered the prisoner 5l on any occasion—I do not understand what he alludes to THOMAS PEREGRINE COURTENAY ESQ I am nephew of the Earl of Devon and am a member of the committee of the Travellers Club I received this letter on the 5th of Sept —it is dated the 7th—I was aware Mr Protheroe was a member of the club but was not acquainted with him myself—I sent the letter to Mr Long a friend of Mr Protheroe s—about the 18th of Sept at the request of Mr Protheroe I sent the prisoner a letter appointing him to call—on the day appointed he arrived at the club and was shown into the committee-room—I asked him his name showed him this letter and asked whether he wrote it—he said he bad—I then read it to him and said You admit that that is the letter you wrote —he said it was The prisoner in an unconnected address persisted in charging Mr Protheroe with certain acts of indelicacy and familiarity with him declaring the truth of all his assertions GUILTY Aged 24 — Transported for Twenty Years Before Mr Justice Erle

MR CLARKSON conducted the Prosecution ELIZA LYNN I am the daughter of a clergyman the vicar of Keswick in Cumberland—I have recently been residing at 35 Montague-place Russell-square and have been in the habit of pursuing a course of reading at the British Museum by permission of the Trustees—there is a gate appropriated for the entrance of the readers to the reading-room—I think I know the gate-keeper Dingle by sight—I went there last Wednesday week the 11th of Aug —I found the prisoner at the gate—after I had entered the gate he ran after me with a letter—this now produced is it—the envelope is addressed to me by name Miss Lynn Reading-room British Museum and this is the note that was enclosed—I read part of the contents of the letter and immediately communicated what had happened to the attendants at the Museum JOHN WINTER JONES I am the senior assistant in the department of Printed Books at the British Museum—the prisoner was a supernumerary attendant—it was his duty to be in the library and hand the books into the reading-room—I have seen him write frequently and know his writing the note produced is his writing I have no doubt of it whatever Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q How often have you seen him write A He has been at the place many years—I must have seen him write twenty thirty or forty times—he makes entries in a book connected with the particulars of the works used in the reading-room—I have received letters from him from time to time and I know that he spells very inaccurately—I have no doubt or question at all about this letter being his writing ANTONIO PANIZZI ESQ I am the keeper of the Printed Books at the Museum and know the prisoner very well—a man of the name of Buckler keeps the reading-gate as it is called—there are two porters one at the gate and another at the room inside called the cloak-room—on Wednesday week Buckler had a holiday and was away from the gate for three days—his leave of absence expired on the Friday—the

Supposing it was intimated that money was to be left at a box where there was a porter at gate it would have fallen into his hands that day A Yes up to the evening of Thursday the porter at the gate would be the prisoner himself—I saw Mr Jardine the Magistrate put his initials to the letter ROBERT CAWTON I am an attendant in the Printed Book department at the Museum—I know the prisoner and his writing—to the best of my belief this letter produced is the prisoner writing Cross-examined Q Do you entertain any doubt about it A None whatever The letter was here read — Miss Lynn Reading-rooms British Museum —Miss Lynn I have wached you for some time with Mr Barnard I have seen all your tricks andmaneuvers I have followed you from the readingroom abont the streets with Mr Barnard I have seen where you have gone to with him I have herd your conversation with him in fact I have seen more than you are aware of and know more than you think for and I must say you ought to be ashamed of yourself to first and go on so with a married man as Mr Barnard is with a family of young children as he has got and his wife a nice lady that ever lived It is wrong of you to allow him to act as he does If it was known to his wife and family you would suffer for it most sevearly and your own family what would they say to it all and more particularly your brother what would he say to all this going on He does not in the least suspect you of acting in this way like a common girl of the town indeed you in some respects are worse for they do not often take up with married men if they know it Now Miss I shall write to your brother and explain all to him and write to your family and explain all to them unless you do one thing and that only shall save you I know of a very poor family who is in the greatest distress brought on by the bad conduct of the father who died six months age all through his extravagant ways by keeping another woman and suffering his poor wife and family to want Now if you will enclose a five pound note or as much near that sum as you can conveniently spair and leave it at the little box close to the iron gate as you enter to go to the reading-rooms—leave it either with the old man at that box or with the young man that is there during the day of wednesday the 11th of August or Thursday the 12th and direct it to Mr J Smith till called for and if not left

CRISPIN RAWLEY I am an inspector of police I took the prisoner into custody about three o clock on Wednesday the 11th of August—I told him that he must consider himself in my custody for knowingly sending the letter to the lady—he admitted that he had given it to her but said that a man he did not know had given it him—I searched him and found on him a pocket-book of memorandums from which I should say that he was not a person who was in want MR BALLANTINE submitted that the letter did not contain such a menace as was contemplated by the statute The COURT considered that it was for the Jury to put their construction upon the wording of the letter and that if in their opinion it contained a threat to charge a criminal intercourse with the party named then that it was a menace within the meaning of the Act of Parliament Cases referred to —The King v Pickford 4 Car & Payne 257 The King v Sutherton 2 Russell on Crimes 706 and the Queen v Hamilton 1 car and Payne Edward Turner Esq No

was brought to me in pencil—it stated that he wished to see me about three o clock before the church on the Green and then I received a second note wishing to know whether I would come out or he would call next day with a friend—the next day I saw him in the road on returning home—he was alone—I asked what he was waiting for—he said he would tell me what he was waiting for when his brother came—his brother had frequently made an accusation against me and the prisoner has threatened me that he had it id his power to accuse me of improper conduct towards his brother—he said it was exposing myself to his brother John—I saw the prisoner again about three or four o clock in the afternoon with his brother John on the north side of Bethnal-green—he then said he would have 10l and nothing less as he was going to Australia and if he had not that money he had stones in his pocket and he would break my windows—that he was so determined to go to Australia that if I would give him 10l he would never annoy me again and his brother would sign any document that I chose to draw up—we then agreed that I should go home and draw up this document and meet them at the Greyhound with this document—I went home and wrote the document—this is it produced —Rickman and Frederick signed it—I gave them 10l —I offered 5l at first and Rickman said he would have the other five and I crave 10l which Rickman took—it was five sovereigns and a 5l note—on former occasions the prisoner had threatened me that if I did not give money they would charge me with exposing my person and it was under that threat that

more to say to convict me more than what has been said to convict me I never extorted any money from him nor did I ever threaten him my first place of meeting Mr Phillips was in the Hackney-road I then mentioned to him the circumstance of my younger brother being in a situation in the Hackney-road I told him that my brother had given me to understand that he Mr Phillips had acted in a very indecent Way towards my brother Mr Phillips said I have known you for some years for God s sake don t say anything about it I said Well Mr Phillips I have no wish to injure you in any way no more than if you will not interfere with my younger brother any more as you must be well aware the manner in which you have acted towards him is of a most filthy description he then asked me if I was doing anything I said No I was out of a situation he said Meet me to-morrow at the Queen s Head and I will talk to you upon the subject I met him there and he asked me what I would have to drink I told him whatever he was going to drink I would drink with him he then said Mr Moore as you are out of a situation these two pounds I give to you may be of service to you he gave me 2l but I in no way extorted them from him Before I left him he said that at any time I met him and wanted money and it was in his power I should have it I then told him provided he did not annoy my brother any more I never sent the two letters in pencil to him I never asked him for the 10l I was at the Salmon and Ball public-house at the time he got out of the omnibus I came out and walked behind him intending to go across the Park as I was passing his house he stood at the parlour-window he beckoned to me—he came out at his gate went up the Green then turned round and beckoned me again he then said If I let you have 10l will you sign a paper I said Yes I would I have nothing more to say at present GUILTY Aged 21 Transported for Fifteen Years

having attempted and having solicited him to commit the said crime and varying the manner of stating the charge MESSRS BODKIN and RICKARDS conducted the Prosecution WILLIAM GRANT police-sergeant A 5 On the night of 9th Jan I was on duty at the station-house in King-street St James s The Rev Mr Sellers was brought there in the custody of an officer named Cronin—the prisoner came with them and made a charge against Mr Sellers—he said I charge this person with indecently assaulting me —I asked him in what way—he said he was on duty at the Duchess of Kent s residence and the gentleman passed him and went down as far as the Park-gate leading into St James s-park that he then turned back under the Duke of Sutherland s wall and when he got opposite the portico of the Duchess of Kent s he crossed over to him and stood under the portico that he then said to him that it was a wet night and he Cooper said Yes it is Sir that the gentleman asked him who he was keeping guard over and he said The Duchess of Kent Sir and that the gentleman repeated the expression altering the word Kent and substituting an indecent word that the gentleman then caught hold of him by his private parts and he then caught hold of him and took him to the guard-room—Mr Sellers said he did not indecently assault him neither did he make use of that beastly word which the soldier said he did—I asked the gentleman his name and he said Am I obliged to give my name —I said You are not obliged to give it here unless you choose but you will be obliged to give it to-morrow —he refused to give it—I saw him searched by the constable who brought him and two 5l -notes some gold and a gold watch were taken from him—he was detained at the station that night Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q What time of night was this A About half-past eleven o clock it was raining and I think it had been for about an hour—Mr Sellers had no umbrella he had a fine cloth greatcoat on—when a person is given in charge on such a charge at this we are bound to take him before a Magistrate WILLIAM DYOTT BURNABY I am chief-clerk at Bow-street police-office On 10th Jan Mr Sellers was brought there before Mr Henry the Magistrate in charge of Grant—there was no name on the charge-sheet at first and I asked him his name—he said l am a clergyman am I obliged to give it the Magistrate said You are obliged to give it and he then gave his name Rev Henry Charles Sellers curate at Send near Guildford —the prisoner was then sworn and examined as a witness—I took his statement down and he signed it— reads— Samuel Cooper on his oath saith as follows I am a private in the second battalion Scotch Fusilier Guards I was posted as sentry last night 9th Jan at the Duchess of Kent s door in Palace-yard about half-past ten I observed the defendant coming towards me smoking a cigar He went towards the Milkhouse-gate leading to the Park and through one gate and returned immediately by another and walked by the side of the wall of the Duke of Sutherland s house He crossed over towards me and said to me It is a wet night I said it was At this time I was standing under the portico of the Duchess of Kent s house and he was still smoking He asked me who I was keeping guard over I replied The Duchess of Kent He said Did you say the Duchess of substituting another word I said No Sir the Duchess of Kent He immediately caught hold of my private parts as he said those words and I at the same time seised him by the collar and took him to the guard-room where I left him in charge of the sergeant of the guard At the time he laid hold of me by the private parts he did not say a word to me On my way with him to the guard-room he said I have done nothing to you I said You have Sir I think he was perfectly sober at the time I had my great-coat on and the defendant put his hand under it when he seized me by the private parts I have been twelve years in the regiment and in the same batallion —Mr Sellers was called on to find bail to answer the charge at the Sessions himself in 500l and two sureties of 250l each Cross-examined Q Did Mr Sellers make any statement A Yes I took it down in writing—he was duly cautioned— reads— I asked him the question who he was keeping guard over and when he answered I repeated the same words that he did Such a thought as he alleges against me never entered my head I am completely at the mercy of the man I utterly deny the charge I had a cigar in my mouth I remained some time under the shelter of the portico I was going as far as Pimlico but it rained fast and I stood for shelter under the portico I stayed there sometime and then I spoke to the man and he seized me I am a clergyman and curate of Send near Guildford —I have got the charge-sheet here—when it was brought to me I fancy there was no name on it looking at it —I may be mistaken in that—I find here in my own handwriting Send near Guildford a clergyman —it is my impression that there was no name because the name of Henry Sadler is in another handwriting— The charge-sheet being read the name of Henry Sadler Send near Guildford clergyman appeared as the party charged with indecently assaulting the complainant while on duty in the Stable-yard in the parish of St James s Signed S Cooper JOSEPH KILLSBY I am in the employ of the clerk of the peace for the county of Middlesex I produce two bills of indictment one presented at the Clerkenwell January Session and the other at the adjourned Jan Session it Westminster— These being read charged Mr Sellers with indecently assaulting Samuel Cooper both were endorsed Not Found The names on the back of the first bill were Paul Cronin and William Grant and on the second Samuel Cooper William Grant and Paul Cronin Cross-examined Q Did you prepare the indictments No the person who did is not here—they are prepared by the instructions of the policeman and witnesses in the indictment-office REV HENRY CHARLES SELLERS I reside at Send near Guildford I am curate of that parish and have been so nine months—before that I was curate at Sibble Headingham near Halstead in Essex for three years—I am of the University of Cambridge—I have been married a year and a half—I came to London from Send on 9th Jan in consequence of a communication which I received from Sibble Headingham where my wife was staying with her sister being in delicate health—I arrived in London by the train which arrives at Waterloo-station at half-past six o clock but I think it was rather late—I proceeded to the Bell and Crown Holborn and engaged a bed-room there for the night—I bad a carpet-bag with me which I left there—I then went as far as Oxford-street and made a call at a shop there—I then went to a tavern in Rupert-street Coventry-street to get some dinner—I should think it was between nine and ten when I had finished my dinner—I then went down as far as the Treasury—I have a friend named Middleton residing at Upper Eaton-street Grosvenor-place—it was my intention to visit him—from the Treasury I returned and went along Pall-mall to St James s along the path that leads under the portico of the Duchess of Kent s house—as I passed under the portico I saw there was a soldier there—I went through the iron gates into the Park and then returned because I fancied the rain increased—I came back to the same portico and remained under it—the soldier was there still—whether I said to him It is a wet night or he first addressed me I am not positive but I said before that I addressed him saying It is a wet night —my doubt is whether I addressed him saying that or whether I assented to what he said—he said It is or words to that effect—I then asked him who he was keeping guard over and he said The Duchess of Kent and I repeated the words after him Oh the Duchess of Kent —on my oath I did not in the slightest degree alter the pronunciation of that word I did not think it—he seized me by the collar and used words that I do not exactly recollect to the purport of my having indecently touched or assaulted him—on my oath I had not touched him or attempted to do so—he proceeded to take me to the guard-room—I believe we passed another sentry at his post but I did not notice—we found a lot of soldiers in the guard-room—the prisoner asked for the sergeant and said I charge this man with indecently assaulting me —I denied it and asked to see the officer of the guard—I was told it was a police-case I could not see the officer—a policeman was sent for and I was given into his custody—while I was in the guard-house 1 did not hear the prisoner charge me with having made use of any indecent expression—I was then taken to the station-house—the prisoner went with me and made a charge against me—I was asked ray name—I said Am I obliged to give it or something to that effect—they said You are not obliged to give it now but you will have to give it in the morning at the Court —I then refused to give it—this produced is the watch I had with me and I also had some bank-notes and money—I was detained at the station that night and taken to Bow-street on the following morning—at the station before I went to Bow-street in the morning a policeman came and said to me So you refuse to give any name and I said You may say Henry Sadler —at Bow-street Mr Henry the magistrate questioned me about my real name—I first gave the name of Henry Sadler—Mr Henry then asked me if that was my real name and I said l am a clergyman am I obliged to give my real name —he said Yes and I immediately gave it and my address—the prisoner was then examined in support of the charge—I was called upon to find bail—I remained in confinement till that was done and was then liberated—when I left Rupert street after my dinner it was drizzling or raining a little I think—I afterwards got a cigar on my way lighted it and was smoking Cross-examined Q Where did you get the cigar A In Princes-street I think at the corner of Coventry-street immediately after I left Rupert-street—I then proceeded to the Treasury—I had no business in that neighbourhood I merely went for a walk—before I got to the Duchess of Kent s I had lighted another cigar—I merely went to the Treasury and turned back—it was drizzling a little the whole time—I had no umbrella—when I got into the open part I perceived it had increased—I had passed the spot where I saw the soldier standing on the first occasion—I first took up my position some distance from the soldier but when I spoke to him I turned round—I had my back to him at first—I do not suppose I was altogether under the portico more than three minutes—I was not above half a yard from him when I spoke to biro—I do not recollect how I was standing or how my hands were—I do not know whether I was near enough to reach him with my arm—I do not think it is at all possible that I could have touched him accidentally—I swear I did not touch him—I could not have touched him but intentionally—I had no notion of such a charge until he mentioned it—I should say positively I did not touch him while speaking to him—I knew that this was the Duchess of Kent s—I am not a stranger to London—Mr Middleton did not expect me he is a bachelor—I did not send for him this evening—I did not say when the charge was made against me that I was going to see Mr Middleton—this matter occurred at a little after half-past ten—I intended to return to Holborn to sleep—I had not when I came out intended to call on Mr Middleton MR BODKIN Q Was the portico the first place of shelter you reached after leaving the park A Yes—I certainly did not insert my hand under the prisoner s coat and place it on his private parts—it was utterly impossible for anything of the sort to have happened by accident—before I went into the country 1 was curate at St Ann s Soho for two years—I merely asked the prisoner as I was standing there who he was guarding—it was not for the purpose of information—I believe it was half-past eleven when the charge was preferred against me at the station JOHN GEORGE MIDDLETON I am the son of the late Admiral Middleton and live at 6 Upper Eaton-street Grosvenor-place I have known Mr Sellers intimately for twelve years—I was at the same college with him at Cambridge and have kept up my intimacy ever since—I visited him at Send just before Christmas—he constantly visited me on his coming to town at different hours—I usually dine at the Parthenon Club in Regent-street and spend the greater part of the evening there—I invariably return home after ten o clock—Mr Sellers would most probably know that he may occasionally have visited me as late as that Cross-examined Q Did he ever visit you so late A Yes I think it was on the night before the funeral of the Duke of Sussex—I did not then expect him—I was living in the same place then—I live in apartments quite alone—when I dine at the Parthenon I generally remain there till near ten—I was at home on this night WILLIAM PRICK I am a private in the second battalion of the Fusileer Guards the same battalion to which the prisoner belonged—I have been in the battalion eight years on 15th April On the night of 9th Jan I was on duty at Sir Henry Wheatley s door which is between the sentinel at the Duchess of Kent s door and the guard-house—about twenty or twenty-five minutes past ten I saw the prisoner pass by where I was posted close to me with the gentleman—he had hold of his collar with his left hand and had his gun in his right—I cannot say whether the bayonet was fixed or not—a man is supposed to have it fixed when he is sentinel—supposing a sentinel wants assistance it is his duty to call to the next sentinel and if he is too far off to hear him there are plenty of people passing by—I was near enough to hear him if he had called—if I had heard him call I should have called to the next sentinel who was at the guard-house door—a sentinel is not allowed under any circumstances to leave his post—I left my post that night at about ten minutes to twelve—I then went to the guard-house—the prisoner was there and said he was very sorry he had had anything to do with taking the gentleman in charge but the old b—did not offer to spring up with anything or be would have let him go he said it was a pity but what he had been on the Colour-post or some other post where there had not been so many people about when he would have had all the b—lot he had got money rings watch and all—he said it was a beautiful little gold watch about the size of a half-crown—I said to him A watch is a very dangerous thing to have anything to do with —he said Oh I would have put that out of sight for three or four days I would have swallowed it —he stated that the gentleman had refused to give his name when he got to the station but he gave it after a time and he said what he saw taken from him—that he would not give it up but it was taken from him by force—he said he saw some notes gold silver a half-mourning ring and a watch—that was all I heard him say—I was tired and went and laid down Cross-examined Q Did any one else hear that A There were several sitting round the fire near enough to hear but I did not notice who they were—it was said quite publicly—I do not know what I meant by saying a watch was a dangerous thing to have I merely said it—he would have the means of putting other things out of the way but a watch he could not—I made the observation on the supposition of his having come by it dishonestly—I did not mention this conversation to anybody till it might be nine days afterwards when we were all talking together round the guard-room fire—I first told Whitlock a corporal—I cannot say whether Mr Sellers case had then been disposed of—I did not hear what became of it—I did not know Mr Sellers was to be brought up the day after this conversation took placeit is a rule I believe for a man to appear when he has committed himself—I did not inquire where he was to be taken to—I have been in trouble several times through being absent and drunk—I think I am between twenty-five or twenty-six years old—I never quarrelled with the prisoner—I never was in his company—he belongs to one company and I to another—I never said I would do for him or anything of the kind—I never said I would give him a lift some day—I never asked him to lend me money—if I wanted to borrow money there are men in my own company to lend it me—I never asked him for money—he has never refused to let me have any—I cannot say whether any of the other men who heard him say what I have repeated are here—I did not take notice who they were—I did not take any notice or speak when the prisoner passed me with Mr Sellers—I was in my box at the time—I made no observation when he came back again without Mr Sellers JOHN STEWART I am a private in the Fusileers in the same battalion as the prisoner—I remember a conversation on the subject of this charge in the barrack a day or two after the 9th Jan —there were several soldiers present beside the prisoner—the prisoner stated that he was on sentry at the Duchess of Kent s about ten o clock and a gentleman came up to him at his post and remarked that it was a wet evening and inquired whom he was gentry over to which he replied The Duchess of Kent and the gentleman replied Oh the Duchess of— that the gentleman then put his hand under his the prisoner s great coat on his private parts on which he took him into custody and took him to the guard-room—he then described the property that was taken from the gentleman at the police-station—he said there were notes gold and silver I cannot recollect the amount and that there was also a gold watch and he said if he bad been on the Colours a b - - -y end to him but he should have had the whole lot gold watch and all—there is a post called the Colours in the yard of the grand entrance of St James s Palace—it is in what is called Colour-court —it is a more private place than where he was on sentry Q Have you ever upon former occasions when he has come off guard seen money in his possession A I have on one occasion and have heard him make statements as to the mode in which he has become possessed of money MR BALLANTINE objected to the reception of evidence of this nature it having no relevancy to the particular charge and only tending to create a prejudice against the prisoner in the minds of the Jury by bringing two felonies before them at the same time MR BODKIN urged its admissibility as showing the intention of the prisoner in the act which he did in the same way as more than one uttering was proved in cases of forgery or uttering counterfeit COM MR JUSTICE CRESSWELL was of opinion that the question being whether the act done was done with a view to produce a particular result it was material to show out of the prisoner s own mouth that he was aware that the course he was pursuing was likely to bring about that result and that upon that ground the evidence was relevant and admissible Q What have you heard the prisoner state on other occasions as to the mode in which he obtained money A On one occasion about the year 1845 at the Wellington barracks St James Park he had some money in his hand and he said he was on sentry at the milk-house gate and saw a gentleman coming along in the direction of the Duchess of Kent s that when he came up to him he seized him by the collar took him to his sentry-box and either got or took his money from him—I saw the money—I recollect there was a sovereign there might have been more Cross-examined Q Did you inform your superior officer then that this man had committed a robbery A No—I did not inform the police—I certainly considered it was a robbery—I was a corporal once—I was degraded from that rank—I have been tried once by a Court-martial for not reporting myself to the proper officer on returning off duty and for absence—that was when I was degraded—that is the only time I have been tried by Courtmartial—I have had no other charge against me—I have never been in the custody of the police—I was never charged with forgery or anything of the kind JOSEPH WALKER I am a private in the same battalion and company that the prisoner belonged to—I was at the guard-house on the night of 9th Jan —the prisoner was there—I came in that night off sentry about ten minutes past twelve—the prisoner said he had given a gentleman in charge that night who had given up some notes gold and silver and a watch and if he had been on the Colour-post he would have had the lot—in the barrack-room a few days after he stated if he had got a sovereign Mr Sellers might have gone to hell—when he has come off duty I have heard him say that he has got money from people he did not say how he got it—I heard him say so as many as three times and when he has come off duty I have seen him with silver Cross-examined Q Have you ever shown money in the same way A No nor anything else—some of my comrades might have done so but they are not here and I do not wish to speak against them—I cannot say whether they have or not COURT Q Have other soldiers in your company said the same sort of thing A Why yes MR BALLANTINE Q Did not you once show a watch to some of your comrades A I have never had a watch since I have been a soldier I never showed one—I never asked the prisoner or anybody else to get rid of one for me THOMAS BRYANT I am a private in the same battalion with Cooper and have been so twenty years—I was in the guard-room the same evening this charge was made against Mr Sellers and heard Cooper say if he could have got a sovereign the man might have gone to hell and if he had been on the colour-post he would have had all he had got—I have heard him speak on different occasions of his having got money while on guard—I never heard him say in what way he got it THOMAS DUNAWAY I am lance-sergeant of the second battalion of Fusileer Guards—the prisoner was under my orders—it is my duty to station the men at the different posts in the stable-yard and that neighbourhood—I have heard Cooper boast that he has taken money of the public while on guard—he never represented in what way—he said he had done so and would do so—I have heard him say if any one spoke to him while he was on duty he would knock them down GEORGE THOMAS BEAUMONT I am clerk to Mr Cocker Mr Sellers attorney—on the day Mr Sellers was committed I went to the Bell and Crown in Holborn and obtained a carpet bag there—I asked for it in Mr Sellers name—I took it to the house of Detention to Mr Sellers—I also paid for a bed on Mr Sellers account MR BALLANTINE submitted that this indictment framed under 7 and 8 Geo IV c 9 sec 8 was not supported by the evidence the charge preferred by the prisoner against Mr Sellers only amounting to an indecent assault and not to a solicitation to commit the crime imputed MR JUSTICE CRESSWELL considered that the very nature of the assault might involve a solicitation and that he must so leave it to the Jury GUILTY Aged 29 — Transported for Fifteen Years

prisoner I was an omnibus conductor I have known Bennett three years and a half—when I first knew him he was checktaker at the Adelphi Theatre—I had lost sight of him for five or six months when he accidentally rode outside my omnibus—I had seen him and Sullivan five or six months or more before I went to Mr Wyatt s but had had no further communication with them than drinking with them—about fourteen months ago I went to Mr Wyatt s shop with Sullivan—I asked Mr Wyatt for a cheroot—Sullivan said I will have one also and I paid for one for him—he then asked for an ounce of bird s-eye tobacco Mr Wyatt served him—he went out saying My friend will pay for it meaning me—I said That is very fine —I remained five or six minutes with Mr Wyatt—I merely said it was a fine evening—I went out and found Sullivan outside waiting for me—he said Harry if that is not an old puff my name is not Jack Sullivan for you can see sodomy printed on his face —I said I do not think so I do not understand such things —he said Then you should come under my jurisdiction and I will make your fortune to which I made him no reply—I tried to pass the conversation off and get rid of him as fast as I could—I then left him—next night I went to Mr Wyatt s and purchased a cigar—we got into conversation—I stopped and took some gin-and-water with him and smoked a couple of cigars—there was no light in the parlour but there was the reflection of the gas which was quite sufficient—half-a-crown passed from Mr Wyatt to me on that occasion—I then left the shop and met with Sullivan—he said Ah you have been into the old man s and have got some money —thinking that he had been watching me I said I had—he said Then I ll have half —we changed the half-crown—I had a pint of porter and I gave him 1s 2d —he said If you will take my advice we can make 20l or 30l out of the old man —I said No I ll have nothing more to do with him —he said Then if you don t I will have you nailed —I made him no reply but parted with him—about a week or ten days afterwards I met Bennett Jones and Sullivan between six and seven in the evening in Coventry-street—Sullivan said to Bennett and Jones Harry meaning me has a good case that I have told him of if you will pay attention to me we can make a good thing of it —I tried to pass the conversation off to something else—I heard no reply and made none—Sullivan talked to Bennett by himself but I did not hear—we all went to a public-house and had something to drink—we left there and went to the Catherine-wheel in the Haymarket but there was no more talk with regard to this—about a week or ten days afterwards I met Sullivan and Jones somewhere in Leicester-square—Sullivan said Well have you been to the old man s again —I said No I have not —he said Then if you don t you must put up with the consequences you have already extorted half-a-crown and I have got you in my power —about a fortnight afterwards I met Sullivan Bennett and Jones at the corner of Piccadilly by the Bull and Mouth—Sullivan spoke to Bennett about it but I could only catch a few words—he said nothing to me—we all went to Wyatt s—Jones said Mr Wyatt if you could oblige us with some money I should be obliged to you you know what it is for regarding you and Tiddiman it is of no use to hesitate —Mr Wyatt said he had not got it—Jones said We must have it —Mr Wyatt went into the parlour and fetched out some silver from a sideboard —he was rather nervous—on receiving it we all left the shop—Jones gave me 2s 4d as my share—I did not see any money given to the others—about a month afterwards I met Sullivan again in Lancaster-place by Waterloo-bridge—he said Now Harry will you come down to the old man with me and get some money —I hesitated about going—we went—I went into the shop and Sullivan waited at a public-house a few doors off—I asked Mr Wyatt how he was—he said Rather poorly —I said If you could oblige me with a little more money I should feel obliged to you —he said I have none —I afterwards received some I think it was a sovereign—I left the shop and went to Sullivan in the public-house—Sullivan said Well how much have you got —I told him a sovereign—he said You ought to have got more and I believe you have —I gave him 10s —he wanted me to go again but I would not—I afterwards visited Mr Wyatt s shop with Jones—I should not like to say it was more than once it might be a week or ten days after the last transaction—Jones said Will you let me have any more money Mr Wyatt —Mr Wyatt replied No —Jones said The fact of it is you must for taking indecent liberties with Tiddiman—Mr Wyatt went to the cheffioneer and brought out half-a-sovereign and some silver—I received 3s and the rest was to be divided with Sullivan—I did not see it shared—I knew Laidler first of all—one evening I was at a ball 1st or 2nd March with Bennett—Sullivan and Jones were not there—Bennett said Now Harry here is a young man meaning Laidler who we met there and he has no objection to set the part of a solicitor for us to intimidate the old man and woman out of 40l or 50l —Laidler replied that he would do so—Bennett proposed that Jones should act as clerk to the solicitor—two or three days alter Jones and Laidler went us to Wyatt s but a week previous or perhaps a little more than that I met Sullivan and he said it would be a good dodge for any one to go and act as solicitor as there was a woman in the case —Jones and Laidler went to Wyatt s I waited outside with Sullivan by agreement—Sullivan told Laidler to go in and get some money and said we would wait till he came out and said Mind you don t come out without it —Laidler came out and said he had got a sovereign all he could get—Sullivan called him on one side and whispered something to him—we went to a public-house shared the sovereign and parted—either the same night or the next we all met again by appointment at a public-house in Long Acre and it was agreed that we should all go—Sullivan gave Laidler instructions to draw up an I O U for 50l provided Mr Wyatt had not got 50l ready cash in the house which after some hesitation Laidler agreed to do not willingly—it was drawn out for 40l first—I made no reply I was picking some cigars out of a cigar-case at the back of the bar—I think the publican s name was Purnall—I then went with them to Mr Wyatt s—I believe Laidler walked on first before Sullivan Bennett Jones and me—he stopped a few doors before the shop till we arrived—Jones and Laidler went in and me Sullivan and Bennett remained outside—in about ten minutes Laidler came out and said to Sullivan I have told the woman all about it —Laidler said to me Now Harry you must come in —I said I would not—afterwards by the persuasion of Sullivan I went in with Bennett—Sullivan was outside he said he would not come in—Laidler went back with us—he and Jones talked to the woman in private—I saw tears in Mrs Legg s eyes and heard Laidler say It is a case not fit for a woman to be mixed up in and this is the young man that can prove it pointing to me—Mr Wyatt was standing by the parlour at the corner of the counter—he could hear what passed—he appeared rather nervous—Laidler asked him for some money—I do not know how much—Mr Wyatt replied he had not got any—Laidler said Then I will draw up an I O U for 40l —one of them I cannot say which said No it shall be for 50l an I O U was drawn up by Jones for 50l —this is it produced —this is Samuel Wyatt s signature to it—there were two I O U s —one was for 40l —after that Bennett asked for a sovereign—Mr Wyatt said he had not got one but he would see what silver he had—he gave Bennett 7s or 8s and gave Laidler a 10l -note—I do not think Mrs Legg was aware that the 10l -note was given—we all left the shop and found Sullivan outside—we all went to a public-house and then to a coffee-shop where Jones said to Sullivan We have been to the old man and made him give us an I O U for 50l —Sullivan said Then of course I stand in —Jones and Laidler replied Yes —next day I went to Wyatt s with Laidler Sullivan Jones and Bennett—Laidler and Jones went in by themselves the others remained outside—they came out and said they had got 25s or 26s which was shared amongst us—Laidler and Jones called Sullivan on one side and spoke to him privately—a few days afterwards I saw Laidler and Jones again but I do not remember anything being said about the affair—after this we met of a night at Laidler s house—we kept meeting together daily—on the night I was taken we all five went to Mr Wyatt s—Laidler and Jones went in we remained outside—Jones came out and met me and Bennett half-way up the street and said in Sullivan s hearing Now then you must come in there is the money all ready waiting —Sullivan came in afterwards—I said I would sooner have nothing to do with it go in by yourselves I will go my way you go your s —Sullivan said No go on go on and I accordingly went in—Mrs Legg said Walk into the parlour gentlemen —I went in with Bennett—Sullivan stopped in the shop we walked into the parlour—Mrs Legg said Now gentlemen I want an explanation of the case who is the solicitor in the case —Laidler said I am —she said What demand have you upon my uncle —one but I cannot say who said 24l —I am sure it was not me—Mrs Legg said Where are your chambers —Laidler said I have already told you 5 Cecil-court St Martin s-lane —at that two officers came from behind the curtain and took us into custody—that ended the transaction Cross-examined by MR WOOLLETT Q When were you first applied to to give evidence A Yesterday—my counsel applied to me—I am to have no reward—no promise was held out to me—I swear that—I was advised to give evidence and to speak the truth the whole facts of my being led into the case—it was simply for the pure administration of justice—I have pleaded guilty and confessed the whole matter from beginning to end and the manner I have been led into it and the tool I have been made—Sullivan is old enough to be my father and ought to know better—I was twenty-one when I first became acquainted with him—I was not aware they were that class of people—I solemnly swear no reward or promise was held out to me—I saw Mr Wontner the solicitor for the prosecution and gave him a statement—I was applied to to give evidence—my counsel did not tell me it would be better for me to do so—he asked me whether there was not one leader of it and I said Yes Sullivan —the first time I was seduced was fourteen months ago—I recollect the conversation that took place then within a word or two—I am sometimes not very quick of hearing—there are no other transactions of this kind in which I have been engaged—I have never been in custody—I do not know Gardner at all—I can give no dates to any of these interviews and yet I recollect the conversations—I was the first that took the half-crown and that I was seduced to do—the next sum I took was 10s —I cannot say exactly—I was seduced to do that—during the whole of these proceedings I have been led into it—I am quite a seduced man Cross-examined by MR PRENDERGAST JUN Q The second sum from Mr Wyatt was a sovereign A Yes if I swore it was 10s it was a mistake—it was 10s or 12s on another occasion—I very much compassioned poor Mrs Legg when I saw her with tears in her eyes—I wanted to get out of it but I was intimidated by the threat I was between one thing and another and did not know what to do—Sullivan said unless I went on with it he would have me prosecuted for extorting money from Mr Wyatt—I do not know what he meant—he said If you do not go again and get some more money I will have you nailed —intimidated at that I went again—I had done nothing then only received the half-crown—that was the transaction he threatened me with if I did not go on—I had known Sullivan about twelve months before I went to Mr Wyatt—I met him with Bennett somewhere about Coventry-street—when I first went to Mr Wyatt s with Sullivan it was between four and five o clock in the afternoon I was going to Fetter-lane to see a young man who drove a Parcels Delivery cart and Sullivan walked with me—we passed this cigar-shop accidentally—we both went in together—I cannot swear who went in first—I took a cigar first—I paid for them—Sullivan then went out—no mention had been made between us of a tobacconist—I had not been in the habit of going to the shop till that occasion—I had come from Fetter-lane—we went in there by accident to get a cigar—I remained after he left merely talking about a fine night and I said to Mr Wyatt One would not think this was a cigar-shop the windows are so dark or something of that sort which took a minute or two Laidler Q How long have you known me A Before any of them—I first met you at a house in Silver-street kept by a man named Harris more than three years ago—I swear it was not ten years ago or seven it may be three and a half—next time I saw you I met you in the street accidentally—I said How do you do and we went and had a glass of something to drink—the third time I met you at Gurney s house in Maddox-street and you said you were a waiter in Fleet-street—I saw you once in the street dressed as a footman you said you were in service—it might have been three or four months after—fourteen months ago was the first time I was drawn into anything of the sort—I know Mr Protheroe the member for Halifax—I first got acquainted with him eight years ago—I will swear it is not fifteen—I swear I was more than fifteen years old when I was first acquainted with him—I have had money from him I drove him every morning from Chapel-street Park-lane in a Metropolitan stage-carriage—I swear I have never been in his bedroom—I have never had gold from him in his house only what he has paid me for driving him—he never took me into his house—I have never been into it—the last time I saw him was eight or nine months ago—I swear that when I was arrested on this charge I did not send for him and have money from him to defend me Q Have you never taken persons to Mr Protheroe lads youths which Mr Protheroe likes you know the sort of persons to suit Mr Protheroe and shared the money between them and yourself A Never in my life—I have never received gold or 5l -notes from him—it was on a Saturday the I O U was procured—I said we went the next day and got a sovereign but I have not been particular to a day or two—I never passed bad money in my life—I never tried to pass any on Mr Wyatt when I went to purchase cigars—he never cut a half-crown in two—I have never been in custody for smashing MR BODKIN Q Do you know that Mr Protheroe prosecuted a person for the same offence A I remember reading an account of it in the paper—I heard nothing said by any of the prisoners about 12l till the examination at the police-court—I heard Sullivan whisper once to Laidler and Jones and say Ah we have done Mr Harry —I forget when that was MARY LEGG I am niece to Mr Samuel Wyatt who keeps a tobacconist s shop in Lincoln s-inn-fields I live with him and help him to carry on the business—he is sixty-four years of age and has been in ill health for some time past—about Nov his manner was a great deal more depressed than usual and I looked more attentively to him—the first time I remember any one coming was on New Year s eve—it was Tiddiman—he was between the parlour door and the shop door which was slightly open—he had his hand in his pocket and said to my uncle This settles it between you and me —he afterwards left the shop—after that evening my uncle became more depressed and I kept my eye on him—about a week or a fortnight afterwards Bennett and Jones came and saw my uncle—I heard nothing—I was at dinner in the shop which is on the same floor—the middle door is never shut—they only remained a few minutes—I saw nothing given to them—the same week or the following I was at supper and Mr Wyatt was shutting up the shop Bennett and Tiddiman came and I saw money pass from my uncle to them both—I heard nothing said—I did not hear the sound of money but they received something from my uncle which they put into their pockets—I saw their hands in their pockets—at the time they came when I was at dinner my uncle was dining with me he went into the shop to them and some conversation took place in a whisper—in consequence of observing that I went into the shop and found Bennett Jones and Tiddiman—I asked them what was the matter and why they annoyed us so—Tiddiman said it was not fit for me to know—I said There are money transactions passing between you and my uncle which I wish to know —Tiddiman said there was not—Jones said You know nothing of me —I said I did not never having seen him before—I do not remember Bennett saying anything—they went away after paying for their cigars—on the evening of 2nd March I was in the kitchen and heard a noise which brought me up—I found Laidler and Jones with my uncle in the shop—Laidler was reading a letter of some description to my uncle—they found I would not leave the parlour and they left the shop after about a quarter of an hour—they left off speaking as soon as I appeared—between eleven and twelve o clock that night my uncle was shutting up the shutters and Laidler and Jones came into the shop—I said I am glad you are come for now I will have an explanation of this business and hearing the others outside I insisted on their being brought in—Bennett and Tiddiman came in—when they were all in Laidler said it was a sodomite case—I asked With whom —Tiddiman said With me —they followed my uncle into the parlour—what was said I do not know—I followed them in—I said I was very sorry for it but I do not remember saying anything else—Laidler said they wanted to get Tiddiman out of the country and it was a very bad case the vessel he was to sail in was to sail on the following Thursday and they wished for money for him to sail in that vessel—Bennett asked my uncle for money and he said he had none—Bennett said You must have taken some in the course of the day —he said he had not I think—they said something in an under tone—they did not seem inclined to go—I think one of them I will not say who said We will not leave the house until we have some —the door was shut I think one of them had his back against it but I really was so excited I do not know—if it was any one it was Bennett but I do not remember—Tiddiman said he would have an I O U for 40l —Bennett said I ll have fifty —Tiddiman replied No 40l will do I won t be too hard upon him —Laidler asked me for a piece of paper—I said I had none—one of them took a piece from his pocket—there was a pen and ink on the counter and one of them I think it was Jones wrote this I O U produced for 50l —they all looked at it and my uncle signed it—I think it was Jones and Bennett put it before him—they said when could they have the money could they have it on Monday —my uncle said No he could not procure it by then—this is my uncle s signature—it was not written in my presence I was in the parlour he was in the shop—Bennett said he would not go without he had some money—my uncle took some silver out of the cupboard and gave some of it to Bennett but he snatched the rest and said We may as well have all —they went away and took the money and the I O U —this was on Saturday—after that my uncle became much worse he kept his bed until the day the prisoners were taken—on the Monday afterwards Jones and Laidler came about the middle of the day—my uncle was in bed—they inquired after his health—I said he was very ill in bed they might satisfy themselves by seeing him if they thought proper—they did so he slept in the parlour—they asked me for some money—I said they could not have it but if they would come next day we would see what we could do for them—Laidler said he was a solicitor—the I O U was produced—I really cannot tell what was said about it for it was produced so often and so much was said about it—they said they would compromise the affair for 30l and I think it was that day that Laidler said he had been to the Docks to pay part of the passage-money and that Tiddiman might start by that vessel—he said it was a most infamous affair and if it got into the papers would cause more sensation than Greenacre s murder—I then said something to Jones about some other case—Jones mentioned some name and said it was a similar case to the person in question but he got him through it—next day Tuesday Laidler and Jones came—they said they came for money and they wished it very much to be settled—I said it was impossible but I would give them part of it—Laidler spoke—I gave them a 10l -note and two sovereigns my uncle s money—the I O U was mentioned—Laidler received the money—I will not be certain whether I gave it him or whether he took it up—when he had taken it he said We consider this as our fees do not tell Bennett or Tiddiman we have received any —he said they might think they were compromising the affair and I think he said something about indicting them for felony and having Laidler s name struck off the roll of attorneys—I said I would not—next day Wednesday Laidler and Jones came again—they came almost every day—they saw Mr Wyatt in bed—Laidler said could not my uncle grant me an undertaking to get the remainder of the money—he said he could not—Laidler said if he would he would take me to the Bank either in his private carriage or in a cab—he would not and they went away—next day they came again and brought an I O U for 40l but that was thrown away and burnt as a forgery it was not my uncle s writing—my uncle s name was to it—Laidler asked me if it was my uncle s writing—I told him No and he then burnt it—he said it had got into Bennett s or Tiddiman s hands one of the two I do not know which—he said they picked hit pocket of it and they could sell it for 30l as any one would give them that for an I O U with Mr Wyatt s name to it—he said to Jones If you will endeavour to get it back from them I will give you a sovereign —Jones said I don t require that I dare say I can do it without —on one occasion Laidler said if the money was not paid the Sheriffs officer would come and take the things away to the amount I suppose—on the Friday Laidler and Jones came again and saw my uncle in bed—I said I wished to settle altogether for I was very much annoyed and my business was injured as I was obliged to shut my shop up as soon as it was dark to pacify my uncle who was almost in a state of madness—Laidler said You can keep open with safety till nine o clock at night as your house is protected till then —he said he paid a man 5s a day to watch the house and pointed out Sullivan who was coming up the gateway opposite—he sent Jones to fetch Sullivan who came back with Jones—Laidler said he would not be answerable for my shop after nine as his man went off then—they all three went into my uncle s bedroom—Sullivan only asked him how he did —nothing was said there about settling—as they went away they asked me if I could settle it—I said I could not it was not in our power—they went away somewhere about one or two o clock—Sullivan said as he was going away that my uncle appeared very ill and it was a pity it could not be settled—then they left—about eleven o clock after the shop was shut I was alarmed by a very great noise as if the shop-door was beat with sticks— they used to enter at the private door —it continued two or three minutes—I did not go—I was in the parlour—I heard a voice call my uncle s name and ask if he did not mean to open the door—it was not a noise as if people wanted to come in—I did not open the door—it frightened my uncle very much—next morning Jones came—he saw my uncle and said he was very sorry to see him so ill and of course he wanted money—I told him they would have had the money if it had not been for the riot the night before—Jones asked me if I would give him a paper to satisfy the others that he had been there and what was the cause of their not receiving the money—I consented—this is the paper I gave him produced —it is in my writing—he then asked if I could give him some money—I afterwards gave him and Laidler 4l on Friday the 8th—he denied having been there the night before—I said it was of no use for I heard their voices—he said they had nothing to do with it— paper read— Gentlemen —Through your coming last evening my uncle is much worse if you will let the matter stand over till Monday at six the 30l shall be forthcoming M Legg —the same afternoon Laidler and Jones came together—an agreement had been spoken of before and Laidler said it had been altered to my wish and he brought it with him—this is it produced —I had desired an alteration in it a day or two before—it then had no stamp—he said it could be stamped for half-a-crown—I said I would consider of it I think—I gave Jones half-a-crown the following day Saturday to get it stamped—it was brought to me on Saturday by Laidler and Jones—I said I did not know the names—there were only two that I recognised Laidler and Roberts—they said those were the proper names of the other men—Laidler read it— read— Memorandum of an agreement made and entered into between Samuel Wyatt of Great Queen-street Lincoln s-innfields on the one part and Henry Roberts John Evans John Smith

50 —Laidler was not there only Jones—I had those written receipts because they said it was in part payment of the 30l and I asked for a memorandum—on the same afternoon Monday Bennett and Jones came—Bennett asked me if I could give him 5l —I said No —he asked me if I could procure it by the following Friday as he had three guineas to make up the rent—I said I did not know I would see what I could do but the money should be paid whether my uncle was dead or alive—on the Tuesday I complained to the police Jones came between eleven and twelve o clock and asked how my uncle was and if he could have any more money—I said I had none to give him then but if he would call at four I would see—he came again at four with Laidler but during that time I had given information to the police—they asked how my uncle was and I said I was very sorry I had not got the money then I had sent a person out to endeavour to procure it but if they would come at nine I would see what I could do and I wished all of them to come—either Laidler or Jones said All —I said Yes all —they wished me good afternoon and went away—at nine Laidler and Jones came—I then had the police in the house—I asked where the others were—they said did I wish for them all—I said Yes I told you so looking at Jones—Laidler said I dare say you will find them at my chambers or at the corner —Jones then went out—Laidler remained in the shop and smoked a cigar which he paid for—Jones was not gone more than ten minutes—Bennett Tiddiman and Sullivan came back with him—I showed them into the parlour and said Gentlemen I wish for an explanation of this affair what is your demand on Mr Wyatt Laidler then answered Twenty-four pounds —I said Is that your demand and one and all answered Yes —I cannot say whether Sullivan spoke but several said Yes —I said Who is the solicitor in this affair —Laidler said I am —I said Are you a solicitor —he answered Yes —I said Where are your chambers he said It is affixed either to the bond or the agreement I do not know to which but you have my direction for I gave it you —I said I have lost it —he said My chambers are at No 5 Cecil-court St Martin s-lane —I said Do you all expect something out of this —Sullivan said I do not and left the parlour—he was stopped in the shop by inspector Pearce—two policemen who were behind the curtain in the parlour came out and took the other four into custody Cross-examined by MR WOOLLETT Q On 2nd March you say you have a very imperfect recollection of what occurred A Yes I was so much excited and so much hurt I do not know what I said Cross-examined by MR PARNELL Q Was Tiddiman to go away in the vessel A Yes so Mr Laidler told me—I never saw Tiddiman come there except once during the whole of that week and then he was sent for—he was one of the party claiming part of the 24l —it was not said why he was to be sent away—I am quite certain they said it was a sodomitical case—they were all present then but Sullivan—I only saw him twice Cross-examined by MR PRENDERGAST JUN Q All Sullivan said about the matter was that it was a pity it was not settled A Yes he said nothing more that I in the slightest degree remember Laidler Q When the I O U was given did not I tell you if you were annoyed by them to give them in charge A You did—I was to give them in charge and send for you—on the Tuesday when you came you told me it was a case you did not like such a case as you had never been mixed up in before and you did not wish to have anything more to do with it—I did not tell you I would not harm you—it was the farthest from my intention for I should have had no idea of prosecuting you—I did not say I would do you no harm if you would stand by me—I did not say If you stand by me and there is no other man in the house you shall not be hurt MR BODKIN Q Was what he said about giving them in charge and sending for him after the I O U had been given A Yes he did not say that was to be the case in consequence of my having given the I O U —the I O U was given to get rid of the annoyance—I cannot say if it was to protect me from further violence JOSEPH THOMPSON police-sergeant F 11 On Tuesday evening 12th March I went to Mr Wyatt s with Brown another policeman—we concealed ourselves behind a curtain in the back-parlour adjoining the shop and remained there about half an hour—at nine o clock Laidler and another who I believe to be Jones came—Laidler spoke to Mrs Legg—she said Where are the other gentlemen I thought I told you they were all to be here —he said they were close by he would send for them—he spoke to the other and sent for them and in the end the four other prisoners came—after some conversation we came from our hiding-place—I took Laidler and Tiddiman—on Laidler I found this agreement and I O U and a letter signed M Legg—going along Queen-street he said Is Sullivan taken —I said I believe he is —he said Ah b——y old fox I am glad he is taken that is the General with all his generalship he is taken at last I do not care about myself Mrs Legg will clear me I only did it to stand her friend —at the station he gave his address Laidler 5 Cecil-court St Martin s-lane —I found a key on him which he said was the key of his box and that his landlord s name was Morriss—I went there according to that direction—a box was pointed out to me by the landlord—it was locked—I found in it this agreement and the fly-leaf of a brief and a letter—I have seen Bennett before this once dressed as one of the Life Guards blue and another time in the suit of an hussar Laidler Q Have you ever seen me in company with either of the prisoners A Yes on one occasion with Bennett and Jones at the masquerade at Drury-lane Theatre—I am not quite certain whether Sullivan was in your company but he was a short distance off WILLIAM WEST police-sergeant F 7 On 12th March about a quarter-past eight o clock I went to Mr Wyatt s—I saw Jones and Tiddiman on the opposite side of the way walking to and fro and looking on the other side—I afterwards saw Jones and some one else go into the house—Jones came out again—I met Sullivan at the door took him and handed him over—I then went into the room and took Jones and Tiddiman JAMES BROWN policeman I accompanied Sergeant Thompson—I was concealed behind the curtain—I afterwards took Bennett—on the way to the station he said I am let into this secret I wish I had stopped at home SAMUEL WYATT In March last I carried on the business of a tobacconist at 13 Great Queen-street Lincoln s-inn-fields I am sixty-four years of age—one evening about seven months ago Tiddiman came and asked for some tobacco—I gave it him—he squeezed my hand and pressed up against me—I was behind the counter and came to the front of it to take a glass of gin-and-water which I had made—he left in five or ten minutes COURT Q Did you sit down at the outside of the counter and take your gin-and-water A Yes I asked him to take a little of it—that was before he squeezed my hand—I went round and sat by his side with the gin-and-water on a chair between us—he squeezed my hand when I laid the tobacco on the counter—he had not tasted the gin-and-water before I put down the tobacco he squeezed my hand both before and after—I noticed nothing particular in his conduct towards me—I thought it very strange his squeezing my hand for a stranger—some time afterwards he got up to go he got two or three Cuba cigars which he paid for—he did not touch me after squeezing my hand—there was nothing extraordinary in his demeanour but that—I made no complaint to him before he left MR COOPER Q Afterwards did he repeat his visits again and again A Yes the second time he came I gave him some money—I did so several times—he afterwards came with Bennett and Laidler they both said they must have some money—I do not recollect whether Tiddiman was with them—it might be a week after Tiddiman came the first time—I gave them some money—I do not give money to every one who comes into my shop and asks me but they threatened me with an assault on Tiddiman—I never committed it—they all three said they would accuse me of an indecent assault on Tiddiman—Tiddiman was with them then I gave them I think two or three sovereigns—my niece did not make her appearance on that occasion—they left after that—the three came again but Tiddiman came principally—I remember Jones coming again that is him pointing to him —on 2nd March they all came again except Sullivan—they said they would have a note for 50l —I said I could not give it—they then said they would have one for 40l they then offered to take 30l —they had a bill for 40l drawn up by themselves which they destroyed—they said it was nothing of mine—they then made out an I O U for 50l and I signed it—I calculate that I have paid them about 50l at various times Laidler Q On the first night you saw Tiddiman when he had the gin-and-water and pressed your hand did you invite him into your bedroom A No I sleep in the back parlour—I swear I did not sit on the bed with him—he walked in there himself that night—he did not go into the parlour on any other occasion COURT Q The first time you saw Tiddiman did he go out of your shop till he left A No I have no other room but the parlour I have no smoking-room—he walked into the parlour just inside the door—I believe my bed was down because I have it made generally about eleven o clock—the shop and parlour open one into the other—I certainly followed him into the room because it was strange that a stranger should go into the parlour— I told him to go—I am certain of that—nothing particular struck me in his conduct at that time—I was surprised at his squeezing my hand and walking into my bedroom—I felt disposed to kick him out of my house—I told him I never suffered any one to come in there—he did not stay five minutes after that—I did not go on with my gin-and-water after that—the shop was open any one passing could see into it—when the room-door is open any one can look in by the light of the shop—as far as an open view goes it is a public place—the door is glazed as well as the window the shop is nearly half as wide again and half as long again as the dock of this Court—I was near the parlour with the spirits-and-water—that was not where I served him with the tobacco—I served him behind the counter and then came forward to take the remainder of the refreshment—I take gin-and-water every night because I take no malt liquor MR PARNELL with MR WOOLLETT contended that upon this evidence there was no case for the Jury that any threat of the precise nature alleged is the indictment had been made to the prosecutor all that took place with him pointed only to a charge of indecent assault which would not support this indictment See Reg v Middleditch 1 Denison s Crown Cases p 92 that the expression used to Mrs Legg could only be received as evidence to explain the nature of the previous threat to the prosecutor there being no charge that by any threat to her money was sought to be obtained from him and that it had been held that the very term used to her sodomitical was of too vague and uncertain a meaning to support an indictment See Reg v Bower 3 Queen s Bench Reports and Reg v Orchard and another 3 Cock s Criminal Cases 238 MR BARON PLATT entertained no doubt whatever that there was evidence for the Jury Laidler s Defence I left my situation as waiter at the Hanover Tavern on the last day of February I met Tiddiman in Stacey-street Soho we drank together and made an appointment for the next day and I was taken to Mr Wyatt s Mrs Legg demanded the nature of the case and I asked him and told her it was a case of an indecent assault that is the only time I was in the house it is quite false that I was there seven or eight months ago when the I O U was got I said I would have nothing more to do with the affair which she will acknowledge she begged me to stand by her and she would hold me harmless on Saturday 9th March she sent me half-a-crown to get the agreement stamped I afterwards showed it to her she said it was what she wished I am mistaken for another person Gardner alias Harrisson of the Lock Hospital I have been quite drawn into it by Tiddiman whenever they were going for money themselves they drew me into it I have been to the East and West Indies in ships and have certificates of character Mrs Legg kept me in the case after I had said I would have nothing more to do with it she said if I would stand by her till the case was settled she would hold me harmless the 12l I received of Mrs Legg which she said were for fees was given over I used no deception in the case I gave no false name or address either to the police at Somerset House or to Mr Wyatt I considered I was doing nothing more than acting as a friend I want Thomas Miles called THOMAS MILES I keep the Hanover Tavern Hanover-street Laidler lived with me as waiter I should think eight months—I do not recollect his leaving the house seven months ago in the afternoon between three and four o clock—I cannot pretend to say he did not—it is usual for him to be there in the afternoon—I do not recollect him being absent in the middle of the day about two months before Christmas COURT Q When did he leave your service A About a month ago— he was in my service in September—if he asked for an hour he would be allowed to have it The JURY found the prisoners GUILTY upon all the Counts and were of opinion that the prisoners threatened to accuse the Prosecutor of the crime stated MR PRENDERGAST JUN on behalf of Sullivan in moving in arrest of judgment urged that the indictment was defective in as much as it did not allege that the security sought to be obtained was the property of the Prosecutor and refered to the case of Reg v Parker where such an omission was held to be fatal MR WOOLLETT for Bennett and MR PARNELL for Jones made a similar notion and referred to Reg v Norton 8 Car & Payne 196 MR BODKIN is reply contended that as this was a charge not of obtaining but of endeavouring by means of threats to obtain it was not necessary to show whose property the security was See Reg v Clark 1 Car & Kir 421 MR BARON PLATT having taken until Monday to consider the point in giving judgment stated that the question was whether the indictment which charged the prisoners with making the threat in question with intent to extort from the Prosecutor a valuable security and did not state whose property that security was could be supported or not The statute on which the indictment was framed was 10 & 11 Vic c 66 s 2 which made it an offence to accuse or threaten to accuse any person of the offence specified with a view or intent to extort or gain from such person any property money or security The words of the statute were exceedingly important because one of them viz extort had a certain technical meaning which was defined in 2nd Salkeld s Reports and when a man was charged with extorsively taking the very import of the word showed that he was not acquiring possession of his owntion would be found in 2 Burn s Justice and the language showed that it was not at all necessary that the thing extorted should be stated to be the property of any person if it was wrested from the party upon whom the extortion was effected and if that was the case the present indictment was sufficient In a case referred to Reg v Norton it appeared that the property was described in the manner contended for by the prisoner s counsel but that was an indictment under another statute which made it necessary that the party charged under it should actually obtain the thing sought to be obtained that was not so in the present case because whether anything was obtained or not the crime was complete and whether the property belonged to the person threatened or not was quite immaterial the offence was committed immediately the accusation was made with the evil intent stated in the indictment TIDDIMAN was recommended to mercy by the Prosecutor Aged 24 — Confined Two Years BENNETT Aged 22 —LAIDLER Aged 24 —JONES Aged 24 — SULLIVAN Aged

charge Wren having been before convicted MESSRS CLARKSON and BALLANTINE conducted the Prosecution MICHAEL TASBURGH I am between seventy and eighty years of age and live at Bird Wallace-hall near Doncaster I am a widower and have children and grandchildren On 27th Aug I arrived at Euston-square from Doncaster and proceeded directly in a cab to the Tavistock Hotel after dinner I walked out intending to return and go to bed—I went through the Lowther Arcade through a street which I do not know to Hemming s-row—I saw something going on at a shop window I thought the man was making billiard-balls—I stopped and looked at him there were four or five persons standing there Braznell was one but I did not see Wren—I asked Braznell if he knew what the man doing he said Turning —after that he pressed very much against me and leant over as if he wished to look into the shop that had the effect of pressing upon me—I believe I was standing with both hands down in a moment or two afterwards I perceived that he was pressing his private parts against my hand I withdrew my hand and walked away about twenty yards—he then came up to me and asked me what I meant by taking indecent liberties with him—I told him I had done no such thing—he said Do you think I will allow you to do so for nothing —a conversation took place which I cannot remember exactly but he asked me what I would stand it was all to the same purpose—I said I would stand nothing—he said then I must take the consequences—I continued walking and he followed me close—when we got to the bottom of Hemming s-row he said I had better go into a public-house and have a glass and we could soon settle the business that he did not want to have any dispute nor to be hard upon me—I again told him in the most peremptory manner I was able I will neither go into any house nor give you one farthing —he said then he would hand me over to the police I said I was quite ready to go with the police—I think he said Then you had better follow me —I understood him to mean to the police I said I was ready to do so and walked on—when he said he would hand me over to the police I said Then you mean to threaten me —he said No I don t I know the law as well as you do —Wren was then standing in front of me—I first saw him at the bottom of Hemming s-row—I cannot tell whether he could hear all that was said he was five or six yards off—a few minutes afterwards I saw the prisoners speak together with a third party whose name turns out to be White—I went on walking with them both and when we got into the Haymarket by the bottom of Panton-street a policeman came up with White who had left to fetch him about two minutes before—Braznell said to the policeman That is him pointing to me Wren was close to me—I did not hear Braznell say anything to the policeman about Wren—I gave myself up to the policeman—I do not think Braznell had spoken to the policeman before I did so—I was locked up in the station all night—I told my story to the inspector nearly the same as I have now—next day I was taken before Mr Hardwick the Magistrate at the Marylebone police-court—the prisoners and White appeared as witnesses against me—I had no solicitor or counsel I thought I could tell my own story better—the prisoners were examined apart by the Magistrate s order police were sent out with them—I then told my story—I was discharged and made the present charge against the prisoners—I never caught hold of Braznell by the private parts or forced down his trowsers—I took no indecent liberty with him the moment I perceived him pressing on me I withdrew Cross-examined by MR ROBINSON Q Have you ever been in business A No I am quite independent—I think I arrived at the Tavistock Hotel at a little after two o clock—I left Doncaster at ten—I did not dine at the Tavistock as they have only a table d ho✗le and I do not like it—I dined at the Albion in Drury-lane—I left there about eight—it was a quarter-past eight as near as I can say when I first saw Braznell and about twenty minutes elapsed between my first seeing him and my being given into custody but I am not quite sure—I am pretty well acquainted with the streets of London—I have been here three times this year—I knew Panton-street but not Hemming s-row I do not think I was ever in it before—it is a very short street—I had gone out to walk until nine—I was five or ten minutes looking into the turner s shop—I spoke to Braznell first—there were several persons looking in but I only noticed a little girl—I had not to look over anybody s shoulder—I was near the window—Braznell was pressing over me to look into the shop—my hand was not at his private parts till he pressed against me—his private parts were against my hand for about a minute—I withdrew my hand immediately and walked away—I have not been used to Courts of Justice except in my own county—about twenty minutes elapsed from my leaving the shop till I was given into custody—I was bound over by the Magistrate to prosecute—it was about a quarter of an hour between my making my statement to Inspector Whall and my being given in charge it was done as quickly as it could be Cross-examined by MR WOOLLETT Q The first time you saw Wren was at the bottom of Hemming s-row A At the end of the street—he might or might not have been at the window—Braznell walked with me and Wren on my left side till we got to the end of Hemming s-row when Wren went in front of me and was there when Braznell threatened me WILLIAM OBEY policeman A 299 I was in Panton-street—White came up and gave me information—I went and found the prisoners and Mr Tasburgh standing still—Braznell said he wanted me to take an old gentleman into custody for taking indecent liberties with him in Hemming s-row and he said Here is my witness —Wren said I saw the transaction —Mr Tasburgh said it was quite false that Braznell threatened to give him in custody and he intended to follow them till they did so that he was an old man but he would not put up with a charge which was false—he went readily with me to the station—Inspector Whall was there—statements were made and Mr Tasburgh was locked up all night taken before the Magistrate next morning and discharged and the prisoners were committed Cross-examined by MR ROBINSON Q How far from where Mr Tasburgh and the prisoners stood was it that White came to you A About twenty yards—in the same street JOHN WHALL police-inspector I was at the station in Vine-street Pic-cadilly when Mr Tasburgh was given into custody—he made a statement to me—I produce the charge sheet—the charge made by Braznell is Indecently assaulting Joseph Braznell at Hemming s-row St Martin s-in-the-Fields —it is signed by Braznell and Wren as a witness Cross-examined by MR ROBINSON Q What time was it A The charge was taken at half-past nine o clock but there was a charge under investigation when he was brought in WILLIAM BISHOP I am clerk at the Marylebone police-court I was present when the charge was made against Mr Tasburgh—the prisoners were examined in support of it and also a person who gave his name White—the charge was then dismissed—I took down what they stated— reads— Joseph Braznell says I am a lithographic printer and live at 7 Robin Hood-court Shoe-lane last night at a quarter to nine o clock I stopped with two young friends at the shop-window of a turner in Hemming s-row and looked in the prisoner was standing there when I went up I was there about a minute when the defendant put his hand behind him as I was standing behind and caught hold of me by my privates at the same time saying What are they doing in the shop —I told him they were turning and then told one of my friends what the defendant was doing and to watch his proceedings when the defendant asked me to go for a walk I walked with him as far as the Haymarket till I met a constable then I gave him in charge and my friend followed close behind us —Some questions were put by Mr Hardwick after Wren had been examined and then Braznell was recalled and further questions put The COURT upon looking at this further statement considered that it was not relevant to the present charge it only going to the credit of the party then under examination MR BALLANTINE then proposing to read Wren s examination MR WOLLETT objected on the ground that it was not a voluntary examination but one which he was bound to give upon oath the Magistrate having the power to commit him if he refused which rendered it coercive referring to 2 Russell on Crimes p 855 and Rex v Lewis 6 Car and Payne 661 MR JUSTICE WILLIAMS was clearly of opinion that the evidence was admissible Read— John Wren sworn Iam a porter and live at 4 Little Cockpit-yard King s-road I was with the last witness last night and whilst standing by the kerb he called my attention to what the defendant was doing and I saw the defendant force down the last witness s trowsers and catch hold of his privates —on that being read over he corrected it and said He attempted to force them down the defendant then asked him to take a walk my friend did till he came to a constable and then he gave him into custody MR ROBINSON with MR WOOLLETT submitted that the indictment could not be supported in as much as there was no evidence of any threat to accuse the prosecutor of an infamous crime but only of an indecent assault which was held in Reg v Middleditch not to be sufficient to sustain a charge of this nature MR JUSTICE WILLIAMS was of opinion that there was evidence for the Jury BENJAMIN GREENARD policeman

conducted the Prosecution HENRY MAY I am head-waiter at the Scotch Stores at the corner of Burlington-street Regent-street On Wednesday 18th Sept I was on my way home from Charing-cross to Regent-street I had been with a person I knew respecting a public-house that he was taking in the neighbourhood and I went to Charing-cross to see him to the omnibus—as I was going from there to Regent-street I had occasion to stop at a urinal at the corner of Hemming s-row—it is a place where there are partitions—it was then about a quarter to one o clock in the morning—when I went into the place I observed the prisoner there at the further partition—I went to the first one I came to and unbuttoned my trowsers for the purpose of relieving myself—the prisoner directly came to me from the partition he was in took me by the flap of my shirt and said You b—— if you don t give me a sovereign I will charge you with an indecent assault —I immediately struck him in the mouth and from the blow he fell to the ground—he got up again and snatched my watch from my pocket which was fastened by a guard and got it into his hand—he likewise tore open my waistcoat and feeling I suppose that I had money in my pocket he said I find you have a sovereign or two I will have one of them —I then struck him a second time and called the police—I had about four sovereigns in my left-hand pocket—he said if I did not give him one of them he would charge me as he had previously said—I called the police while we were struggling in the place he went out—I followed him and when he saw the policeman coming up he said This gentleman has been annoying me and following me —I directly said I give this man in charge for an attempt at extortion —the policeman then took charge of him—in going to the station I asked the policeman to allow me to go into a house at the corner of Coventry-street to take a glass of ale as I felt rather excited—he said You had better not come on and I did not—I went on to the station and gave the charge—when the policeman took him into custody he said If you will go your way I will go mine Prisoner His statement is entirely wrong he knocked against me and struck me he had annoyed me and followed me up three or four streets and when I got the policeman I told him the gentleman had been following me I did not know for what and then he said I wanted to extort money from him and after the policeman took me into custody he never asked the policeman s permission to go into this public-house he ran into the public-house the policeman left me standing in the street by myself and went and brought him out Witness I did not follow him up and down the streets—the policeman did not let me go into the public-house nor did he leave the prisoner standing outside JOHN STRATFORD policeman A 233 On Wednesday morning 18th Sept about twenty minutes to one o clock I was on duty near Hemming s-row and heard a cry of Police —I hastened to the spot and met the prisoner and prosecutor—the prisoner said there was a gentleman following and annoying him—the prosecutor was about two or three yards at the side of him—he came up and said that he was in the watering-place and the prisoner had indecently assaulted him and attempted to extort money and wanted a sovereign from him—I asked the prisoner what he had to say to this charge—he put his hand out to the prosecutor in this manner waving his hand and said You go your way and I will go my way —I said I must take you into custody —as we went along the prosecutor wanted to go into a public-house and get a glass of ale—I said No you must go on —he did go on and nothing more was said about it—the prisoner was drunk—the prosecutor appeared perfectly sober Prisoner May wanted to extort the price of some ale from me as we went along the prosecutor went inside a public-house and this constable followed him in and brought him out and I stood in the street by myself Witness That is not true Prisoner Nothing was said at the station about the watch or money till the second examination Witness The prosecutor stated to the sergeant that the prisoner had indecently assaulted him in the watering-place and attempted to extort money and wanted a sovereign MR PARRY proposed to call a witness who would prove that two years ago the prisoner made a similar charge and then gave a false address and as an authority for taking this course he referred to Reg v Cooper Sessions Paper Vol 29 page 469 MR JUSTICE ERLE thought that case not applicable to the present there the question was whether any intent to obtain money was established and the evidence then adduced as to other transactions was to make that point clear in this case if the witness was believed the intent was manifest and therefore it was unnecessary to call other evidence to confirm it GUILTY Aged 30 — Transported for Life There was another indictment against the prisoner 
t18520816-841  841 HENRY HARRISON feloniously accusing one Anderson Massey of having attempted to commit an abominable crime with intent to extort money —Other COURTS varying the manner of stating the charge MR CHARNOCK conducted the Prosecution ANDERSON MASSEY I live and carry on business at 58 Baker-street Portman-square the Baker-street Bazaar I am in partnership with my brother Mr William Massey and have been so about eight months—before that I carried on business as a linen draper at Stamford in Lincolnshire—I am twenty-nine years of age—I had been in business as a linen draper six years—I am a Lincolnshire man—my father was a very large farmer there—I have one brother who lives at St John s-wood who has an appointment in the city and another brother who is an ironmonger at the Baker-street Bazaar—on Friday 30th July I went in an omnibus from St John s-wood to Charing-cross—I dismounted from the omnibus at Charing-cross—I left my brother s at 10 minutes to 10 o clock and I think it must have been about 20 minutes past 10 when I got from the omnibus—on my return from there I passed the back of the barracks—I had no occasion to pass it but I did pass it on my way back to St John s-wood—there is a urinal there at the corner of a street where the baths and washhouses are—I do not know the name of that street it is at the back of the barracks—there are six divisions to the urinal—I have made a model of it since producing it —there is a gas light at the end of it—there is no gas light at the top—you can go into it from either side—I am not sure whether I went in to the third or fourth division from the side nearest the baths—while there I did not speak to a soul—I did nothing while I was there except the purpose for which I went in—when I first went there the place was full and two others waiting—I did not see the prisoner there—I went in and came out COURT Q Did you wait outside or inside A Just inside—there were two others inside and the places were all full—I entered at the further end and came back the same way MR CHARNOCK Q You do not mean that you waited inside the unnal A No not inside it—the wall comes a little further on and that was where I waited COURT Q Did you wait inside the enclosure A No just inside the wall close by MR CHARNOCK Q There is a long wall there I believe and this place is fastened against the wall there being more wall on each side of it out-side the place A Yes—when I left I should think there were four persons there—it was perfectly light—I came out at the end against the baths and turned to the left to come into Princes-street that leads into Oxendon-street and into Coventry-street—it is the only direct street into Coventry-street—I went straight up I passed the baths and washhouses and turned westward towards the Haymarket—I did not go up a street called Arundel-street which has no turning and then come back again—my attention has been since called to Arundel-street—I certainly did not go up there—I went through Titch-bourne-street into Regent-street—I continued part of the way up Regent-street on the right side—I then crossed over to the left and waited to hear a band playing I should think about eight minutes—it was playing in one of the bye streets leading out of there—I then proceeded to the Regent-circus where the omnibuses stop to take up persons—up to that spot nobody had spoken to me—I had not the slightest idea that any one was following me—I had passed many policemen between the urinal and the Regent-circus—I waited about fire or six minutes for an omnibus before one came up—during that time no one spoke to me—there were policemen standing there—at the expiration of that time I was about to get upon an omnibus—I had not got up—I was just moving from the causeway to get up I had not touched it I was close to it it had stopped—any one could tell by my manner that I was going upon it and as I was going the prisoner touched me on the shoulder in this way took hold of my left arm and said in a low tone I want to speak to you —I turned round and he said You have been guilty of an indecent assault upon me at the back of the Trafalgar barracks and I mean to have your name and address —he was not dressed half so well as he is now—I had never seen him before until that moment—I turned round and said to him You villain what do you mean I have never seen you in my life before and I am only surprised at your audacity in making such an accusation —he replied Oh we shall see —I said I suppose you are one of those fellows that require feeing but you will be mightily deceived in the person you have got to deal with for not one penny or one farthing or a single fraction would I give you if it were to save your soul —I felt very intimidated indeed I think I might have been knocked down with a straw at that moment—he kept saying Oh we shall see and he said he was determined to have my name and address—I said If my name and address is all you require that I can easily accommodate you with or give to you —I took out my card-case and was going to give him my card—I took out my pencil also to write my address upon it but it struck me just at the moment that if I gave him my address that would be all he required and he might annoy me in after life in writing or some other mode and I thought I bad better not give it—I gave him a card—it was afterwards produced by him at the police-office—I did not tell him my address when I gave him the card—I said I was going to St John s-wood near the Eyre Arms—I said that I lived near there—the omnibus was not stopping all this time it had gone on—I then walked on up Oxford-street partly on the left side as far as Duke-street and then crossed over to the right the northern side the side nearest St John s-wood—I turned up Duke-street into Manchester-square and ultimately into Baker-street —that is the street in which I carry on business—during the time this took place as we went along I repeatedly saw police-officers up Oxford-street and likewise in Manchester-square—when I got to Dorset-street which is a street crossing Baker-street I turned round and said Now I shall not allow you to follow me or insult me any further —as we went along he repeatedly spoke to me but I never made any reply—he kept following me—I was conscious of his following me—he said he was as much a gentleman as I was—and what a very fine sort of a gentleman I must be and those sort of observations—and in Baker-street I said I shall not allow you to follow me or insult me any further —we had passed a policeman about thirty yards in Baker-street and I turned back and met the policeman—he was following us and I said to him This man has a charge to prefer against me policeman you must take me into custody and hear what he has to say —at the very moment I began to speak the prisoner also said I give this person or gentleman in charge —I spoke first I am sure of that—we met the policeman—the prisoner said he gave me in charge for an indecent assault at the back of Trafalgar-square—he must have seen the policeman as we passed him in Baker-street he could not help seeing him—we were going in the same direction—the prisoner was behind me—I said to the policeman Now supposing this accusation to be true what should you have done to the person that did it would you not at once have knocked him down —the policeman said Certainly I would —I went to the station with the policeman—the prisoner there preferred the charge and I was locked up all night with other prisoners—some drunken horrid fellows were in the same den where I was put—the prisoner was not detained in custody—he was allowed to depart—next morning I was taken to Marlborough-street police-office put into the dock and the prisoner appeared against me—he was sworn and examined—after the case was finished on his part the worthy Magistrate Mr Hardwick dismissed the charge at once and made us change places and bound me over to prosecute at this Court—that was the Magistrate s own act—there is not the slightest foundation for saying that I put my hand upon his private parts in this urinal or that I exposed my person to him—I had never seen him to my knowledge till he approached me at the omnibus Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q Are you an inhabitant of London A Yes I live at 58 Baker-street and carry on business there as an ironmonger—I do not sleep there—since I have come to town I have had no settled home of my own—I live sometimes with one brother at St John s Wood and sometimes with another at Cricklewood—I always sleep at one of those two—on this evening I was going to St John s Wood—I had spent the evening with my brother at St John s Wood and had come down to Charing-cross merely for a lounge—I believe it was 10 minutes to 10 when I left my brother s—I had not been anywhere—I merely rode down to Charing-cross for a lounge and then I came back and went to this urinal—it was full and two persons besides myself were waiting—I was outside the two others they were before me—I should say neither of those was the prisoner—I am not able to say with certainty—after leaving there I turned to the left past the baths—that may be considered rather a retired spot—I am not much accustomed to the locality—I think there are a great many people about there—it is rather thickly populated—there were a great many persons about there that night—I went up Princes-street and Oxendon-street—that is a very extensive thoroughfare—I then got into Coventry-street—I did not go up a street into Panton-square—I did not turn up towards Panton-square at all I am quite sure of that—I did not turn up any street—I crossed Coventry-street from the left to the right a little further on than Oxendon-street—I did not go into Leicester-square at all— I did not go down Arundel-street or Arundel-place—Regent-circus is a very populous place—the prisoner did not come up to me or make any observation to me until I got there—after he first spoke to me I might have called the attention of the police I did not do so because such a thing never struck me at the moment—there were of course plenty of passers by to whom I might have spoken—I asked the policeman if the charge were true and a man had conducted himself to him as the prisoner said I had done whether he would not have knocked him down—the same reasoning would certainly apply to the charge as to the offence I might have knocked the prisoner down when be charged me but that would have been taking the law at once into my own hands—I did not see the policeman when I was locked up MR CHARNOCK Q I suppose you were a good deal excited at the time A I was very much so indeed—it was a very fine night moonlight —there is no pretence for saying that I went up Arundel-street Panton-square JOHN MARSHALL policeman 118 D On Friday night 30th July I was in Baker-street between 10 and 11 o clock—I saw the prisoner and Mr Massey pass me—it was not a very moonlight night—it was near 11 within a few minutes—after they had passed me about forty yards they suddenly turned round—I had just come out of Dorset-street into Baker-street—they stopped and I came up to them Q When you came up to them recollect if you can which of the two spoke to you first or whether they spoke together and what was said A I distinctly heard the prisoner say that he would give that gentleman in charge for committing an indecent assault upon him—he repeated that three or four times over—Mr Massey spoke near about the same time but I did not hear his words and do not know what it was he said—I did not hear them talking before I came up—I did not notice because I came out of Dorset-street into Baker-street I did not come right along Baker-street—I took Mr Massey into custody and took him to the station—the prisoner went with us and preferred his charge—I saw him sign the charge-sheet in the name of Henry Horner—Mr Massey was locked up all night—I was present next day—the prisoner appeared and gave his evidence—the charge was dismissed and he was put into the dock by order of Mr Hardwick—Mr Massey went into the witness box and was bound over to prosecute Q Was that done by Mr Hardwick or was he applied to to do it A I never saw any one make the application—the case lasted a long time Cross-examined Q I believe I may take it that my friend Mr Charnock was there and a solicitor into the bargain A I do not know there were several gentlemen there—the prisoner had no solicitor there—I did not know Mr Charnock then—I never heard the name—I did not hear it on that occasion NASSAU O BRIEN police-inspector On Friday July 30th the last witness brought Mr Massey to Marylebone-lane station on a charge—that charge was given by the prisoner and was signed by him—it was read over to him—I produce the charge-sheet—the charge was indecently assaulting complainant at the back of the National Gallery in the parish of St George Hanover-square—Mr Massey was locked up—I was not at the police court in the morning—the prisoner gave his name and address as Henry Horner 37 New Cut Lambeth baker—he signed his name and I wrote the address from his dictation WILLIAM BISHOP I am clerk to the Magistrates at Marlborough-street Police office I was on duty there as clerk on Saturday morning 31st July when a charge was preferred by the prisoner against Mr Massey—the prisoner was sworn—I took a note of the evidence—this is it— read —Henry Harrison of No 55 York-road Lambeth baker sworn—I was coming from my father s last night to Princes-street Leicester-square and I went into the urinal at the back of the barracks at the back of the National Gallery—I went into the first place vacant—the prisoner was in the next place and put his hand round and took hold of my penis in a very indecent manner and turned round and exposed himself to me—I went out and followed him for the purpose of seeing where he lived with a view to give him in charge—I followed him to Regent-circus Oxford-street where he was going to take an omnibus—I said to him You cannot go there Sir —he said Why —I said Because you have acted in a very indecent manner to me down by the barracks and I followed him for the purpose of seeing where he lived and then to call a policeman—when I accused him of it he told me he did not know anything of me and denied all knowledge of me—then he said I will give you my address if you require it and you can call on me in the morning I live at St John s Wood —he pulled out his card and gave it to me with the name of Anderson Massey on it—he was going to write upon it and I said If it is your card is not your address printed on it —he said No I will write it —then he said Give me your address first if you are a gentleman —I told him I was not a gentleman but a baker and perhaps as much a gentleman as he was—he then said going along he supposed I wanted feeing—I said Feeing I don t understand you what do you mean —he said I dare say you don t have you never been at school you look like one of those rascals that does —nothing further occurred till we were in Baker-street there he said if I wanted to go to see his residence I might have ridden in the omnibus with him and he would pay for me if I had not the means—I told him I was not without a shilling and did not consent to any such proposal and I looked on his statement as all untrue—when we got about twenty yards past a constable he said There is a constable we have passed and if you mean giving me in charge you had better do so —I said If you will turn round I will —it was then close on 11—I went up to the constable and said Take this man in charge for an indecent assault —he was taken to the station—Cross-examined by MR CHARNOCK —I am a single man—am twenty-two years of age—live with my father work for him—have been at home nine months and previously worked for Mr Gilbertson in Judd-street three or four months—before that was at Mr Robertson s Macclesfield-street six months— before I was at a house of call and my father s—I was nine months with Mr Ryan in Gilbert-street—before that at Mr Dales Chapman Lansdown-place—I gave my name when I gave the charge Henry Horner —that was false and a false address—New Cut Lambeth is a false address—I cannot swear that I said I was connected with the Bread League—I might have said so and forgotten it—I never before went by the name of Henry Horner or gave a false address before or by any false name—I do not know such a person at 37 New Cut Lambeth—it first came into my head at the station to give a false name and address—my reason was when I was in the country I knew a young chap of that name and his name came into my head—I do not know who lives at 37 I fixed upon it by accident —I regretted it when I got home that I had given a false name and address—the urinal is at the corner of a street—I do not know that there are six places in it—I do not deny I have been there before perhaps a dozen times I cannot tell—there is a gaslight there—there are two entrances to the urinal—I cannot say if all the places were filled—I did not cry out or give any alarm—I believe I came out before him—I made no charge on the spot I did not exchange a word with him from coming out of the urinal till we got to the Regent-circus—I think he saw me following him—he passed the baths into Princes-street Oxendon-street Coventry-street up Arundel-street where there is no thoroughfare along Titchborne-street to Regent-street and crossed over—some music was playing he stopped not a minute there—it was 10 when he insulted me—it was about half an hour to the time he was getting on the omnibus—I saw two or three policemen on the road the first I think was in Regent-street—I am not sure I did not meet one before that—I did not inquire for one because I wanted to expose him by finding his address—I saw the policeman in Oxford-street—the prisoner went to run he did run about twenty yards—I followed him—I told him when he wanted to write his address That won t do for me —I would not let him go in the bus—he turned up Duke-street and said he was going to St John s-wood—I did not exchange a word with him all the way hardly—we went more than fifty houses into Baker-street before anything was said to the police—in Baker-street the prisoner did not say I will not permit you to follow me —he did not stop in Manchester-square—I am not known to the police—I have been an attorney s clerk with Mr Guy—I had 5s a week and left of my own accord—I was there twelve months five or six years ago—he said I suppose you want feeing in Manchester-square—I thought if I did not follow him I should not get his correct address—he gave me the card in Duke-street—I did not give him my address I told him I would give it to his superiors—I did not know what he meant by feeing me—I have been in a police court before at Lambeth—a man was fined for assaulting me—I never made any charge against any person in the police court or against any one since—I have not latterly received any money from my father but my father gives me 1s or so when I ask—when there is much doing I am employed from 4 in the morning till the afternoon—yesterday I was in doors all day sitting—I did not go out till half past 9 last night—I was on my way to my house of call—I went over Westminster-bridge up Parliament-street to Charing-cross then necessity required and I went into the urinal—he did not lay hold of me till I had pumped ship—I cannot say how long I ceased to work as a baker—it is about nine months since I earned any money—I slept at my father s last night—it may be a month since any business has been done at my father s Q Is that a true account of what passed A It is upon that Mr Hardwick said I do not believe one word of the statement against Mr Massey and dismissed the charge MR BALLANTINE to JOHN MARSHALL Q Did you make inquiries at the prisoner s father s to find out whether his account was true A I did I found that he was living at home at his father s JURY Q What is his father A A baker but the shop was shut up COURT Q Where does he live A 55 York-road Lambeth MR BALLANTINE Q That was the address he gave at the police court A Yes his father has been carrying on the business of a baker there but it appears that he has not been doing any business for some time—there was nothing in the shop when I went there—there was no bread in the shop the shutters were down but there were no scales or bread or anything in the shop MR BALLANTINE stated that he had no imputation whatever to cast upon the prosecutor the only question was whether the prisoner had acted bond fide or whether he might not have mistaken the prosecutor for the person who had committed the alleged assault upon him William Ryan baker 34 Gilbert-street Grosvenor-square William Tingay licensed victualler 18

t18550226-349  349 WILLIAM RISLEY feloniously accusing William Stanley of an infamous crime with intent to extort money —Other COUNT for demanding money with menaces MESSES CLARKSON and BODKIN conducted the Prosecution WILLIAM STANLEY I am collector of the Queen s taxes at Edmonton and also assist my father in his business of a butcher I know the prisoner—I have known him from a child—on Tuesday 26th Dec I saw him at Edmonton—I had not seen him for some time before that—I have been informed that he was living with a nobleman as a servant—I went with him to the Stag and Hounds public house—it was very near there that I met him—this was about 3 o clock in the afternoon—I had some gin and water there with him—I had occasion to go there for some money—I paid for the gin and water—we were there not more than a quarter of an hour—there was some talk between us about horses—on coming out of the house we separated—I saw him again between 6 and 7 o clock in the evening—I met him by appointment near the Angel hotel—I have an office close by in Orchard-street where I transact my collecting business—I went there with him in the evening—I there showed him some pictures of horses that I had there—that had not been mentioned when I saw him in the afternoon and appointed to meet him I asked him if he knew anything about the Derby race—we had some brandy and water together at my office it was in the office—I also smoked and the prisoner too—I cannot say how long he remained there it might be an hour or an hour and a half—we then came out of the office together and walked together to the top of the street—I bade him good night and he said Good night you will hear from me legally to-morrow —those were the words—nothing more passed—I did not understand what he meant—in the course of our conversation in the office he asked me if I could tell him of a good solicitor or whether I knew Mr Norton and if I thought he was a fit person to manage a case for defamation of character—I said I did not know I had seen Mr Norton practising in the County Court and I considered him a clever man there—he said nothing more on that subject—I saw him again on the Thursday morning—I had not in the interval heard from him legally or otherwise—I saw him at Mr Cater s gate at the Hyde-side—I had a horse and cart there—he was at the outside gate when I came out—I did not go into the house—I went to the inner gate and when I returned I found him there—I asked him if he would ride—he said Yes and he got into the cart—I asked him where he was going—he said he was going to the Angel hotel where the Magistrates meet—Thursday was the day of their meeting—this was from about 10 o clock to a quarter past—I called at several places and then drove to my own home which is a short distance from the Angel—I did not drive to the Angel—he got down on the bridge sixty or seventy yards from the Angel—nothing passed then about the nature of his business at the Magistrates —I saw him about half an hour afterwards when I was going to take the meat to my customers that had been ordered—he was then coming from the Angel round the corner—he got into my cart again—I then asked him what his business was at the Angel—he said he had particular business with Mr Busk—Mr Busk is a Magistrate who sits there—I said What is the nature of your business —he said You know very well —I said I did not at all understand his meaning—he rode with me as far as the Hyde-side where I first saw him—he then got out of the cart and said he should ride no further—I then went back again and proceeded about my business—I had occasion to go to London about 12 o clock or from that to half past 12 o clock that same day—I went outside the omnibus—I did not see the prisoner on that occasion I did not know he was on the bus till I got to Stamford-hill I then found that he was getting across the roof of the omnibus to the front part of it where I was sitting—the omnibus went to Bishopsgate-street—I got down there opposite the shop of a Mr Bax—the omnibus does not usually stop there—the prisoner got down there also and I asked him if he would take anything—he said Yes and he had a glass of sherry—after that he said he wished to speak to me—he said This is a serious charge —I said What —he said I have been to Mr Busk and of course he will compel me to prosecute —those were his words and he made answer directly and said I must either go to Brighton or to Boulogne —he said I have been to Mr Busk to lay a complaint and I shall be prosecuted if I stop there if I don t go out of the way —what he said was I have been to Mr Busk to lay a complaint and of course he will expect me to follow it up and he then said Of course you are quite aware it will transport us both for life —I then made answer directly and said I could not see at all what Mr Busk could interfere with him for or what Mr Busk had to do in the matter with me—I told him I could not see what harm he could take from any charge he could make against me with Mr Busk COURT Q Try and give us the exact words A I said I could not see what harm Mr Busk could do to him—I said I did not see what harm Mr Busk could do to him or me either—I said I did not see how Mr Busk could interfere with that with him or me—I did not see what harm I he could take or me either from any charge he could make against me—I did not say anything about Mr Busk—he said he had been to Mr Bunk—I said I did not see what harm he could take or me either from anything that Mr Busk could do MR BODKIN Q Tell us exactly what passed as near as your memory will enable you A I can say no other than I hare said before COURT Q You have said about half a dozen things and all different what was it that you really said A I told him I did not see what harm he could take or I could take from any information that could come from Mr Busk—that was what I said MR BODKIN Q What else passed A He said he must either go to Brighton or Boulogne he could not go back again to the neighbourhood where he was living any more—he said that he and his brother had 1 000l in the bank and that he should be obliged to sell some of it out to meet this charge—I said What is it you want of me —he made no answer—I said If you want my life after the accusation you have made you had better take it COURT Q What was the accusation that he made A Because he said that we had both done what would transport us for life—he had used those words previously MR BODKIN Q At what part of the conversation was it that he said that A It was opposite Mr Bax s—he said You know we have both done what will transport us for life —that was after he said he had been to Mr Busk s—he then asked me if I was going home that night—I said if I was alive and well I was going home nothing more passed he went away—I am subject to epileptic fits—I was taken ill in that way that evening in London and taken home in a cab Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q You have said that you knew this young man all his life A Not all his life from his childhood—I knew him when he was quite a child his father worked with my grandfather as farm servant—I knew what his condition in life was—he told me he had 1000l in the bank—I had no reason to doubt that—I was told that he had lived as servant to a nobleman—I had not seen him about the street at Edmonton only at his own window—it might be two years before the 26th Dec that I had last spoken to him—I cannot say when I had spoken to him previously to that—I can say that I had done so but I cannot say how long before it might be more than four or five years—that is what I mean by knowing him all his life—I am a tradesman s son—my father is not in a very large way of business—I asked the prisoner into the public house and proposed to treat him—I proposed to meet him again to see if I could ascertain anything about the Derby to get any information—this was on 26th Dec —I believe the Derby takes place in May—I do not make a book—the prisoner is about twenty-two years of age I am about forty-six—I intended to get some information about the Derby from him—I am not a betting man—I occasionally have a trifling bet but I am no betting man—I had not learned all that was needful for my purpose when I saw him I had not time—I had time to drink some spirits and water but I had a good many places to call at and being anxious to learn something about the Derby I made an appointment in the evening—I did not tell him that it was to learn something about the Derby I had been talking to him about horses—I make inquiry from a great many persons to know what their real opinion is as to the merits of different horses—that is of course to make a bet upon—I had asked the prisoner of course previously if he knew anything about it—he did not say that he understood all about it of course he said he did not know much about it—that was in the middle of the day but people very often say that that know a great deal—I did not see by his countenance that he was a sporting character I do not believe persons when they say they know little about things—thinking he might deceive me as to the amount of his knowledge I made the appointment—I was in the first public house with him about a quarter of an hour the landlord was there and a servant of Mr King s I do not recollect any one else—there was no friend of mine there—I met him in the evening by appointment and took him to my office—no one lives there but myself—I have some pictures of horses there there are pictures of another kind—I am not aware that there is a picture of a lady there is one of Time and Eternity—Eternity is not stark naked I dare say there are plenty of gentlemen in Court who have seen the picture—there is no indecent picture there—there is no naked woman there the upper part of the figures in Time and Eternity may be half naked and the feet are naked—the man is nearly naked—the woman is not lying down—I got it at a sale at a gentleman s house in the parish—I did not point that out to the prisoner—he looked at the whole of the pictures—there is a sofa in the office—I did not touch the prisoner at all—I never touched him at all—I was talking to him—one thing he asked me about was about the solicitor for defamation of character that was in the office and another thing he said was You must be a very rich man —I said I wish I was you may depend upon it I would not ride about in a butcher s cart —he said You must be at least worth 20 000l or 30 000l —I said I wish you could prove your words —he said I don t call yours a butcher s cart I call it a dog cart —I do not recollect anything else—I asked him about the Derby certainly that was at an after part after we had spoken about the other I had asked him to come on purpose—I began to speak to him about it immediately not the first thing in the course of conversation—I asked him which he thought was the horse likely to win the Derby he said at the present time he had no particular favourite and he asked me what I thought—I told him that I thought the—was a very good horse and very likely to win it—I do not recollect any further conversation about the Derby—the information he gave me was not very extensive—I have told you pretty well all that occurred—there was other conversation no doubt but I do not remember the particulars of it Q What made you keep him there an hour and a half A He sat there as long as he pleased—he was not there three hours—I will swear that and I should say not two hours—when he left the office and had got to the top of the street he said You will hear from me legally to-morrow Q Did you ask him what he meant A He was gone he walked away as he told me—I did not take the trouble to stop him for I stood in amazement—I was perfectly surprised and astonished at hearing the remark made—he had been in my office an hour and a half—we were on perfectly good terms while there—I did not follow him and ask him what he meant when he said this—I was really so surprised at the time for I could not tell what it meant COURT Q You said you did not take the trouble to stop him A No—I thought it was more of a joke than anything else MR BALLANTINE Q You thought it was a joke A Yes—I saw him again on the Thursday and asked him to ride with me because I thought I should ascertain or get some information about what he had said before— I considered it only a joke that was the very reason I took him up to ascertain what he meant by it—I did not know whether it was a joke or not—it was impossible for me to tell how he meant it—I did not want then to ascertain about the Derby it was to ascertain about those words—I took him up into my cart to learn that—it was a mere accident my seeing him afterwards coming out of the Angel—I did not say anything to him the first time in the cart about the words—I thought if it was said in anything more than a joke of course he would have mentioned it to me—I did not ask him—I spoke to him again when he came out of the Angel—I pulled up he walked towards the cart and I asked him if he was going that way—he said Yes and he got up and rode—I offered him the ride as I said before to ascertain the particulars of what he had said—I asked him of course if he had been to the Angel—I knew he had been to the Angel—I asked him what his business was there Q What business was that of yours A That is very true but we often ask things Q What had those mysterious words to do with his going to the Angel A I should think they had all to do with it—I asked him what his business was at the Angel—he said he wanted to see Mr Busk on particular business—I do not know what business it was of mine to ask him—of course it was to find out the meaning if there was any in the words You will hear from me legally to-morrow —I should say the Angel had something to do with those words—he said he had been to see Mr Busk—he did not say that till I asked him—I asked him what his business was at the Angel Q Why did you ask him that A Well we often ask questions that we have no business to ask COURT Q Do you mean that it was from mere curiosity A It was from mere curiosity to ascertain the meaning of those words You will hear from me legally to-morrow MR BALLANTINE Q What is your answer let us know what you mean to abide by did you in the first place ask him what he had been at the Angel for A I asked him of course what he had been at the Angel for—I could have no motive for doing it COURT Q What was your reason for asking him A The only reason I had was to ascertain the meaning of those words—of course I had that object—I wanted to ascertain what the meaning of those words was MR BALLANTINE Q Do you mean deliberately to swear that A Of course I can swear it—I swear that I had no other motive in asking him there is no doubt of it—I swear it—my object was of course to account for those strange words—you can take that as my answer Q What had his going into the Angel to do with those words A Because of course the Magistrates meet there—I could not tell from his mysterious way and what he said what his plans and motives could be—I wanted to know the meaning of the words he had used—the Magistrates meet at the Angel—it was on the same day that I saw him on the omnibus at Stamford-hill I got down at Bishopsgate-street—I said to him What are you going to get down here —it was not What Risley are you here —I was aware he was on the omnibus at Stamford-hill it was there that I said What Risley are you here when he got across the omnibus—when we got down by Mr Bax s I said to him What are you going to get down here and then I asked him to have something to drink—I did not offer him 5l I told him I had got 5l in ray pocket I wanted to see whether he said he would take it—that was after he had spoken about going to Brighton or Boulogne—I certainly did not mean to give it to him Q Did not you say to him Risley I have 5l in my pocket and did not ho say Money is of no use to me A He said money was no object to him he and his brother had 1 000l in the bank—he said Money at least 5l is of no use to me I have money in the bank but I never offered it to him—his answer was not Money is no use to me —I have been examined before—when he told me that he was going to Brighton or Boulogne I said Well I have 5l in my pocket I did it on purpose to hear what his answer would be to see if he would ask me for it—I never offered to give it him—he said 5l is of no use to me —I will not undertake to say whether it was 5l or Money but I quite believe it was 5l Q Have you ever been troubled in this way before by anybody The witness was here taken ill and removed from the Court under the care of a surgeon JOHN STANLEY I am the brother of William Stanley and live with my father and brother at Edmonton On Saturday 30th Dec I was in my cart and met the prisoner in the lane—I did not know him before he stopped me and asked if I had seen his father—I asked who his father was—he said Risley —I told him yes I had seen his father—at that time my brother was lying at home ill in bed and had been since the Thursday when he was brought home from London in a cab he had had a fit—he asked me if his father had said anything to me—I said he had—he asked me if my brother was at home—I said yes he was at home and ill in bed—he said Yes and so he ought to be —I said Why make such a remark as that —he then told me that my brother had tried to commit a capital offence upon him he said his reputation and feelings were very much hurt he had been to Mr Busk and Mr Busk was not at home—I said What charge have you against my brother you had better come down —he said No unless I have compensation before Monday I shall go to Mr Busk again —I saw the prisoner s father on the following Wednesday—I made an arrangement with him on the Tuesday to meet me by the Angel on Wednesday evening at 7 o clock—I went there on Wednesday at 7 o clock and there met the prisoner and his father I said to them Well this is an affair we cannot talk about in the street we had better go down to my brother s office —the prisoner said No I have had one trap laid there for me I don t have a second —we then walked up the street and I met my uncle in fact I had sent for him and he joined us—I then said to the prisoner Well young man what is this you charge my brother with this was in Silver-street in presence of my uncle and the prisoner s father —he said I make no charge against him —I then asked him if he was in London with my brother on the previous Thursday—he said No —I asked him a second time and he said accidentally he went up by the same omnibus—I then asked him what he charged my brother with opposite Mr Bax s—he said This is not a legal place to discuss such matters as these he said his father had given him a liberal and good education and he said Your family is lineally descended from the noble family of the Earl of Derby of the highest respectability and a rich family what is 500l or 1 000l to you or your family to settle a matter like this I have 100l in my pocket as well as you have —he then said Come along father and as he left he said You will hear from me legally by the 8th of next month —I turned round to any uncle and said Did you ever hear such a villain — it was then the prisoner said You will hear from me legally by the 8th of next month —this was on Wednesday the 3rd Jan Cross-examined Q This was a trap was it not A Not that I am aware of—it was certainly not a trap to catch the prisoner—I made the appointment merely to see what he had got to say as I intended to prosecute him—I wanted to see what he would say that I might prosecute him—I did it to hear what he had to say—I do not think that my object was to induce him to say something about money—I cannot say whether I knew that if he mentioned money I might prosecute him I might know that I did not—I made the appointment on purpose to hear what he had to say as I believed from the beginning that it was nothing but extortion—I knew very well that if he made any demand upon me I could prosecute him—I did not do it to get him to make the demand I merely wanted to hear what he had to say about it—he could do as he chose about mentioning money—I did not hope that he would—I did not hope anything about it I merely wished to bring him before a court of justice—he could say what he chose—my object was this I thought from the beginning that it was nothing more than extortion and I thought I was doing justice to my brother and to my country to prosecute him—I had not mentioned anything about the noble family of Derby—I do not know how he came to imagine we were so highly connected no doubt it was from his being so highly learned—he said his father had given him a good education—I had not said anything about it—there is no ground for it MR CLARKSON Q Is your brother subject to epileptic fits A Yes very much so—I know my brother s office where his business is carried on there are no indecent pictures there or anything of that kind and he never had one MR BALLANTINE Q He never had an indecent picture A No never that I saw—I swear there are none and I swear I never saw any—I saw no naked woman there—there is a picture of a woman I do not know the subject but it is not an indecent picture—it is partly naked there is something thrown over her—it is such that my brother never removed it when his friends or his sisters have been there—there is a cloth thrown across the legs it is otherwise naked—she is sitting down I think—there is a figure of a man not naked there is something across him and he has a scythe in his hand MR CLARKSON Q Where did your brother get it from A At a sale—it belonged to Mr Snell a very old inhabitant of the parish HENRY STANLEY I am the uncle of the prosecutor On 3rd Jan I was in Silver-street Edmonton—there was an appointment made with the prisoner s father and my nephew John Stanley to meet there—my nephew John informed me of it—when I got there I found John Stanley the prisoner and his father—I asked the prisoner what he came for whether there was not some accusation against William Stanley he said No — I had never seen him before —I asked him what he wanted compensation for he said he did not want any compensation—I asked what he came there for he said nothing he had only come to accompany his father—I said I thought you had come here to settle some sort of business where will you go —he said that was not a proper place to settle a case of this sort in and we went down a lane by the side of the shop the four of us—I asked where he would go and his father took him down the lane by the side of the shop that was in their way home—he then began by saying that the name was Stanley and that we were of lineal descent from the Earl of Derby and that we were a respectable family and a family that had money and 500l or 1 000l would be nothing to settle a matter like that Cross-examined Q You asked him distinctly if he wanted compensation A Yes and he said No EDWARD THOMAS BUSK Esq I am a Magistrate and usually preside in the Edmonton district—I cannot undertake to say that I was on the bench at Edmonton on Thursday 28th Dec last—I know the prisoner—he never preferred any charge of any kind before me against William Stanley—he did upon another occasion but not against that party The prisoner s statement before the Magistrate was read as follows — In the absence of my legal adviser I do not wish to say anything except that before meeting the Stanleys on the Wednesday night my father said to me If you see them and they want to compromise don t take anything and made me promise not to do so or he would go no further which I did JOSEPH BURNS I am a surgeon—I have seen William Stanley the prosecutor—he is not in a state to be brought in or to answer any questions he has had an epileptic fit GUILTY Aged 25 — Transported for Twenty-five Years MR BUSK stated that a similar charge had been preferred before him by the prisoner against another person some weeks previously MR CLARKSON stated that upon the prisoners apprehension two papers were found upon him setting out the circumstances of an alleged offence committed upon him by his former master fifteen months ago The JURY expressed their opinion that the present charge made against the prosecutor was totally without foundation 
t18551217-141  141 JOHN SIMMONDS feloniously threatening to accuse John Gossett Hill with assaulting him with intent to commit an infamous crime and thereby extorting money from him MESSRS BALLANTINE and PARRY conducted the Prosecution JOHN GOSSETT HILL I had chambers at the Albany in Aug I left them at Michaelmas I answered an advertisement of the prisoner s as valet and the prisoner presented himself to me I did not want a valet but a general servant and he was quite satisfied—some of the rooms at the Albany adjoining mine were being repaired—I had three rooms and there was a kitchen for my servant—the servant s room was at the top of the house but it was locked as I had been out of town some time and the key was on a bunch which I had just put away and as the prisoner came just as I was going out to dinner I told the servant to put some sheets on the other bed on the ground floor which I had previously occupied but the room had not been used for some time—I slept in another room on the ground floor— I have taken a house in St James s-square which at that time I was looking after and everything was disarranged at the Albany as I was on the eve of moving —the prisoner came into my service on 7th Aug and I went to a party that evening—the prisoner brought me my hot water and boots next morning and waited on me at breakfast but said nothing to me and I went to my engagements in the City at my usual hour—I returned about 6 o clock in the evening and just as I was going out again to dinner the prisoner said You came to my room last night you know you did you wanted to take liberties with me and wanted to get into bed I shall give you into the hands of the police or go before a Magistrate unless you give me a sum of money —I said How much will satisfy you —I was so horrified at this charge that I lost my presence of mind will 5l satisfy you —he said No a lawyer will give me that for making such a charge — this was at half past 6 o clock I had dressed and was going out I do not think I saw him when I came in till he came into the room at half past 6 o clock —I ultimately gave him a cheque for 45l and brought him the money next day—I was at that time on the eve of marriage my mother was in very bad health and was obliged to be taken away to drink the waters and my father is of an excessively excitable temperament—those matters operated on my mind—if I had been alone in the world I should not have hesitated a moment what course to pursue—the prisoner left my service on the following day on the afternoon of the 9th—I told him he must go and of course he was quite willing to do so and I afterwards received a letter from him—it was this day fortnight—I destroyed the first letter but this produced is another letter which I received from him this day fortnight—it is excessively insolent—I know his writing— Read Dec 7th Oxford Dear Sir —Having written two letters and received no answer I have taken the liberty to write the third and if I receive no answer from you you may expect to hear from some one else I have heard this part was illegible —— as I shall let my friends know and I shall expect an answer by return of post To Mr Hill Oughton House Harlow Essex —that is my father s house where I was staying—in consequence of that I consulted my solicitor and he gave me instructions what to do—I employed a policeman and secreted him behind the curtains at my house No 24 St James s-square—I made an appointment with the prisoner which was not kept by me that was by advice—it was kept by the prisoner—an appointment was then made for Monday the 10th at half past 8 o clock—a policeman named Crocker was engaged to watch and hear what took place—my brother in law was also present but concealed—I made the appointment by telling the servant to say if the prisoner called again that I should be at home at half past 8 o clock on Monday evening 10th Dec —the policeman Crocker was so situated as to hear what passed between us without being seen—the prisoner said I am very sorry to trouble you again but I want a little money my grandfather is willing to establish me in business if I can get some money —I replied On what grounds do you come to me —he said You know Sir —I said A repetition of that horrible charge which you made against in me the summer —he said Yes Sir —I said But when I gave you that 45l you promised me you would never trouble me again —he said But 1 have been ill and spent the money and I have seen such cases in the papers since then —I said What will you do if I do not give you any money —he said Consult with my grandfather and place it in the hands of a lawyer —I said But what will you accuse me of —he said Of haying come to my bed side and tried to take indecent liberties with me —I said How much money will you want —he said I do not know Sir and then after some hesitation said 20l —after some hesitation I said I suppose I must give it to you —I wrote this cheque for 20l produced and gave it into his hands and the constable and my brother in law came from behind the curtains and he was taken into custody—there is not a word of truth in the filthy accusation this man has made—it makes one sick even to think of it Prisoner Q When I came to you you said that I could come in that night and as my room was not ready I could sleep in your bedroom and I said that there was no occasion for that A Yes I think you said There is no occasion for that I have got my own rooms in Bruton-street and can sleep there —I said that I would rather have you come in that night and you did COURT Q Bo you mean that you said that ho might sleep in your bedroom A Yes that was a room which I had occupied before but I did not intend to occupy it again I occupied another room—all the rooms in the Albany open into one another MR PARRY Q A gentleman who has a servant in the Albany must sleep almost next to him A Yes GIDEON CROCKER police sergeant C 9 I was sent by the inspector at the station to Mr Hill s house and was employed to watch—I was out of sight but perfectly within hearing—Mr Hill s brother in law was also within hearing behind a curtain with me—the prisoner said that he was very sorry to trouble Mr Hill again but his grandfather had thought of getting him into some business in Oxford provided he could get a little more to put with it—Mr Hill asked him how he came to him for money the prisoner answered You know Sir —he said Is it a repetition of that horrible charge you brought against me in the summer —the prisoner Raid Yes —Mr Hill asked him what sum of money would satisfy him—he said that he did not know but afterwards said 20l —Mr Hill asked if he did not get the 20l what charge would he make against him—he said You know Sir you know you came into my bedroom and came to my bedside and wanted to get into bed or did get into bed words to that effect—he said nothing about indecent liberties at that time that I recollect but he did at the station—Mr Hill gave him a cheque for 20l and as he was going away I stopped him took him into custody and took the cheque out of his hand Prisoner s Defence I have always been living in gentlemen s families I lived with Mr Bigg about eighteen months I left him on 10th July and advertised Mr Hill answered it I arranged with him and went to him a fortnight afterwards I had eighteen months good character it was taken from me at the police office I showed it to Mr Hill and he was satisfied with it I told him if he was not satisfied Colonel Hall was living and he could make inquiries about it and my master was stopping at an hotel in Bond-street he said that he would but did not and I went to him on the first night I slept in the room I had been there about two hours when Mr Hill came in I went to bed about 10 o clock and he came in about 12 he came first to wash his hands and came in afterwards with a light in his hand and his dressing gown on The prisoner here entered into the details of the offence in question next morning he said You will not say anything to anybody I said No I knew nobody in London and had no acquaintance but Mr Bigg and dark I said to Clark I do not know what that gentleman did that I am living with but last night when I went to bed * * * * * what am I to do I cannot live with him he said Get him to make you some recompense and leave him I said I do not know what to do about it when Mr Hill came in I begged his pardon and told him I was very sorry but I was not comfortable in his place he had told me in the morning before he went out to sleep in my own room at the top of the house he said was not my own room comfortable I said Yes but that I could not think of stopping after what occurred last night and I wished to leave directly he said What recompense can I make you for your time said I do not know he said Will 5l do I said No nor yet ten he said what did I intend to do I said I intended to go away and see some one about it you have done me a great injury I have been waiting about three weeks for your place he said Before I would have the thing made known I would give you anything you like but more than 40l or 50l will ruin me he gave me three cheques for 45l and begged of me not to change them till next day and said that he would give me the money next day two of the cheques were on the same bank the three amounted to 45l next day he brought me 45l wrapped up in a piece of paper I gave him the three cheques back and he begged me to say nothing about it all that my room wanted doing to was I had to go down to the steward s office and she put some sheets on the beds that was the room I was to sleep in she brought the key next morning I only slept two nights there one in his room and one in my own I have always had a good character I have been in service from fourteen years old if Mr Hill had acted as a gentleman to me I should have done so as a servant I have lived with Lady Lee and several other persons but none of them are here COURT to MR HILL Q Had you been out to a party that night A I had been dining out—I came home about 12 o clock—I had not slept in that room for two or three months—it is true that I went into the room—I went in because my washing things were there—I washed my hands there and spent about a minute in the room altogether—I had no washing materials in the room where I slept-it is a library and the bed in which I slept was a press bed—the statement that the prisoner has made is absolutely false—I did not ask him to say nothing about it because I had done nothing—nothing of the sort passed—the whole thing is absolutely false—it is only because there are particles of truth which he has made a handle of—it is true that I washed my hands there that is the unfortunate circumstance and it is also true that he slept in that room—the rest is absolutely false—I cannot recollect whether I gave him one cheque or three but I can find out if it is material—I cannot say whether the laundress brought the keys the next morning but I could not find the keys and that is the reason that he slept in that room—it was first proposed that he should sleep in that room about 6 o clock the evening just as I was going away—I had not time to look for the keys as I was obliged to hurry—he brought a written character—I went to tie gentleman at Long s Hotel but he was not in town—I learned that he had been at the hotel and that was so far satisfactory—I went to the prisoner s lodging and they did not give him an unfavourable character but on the contrary—I gave direction to the laundress to prepare the bedroom for him at the top of the house—I saw her as I was coming down the passage and said Just have that room got ready Prisoner On the night that he came to my bed he said that he should not wish me to sleep in that room any more and that my room should be got ready next day Witness That is not true GUILTY Aged 22 — Transported for life

time—she occupied two rooms on the third floor—when she came to me she was a stock maker lately she has tried mantle work and nightcaps for a short time—she has been at work very little not so much as before—I have seen her write her bills—I believe this letter to be her writing—I remember the officers coming to search the premises about two months ago—they searched her rooms Mr Bruff and I were both present—they searched the whole of her boxes—I saw them take papers away they took them out of a desk of hers Prisoner Q Was not a letter addressed to Mr Simmonds enclosed to me in a letter addressed to Emily Taylor A It was so—I think there were two letters sent to Emily Taylor I am not quite sure there were two letters—the letter stated that she was to take it to the warehouse and say she had seen you write it— MR BODKIN here produced the letter —I did not look at the papers which the officers took—I believe the letter you speak of was given to you by Emily Taylor I do not know exactly how it came—it was shown to me I should think a year and a half before the officers came—there was a bad shilling inclosed in one of the letters you showed it to me—I do not know what became of that letter COURT Q How often have you seen the prisoner write A I think about three times I saw her write bills to put in the window for girls to work MR BODKIN Q Who is Emily Taylor A A girl who

am a detective officer of the City of London I have been for some time past employed to trace if I could the author of letters of this description—I have inquired at the places mentioned in the letter and learnt that they knew nothing of the prisoner—I went to the prisoner s lodging on 22nd April after I had taken her into custody—I found these two letters in a box in her room—the box was not locked—Mrs Bruff and Thain were present and I think Mr Bruff MIRIAM SMITH I am married I live at No 51 Cornhill I have known the prisoner nearly twenty years—she was a stock maker—I have seen her

I believe A Yes CATHERINE COLLINS I live in Bloomfield Street North Dalston I am in no business now I have been a stock maker—I was acquainted with the prisoner I am not now only for the time that I worked with her about sixteen years back—it is full thirteen years ago that I saw her and then quite promiscuously—I have seen her write—she used to write bits of poetry of an evening nothing wrong—I believe this letter to be her writing—it very much corresponds with letters that were written about me to Mr Hellaby—it is like the writing that I have seen of her s Prisoner I do not recollect you what was your name then Witness Catherine Molloy—I have been married fifteen years you recollect me very well—I have seen you write I have your writing by me now with your own signature to it EMMA ATKINS I live at No 22 Bartlett s Buildings I am the wife of Robert Atkins—I am a mantle maker—I know the prisoner very slightly she worked a little for me—she was living in the house at the time I took lodgings there two years ago—I have seen her write—I have seen letters written by her which she has said were her writing—I believe this letter to be her writing—I had received a great many letters and letters were sent to the house of Mr Bruff taxing me with being a most immoral character and my husband the same—they were very indecent dreadful letters—I taxed the prisoner with being the author of them in the presence of Mrs Bruff and she said Good God it is my writing Prisoner Q On what occasion did you see me write A On the evening of the Saturday on which a letter came—T came into your room and you were writing I and my daughter came to see a letter which you said you had received respecting me—I took a bill which you wrote which was exactly the same handwriting to show to the detective officer and then I asked Mrs Bruff to be a witness to my interview with you—I asked you if it was your writing and you threw up your hands and said Good God it is my writing Prisoner I said the bill was my writing certainly but not the letter COURT Q How often have you seen her write A Twice—the last time was two years ago—it was apparently a letter that I saw her write I did not read it I merely saw her writing—several letters struck me as being the same and my suspicions were aroused FRANCIS BABB I am a boot maker and live at No 5 Redcross Square I have known the prisoner for sixteen or eighteen years—I have seen her write several times—I believe this letter to be in her handwriting Prisoner Q On what occasion have you seen me write A I have seen you write bills repeatedly and one Sunday I saw you put down the income and outlay at my wife s request COURT Q How long ago is it since you saw her write A About three years ago—I may say I have seen her write dozens of times—I have looked at the writing afterwards— The letter in question was here read it commenced Sir please enclose on receipt of this one sovereign if not I will at once accuse you of an unnatural crime The remainder of the letter was totally unfit for publication Prisoner I wish the two letters addressed to Emily Taylor to be read THOMAS THAIN I am a detective officer of the City I accompanied Bull to the prisoner s lodging and took possession of this book—on a second occasion I took possession of a letter addressed to Emily Taylor—I found it among a parcel of papers in the room— This letter signed A Friend was addressed to Emily Taylor and requested her to make statements affecting the prisoner s character for which payment was promised —I have seen the prisoner write—I believe that letter to be in her handwriting Prisoner s Defence I can only say that these letters have been going on for the last five years they commenced by threatening that I should not remain in the stock business for a long time they sent letters to the house where I was living then they commenced at the warehouses where I used to work till they got me out of the work and when I got into another warehouse the letters began again then they took to writing to my work people similar to that of Emily Taylor asking them to say I was the party that sent these letters I was at last driven out of the stock business I took to the mantle business and the same thing commenced again while I was working for Welch and Margetson I had not been at work there a month when a letter was sent to the warehouse boy asking him to cut my work with a penknife and then go to Mr Margetson and say I had sent in my work imperfect Thain has that letter and also another that was sent to a young person that was working for me offering her a sovereign if she would when she went out to her dinner take two or three of the stocks with her and also an apron or anything of mine and carry them to Mr Welch and swear that I had sent her to pledge them and to tell Mr Welch that she had seen me write letters MR BODKIN stated that in consequence of what the prisoner had stated on the former trial the prosecutors had secured the attendance of the persons to whom the prisoner alluded and were prepared to produce such letters as she desired The prisoner called MARY ANN COWELL I have never seen the prisoner write letter—I received this letter produced by Thain at the commencement of last Oct twelve months—I took it back to Miss Hamilton the next morning Cross-examined by MR BODKIN Q Where did you get it from A It came to my house No 12 Princes Street by post—I am not acquainted with the prisoner s handwriting— this was a letter signed Mrs Thomas Clark addressed to the witness urging her to make false statements as to the character of the prisoner —I do not know any such person as Mrs Thomas Clark—the prisoner worked for Mr Welch EMILY TAYLOR I received this letter produced three years ago in Oct —the letter to Mr Simmonds was enclosed in it Cross-examined by MR BODKIN Q Have you worked for the prisoner A Yes in Bridgewater Square I sat in the same room with her—she had another room—she used frequently to go into that other room I do not know for what purpose—I have often fetched her writing paper and postage stamps—I have afterwards seen her go into the other room by herself and remain there some time—I have bought 6d worth of stamps at once and a quire of letter paper—she worked for Mr Hellaby at that time—I have never seen her write—she has been in the room by herself for three or four hours after I have fetched her the paper Prisoner Q Did I ever send you to post any letters to any persons A No—I am sure you have been in the other room as long as three or lour hours by yourself MR BODKIN Q Did she produce any needlework that she had done during that time A No she never took any in— At the prisoner s request a letter was also put in and read addressed to George Stock Department Welch and Margetson s Bridge Place Southwark Bridge Road to the same effect as the other CHARLES THAIN re-examined I believe this letter and the other to be in the prisoner

in a ditch and scratched him in the bushes then I flung a stone at his head and broke it he held up his hands and his head bled at that time being asked at what time this was he answered this is three weeks ago Cross examined Q Do you remember any thing said by the jury that they were satisfied before Ashley was sworn Gurney I do not David Hart sworn interpreter to Henry Simons Henry Simons On Wednesday the 21st of August between four and five in the afternoon as I was walking on foot my leg began to swell I went in at the Rose and Crown on this use Smallbury-Green to ask if I could lodge there I saw a witness that is here Lettice Sergeant I told her I would pay her for what I had if they would let me lie there the woman went backwards to ask in the mean time the prisoner brought some beer out at the door and asked me if I would drink with him I would not drink at all he attempted to pull me by the beard but never touched my beard I gave him a shove from me I had a walking cane in my hand but did not hold it up I never meddled with him after this the woman came out and told me I could not have a lodging I went away the prisoner came after me and I began to run he hollow d after me stop thief and ran after me there were gentlemen on horseback I ran between their horses the prisoner seemed to be a little in liquor after that I went to Brentford and there lodged at the Red-Lion I neither stumbled not tumbled at all there was no stone throwed after me nor none touched me I had no would nor mark of blood about me it was not above two minutes from the time of Ashley s asking me to drink and my coming up to the men on horseback On his cross examination he said he returned to London the day following that between the 21st and 29th of Aug he continued there and set out on Wednesday the 29th for Bristol and that night he was robbed Lettice Sergeant In August last I lodged at the Rose and Crown the house of Charles Rickets on this side the turnpike on Smallbury-green I was there from the latter end of April to Michaelmas Day I remember on the 21st of August Mr Rickets was starting of beer Ashley the prisoner was there almost all that day he had been drinking there are two benches at the door the Jew came there he sat on the bench on the left hand and I on the right he asked me for lodging as well as he could in broken English he turned up his linnen and opened his bosom to shew me he was a clean man and that he would pay for his lodging I went in and asked Mrs Rickets if she would lodge him She made a pish at it I came and told him he could not lodge there I believed I went by his desire again she said that she could not give an answer till she saw her husband in the mean time the prisoner went out of the house with a pint of beer in his hand and said old father will you drink the Jew shook his head and said something but I don t know what he never touched the pot then the prisoner called him a rogue and a Jew and endeavoured to take him by the heard and catched hold on him the Jew put his hand up and pushed him away the Jew continued till the gentlewoman came to the door then I said can you lodge this man she said I will go and ask my husband he gave him a heavy curse and said he was a Jew and should not I told him the poor man got up to go away Ashley sat down in his place and called him rogue and Jew the Jew turned again and as well as he could said he was not a rogue Ashley was a rogue he got up in great haste to run after the Jew I said to his wife it is a pitty don t let him follow him she took hold on his sleeve he gave a jerk and fell down the Jew turned round and looked at him then he went along I saw four gentlemen on horseback come along he got between their horses from the time of Ashley s coming with the beer and the Jew getting betwixt the horses Ashley had not thrown him in a ditch nor scratched him in the bushes or throwed a stone at him I never saw no such thing I was out at the door there all the time the gentlemen came up to the door to me after they had stopp d Ashley Mr Rickets at this time was in his shop learning out at the window where he fells his liquors he was not at that time out at t he door the gentlemen on horseback stopped Ashley and his wife got up there and took hold of him then the Jew was got out of fight Ashley never touched him in the pursuit The next morning Ashley was in the same house again a little before breakfast time the men were laughing at him for running after this man to use him ill Ashley said he never run after him for he was so drunk he could neither run after or overtake him The very night before the trial of Goddard the prisoner rode up in a post-chaise to Mr Rickets s house and called for Mr Rickets he was busy and asked what he wanted he said drive on boy to the post-boy and made Rickets no answer Q How many people saw this affair between the Jew and the prisoner L Sergeant The prisoner s wife one Rose Ford and one Baily a butterman And on her cross examination she said The prisoner catched hold on the Jew s beard the Jew had a stick in his hand but never offered to lift it from the ground or offered to strike him that the Jew said no heard no heard that the Jew did not run till he saw the prisoner running towards him That the prisoner gave him a heavy curse that she continued sitting on the right hand side in the poach but got up and went into the road while they were running that she saw no stones throwed that there is a very clean ditch no briars to hang over it it is a deep ditch on one side but the Jew run more on the other side that the Jew crossed right against Madam Spire s having not run above twenty yards before he crossed the way Rose Ford I remember seeing the prisoner and the Jew at the alehouse near Smallbury-green I was at the door when the Jew came up Ashley stood at the door with a pint of beer in his hand he asked the Jew to drink he refused to drink I came away from there it may be about thirty or forty yards from the door I had my little boy with me I stood still looking about me I saw the Jew come from Mr Ricket s door and in a little time came Ashley swearing and cursing stop thief he has robbed me they ran strait the road then crossed into the foot-path I gave the Jew room to come by me Ashley was so fuddled he never could overtake him neither did he throw a stone at him nor was he thrown in a ditch there were some gentlemen coming the Jew ran between their horses they asked what was the matter I said there was nothing the matter he had robbed him of nothing Ashley answered he has robbed me of my beer The Gentlemen said to Ashley you sorry man let the man go about his business and do you go along with us to the Rose and Crown or we ll horsewhip you Q Is there a ditch R Ford There is a ditch but very little briars and things grow over it there is a wall by Mrs Spires s Q How did any body know you was able to give evidence of this R Ford I told it to my landlady Elizabeth Jennings as soon as I got home I talked of it many times after he had swore against the Jew The Attorney heard of it and so subpoena d me On her cross-examination she said after being often asked there was no stone thrown that she had them in fight all the while and was positive of it that she saw the very beginning of it that she had been chairing at Rickets s house Gregory Wright I live at the Temple-Muse Fleet-street White Fryars on the 21st of August last I set out from my house after one o clock for Newberry-Fair by myself till I came on the other side Hammersmith there Mr Pain and Mr Mercer overtook me we lay at Maidenhead that night we continued in company till we came to Newberry upon out going between the Coach and Horses on the other side Brentford and the Rose and Crown Alehouse before we came at the Turnpike I saw one man pursuing another we might be about two hundred yards from the Rose and Crown Alehouse I saw it was a Foreigner by his dress that was pursued which made me anxious to enquire what was the matter the man behind called out stop Thief stop Thief which I believe to be the prisoner at the bar when the Jew got to us he got between Mr Pain s horse and mine the drunken man the pursuer scrambled up near we kept him back the drunken man said he is a rogue and a villain we desired he d tell us what he had done he said he has drank my beer and ran away and would not pay for it said I if that he all let the poor man go about his business and what is to pay I ll pay it no said he he would not and made a scuffle to come at the Jew I took particular notice of the Jew he made signs holding his hand up to his beard we said he should desist then he said to me you have robbed me said I if this is the case you are a villain and if you say so again I ll horse-whip you we stopped him there till the Jew got near to the houses at Brentford he was very near turning the corner where the bridge is I believe on my oath the Jew was at least two-hundred yards off I turned myself on my horse half britch to see whether he was secure the drunken man swore and cursed and used many bad words there came a woman and took hold on him she seem d to be his wife she desired him to go back he fell down then Mr Pain said the man is safe enough the last woman that gave evidence told me nothing was the matter that the Jew did nothing to him he had drank none of his beer but refused it and that he made an attempt to pull him by the beard with that we advanced towards the Crown Alehouse I and I believe Mr Pain stopt with me there was the woman that was examined first I asked her what was the matter she said no thing at all I said if there is anything to pay for beer that that poor Jew has drank I am ready to pay for it she said the Jew did no harm to the man nor drank none of his beer Q Had there been a stone throw d Wright I saw none throw d and believe the man was so drunk that he was not able to pursue or over-take him I saw the woman at the door the time they were running they crossed the road backwards and forwards the Jew kept it may be fifteen or twenty yards before him I kept my eye upon them from the first of the calling out stop thief On his cross examination he said When they first heard the alarm he believed the Jew might be within fifty yards of the alehouse and they about two-hundred yards from the Rose and Crown alehouse that they were nearer that than the Coach and Horses that they met the Jew about two-hundred yards on this side the Rose and Crown alehouse that he saw no blood or mark at all on the Jew that he made no such complaint or sign to his head but said my beard and sign d to it Ambrose Pain I keep a farm and deal in horses and I live at Tottenham-high-cross I was in company with Mr Wright and Mr Mercer on the other side Brentford on this side the Smallbury-green Turnpike I don t know the signs I saw the Jew drinking and a man pursuing him I can t say I heard the cry of stop thief the Jew seem d to be terribly frightened and got between Mr Wright s horse and mine he sign d as if the drunken man attempted to pull him by the heard I did not see him dirty as if thrown in a ditch nor scratched any more than I do now I saw no blood about him neither did he make any signs to his head we prevented this drunken man from hurting him and I believe I called him rascal and villian for his pains I beckon d to the Jew to get away he immediately went away I staid a little while and left Mr Wright and Mr Mercer and kept walking on and said he is safe enough now the man was gone a pretty way from them the drunken man was fallen down on the road and a woman came to him and had got him by the arm I can t say I know these women again there was a woman or two there Stephen Mercer Mr Pain Mr Wright and I were going together for Newberry this Jew was running and the prisoner pursuing him the Jew was about fifty yards from the Rose and Crown alehouse when I saw him first the prisoner called out stop thief the Jew was about fifty yards before him they kept making towards us the prisoner was so fuddled he could not catch him we threatened to horse-whip Ashley Mr Wright asked Ashley what he had robbed him of he said of his beer then he said tell me what beer and I ll pay for it Q Did you see any stones throw d Mercer There where none at all throw d we all looked at them the Jew was not thrown in the ditch nor no appearance of dirt upon him or scratches or blood upon him then he put his hand up to his heard and said pulla me heard pulla me heard was all his complaint we stopp d Ashley and saw the Jew almost to the bridge going to Brentford there was a little woman came up and said why can t you come home you drunken fool he spoke an ugly word and gave her a shove and said go along said I to her what has the Jew robb d this man of nothing at all said she Mr Wright ask d that woman what had happened at the alehouse saying if he had drunk any beer he d pay for it she said he had drank none of his beer the other woman gave the same account Q to Mr Wright again How came you to know of this trial to give your evidence Wright I was waiting at the door of the grand jury last sessions to find a bill against a person as I was leaning over the rails I heard Lettice Sergeant talking about the affair of this Jew the Jew I observed looked me out of countenance I asked his interpreter what he look d at me so hard for he said he believed he knew me The woman said she was come to support the cause of this poor unhappy man and added that in August last there were four gentlemen coming on the road when he was pursued and he has made all the enquirey he can to find them out and can t find any of them said I what time in August she said the 21st I look d at the Jew and saw he was the same man I ask d his interpreter whether he was pursued by any man he said yes he was I said to the woman I know the men by which means I was brought to the grand jury about this affair this bill and mine were in together Mary Ridgway I live at the Red-Lion and Punch-Bowl in Old Brentford this Jew came and ask d for a lodging at my house the 21st of August last in the afternoon before dark I turned up his cloaths and said if he was clean he should seeing him very clean I bid him walk in he came in he said Selse Selse hundreds I did not understand him I thought it was to lie by himself what he meant don t know when he lay down in the bed I went to fasten the door he opened his bosom I saw a belt next his skin after he was in bed he turned the cloaths a little back and said hundreds hundreds again I had before taken notice of his face and hands fearing he had got the itch he was all clean had no blood nor scratch upon him he had no dirt on him Q Did he make any complaint of his head M Ridgway He made no complaint to me I make all my beds myself there was no blood about the sheets the next day He came again the 28th of August I ask d him if he would lie there then he said no Bristol Bristol said I don t tell of your hundreds fearing you should be robbed on Hounflow-Heath then he turn d himself round and pull d out a piece of gold much like a half guinea I asked a woman what it was she did not know then I delivered it to him again and by his meaning as far as I could understand it was a ducat he said he had hundreds Elizabeth Gill I liv d with Mrs Ridgway in August last I saw the Jew when he ask d for a lodging he was examin d to see if he was a clean man Mrs Ridgway said he would not lie with company when he came in I saw no dirt on him or scratches or blood or wound on his head Eliz Jennings Rose Ford lodged with me in August last she came in a doors in a great hurry and asked me if I had seen a Turk go by then she said I mean a Jew I said I did not observe She said that fellow Tom Ashley has been running after a poor man calling Stop thief and I am sure he did not rob him of any thing or do him any wrong that he had called at the Rose and Crown to ask for a lodging that four men were on the road and asked what was the matter and she said nothing at all that they asked Ashley what he had robbed him of he said of his beer that the gentlemen said if Ashley would not go back to the Rose and Crown they would horsewhip him and she said that was very good of them and added Ashley is now gone to the Rose and Crown and the Jew is gone on the road Richard Strickland The prisoner at the bar told me he had been a witness at the Old Bailey for Mr Goddard and that Goddard was cleared and that he took him down to his house to be paid for his trouble that after he had made him welcome he took him by the hand and led him to the door and said Mr Ashley I shall have a respect for you all the days of my life for you actually saved my life though I deserve to die for I actually robbed the man then he took him in again to pay him for his trouble and asked him what he must have he answered he would trust to his honour then Goddard throwed him down half a guinea and asked if that would satisfy him he grumbled and then he threw him down a crown more and at last he made it up a guinea then as he went away he told him to come again such a day there would be some gentlemen there He went and said he thought there were a hundred gentlemen at the table that they called for a plate to gather money for him that a gentleman had gave a shilling then Mr Goddard came and took the plate out of his hand seized Ashley by the collar and turned him out at the door saying he was a rogue so he went away very angry some time after this there was a trial to come on at Westminster-hall Ashley was subpoen d there he told Goddard he did not care to go and that if he did he should do him more hurt than good unless he would pay him better for it I have heard Ashley grumble about it many times that he was not paid enough that had he known as much as he then did he would not have spoke till he had been better paid Q How long have you known Ashley Strickland I never knew him till I went to work with him about a month after Michelmas last Q When did he tell you this Strickland We have talk d much of this in our work and one time he told me as we were going from London home the 10th of Febr which was Shrove-Monday that Goddard took him to the Black Bear in Piccadilly that night and he was to come for a witness at Westminster the next day he said he told Goddard he had better not let him be a witness unless he would give him five guineas or if not he would blow and tell all he had told him Thomas Woodman I had a warrant brought to me from Mr Waters to go to take Ashley I went down to Twickenham and was told he was in the Earl of Northumberland s garden at work I did not care to go there but waited till six o clock for their leaving work I was going up to the garden that I might see him to know him I had a servant with me that walked behind me he stopp d Ashley I turned back and told him I had a warrant against him he seemed very much surprized and asked me for what I said I supposed he know d but when we came into the chaise I would inform him I took him into the Inn where my horses were and in a room I told him the purport of my warrant was for giving evidence for Goddard at the Old Bailey I had a warrant from my Lord Mayor backed by Justice Fielding I said I suppose you are no stranger to it you know you ill treated the Jew and it is a very bad thing you did to a stranger you ought to let strangers go about their business you broke his head pray whereabouts did you break it he put his hand to his temple and said hereabouts I got him into the chaise and rode with him in it and let the constable ride my horse as we were going along he told me that the night Mr Goddard was discharged at the Old Bailey he went home with him and after some time Mr Goddard took him out into his yard and shook him by the hand and said Mr Ashley I thank you for the good office you have done me you have saved my life I ought to have - Prisoner s counsel What he says Mr Goddard said is no evidence and ought not to be mentioned here Woodman He said Goddard gave him half a guinea he grumbled and said you may as well give a guinea as a shilling that they had some words then he made it three crowns but at he made it a guinea For the prisoner Charles Rickets I live at the Rose and Crown a little on this side Smallbury-Green Turnpike I remember this Jew came to my house the 21st of August about three or four o clock Ashley at that time was there he work d with Mr Clements the Jew ask d for lodging I said to him he was of the wrong country when he found he could not lodge there he was going away from the door Ashley had been drinking a little he offer d some beer to him out of his pint instead of giving him beer he laid hold on his heard and shook him by it Ashley did not deliver his pint to him then the Jew took himself away about ten or fifteen yards he had a sort of a cane and a black string to it he shook it at him then Ashley ran after him and pelted him with gravel stones across the road backwards and forwards whether he hit him or no I can t say he flung several handfuls of loose gravel stones a dozen times very likely Q Which way did they run Rickets Towards Brentford Bridge there were some horsemen came up so we could not see whether the Jew was in the ditch or not The horsemen said when they came to my house the drunken man had throw d him in the ditch they were gentlemen like they came and asked why the Jew was used so ill my wife and I both spake to them then they ask d if he had left his reckoning to pay we said he had nothing to drink nor did he ask for any only lodging I saw no more of the Jew nor did I see Ashley till next morning On his cross examination he said He was here on Goddard s trial that Ashley then was examin d that he himself was also examined then and gave the same evidence he does now that he then said he saw Ashley pelt the Jew with gravel stones and he told the same then as to the horsemen telling him Ashley had put the man in the ditch that he was waiting upon some gentleman with liquor at the door at the time that some of the gentleman were on horse-back some on foot that some of them live at Windsor that he spoke with the Jew twice himself before Ashley came out with his beer that he saw the Jew go to lay hold on the pint pot and was within three or four yards of them at the time that the Jew might be twenty or twenty-five yards off before Ashley could set out after him that the Jew was about a hundred yards from his house before Ashley took up any gravel to throw at him and that Ashley might be within thirty yards of the Jew that he never saw Ashley catch the Jew that he did not see the horsemen stop Ashley nor see Ashley fall down on the ground Being again asked whether the horsemen did or did not say the Jew was put in the ditch and bid to be careful what he said for the gentlemen were in court he said they did not tell him so and added he had not said they had told him so Q Has not Mr Goddard been now out of the court to tell you what the witnesses have sworn for the crown before you came in Rickets Mr Goddard did come out but I did not hear him say any thing at all about it Q to Mr Wright Did you or any of you tell this witness the drunken man had thrown the Jew into the ditch Wright When this witness said so it gave me a shock we neither of us told him so I saw Ashley down there were none but women at that man s house when we came there George Wheeler I was present at the Rose and Crown when the Jew applied to Mr Rickets for lodging Mr Rickets said he had none he was of the wrong sort Ashley came out there with a pint of beer and asked the Jew to drink the Jew went to drink Ashley catched the beer away and took hold of his beard and gave it a shake or two The Jew said Don t don t let me alone in English He went away about 15 or 16 yards and shook his stick at Ashley Ashley ran after him all down the Road and threatened to knock him down we stood at Mr Rickets s door the Jew was about five or six yards before him as they ran Ashley threw stones and pelted him all down the Road as far as I could see I saw him pick up stones gravel and one thing or another I saw none of them hit him he followed the Jew 200 yards and above I did not see him throw him in the ditch he was very near it once on the right hand side the horsemen stopped all at once and I could not see him any more On his cross-examination he said He was servant to Mr Freeman a brewer that they were starting beer at Mr Rickets s house and putting the butts into the cellar that he saw the Jew come up first and ask for lodging that he had not seen Ashley before he came out with a pint of beer in his hand that the Jew had not given him any offence as he knew of that Ashley picked up stones to throw when the Jew was about fourteen or fifteen yards from the door and continued throwing all the way as far as he could see till they met the gentlemen now and then stooping and hallooing that he heard nothing of stop thief that he did not see the Jew go in between the horses that the gentlemen might be ten or fifteen minutes talking to Ashley in the road that he went into the cellar to work and don t know what became of Ashley that he did not see Ashley fall that he saw Ashley s wife go out of the house to stop him but did not see her come up with him James Chivers I was one of the brewers the last witness and I were laying down beer at Rickets s house I saw the Jew come up to the door to ask for a lodging the prisoner was in liquor the landlord denied the Jew lodging he went away Ashley followed him and pelted him along the road he might catch up the gravel and fling at him I am sure I saw that but can t tell how often They ran a good way down the road it may be a hundred yards Q Did you see the Jew down in the ditch Chivers I did not nor any blood upon him I went down in the cellar to work as the gentlemen rode by On his cross-examination he said The Jew went away directly on his being denied lodging that the Jew was but about the length of the Sessions house from the alehouse when Ashley began to follow him John Bendwell I was by when the Jew applied to Rickets for Lodging Mr Rickets denied him he asked again and pulled out money I think it was a sixpence and said I have money to pay Mr Rickets said you are of the wrong Country I can t lodge you Ashley came out with a pint of beer in his hand and asked him to drink he offered to take the beer instead of that he took the Jew by the beard and shook him pretty handsomely the Jew got about ten or twelve yards or more off and turned about and shook his stick at him then Ashley swore if he did not go along he would break his head he went forward and turned round in about ten yards more then Ashley set out after him and took up stones one two or three I believe and throwed at him and ran after him almost as far as we could see and kept picking up something we could not tell what I did not see any stone light upon him he pursued him as near as I can guess about a quarter of a mile there was a ditch on each side I saw some Horsemen come up I saw the Jew in the ditch he fell against a bank almost a quarter of a mile from us I saw Ashley at the same time tak up something and fling at him there were four five or six people on horse-back came this might be about twenty yards from them Q Are there any bushes on that ditch Bendwell There are a very few briars We laugh d pretty heartily when they ran down the road it was a merry thing for us On his cross examination he said There were three servants of us we had just done our work in the cellar and was come up Ashley was in liquor he began to throw at the Jew as soon as he came into the road that he did not see a woman with a child in the road upon the Jews being in the ditch the horsemen came up and stopped Ashley was not within reach of the Jew when he was in the ditch that he thinks the Jew by looking back at Ashley stumbled into the ditch he can t say that Ashley put him in the ditch he did not perceive the horsemen to lend him a hand out of the ditch they stopp d right against him when he was in the ditch that he did not see him go out of the ditch because the horses hindered their seeing that he did not stay at Mr Rickets s door till the horsemen came there but went in and smoak d a pipe that they were all of them in company and none of them in the cellar to help finish the work that they had quite done that they did not see the Jew go in between the two horses that he is sure the horsemen must have seen the Jew in the ditch that he did not hear Ashley cry any thing after the Jew that he hallowed after him but what the words were he could not tell that he did not see any body stop Ashley on the road that Ashley was down among the horse-men when the Jew was in the ditch that he don t remember Goddard had spoke to him out of the court John Bailey I was going up to Mr Rickets with some butter with a cart and horse I saw the Jew cross the road against Mr Spires s about two hundred yards from Mr Rickets coming towards Brentford Ashley ran away after him and threatned to kick him they came so near my horse s head that I pull d the reins to stop fearing I should run the Jew into the ditch my cart had a tilt so I could not see behind when my boy called to me I saw two or three horsemen come up near the place where the boy said they are in the ditch together we were about one hundred and fifty yards from the place I thought it was all gone off Q How far is Mr Spires s from the Coach and Horses Bailey It is about two or three hundred yards from it On his cross examination he said The Jew and Ashley might be three or four yards asunder as they run that he saw nothing thrown that he did not stop his cart that the place were his boy said they were in the ditch is about three or fourscore yards from Mr Bates s the minister s house Edward Beacham I am thirteen years of age I was in master s cart and saw the Jew and Ashley run they ran 2 or 300 yards farther than the cart the cart was pretty near a hundred yards from the Rose and Crown I saw the Jew stumble into the ditch he was against the bank Ashley was not far from him then I did not see any stones thrown I could not see whether Ashley came up to him because there was a mob of four or five horsemen I did not see Ashley do any thing to him the horsemen were not within sight when the Jew fell into the ditch they came up in three or four minutes they stopp d and soon rode away again On his cross-examination he said he believed Ashley was eight or nine yards from him when he was in the ditch that there was a great mob besides horsemen about him six or seven when he was in it he can t say whether the horsemen were come up before he got out that he did not see him get out Martha James I live at Isleworth with the Rev Henry Bates at the same side Spires lives on betwixt two and five in the afternoon on the 21st of August I heard a noise in the road when I thought it came nearer I went out I saw three or four gentlemen-like farmers and the prisoner in the middle of the highway I saw the Jew with a long sort of a garment on a little on this side the prisoner the gentlemen went away the prisoner took up gravel and pelted the Jew then he put his hand to his garment and took out a sort of a dirty rag that was tied there he held it up to the side of his face and cried in a mourning manner I pittied him and thought he was hurt then master came and I said there is Ashley drunk I never saw a man so drunk in my life he was fallen down in a ditch I desired my fellow servant to go and help Mrs Ashley

better she being with me 2 or 3 times about it Q Did you see her sign it Thomas I believe I saw her sign it or acknowledge it to be her mark and also that I swore her which is always done previous to the caption I have no doubt in the world but that the person who signed this information was sworn Q Here is a place erased and also an interlineation in another place on it did you observe them before it was sworn Thomas I can t say I remember them Mr Hill I saw the woman at the bar come to Guildhall and heard Mr Thomas administer the oath to her I kept the door there Q Can you take upon you to say this is the information which she swore without alteration Hill I cannot say William Carter I know Jane Blynn I had a warrant against Edward Rowland John Ashmore William Fitzmorris and Richard Benton upon an information she made He produced the warrant I took up William Fitzmorris John Ashmore and Richard Benton on the 3d of Aug 1753 Jane Blynn came to me several times about that since and talked to me about it I heard her say she had been sworn and one Thomas Westbyer appeared as her solicitor on this occasion He told me at Guildhall coffee-house on the 8th of August that neither Stevens nor Blynn were sworn to that information upon which I went to Guildhall and met Mrs Blynn I asked her whether she was sworn or not to the information She told me she had been sworn to the information and if there were occasion she would go before my lord and swear it again This I made a memorandum of Q Did you take up any others by virtue of that warrant Carter I believe I took up 5 more Some gave notice and put in bail and never were in custody There were Isaac Thorp Robert Baskerville Edward Rowland and one Trottman there are eleven in all in the information Edward Rowland I never was in the prisoner s house in my life nor never spoke to Stevens or her to my knowledge nor had any concern with either of them Q Was you in her house in the year 1753 breaking the windows Rowland No never in my life I never had any conversation or concern with her about what she has charged me with When I was told there was a warrant and some people taken up and that I was in it I sent notice to the prisoner of bail and took two of my neighbours and bailed it at justice Fielding s Q Was you in a mob about her door Rowland I never saw a mob there I saw as I was in my own house John Stevens arrested Q Was you bail for any person Rowland I was bail for Mr Thorp Mary Beesmore I have heard Jane Blynn frequently say to Mr Stevens and swear besides wishing many a bitter wish she would have revenge of Mr Rowland because he was an acquaintance of that rogue Thorp that keeps the Ship and that she would drive the place of them both Q Where do you live M Beesmore I live in Petty-France very near the Ship Q How came you to hear her say this M Beezmore I frequently went to her house about the time of these quarrels Q What was the cause of her animosity against Thorp M Beezmore I can t

for her saying so S Jacobs I know not the reason But she said they were a combination of thieves and blackguards and Mr Salt at the Gatehouse was the biggest of them all and that she would make beggars of them all I have heard her say she did not know them to be acquainted with them She sent for me when she went out of her house and said Mrs Jacobs you are a very honest woman your word will go in a court you never was brought in question you must swear that Thorp Ashmore and Rowland came every day to the door and threatened to have us out life and limb when we came upon trial this was after she could not get bail She told me she was sadly afraid Mr Waters does not do me justice come along with me and let me examine him He gave her but little encouragement in her affair and she seemed to be afraid of him She said also that Stevens s character was so bad that she would not take her trial with him for if she did she should be cast and you must say he is gone you know not where she said she would say so and then I might after her said I can you say so before the face of a judge when you put him out of the way for a day or two Q How long was you in her house L Jacobs I was 4 months there I never saw her since because I would not swear it The reason of my going to her first was my husband had pawned some things there when she lived in the Broad-way Westminster and she was gone and we could not find her at last we found her in Goswell street and she said we were forced to come away from there because there was no peace Isaac Thorp I was indicted at Westminster sessions

they had pawned these were all the riots that I saw and she and Stevens would not let them have them although they brought their money in their hands Simon Jacobs I have heard Jane Blynn say many a time she would be the ruin of Thorp and Ashmore and said we must do it for them for they are the best feathers to pluck and that she d not leave one a pot of beer to draw or the other a loaf of bread one being a baker the other kept an ale-house and says Stevens I ll get a sheep s heart and take the congealed blood out and say it was human blood from their beating Thomas Jennings I lived next door

remember Jane Blynn and there was a man with her she called him John Stevens and he swore to the truth of this information it was taken at Guild-hall before my lord chief justice Lee John Hill I am bar-keeper at Guild-hall I have seen the prisoner there several times in August 53 I remember there was a man and a woman I believe she was the woman tried here some time since and I really believe the prisoner was the man they came to Mr Thomas to lodge an information Q Did you know the prisoner before that Hill I have seen him hundreds of times he went by the name of Cuddy Stevens I have a very ill opinion of him I remember seeing Mr Thomas hand a paper to him and ask if it was his hand-writing and just at that time somebody cried open the door officer and I was obliged to open the door I was then within three yards of him I remember also at the same time a man said to me don t you know that man that is Cuddy Stevens Q Then you can t say you saw him sworn Hill I cannot William Carter I was tipstaff to my lord chief justice Lee I remember there was a warrant dated August 21 1753 to be executed upon Isaac Thorp and several others I can t say who brought it to me but remember the prisoner at the bar came to me as a prosecutor several times along with Blynn both before and after the execution of it Isaac Thorp The prisoner once lived in my neighbourhood about twelve doors from me but not in the same street there was Jane Blynn lived with him they had taken in pawns and as people came to take them out they would not let them have them and people made complaints and there used to be mobs about the door Q Was you near her house on the 14th or 17th of July 1753 Thorp I was not on both days I was in my own house the Ship a public-house I had had a trial with this prisoner

pounds to have a riot sworn against me Q Did you ever threaten to murder him or Jane Blynn Thorp No I never did Q Did you ever offer a reward to any to do it Thorp No I never did John Alexander I was constable that time I was at Stevens s house on the 17th of July 1753 along with one Fitzmorris to serve a warrant on him if Mr Thorp had been there I must have seen him Stevens made resistance and I was obliged to charge others to assist me to haul him along Mary Turner I laid at Mr Thorp s in August 1753 I remember there was a disturbance in the street on the 17th of July before his door some time in the afternoon and I know my master was in his house with some gentlemen and was engaged at home till late at night Patrick Holborn Mr Thorp is a neighbour of mine I remember being at his house on the 17th of July I went there at about five in the afternoon and staid till half an hour after nine we were smoking a pipe together in his back room I remember it by having a warrant in my pocket to take up a woman in that neighbourhood I never heard of any riots at the prisoner s house except it was by people whom they would not let have their goods which they had pawned Hannah Russel I was a chair-woman to the prisoner and Jane Blynn when they lived in the Broad-way Westminster there used to be people continually coming for their goods which they had pawned I cannot remember any particular day because every day was alike by people coming for their goods but I never saw Mr Thorp or Mr Ashmore or any of the persons charged in the information in any of the disturbances at the door they used to make me give answers at the door and they would keep out of sight as much as they could Sarah Jacobs I was four months in Stevens s house to my sorrow when he and Blynn lived in Goswel-street sometimes they passed for man and wife sometimes for mistress and servant because if they passed for man and wife they could not swear for each other I heard the prisoner say many a time he was forced to come away from the Broad-way Westminster on account of the riots by people coming for their goods and he has often said he would be revenged on Thorp Ashmore and Rowland and three parts of the people in the Broad-way and would go to law with them till he brought them to beggary and he often said he was then at a great loss for people to swear for him he was used to have people to swear for him at any time but said they were all dead he said several times to me I must swear Thorp and they came to his house and made riots and he said Jacobs should go and swear likewise and threatened to have him and Blynn out of the house life and limb I said I knew neither of them and I would not swear any such thing For the prisoner Elisabeth Rogers I was in Jane Blynn s house along with Mrs Jacobs she was left in possesion for them I never heard Mrs Jacobs say the prisoner bid her swear as she has sworn here but I once heard Mrs Jacobs say Mrs Blynn asked her to swear so Richard

you old b - h I ll knock your brains out she threw the lock away and her husband and she took Mr King by the collar I thought they would have strangled him She Mrs Jacobs called me a thousand old

Q Have you your minutes here Gurney I expecting to be call d upon this trial before the trial of Baynham and Clifton was put to the press was very careful to examine and correct it and am able to say the trial in the Sessions-Paper is a just copy of what pass d in court as to the substance of the evidence given on that trial The clerk of the Arraigns takes and reads part of the evidence of Broadbent and Hennet as much as concerns the present indictment See the trial No 35 and 36 in last December sessions John Harrison and his wife were next examined then Frances Jones their maid servant then Thomas Fryer then James Delton who all agreed as to the substance of what they deposed on the former trial to which for want of room in this paper the reader is referr d John Baynham I was tried in this court in December sessions accused with committing two rapes one on the person of Elizabeth Broadbent and the other on Rachel Hannet on the 6th of July at the Three Compasses in Little Wild-Street On the 20th of October last Mr Tew came in at the Three Compasses he asked me if I knew a watch-maker that wore his own hair tied behind Mrs Harrison said do you not know his name He said he did not nor did he say what he wanted him for then he went out Soon after he returned again and asked for one Baynham We said he was not there then he went out again He came several times that day that Baynham with his hair tied behind is my first cousin Mrs Harrison said that man meaning Tew came about a rape which she heard was mentioned at justice Cox s to have been committed at her house I then went down to Brook s-Market to my cousin and told him that a lawyer had came about a rape said to have been committed at the Compasses and that it had been talk d of at justice Cox s and the lawyer inquired for him he said he knew nothing of it and that they could do nothing to him he then came with me to the Three Compasses and had some oisters and beer Then Mr Tew came in again and said is Mr Baynham here yes says I my name is Baynham what do you want with me says he you are not the person I want he then said if I would stay a little while he would soon put an end to it to clear me and save himself the trouble of coming again Accordingly I staid I think but am not certain that Raminger came with Tew he went out I think and return d I know he brought Elizabeth Broadbent with him Said Tew to her don t be afraid no body shall hurt you is any body here you know Tew and I were sitting together She pointed to me directly after that Raminger said I ll go and fetch the other girl no no said I you shall not go by yourself let some body go with you then one Watkins a friend of mine went with him I can t find him now or I would have had him here Raminger then brought in Rachel Hannet and said to her do you know any body her she looked about a long time Then said they let her sit down she did next to Broadbent and did not speak for a great while only looked upon one and another There were a great many people in the house I saw Hannet stoop down to buckle her shoe and I heard words pass between her and Broadbent she would not mention any body then but got up on her feet we all got out of the box and I stood by the fire She went to Raminger by the cellar stairs and there were some words past said he is that the man pointion to one and another is that the man with a pot in his hand one had a pot in his hand I observed Raminger and Tew were together by the cellar stairs when Hannet pointed to me Q What were they doing Baynham They seem d to be whispering together I don t know what they said Q Who had the pot in his hand Baynham That I believe was my cousin At last she came and touch d me then Raminger collar d me directly and said her was a constable and left me in Mr Tew s care till such time as he got a warrant When he came back with the warrant he collar d me and took me to St Martin s Round-house where I lay all night and from thence to justice Cox s after which I took my trial here Q How long was Hannet in the room before she fix d upon you Baynham I believe 25 minutes Q Did you ever ravish either of the girls Baynham No I never saw either of them in my life before to my knowledge Q When did you first become acquainted with Sarah Clifton Baynham Upon my oath I never saw her to my knowledge till I saw her in Newgate after I was committed I never saw the prisoner before that time or Raminger either Q How long have you wore a wig Baynham I have always these six years On his cross examination he said That on the 6th of July he had a drowiness on his spirits and was bled it being on a Sunday at his cousin s house two doors from the Three Compasses That he had been at the Three Compasses that morning to pay some money he remember d the day on account he had pledged a thing the Monday before and his father was at the expence of fetching it out That Broadbent did not examine the other people at all but directly pointed to him which he believed was with directions Mr Tew having hold of her under each arm at the time but did not see Mr Tew give her any directions That when Hannet came in he push d him into a box and sat down by him That if he had spoke when Broadbent and Hannet were whispering Hannet would have thought Broadbent had fixed upon him and as it would have been a direction to her was the cause why he did not attempt to hinder it That it was Mr Raminger that said let her sit down and rest herself That there were five or six people in the room Sarah Clifton I went to live servant with the prisoner the Tuesday before Whitsuntide last and staid there something above five months I had given warning to go away but could not get my wages he used me but indifferently towards the latter part of my time for he turned me out of his house at twelve o clock at night two days before my month s warning was up He said the girls had told him I had rob d him I wonder d what there was that I could rob him of he having but very little I desired he would lock me up in any room in his house and not turn me out at that time of night he then repeated my robbing of him and said he had promised the girls I should go out that night I said I had no money then he gave me a shilling and I went up to the Round-house In the morning I went to him again for my wages then he said there was a rape committed and began to accuse me with he knew not what and kept me a prisoner in his own house without a warrant He then took out a warrant and carried me before justice Cox Q What was due to you for wages S Clifton Almost 3 l I had had a shilling at a time two or three times When I came before the justice there was a robbery laid to my charge I was carried to St Martin s Round-house that night The next day he charged me with the robbery and two rapes on Broadbent and Hannet they were both there I said to them I have been as good as a mother to you consider what you are going to do the girls said they had been out with me the same as they swore on the trial afterwards I was then sent to Pridewell At that time I had never seen John Baynham in my life the first time I saw him was in Newgate where Mr Tew came to see me and sent for me down I said Sir I don t know you he said no I suppose not he ask d me to drink a glass and said he came from Wiesenthall I said what will you please to have with me He then said here is a rape committed and as you certainly are concern d you must find the man said I you may be the man for what I know for I never knew a man that did such a thing He said it should be the worse for me if I did not tell who the man was I said if there is never a man found till I find one you will never have the man Then I went up stairs aga in to my apartment and soon after a soldier named Jones a country-man of mine came with a full-pot of beer to see me then came Mr Tew and took him up for the man that ravish d the girls This was all the same day Q How long had you been in Newgate then S Clifton I believe I had been there about nine days I never was out of St Clement s-Lane where I lived on the 6th of July it was Sunday and I was ironing all that day I remember I had a pewter dish and six plates which we had borrowed at the White-Hart in the lane and I carried it home that day and was there when the two girls came with a great nosegay between eight and nine o clock I had been at Mrs Harrison s about three times during the time I lived with the prisoner she and I were old acquaintance in the country and she had been at the prisoner s house and gave the girls some money to be good and mind their business Broadbent once went with me to her house to borrow some china but I never was up stairs or knew where the stair-case was in my life When I went home with the girls that Sunday night from the White-Hart my master was sitting with his right leg across his left at the end of the table he asked Broadbent and Hannet how they came to stay so long they said they had brought him a nosegay and were tired I cut them their supper and they went to bed he had nine apprentices and these were two of them I had one of the apprentices with me named Ann Forbes and my master s daughter when the others called on me coming home Q Had you any quarrel with your master before he suspected himself to be rob d S Clifton Yes a great many One was he was poor and wanting an usurer he sent me out to see for one When I returned there were two or three Germans his countrymen in the kitchen they had been playing with the girls and had dirtied the kitchen I said no such things should be while I was there My master the next morning ask d me whether I was master or he My master had sent me to South-Audley-Street to inquire after one Brailey a woman whose character I found to be very bad and he set me to watch if such a woman came about his house at nights I once saw an old woman and looked out of the window but she was not so tall as her in South-Audley-Street He sent me to Mr Williams at Mr Cox s to desire he would be so good as to come up and examine the girls saying he fear d they were naughty girls he bid me tell him he would not be against making him a present of a pair of ruffles These I took to be all shams for he had hardly any thing to be rob d of I went to Mr Williams and he seemed not to be willing to come I said to him I wished I was out from amongst them he said then why don t you go away I said because he owes me wages he then said why don t you arrest him Q What is a pair of Dresden ruffles worth S Clifton I don t know I sold a pair once for a woman for 14 s Mr Williams and another gentleman did come at that time there was not a charge laid against me for a rape or robbery either Mr Williams examined the girls and the next day it was that I was turned out of the house and carried before justice Cox where the two girls charged me with a rape the same which they did in court there I was call d old b - ch and old b - wd I don t know that any body missed calling me somewhat the justice said I was a bad woman and I was not permitted to speak for myself When I was at the justice s my master was there who said he was a piece of a doctor himself and insisted upon going up to examine the girls and he and a woman went up Mr Williams said when I was going to bridewell it was hard for a woman to go there without money in her pocket and my master gave me four or five shillings Mr Tew was there Then Mr Cox did insist upon my having my wages but he never paid me till I got an order from the court for he never intended to have paid me till after I was hang d I suppose My master once had some friends on board a ship and he and his sister went there to see them The next morning I sent Broadbent to her master s door for a candle she came running back again and said my master hath got a woman in bed with him Then I went in and found it was his sister and her cloaths were lying by Q Did you ever observe any familiarity between your master and any of the girls S Clifton No I did not William Jones I am a soldier I went to see Sarah Clifton in Newgate and when I was there a gentleman came and ask d me if my name was Jones I said it was He then ask d me if I was a lawyer I said yes he said to the man that keeps the taphouse I order you to keep this man I will swear that is the man that was concern d with Mrs Clifton I was detain d there about three hours and a half in the taphouse He returned in about two hours and brought a constable to take me to the Compter Then Clifton s master as they told me and a little girl came the little girl said she never saw me in her life Then I ask d the master if he ever saw me before he said no Then I was let go about my business Q Look at the prisoner is he the man Jones I don t know him again neither do I know what day this was Then the commitments were read in court to see if this was before or after Baynham was committed Baynham s mittimus was on the 21st of October and Clifton s the 14th of the same month Rachel Hannet I was fourteen years of age last Saturday Q Do you know the nature of an oath R Hannet I do I heard my master tell one of our girls named Ann Smee the nature of an oath My mother lives at Putney My master took nine apprentices out of St Martin s Work-house I was one of them He is an embroiderer of such things as we call Dresden-work Master used us well enough for a little while till about four or five weeks after we were bound Sarah Clifton was servant in the house and was very good to us Q Do you remember you was evidence here against Clifton and Baynham R Hannet I do and remember the evidence I gave I was sworn then Q Was that evidence you gave true or false R Hannet It was false Q Then how came you to swear R Hannet Master persuaded me to it Q Where had you been on the 6th of July R Hannet I had been at Putney one of our children was dead and I went thither and brought some flowers home Elizabeth Broadbent was with me we went out about ten o clock with master s leave We came out from Putney about four and got home between eight and nine When we came into our lane we heard Sarah Clifton laughing at something Bett Broadbent said there is Sarah Clifton laughing I suppose she has got somebody with her We went into a house where we found her one of my fellow-apprentices Ann Forbes and master s daughter Sarah Clifton was merry and ask d us if we had got any halfpence We said yes So I and the other girl put down three halfpence and we had some more beer I don t know whether it was a pint or a pot After that Sarah Clifton said it was high time to go home So far was truth but we had no gin Master was at home when we got there sitting with some gentlemen Q Did you see John Baynham that night R Hannet No Neither did we go to the Three Compasses Council Take care what you say for perjury is a dreadful thing it is a guilt that you have drawn upon yourself every body will be angry with you and God will be angry if you don t speak truth R Hannet I will speak truth Master used to behave very badly to us all he used to beat us and use us ill we were very much afraid of him he behaved rudely to us Q How rude R Hannet He used to be impudent and the German gentlemen that came to him used to pull and haul the girls about Q How old are these girls R Hannet Ann Smee is about sixteen years of age Bett Broadbent a little older than me the other s younger Once I remember master gave us leave to play in the yard when there were some of his countrymen came to see him who said something to some of us and Sarah Clifton said we should not stay to be pull d and haul d about by such a pack of fellows Q How came your master to advise you to swear that which was false tell the truth and also what your master did to you R Hannet He lay with me after breakfast the day after Sarah Clifton was gone That morning my master was in his own room a little room backwards up two pair of stairs I was sitting at work in the shop five pair of stairs high and heard him call Rachel I made no answer One of my mistresses said your master calls you He used often to call me down and say things that I did not like about Sarah Clifton and wanted me to swear against her for stealing of things I went down to him that time the door was open and he bid me come in which I did and he shut the door and lock d me in This little room was quite backwards I went through a large room to it I said Sir what are you going to do to me no harm says he and laid me down on the bed and got upon me without saying any more to me and lay with me While he was upon me his daughter came up and knock d at the door and wanted money for butter He went out to her and half way down stairs and gave her some money He had lock d me in I tried to get out and could not He came again and got upon me This was all against my will Q Did he ever lay with you after that R Hannet No he wanted to do so but I never would let him Q Had you ever been lain with before R Hannet No I went up stairs as soon as master had done with me Q How long was you with him R Hannet Pretty near two hours Q Did you cry out R Hannet I did not because I was afraid he wou d do something to me I was greatly afraid of him He used to beat us all He used to take up the girls petticoats and whip their backsides sadly I went up to my work crying with a penny in my hand which he gave me I shew d it to one of my mistresses who ask d me what I cry d for I did not tell her then Presently in came Sarah Clifton and said she came to see whether she was guilty or not saying she would not run away After my mistresses were gone down stairs I told Esther Croasier master had used me ill She ask d me how and I told her all I was not well after it it hurt me very much Soon after as we were going down to dinner I took them all into our bed room and made it known to every one of them there were nine of us They would hardly believe it so as we were going by the door I took two of them in and shew d them the bed where master had serv d me so They all came in I believe one after another After this master proposed to me to swear it against Clifton and another This was on a Friday I remember that afternoon Mr Williams who is Mr Cox s clerk was sent for When I came into the parlour he ask d me who was the man that had lain with me for master had been and told the justice two of the girls had been lain with and that there was also a robbery committed and somebody had lain with me but he could not find the man out He had bid me say so too I was very much afraid of him and dared not do but as he bid me We went the next day to Mr Cox s and he wanted me to swear a robbery against Clifton After this when we were to go about the rape he bid me stick close to it and not say he had lain with me but it was a tall pock-frecken man He did not mention his hair then I ask d him if I must swear He said yes Q Did he tell you where you was to swear you was lain with R Hannet No after we had been examined before justice Cox he talk d to me again he bid me six upon the Three-Compasses in Little Wild-street because he used to borrow all his china at that house when his company came Q Had you ever been there R Hannet No but Broadbent had After we had been at the Three-Compasses he would talk to us both together and he used to set Bet Broadbent to teach me my story He used to teach her the most and she used to sit up a-nights to teach me He told me there would be indictments found against Clifton and Baynham and I should be a witness at the Old-Bailey and the robbery and the rape would together take their lives away He used often to be teaching us what to say Q Do you remember being carried to the Three Compasses R Hannet I do Mr Raminger fetcht Bet Broadbent first He told us he was a lawyer and there was one Mr Tew another lawyer Tew took Bet Broadbent and me first to six upon the house We went in and upstairs because it was given out that we had been lain with up stairs Mrs Harrison came up to us she had the key in her pocket I went into one room and Broadbent into the other At that time we agreed upon the room where there was a bed We had seen the curtains Q Did any body advise you to six upon that room R Hannet Not till we came into it then we fix d upon it ourselves Q Were Raminger or Tew with you while your master was instructing you what to say R Hannet I do not know that they were We went after this to the Three-Compasses Soon after Raminger had been for Broadbent he came for me there was a little man with him Q How came you to fix upon John Baynham R Hannet My shoe was unbuckled and I went into the box to Bet Broadbent and stoop d to buckle it when she pull d me by the sleeve and stoop d down saying you must six upon that tall pock frecken man that was in the box with us I sat a good while before I did I believe he saw her pull my sleeve because he spake about it at justice Cox s and Mr Raminger said it was no such thing Mr Raminger ask d me if the man was in company At first I was afraid to speak and did not for a good while at last I fix d upon Baynham Q How was you sure that was the same man you should fix upon R Hannet Because I saw him go out of the box and go to the fire-side after that we went to justice Cox s but he was a bed So we went the next day when my master bid me stick close to it I believe Raminger had told him what had happen d at the Three Compasses they used to talk German together and my master laughed that night and told his sister I had pitch d upon a pick-house taylor I had a good mind once before the justice to tell the truth when Baynham down d on his knees and said you know I am not the man that lay with you but master look d hard at me and Bet Broadbent pull d me by the sleeve The justice took us up stairs and said he would do all he could to see whether we would own it because the man said he was innocent he ask d us if we were sure he was the man we both said yes I was at one end of the room when he examined her at the other We stood to it After this my master kept us very close he did not let us go out of his house but when he was with us till we came to the Old-Bailey he told me I should go before a heap of gentlemen at the Old Bailey and I must swear there what I had sworn before justice Cox and at Hick s-Hall where I swore that Baynham had committed a rape upon us and Clinton had hold of our legs my master ask d me when I came out what I said and what I swore which was the same as that at the Old-Bailey That morning before we came out he took Broadbent and me into our room where we all lay he first examined her and she came even he then examined me but I did not come even then he huffed us sadly and we were afraid we were going to be kill d he then said for God s sake don t lay any thing to my charge for if you do it will bring me into trouble and as we were walking along he bid me not to hammer stammer but speak the truth for else they would be clear d and we should suffer this was as we were coming out of the Baptist-Head near the Old-Bailey gate just as a man had came and said our trial was coming on Q What did he mean by the truth R Hannet That was what we had said already and when I came here I swore the same I did at Hick s-Hall Q Had you any remorse of conscience while the two prisoners were upon their trial for their lives R Hannet I was sadly affrighted I thought to myself I would say what was the truth Broadbent and I quarrel d sadly I wanted her to own the truth at the Baptist-Head she said her master would kill her if she did I said it was better for her to be kill d than to take two innocent lives away I ll not take their lives away she said you had better do it no body will know any thing of the matter There was a midwife near us she that search d us along with my master at justice Cox s who said what is that you will not take away Bet Broadbent said nothing nothing I had strove to persuade her to speak the truth at home I told three of our apprentices that all we were doing was false and that master persuaded us to do it I also told both of my master s sisters that he had lain with me the same day that he did Q What did they say to it R Hannet They said they could not understand me but they did Q How were you searched at justice Cox s R Hannet We were put upon our backs on a table Cross examination Q Are you now convinced of the true nature of an oath R Hannet I am Q Do you know you have done a very wrong thing hitherto R Hannet I do Council Then if you are guilty of a crime of the same nature again you will be guilty of an additional crime R Hannet I shall so Council Then you need not be affrighted at any question that may be put to you You say all you said on the last trial was false R Hannet It was not false about my going for the flowers and going in at the alehouse in Clement s-Lane and having strong beer but it was false when I said I had some gin and that Mrs Clifton assisted John Baynham to lie with me Q Are you sure your master the prisoner persuaded you to say what you did R Hannet I am Q Do you pretend to say your master ever did any thing impudent to you before he took you into his bedchamber R Hannet He used to whip the girls but he never whipped me Q Was it because he found fault with what they had done R Hannet No he whip d them more than they deserved a great deal Q Had your master a lock to the door where you say he lay with you R Hannet Yes and a key too and there was a lock and key to the large room door that we went through first Q Did not Sarah Clifton rob your master R Hannet No she never did he himself hid the things behind the barrel and then laid them to her and us Q Did she ever talk to you of keeping a cook s shop R Hannet She said she believed he never would pay her her wages and that she would go away and keep a cook s shop and she asked us if we would come and see her Q You say you was along with your master about two hours what did he say to you in that time he was not asleep I suppose R Hannet He spoke but very little I ask d him what he lay with me for He said to get me with child Q Don t you think your mistresses would have come to your assistance if you had cry d out R Hannet I don t know whether they would or not Q Did you see any marks of blood on the bed afterwards R Hannet No but there was on my shift which I shew d to Bet Broadbent and almost all my fellow-apprentices and one of my mistresses and she told the other Q How do you know that R Hannet I was shewing it to Bet Broadbent and one of my mistresses came and ask d me what I was doing I told her and she went and told the other who came and told me I was a fool for shewing it to the little ones Q When did your master first talk to you about the rape R Hannet Not till two or three days after I had been first at justice Cox s then it was given out that somebody had lain with me and he bid me lay it to a pock-frecken d tall man and not upon him Mr Tew took Broadbent and Mr Raminger took me to the Three Compasses first to six upon the room Q Had any body bid you and Broadbent six upon one of the two rooms at the Three Compasses R Hannet Master bid us say we were lain with up stairs in a room Q Did justice Cox desire you by all means to speak the truth R Hannet He did over and over and said if I swore false I should go to the Devil Council for Prosecution Which was you most afraid of your master or the Devil R Hannet I fear d my master most Q to Mrs Harrison There was a piece of evidence came out from this witness unexpectedly do you remember this girl coming to your house with Mr Tew and Mr Raminger before they were brought to find out the man that ravish d them Mrs Harrison The first time Mr Tew and Mr Raminger came by themselves and told me that two girls had sworn a rape to have been committed at our house in a room where was green furniture and that Clifton brought them there I said if you bring the girls they will find themselves mistaken in the house So they did bring the girls a day or two after and went up stairs into the room but my curtains are blue This I believe to be two or three days before they came and fix d upon Baynham I went to justice Cox s when Baynham was taken up The girls there said I was the person that brought the pot of beer up The justice asked if I could recollect where I was then I said I was at a Chrillening that day and I got a certificate of the child s being christen d at that time Elizabeth Broadbent I am fourteen years of age and upwards My master had a child died and Rachel Hannet and I went for some flowers to Putney on the 6th of July we set out before dinner and I believe staid there till between four and five in the evening and it was duskish when we got to Clement s-Lane I saw one of my fellow-apprentice s sleeves at a house in the lane where we had our drink and I heard Sarah Clifton laughing so we went in where we found her my master s daughter and Ann Forbes We said we were very dry and call d for a pint of beer we drank it and went home together This house was not above five or six doors from my master s house but on the other side of the way When we got home my master ask d us what made us be so late We said we staid a little later than ordinary because it rain d I told him we were just come from Putney Q Was there any quarrel betwixt Clifton and your master at that time E Broadbent I can t tell whether it was that week or the week before that they quarrel d my master had been rude I went one morning into the parlour where my master lay there was his sister in the bed by him I told Clifton of it and she gave warning and said she would not stay then my master did not like her and said he would do her an injury some time or another and said he had rather see the Devil than see her Q Did she ever hear him say so E Broadbent I don t know whether she did but I heard it Q How had your master behaved to you before this time E Broadbent He behaved pretty well before then but when Clifton gave warning he persuaded us to it Clifton said she could not bear to be in the house because there was such rudeness done in it Q How soon after you had been at Putney did you hear of Clifton s taking away goods E Broadbent It was about a week after he said that was to turn her away We were to say that she made us steal things Q Was you particularly mention d as one of the persons that was to charge Clifton E Broadbent Master desired me to steal them and lay it on Clifton Q Did you according to what your master desired hide or take away any of these things E Broadbent At first he took and bid some of the things himself behind a barrel in the beer-cellar which was a napkin and Hannet found it We did not see him put it there we only imagined he put it there himself Neither of us had taken a pin s point from him and I believe Clifton never did Q What day of the week was it that she was turn d out of doors E Broadbent I believe it was on a Tuesday She return d the next day for her wages and what things she had left when he accused her of stealing his things and making us steal his things to ruin him and said she should be taken up Q Did he mention any thing of a rape then E Broadbent I don t know that he talk d any thing of a rape then he took her up and she was carried before justice Cox Q When was the first time after she was turn d out of doors that you heard of a rape being committed upon you E Broadbent Master took me down out of the shop and ask d me if ever any body lay with me I told him no Q When was this E Broadbent This was a day or two after Clifton was turn d out of doors Q Did he give you any reason why he suspected any man might have lain with you E Broadbent He ask d me first he said if there has not then you shall lie with me to night I said I never was in any man s company in my life That was to be the rape and he would lay it to Clifton and a man Q Did he mention at that time the man he intended to accuse E Broadbent He said I ll take up Clifton for it and a man named Baynham Q Did you know Baynham at that time E Broadbent No I did not I had never seen him with my eyes or heard of him till master mentioned him Then he said he d call Rachel down after he had done with me and make her do the same he put his hands down my bosom this was in the morning I was sent up stairs and I believe he did call Rachel down she went down I know Q Did any thing more pass that day about his intention to charge Baynham and Clifton E Broadbent He said he would do so and swore to it He ask d me if I knew any house thereabouts I said no except Mr Harrison s then said he that is the house if you know no other he said some more words which I have forgot now Q Did he talk with Hannet that day E Broadbent No not in my hearing Q Did he oblige you to go to bed with him that night E Broadbent No Rachel was lain with first and I remember afterwards she came up crying with a penny in her hand I ask d her what was the matter She said I ll tell you by and bye and told us she was ruin d for ever Presently after my mistress went down and she told us every thing The night after this because I would not lie with him he threaten d that I should go to Newgate for stealing things I kneel d down and cry d and said I hoped he would forgive me for what I had done He sent his sisters and Rachel to bed after supper about nine or ten o clock then took me in his lap and said he would make me go to bed with him and kissed me Then he fetch d a bed down into the two pair of stairs room and said to the girls that lay with me you shall not lie with her any longer for you will make her as wicked as yourselves He made me undress myself and then tied a handkerchief about my mouth I said pray Sir don t for you ll ruin me for ever He said I shall not hurt you I will do you no harm Q Why did not you call out E Broadbent He had lock d the door there were three of them this was in his own chamber After this he took me under my arms push d me into bed and lay with me most part of the night Then he got the other bed out it is a German bed one over another and laid it in the fore room where I lay till mistress came and call d me Q How soon after this was it that he began to talk with you about the rape E Broadbent He talk d to me about it every day and bid me not to forget a word and be sure not to backen it and he told me once that two lawyers Mr Tew and Mr Raminger were gone to seek after this man that they were gone to the Three-Compasses in Little-Wild-Street and if they came for me I was to say the man was in the tap-room and if there was a tall man named Baynham there wearing his own hair and a blue coat I was to take him up Q Did he say John or Henry Baynham E Broadbent No he did not say either he told me very often to say that he was a tall thin man pitted with the small-pox and I must say he had his own hair on when he ravish d me Raminger and Tew return d and said they believ d they had found him Q Was you to go and shew them the house that the rape was supposed to be committed in E Broadbent Yes I did on a Monday He had told me any home that I knew and I said I knew none but the Compasses Then he said six upon that I shewed them the house Hannet was not with me then Q At the time you shew d Raminger and Tew the Compasses did Hannet come there E Broadbent No not the first time I shewed them the house the entry and stairs as I stood at the step of the door Hannet went with me and them the second time when I went into the fore room above stairs and Hannet into the back room Mrs Harrison open d the back room door with a key where we saw the bed We said that was the room that there were green curtains to the bed and window and that the bed was removed Q Had you ever been in that room before then E Broadbent No never in my life After that I was brought by Mr Raminger to that house in order to fix upon somebody I believe this was a night or two after Q What instructions did your master give you or did he give you any in order to fix upon the man E Broadbent That day he had been out I know not where When he came home he call d me into his room and said you are going I believe to the Three-Compasses to take up the man that did the rape Q Did he mention the word rape E Broadbent He said that say with me Said he there is a man in a blue coat a tall man named Baynham pitted with the small-pox you are to take him up Q What time did you go thither in order to fix upon the man E Broadbent It was after we had left work at 9 o clock When Raminger brought me in Tew was sitting or standing by a man I look d round and saw there was never a man there but he that was tail and thin and I took him for the same man that master gave a description of Q What did he say for himself when you had fix d upon him E Broadbent He ask d me if ever I saw him in my life and whether he ever lay with me I said yes he was the man There were a great many people in the tap-house at the time but I had never seen Baynham before in my life When Rachel Hannet came she look d affrighted trembled and stared about I believe Mr Raminger brought her in Mr Tew and Mr Raminger were going to take me out of the tap-room but Baynham and all the company said it was not fair to take the girls out Mr Tew was going to speak to me and stoop d down when they all said let the man have fair play Q Where was you when he was going to speak to you E Broadbent I was just at the tap room door Hannet was desired to look about and see if she knew the man She look d very hard about her and came into the box where I was and then attempted to buckle her shoe I was by her and gave her a pull by the sleeve of her gown pointing with my other hand under the table to the man who sat in the box by the fire side Q Could she see you point E Broadbent I can t tell that It was a great while before she fix d upon Baynham She was frighted and ran backwards and forwards the tears were in her eyes and they asked what was the matter Mr Raminger I believe was by me and Mr Tew and she were by the bar when sh e fix d upon the man Q How long was it after you gave her the pull before she fix d upon the man E Broadbent It was about a quarter of an hour after The people would not let her and I be together saying it was not fair but I kept looking at the man and looking at her She trembled every limb of her and cry d After she fix d upon him he was taken into custody and carried to the watch-house we went before justice Cox the next day where I said he was the man that ravish d me In the morning before we went before the justice my master told me not to seem to be frighted saying if I cried it would shew me guilty Q Guilty of what E Broadbent It would shew that he was not the man and then they will ask you said he and you will confess he is not so I shall be brought into trouble After this he never let a day pass but he bid me keep to the truth and that if I did not stick to it he would murder me Q What did he call the truth E Broadbent That was what I had said before I must stick to Q Did he tell you before you went to Hicks s hall to find the bill what would become of this man E Broadbent He said he believed it would hang him but said he you shall never want I will take care of you After that I went before the grand jury and was sworn where I said the same that I did afterwards in this court that one Baynham was the person who ravish d me and that Sarah Clifton stood at the feet of the bed and held my legs He gave me directions to be sure to stick to it and to say that Clifton put us on to ruin our master He said I have not money to pay her her wages and if she is not hang d for this I ll take care to transport or murder her I remember I was at the Baptist head near the Old-Bailey gate before the trial came on and that going from thence to come to this court he said Mind Betty say nothing but the truth stand to the truth meaning that which we had sworn to before He said the same to Rachel and told me at home he would mention this to me at the Baptist-head he said speak the truth and consider what you are going to do or else you will be hang d looking very down That very morning he called me down stairs and asked me whether I could say what he had taught me and bid me tell it over I tried but could not say it right then said he you will cast yourself and me too Q What did you fail in of your lesson E Broadbent I said the man had a red cap on and I was to have said a white one Q Was what you mention d here at the trial the same as he bid you say E Broadbent It was He said if they ask you whether or no he had a wig on say you saw him pull off no wig but he put on a cap over his hair or wig tho I have now forgot some words he told me Q Was that which you swore here true or false E Broadbent It was all false Q Did not Hannet say her conscience was very uneasy at coming to swear against two innocent persons E Broadbent She did As she was standing on the stone steps belonging to this court the tears being in her eyes she said Bet I am frighted within me for going to swear against these poor innocent persons I said Rachel we can t help it stand to it stand to it or else we shall be hang d this was before we gave our evidence Q Did Hannet at any time tell you her master lay with her E Broadbent She told me and the other girls of it the very day he lay with her Cross Examination Q When Clifton left the house how long was it before you went to justice Cox s E Broadbent It was a day or two after Q Had you heard any thing of charging her with this rape before you went to the justice s E Broadbent My master told me of it I can t tell whether he told Hannet or not Q Did you ask him what a rape was E Broadbent I ask d him what he meant by lying with a man and he said if you don t know you shall lie with me Q Did you ask him to explain the meaning of a rape E Broadbent No I did not but he said that lying with and debauching a person that had never been lain with before was a rape Q How long was it after Hannet had been lain with that he was concern d with you E Broadbent I believe it was the night after Q Who did the justice speak to first Hannet or you E Broadbent I believe it was me he said Are this man and woman innocent or guilty This was the time when Baynham was taken up not the first time I went to the justice in order to charge Clifton with thieving Q How came the rape to be introduced there as it was not the charge you went to make E Broadbent I can t tell I believe my master told that Q Did you ever know your master go to the Three Compasses E Broadbent No Q Had you ever been up stairs there before you went with Mr Tew E Broadbent No never Q Did you know any thing of the situation of the house E Broadbent I went there once with Clifton who said she had a friend lived there she also went thither with me for some china Q Did not you imagine you could punish your master if he used you ill in lying with you E Broadbent I did not think of that then Q What reason could he give for a white cap more than a red one E Broadbent I said it was a red cap which he said was wrong and that if I said so in court they would condemn him and me too Q When Mr Tew and Mr Raminger carried you out of the house to go to the Three Compasses what did they say to you E Broadbent They asked me if I could find out the house and I said yes Q Do you remember any mark being left on your linen by your master s using you ill E Broadbent Yes there were marks I was examined by a midwife and by my master who when we were going up stairs told Mr Cox he was a surgeon and asked leave to go up with us The midwife said if that is not the man that is below speak and tell the truth I said I had She said I had been pressed upon by a man and said the same by Rachel Hannet Q Do you remember there being a mat in the entry at the Three Compasses E Broadbent There was one at the room door We laid there was a mat and that Rachel Hannet being fuddled had like to have fell down by kicking against it but Clifton laid hold of her and held her up Mr Ford After the trial of Baynham and Clifton the court suspecting there was a perjury ordered these two girls to two separate compters the morning after I had directions from many of the magistrates to do the best of my endeavours to find it out to which purpose I sent for the keeper of Wood-street compter and made use of a pious fraud in order to come at the truth I desired the keeper who had Hannet in his custody to acquaint her that Broadbent had discovered the whole truth I went after that to her in the compter She fell on her knees and said she was ready to discover the truth and gave an account which took up about three quarters of an hour having received that from her I came from thence to this court which was sitting my Lord-mayor went into the next room and Broadbent was sent for as soon as she came into the room in order that she might discover the truth I desired Rachel Hannet who was brought there to go up to her and kiss her and tell her she had told my Lord-mayor the whole truth which she did and immediately retired out of the room then Broadbent began and confirmed Hannet in every circumstance She likewise came into court and did the same here There were three other of their fellow-apprentices sent for Ann Smee Ann Forbes and Esther Crosier they also confirm d every thing that they were apply d to for the truth of one was that Hannet told them she had been lain with by her master and of her going to give false evidence and every thing the two girls have now said in court quite agrees with what they said on that examination Q Whether they had any communication with each other so far as for one to know what the other had said Ford To my certain knowledge they had not One was only told that the other had told the truth then the exactly confirmed what the other had said Ann Smee I am sixteen years old I was apprentice to the prisoner I remember as soon as ever my master had lain with Rachel Hannet she came up stairs and told my mistress and whisper d and shew d her a penny She said she could not understand her and when we went down to dinner I bid Elizabeth Warden tell my mistress of it when we went to tea but she said she could not

upon the trial Q What were they to swear E Crosier They told me they were to swear falsly Q to Mr Ford Are these the three girls that were examined the morning after the trial of Baynham and Clifton Ford They are they were sent for unapprised of what they were to come about They did not then give the account so fully but they gave a very good account and never contradicted each other For the prisoner James Tew I was employ d by Mr Raminger to enquire into this matter I don t know that I ever had seen the prisoner then Mr Raminger told me these girls had rob d him of thread and things and he beg d I would be concern d and go to the justice about it He said a woman had been committed upon suspicion of the robbery Q When was this Tew I believe it was about the 15th of October When I came there I heard a good deal about it I can t charge my memory to say they were brought up at that time but some days after there was a discovery that a woman had enticed the girls to these facts and she had committed a rape Upon my going there the girls Broadbent and Hannet were examined one by one Mr Raminger was with me the girls told their story and what a number of things they had been assisting in to rob their master and in throwing them ou t at the window I went then to justice Cox s and told him the affair and he was clear of opinion there were a robbery and rape committed I ask d the girls and they said they knew the house where they were debauched and told how they had been at Putney and call d in at an alehouse in Clement s-Lane and were taken from thence by Clifton I took two persons with me to the Three Compasses and ask d the woman if she knew the girls she said no one of them said to her Madam you know me very well for I have been here for cups and saucers and you brought beer to us up stairs when we were here The girls went up stairs and said there were five girls in the room at the time they look d at the curtains and said they were sure that was the room The man I found had been described before justice Cox We ask d the people if they knew any such person That very man was there Broadbent said upon seeing him that is the man that committed the rape upon me I said that man s circumstance does not appear to be capable of giving you money she had told me that he had given money to her and Mrs Clifton too At last they began to threaten me and I began to think my life was not safe because I had heard a great deal of the people before Court There has been inquiry made and Harrison and his wife bear good characters Tew I never believ d Baynham committed the rape After that the girl and the man sat down then Hannet came and sat herself down by Broadbent I observ d one to stoop and said what are you at then Taylor one that went with us got between them and after a considerable time the girl said that is the man I desir d him before justice Cox to give an account where he was at that time He at last fell down on his knees to the girls and said consider my youth The girls said you are the man Cross examination Q What do you imagine the girl s intention was by stooping down Tew I thought it was to give the other intimation of whom she had pitch d upon Council Then upon the improbability of the story you thought Baynham was an innocent man Tew I told Baynham s friends that I thought him innocent After that they told an account of one Jones a soldier who came there and whistled and that they threw things out of the window Q Whether you still think the man innocent or guilty Tew Upon my word I as much believe him innocent as I myself am innocent Q Look at this soldier William Jones whether you did not charge him with committing the rape Tew No I did not Q to Jones Is this the man that charged you in Newgate with committing a rape and kept you two hours and a half till he brought a warrant Jones This is the man Justice Cox deposed the girls and Baynham were before him that he examin d the girls above two hours that he took them separate from each other and did all in his power to come at the truth and that the rape was attended with such unaccountable circumstances that he could not give into it but upon their positive swearing he did commit Baynham and Clifton and that he granted a warrant against Jones the soldier for a robbery or receiving goods knowing them to have been stolen Mr Williams In the beginning of October last Mrs Clifton came to me and said her master owed her some money and she did not know how to get it I ask d her the sum She said about forty shillings I said the best way for you is to take out an action in the Marshalsea-Court Said she I ll go and do it or they will do something against me After that the prosecutor came and said the girls spoilt his thread and did things wrong and desir d as I bound them all to him I would call in I said the first time I came that way I would I did call and told Broadbent and Hannet that their master complain d of their spoiling his thread and with being guilty of some little pilfering tricks The girls owned they had taken a tablecloth and other things and threw them out at the window to Clifton Then I advised the master to take Clifton up and he applied to Mr Cox for a warrant Q Did they impeach any body else Williams No Q When did you first hear of the rape Williams I first heard of that upon hearing of the felony Q Who did you hear it of first Williams It came from the girls I imagine but I can t be particular Q Did you hear of the rape at the time you was at the prosecutor s house Williams No I did not Q Do you remember a warrant being granted against a soldier upon the information of the girls Williams There was William Frceborn I remember this soldier meaning Jones was stop d in Newgate by Mr Tew I believe it was concerning the children he accused him of committing a rape He charg d me with him and I told him I had no right to keep him a prisoner without a warrant Said he be it at your peril to let him go I went to Mr Newman and ask d him what I had best to do he went with me to the soldier who was in the lodge and ask d him if he was willing to stay of his own accord Said he that I will I will stay for they are mistaken in the man I have a brother very much like myself After that Tew went away and brought a girl She look d at him and said this is not the man I saw no warrant at all Mr Newman About the month of November Mr Tew came to me in the office of Newgate and said there was a person in the lodge against whom he had a warrant for a felony and shew d it to me I look d at it and said I did not think he had any right to detain the man it being a warrant to apprehend him in Middlesex He insisted he should be kept there till he went to my Lord-mayor and got one I said to the soldier tho they charge you with felony you are no prisoner of our s unless you are willing to stay of your own accord I went to ask advice about it and when I came back Tew came with the girl who said she did not know him and he went about his business Q to Mr Tew Did not you go to Mr alderman Dickinson to get the warrant back d Tew I did it was for receiving of goods knowing them to have been stolen Charles Symonds I know Broadbent and Hannet The Tuesday before Clifton was committed in the evening I heard them both say they had rob d their master by throwing the goods out at a window and that Clifton receiv d them And Clifton said to me Mr Symonds you see what little devils they are what chance do I stand amongst them I once heard the master call one of them into the room and desir d her to speak the truth and no more than the truth Cross examination Q What countryman are you Symonds I am a German I used to visit there Q Had you used to go sometimes in the kitchen Symonds Sometimes Frederick Bready I remember there was a charge against Clifton about a robbery by the prisoner and I recommended him to go and tell the affair to justice Cox We went together but Mr Cox was not at home We then went to one of Mrs Clifton s acquaintance for him to come and speak to the girls He came and the girls were examin d The girls own d the robbery and that Clifton had receiv d the things out at the window Q When was this Bready This was the night before Clifton was taken up Cross examination Q What countryman are you Bready I am a German Q Did you use to visit there Bready I did

acquaintance of mine originally when she kept a cook s shop in the Haymarket I went to him about eight o clock in the morning and two or three of the children were examined One whose name was Bolteram said she threw things out at the window I heard the prisoner often bid them be cautions how they swore telling them the danger of forswearing themselves Broadbent said that one watch d while the other threw things out at the window to Clifton Ephemia Wiesentball I am sister to the prisoner and lived with him at the time these things happen d I know there was neither lock nor key to the door where he lay the outward door to the other room had a lock to it but the key was broke I heard him tell these two girls that if they would speak the truth he would forgive them They said they stole the things and threw them out at the window and they asked his pardon Cross Examination Q Did you ever hear these girls complain of your brother s having lain with them E Wiesenthall No never Q Do you remember the circumstance of a bloody shift E Wiesenthall I am ashamed to speak so Q Did nobody tell you about a shift of one of these girls E Wiesenthall Yes Rachel did but nobody else Q What did you

- I have heard Mr Blanchard say that often Q Was you to give medicines to the lame boy or to the family M Tubbs I do not know what they did with them but I know Mrs Blanchard used to sell them and I told Mr Urvoy so for Mr Blanchard used to cure the King s Evil and I have seen her give them out and when I told Mr Urvoy he stopped his hand and would not give them any more She sold them and used to

to see them in the bottles Q Did you ever mention that to Mr Blanchard M Tubbs No Q Nor to his wife M Tubbs No Q Did you ever tell it to Ann Lewis M Tubbs No I was not company for her Q Who did you deliver them to M Tubbs To Mr and Mrs Blanchard and the two sons Q Did you ever deliver any to Anne Lewis M Tubbs No she was in the Kitchen and they were given out of a closet in the hall they were

Blanchard Is this true this evidence has mentioned Mr Blanchard It is false my upon oath as God is my judge as far as I know Q Did Mr Urvoy attend night and morning to see your child dipped four

ordered the handcuffs to be screwed hard that Pank the constable was by at the time that he complained the handcuffs cut him that they were put on in the Pay-office that the handcuffs and rope were both on him together that the rope was taken off in the Pay-office that Mahony heard him complain and said the young man is innocent of the thing if any body was faulty it was herself that he heard her say so to Mr Hanway that he was in custody from Wednesday at eleven o clock till the Saturday at eleven that Mr Way shewed the people his handcuffs upon his hands and the gibbet of two men hanging that he called them ruffles and exposed him to a great number of people that a vast number saw his handcuffs that they put him to extreme torture that Mr Best a Justice of the Peace observed them that they put him in a dirty place not sit for a chimney-sweeper to be put in that one of the Justices observed his hands to be dirty and bloody he thinks it was Mr Fletcher that his handcuffs were plain to be seem by any body that was in the Justice s parlour that he told the Justices he had been handcuffed the first time of coming in that he was three or four times in before the Justices being asked if the people observed his handcuffs he said he supposed the people would not see because they had a mind to favour Mr Hanway that he would suborn them that he complained but once because the Justices snubbed him being asked which Justice he said Mr Fletcher that Mr Fletcher and Mr Wildash both said it was no letter than be deserved that was his being handcuffed that he never returned Mr Hanway

I was walking the deck pretty near twelve o clock I saw Smith there Kennedy was then in the hold Mr Hay was in the cabin Smith asked me what was to be done with the clothes I said he would hear presently He said Why they are mine I said You heard what our lieutenant told you on Saturday He said Here is the receipt I bought the things I said Why did you presume to come down to our house to

was the porter with Williams Along with Smith and Kennedy Q Whose servant did the porter appear to you to be upon your oath Williams I believe on my oath he must be Smith s servant as having the

t17710410-64  315 1st L John Commings was indicted for wilful and corrupt perjury on Dec 1st at the last Admiralty sessions at the Old Bailey in his evidence upon the trial of captain Richard Broad for the murder of Thomas Scott Joseph Gurney I attended at the last Admiralty sessions and took down in short hand the trial of captain Richard Broad The prisoner at the bar was principal witness against the captain who was then tried for the murder of Thomas Scott The prisoner deposed that he was a formast-man on board the King David that captain Broad was then first mate and Scott fourth mate That he saw captain Broad knock Scott down twice with a blunderbuss near the windlass that then he struck the cock in his breast twice that he then punched him three or four times with the butt end into his belly and then turned the mussel of the gun and struck him in the belly that Scott died in less than 24 or 28 hours That he had no assistance but lay where he fell and that Wheeler and Osgood were there and saw him That he really believed the blows were mortal at the time they were given and that every one that was there thought so too That he asked captain Broad to let the surgeon bleed him he said d - n you you bouger if you be not quiet I will serve you in the same manner Upon his cross examination he said it was between four and five in the afternoon that it was broad day-light then being in the month of July That several blows were given him before he came He said that the captain knocked him down twice with the blunderbuss that he got up and was knocked down again He said he first struck him on the head afterwards he said the first blow was in the stomach then he said he was knocked down both ways both times he could not say whether he struck him on the breast or the head with the second blow but was certain he was knocked down with the blunderbuss in the stomach that was the first way the punching with the cock was upon his breast and that he punched him with the muzzle in his belly he said the occasion of it was they had a shower of rain and Scott had gone off the deck to shelter himself out of the rain that Broad beat him upon the deck and used him very ill because he was off the deck He was asked how he could reconcile that he said he could not he had said the man remained twenty-eight hours one time and twenty-four another being asked which he would stand to he said to the forty-eight-hours he was sure he did not live longer than that that he said twenty-four in a short way for brevity sake the truth being forty-eight hours two whole days and nights that all the ship s crew that were left saw him lie upon the deck in that condition but no one could assist him that Broad d - d him in regard to Doughty that he never spoke to the captain about Scott but when he said the captain d - d him he meant about Doughty that he did not say a word to Broad about Scott or to the surgeon s mate or any body that he called for no assistance and no body offered him assistance but one Whallen and Drinkwater what he said about the captain s denying his assistance was in respect to Doughty that Scott was speechless all the while that he never heard him speak from receiving the blow that he could not be always with him but did apprehend he was unable to speak and continued so during all the time and that Osgood was upon the deck at the time the thing happened but he did not remember any body else that was That nobody did interpose because they durst not speak for themselves That the last words he ever heard from Scott was the day before he used he said for God s sake if you live to go home to Bristol remember me to my wife and family then he was bid to remember that two minutes before he swore that the man was speechless from the time he was knocked down till he died His answer was He told me that he was then asked if he had forgot what he said just now that from the last time of his being struck down he never spoke any more his answer was I never heard him speak after the last words he died the day after he said this The blows were the day before that of the conversation he was asked if he did not say he was speechless from that time His answer was Not the time after he spoke to him he never spoke in his hearing but once Then he was asked if he did not swear just now that from the second time he was struck down he never heard him speak one word and believed he was speechless His answer was I might say so he was speechless but the time he saw him and spoke to him he said he was in a very bad condition and died with the blows that he looked at his breast and it was both black and blue and he was swelled both on the right and left side of his breasts he looked at him before he died At the time he spoke to him he opened his breasts that he looked at him once in four or five hours which was as often as he could that he did not look at his blows at any other time till he sewed him up that he opened his cloaths at first when he spoke to him but saw no other blow but upon his breast that Scott told him he thought his death was owing to this blow the words he used was I am a dying man and said Captain Broad was the cause of his death that he did not tell the Surgeon when he saw that blow upon his breast because the prisoner would not allow the Medicines to be of any use he said that at the end of the forty eight hours Scott died and he sewed him up in a bit of canvas and threw him over board five days before they got to Jamaica that when he came to Jamaica he told Admiral Parry of it that he was on board the man of war four days before they failed that he went on board the man of war on the twenty-second and on the twenty-sixth they failed that he told this to Admiral Parry the day he went on board that the Admiral told him he would take care of him in London that when he was sent for he came up here that the Admiral had not time to do any thing at Jamaica as he waited for the Commodore and when he came in was obliged to fail that the Commodore came unexpectedly because they had expected him several days that the admiral could not look into this matter before because he was getting his things on board that he had no more talk with Admiral Parry about this matter that he went to Portsmouth and there the ship was laid up and he was paid off He was then asked whether he did ever say till this hour that he ever told this story to admiral Parry His answer was he repeated it twenty times on board the ship to admiral Parry and his Lady and Daughter He said he did not acquaint Captain Broad of the murder that the admiral challenged him with the story about the murder twenty times in their passage home and that he acquainted the admiral with it when he entered He says that he did not say that after he left the harbour he never said a word about it that he was discharged at Portsmouth in September and got to Bristol the latter end of September and then went to his brother and sister Commings He said he did not know Scott s brother at Jamaica he was not acquainted with him he was on board a man of war and could not go on shore to tell his brother what was become of him He said he did not tell the admiral that this man had a brother at Port royal Scott he said told him many a time he had a brother there but he made no enquiry about it he said from seeing his relations at Bristol he went the next day to Mr Miller s one of the owners that Mr Miller asked him if ever Capt Broad used him ill he said he never lifted up his finger against him in his life Mr Miller asked him whether Captain Broad had used the sellers ill he said he would not let Mr Miller know any thing of it if he had let him into the light of every thing Captain Broad would never have been in London The Captain Broad had been in gentleman at knew himself not guilty he would not he come home in private For he said he stole he river in the night that he did not that he had to say of Captain Broad at that time to Mr Miller because he thought would put him out of the way tho he is never saw any harm of Mr Miller He said he never mentioned any thing to Mr Miller of Captain Broad s using the men ill and then afterwards said that all he had said was false He said he was of opinion that never a one of the twenty-seven men that died on board the ship died a natural death He was asked if the Captain sunk the ship he said as to the Captain sinking the ship he did not know any thing about it that was best known to himself he did not belong to her then for had left him before the ship was lost that a great many slaves were lost all of them through the bad usage of Captain Broad for between him and his mates they lost two hundred and seventy-seven blacks that he had seen him in the morning before ever he got his breakfast and dinner kill eight or nine slaves that he beat them to death that it was nothing for him to kill eight or nine men before breakfast He said he killed them as fast as he could The Council for the crown gave up the cause and Commings was committed to Newgate by the Court for Perjury Richard Osgood I was

they were occasioned by the disorder of the country we all had it Q Had you any conversation with Scott Osgood Yes every day he lay sick upon the deck We had no place to put him in under deck he lay upon the deck where we all laid Q You never heard Scott complain of any ill treatment from Broad Osgood No never Q Was you with him at his death Osgood No Q How long before Scotts death had you any conversation with him Osgood It might be four or five hours Q Whereabouts was it that Scott died where was the ship at that time Osgood Within forty or fifty or sixty leagues before we made Jamaica Q Do you know whether there was any application made by the defendant to Broad to let the Surgeon bleed Scott Osgood I know of none Q Where did the vessel go to afterwards Osgood Jamaica Q When did

in his breast after he was down struck the cock in his breast and punched the muzzle in his belly and he died first he said in less than twenty-four hours afterwards in less than forty-eight hours and that you was there and saw it now the question is is that true or false Osgood False I am certain of it Samuel Harris I was on board the King David at the time Scott died Q The prisoner gave an account on the last trial of Broad s knocking him down with a blunderbuss do you know any thing of such a blow being given by Broad Osgood No Q Do you know what Scott died of Osgood I imagine a fever

venture to say there was never one made use of in the whole voyage in that manner Q You was second mate Osgood Yes I had a peculiar care of the arms and arm chest Q Did you hold any conversation with Scott for two days before he died Osgood I saw him frequently Q Did he ever complain of the ill usage of Broad Osgood No Q Do you remember Commings s coming back to the ship at any time Osgood Yes he came back in the King s long boat Q Was there any relation made then of this murder Osgood I heard none Q And you was on board when he came back Osgood Yes it was the King s long boat he came back in neither he nor any other person complained of this murder Q Can you say whether or not Scott died a natural death with a fever or was killed by any blows from Broad or any other person Osgood I believe he died a natural death and as for a blunderbuss I am certain it was never made use of in such a manner in the ship Q Was any violence made use of to Scott Osgood I never knew or heard of any The Hon Admiral Parry Q Do you remember she defendant s coming on board your ship at Jamaica A I do not because being commanding officer I am seldom on board Q Do you remember seeing him on board A I do not recollect him from the multiplicity of seamen under my command I cannot recollect him Q Do you know of any man s telling you of the murder of Scott at Jamaica by Capt Broad A If such a complaint had been made to me I should have put him into custody there and had him tried by a high court of Admiralty there he never spoke a word to me Q You can be very certain that this man never mentioned it to you A I do not know the man I am certain I never heard it from any man Q He says he repeated it to you coming home A I never heard of it Mr Miller I was a principal owner of the King David I know the prisoner at the bar Q Do you remember his coming to Bristol after having been upon the coast of Calabar Mr Miller On the latter end of September I was in my counting house the prisoner at the bar together with another sailor waited upon me to demand their wages for their service on board the King David at that time the ship was hourly expected it turned out afterwards she waited for a freight I asked if the ship was come in he said No he came home on board the Preston man of war I said Have you deserted the ship I turned to Captain Broad s letter and found that he was put down in that letter as entered on board a man of war I said You are a pretty fellow to leave the ship at such a time after so great a mortality and put us to straits to navigate the ship for we buried I think upon the coast of Calabar and to Jamaica seven or nine and twenty white men of the crew The original crew was about forty and about two hundred and seventy-seven negroes Commings said they left the ship for bad usage that there was no such thing as living with Capt Broad and also from his predecessor Capt Patty I said As to Capt Patty he might be a little severe he was remarkably rough in his disposition but as to Broad I have known him many years and looked upon him to be a different sort of a man however when he comes home he must answer for himself and as to your wages it is impossible to settle with you till I see how you stand on the ship s books They went away in two or three days the prisoner and the other man returned again and brought their landlord They repeated the same demand I gave them much the same answer and said it was impossible for me to settle with them till I knew how they upon the ship s books I was apprehensive they had forfeited their wages for agreeable to that made if a sailor does exceed forty-eight hours after a sorting from the other ships before he eaters on board a man of war he forfeits his wages they said they had not forfeited it they said I would not pay that wages they should I would accept their power of attorney I said I would not put them to the and expence if they would would pay them when the ship returned which they were very thankfull in particular said God bless your honour they took their leaves I called Commings in in order to enquire the occasion of our misfortunes by the mortality in the ship he told me the reason of it was they had been a long voyage about twelve months upon the coast that they had contracted disorders and likewise for want of the doctor that that brought on distempers I said I was very sorry to hear Captain Broad behaved in that manner I looked upon him as a different person Sir says the prisoner if I may speak the truth I never was ill used by captain Broad in my life nor never saw any thing by him but what was humane I asked him if he was not a d - d rascal that the last time he was with me he gave me for the reason of his quitting the ship The ill usage of captain Broad he said Sir what I said was false we must say something to make our story good Prisoner s Defence What I swore in my first examination I told the truth is true and the second time of my examination some of captain Broad s friends made me drunk Here is a gentleman here that arrested Broad for twenty pounds and offered me and another man money not to appear against Broad if I had taken the bribe I should not have brought myself into this hobble The other evidences that were with me are at sea both Howard and Wilson if they had been examined it would have proved the charge I was wade drunk

It was in the afternoon about two or three What day of the week was it - It was on Thursday I believe Endeavour to fix the time as well as you can what day was you robbed - On Friday evening the 29th of July on Monday the 1st of August I took the prisoner this conversation was the Thursday following -

I am sure he was not out from the time he came in till he went out to go to bed JOSEPH RICHARDSON sworn Do you know the prisoner - Yes between one and two he came into the taproom and he staid till about half after four or five and he never was out of the house he fell asleep part of the time I was at his trial and gave the same evidence I was not in company with him in the evening Did you hear what Mrs Handland said of her being robbed -

No Sir it could not be done he could not go so far as the stable door Do you mean to say when she said she was robbed by a friend and not by an enemy she then looked towards Till - Yes I suppose she must she looked towards Till undoubtedly at times Now did not you understand and conceive at the time that she alluded to Till - I suppose she thought it might be Till Did you understand she meant to charge Till - I did Mr Knowlys Did any body else at the time express such opinion - No there were two others sitting with him at the time and I endeavoured as well as I could to prevent their speaking to her for fear she should get warrants I believe the prisoner is an old clothes-woman - She is Court You say she came in between eight and nine - It was full nine if not past Was Till asleep at th e time she said this - He was asleep when she first came in Was he asleep when she said this - He appeared to me to be asleep THOMAS MEREDITH sworn I remember seeing the prisoner at Mrs Wolf s when she came to complain of the robbery Do you remember what day it was - I think it was on Wednesday the 2d of November it was when Trott was there Till was there when I came in and when Mrs Handland came in Was Till near her -

I certainly must but I heard her make no charge against him I came in about six Till was in when I came there and I did not miss him out of the house while I staid which was till a quarter past ten or more Till was there all the time to the best of my knowledge I certainly must have missed the man if he had been absent at any time Mr Keys Did he go out for a few minutes - To the best of my knowledge I swear that he did not Will you swear positively he did not - I cannot be accountable for it particularly Then he might to the best of your knowledge - If he had been in my company I should have missed him I did not see him go out certainly I must have seen him if he had gone out Court You swear to the best of your knowledge which is very different to the swearing to the fact now Sir I wish to know of you whether you can swear positively that he did not go out answer me yes or no - To the best of my knowledge he did not I will swear that he did not go out no further than where I sat on the seat I never went out and believe he did not if he had gone out I must have observed him I left him in the house Mr Knowlys He was awake when Mrs Handland called out a robbery - He was sitting in the corner he might be asleep he was a yard or two from Mrs Handland I remember her very well saying she had been robbed but I do not remember the words she looked round the tap-room when she said so I believe but I did not take particular notice Court If she said she had been robbed by a friend and not by an enemy must you have heard it -

My partner Mr Meridith who works with me at the same shop he was first in the box on the left hand side he then moved and came under the jack and sat there and there he was when the woman came in Court As you was situated could you see Till in the box during the whole time in every box in which he was situated - Yes I was directly opposite I was in company with Meredith and Trott Mr Keys You was in conversation all the time - Yes Then sometimes you looked at Meredith - Yes How long was you looking at Meredith - I cannot say perhaps a quarter of an hour Will you swear you was not more - No I cannot Then during all the time you were looking at Meredith Till might have gone out of the tap-room - I think if he had gone out I must have seen it he was under the jack he was by me all the time Might not he go out and you not have seen him - No Mr Knowles Now you have sworn and you are to speak to the utmost of your knowledge do you think he could have gone out without your observing him - No Sir upon my soul I do not Court Then if that is the case you can swear positively he did not go out -

She said William Till and I was to say I saw him come out and Mrs Grey the prisoner shewed me a bit to look at to see what sort of a gown it was that was hanging out of the bundle and she told me she had lost a yellow gown the bit she shewed me was a striped colour Court What colour was it - I cannot tell directly it was a very pretty pattern Was it a figured pattern - There was no particular pattern that I took notice of it was a new bit of cotton Let me look at the indictment against Till is there any cotton gown in that - There are three linen gowns in it but no cotton gown Cohen She said she had lost several things and she told me if I would go with her she would give me two guineas and if the man was convicted there would be forty pounds twenty pounds for her and twenty pounds for me I told her I would not be guilty of any thing of the kind and she d - nd my eyes and said I robbed her then the followed me down into Holborn and she said you did not rob me I know and she said come your way with me and she wanted me to get drunk she called for a pot of hot and paid fourteen pence of it and she called to a man and said I want a warrant for a man that robbed me I caught him robbing me so when I heard her say that I thought I would see the end of this I would go over with her she went across the way from the Brown Bear and she went into the office and said I want a warrant says the man for what says she a man has robbed me and she made such a blundering story that they would not grant her a warrant so says the man if you will give me half a crown I will go with you Did she say who had robbed her at that time - No I cannot say she did she only said a man asked for half a crown and he would go with her she would not give it him but she told him she was a woman of great spirit and if he did her business she would pay him well he said he wanted nothing but half a crown I have known Mr Till twelve months I have known her sixteen years Did you ever see this man carry a bundle as she wanted you to swear - I did not I told her it was false and I would be hanged before I would do it she told me she had lost a yellow gown at that time and that if I would be good to her I should never want bread Mr Keys My Lord I submit this evidence is not relative to the present charge it is not specified in the indictment was this to be the case any sort of evidence might be produced as it may subject the the prisoner to another indictment that of subornation of perjury I never remember any such evidence admitted the case is whether she swore falsly before the Court when she swore she saw this man with the bundle Court The question here is not whether this woman has sworn false but whether she has sworn corruptly and this is certainly evidence to be received to shew the intention of the party and it is a circumstance to be left to the Jury Mr Keys Pray madam who are you - I am a Jewess That I know where do you live - No 6 Rosemary-lane What do you deal in - Old clothes How many times have you been an evidence in this Court - Never but once about some shoes I bought of a neighbour You was suspected of buying them knowing them to have been stolen -

Yes he was convicted and died for it Now I asked you if you knew any man that was tried and convicted here and you said no - That was about a hat you would not have me say anything that is not right this was for a suit of clothes he was no more my husband than any other man that is here I knew that man s mother she nursed me I have been parted from my husband these seven years I defy the world to say anything against me WILLIAM HANDCOCK sworn Who do you live with -

All that was she told me I think as far as I know I cannot tell what I did nor what I said then she never told me what I was to do before I got down the steps to go in she then told me now says she you must say that you saw this William Till laying asleep in a hay-loft and when he awaked you saw him come down but you would not come down for fear you must say you saw William Till open the door with a knife and in opening the door with a knife he took out a bundle of clothes in a sheet and took them away This time were you sober or in liquor - I was in liquor Are you sure she told you that - I am certain sure of it Did you do anything in consequence of her telling you to say that - I cannot tell what I did I told what she bid me say before the Justice as I was told the next day by other people I did not know the next day Where were you the day the robbery was committed - I was at home at work Did you see anything of what she desired you to say you saw - I did not Did not you say upon your oath that what you said at the Justices was not true - I did not know but as I was told the next day Did not you say here upon the trial of Till that what you said before the Justice was not true -

I do not recollect now Did she at the time you asked pardon of the Court for what you said before the Justice attempt to contradict you - No not at all Mr Keys Did this lady take you before the Grand Jury to find the bill against Till - No I believe you have been tried for something - I have been tried but not for any thing out of the way I was tried for my wages Was not you tried for a fraud - They made a fraud of it I believe you was acquitted through defect of evidence - I do not know how it was but I know very well I did not mean to make it a defraud I meant for the gentleman to have the money if I had thought on it So now you come here to swear that what you have sworn before the Justice was false - Yes You was very drunk you say - Yes How came the Justice to take your evidence - I do not know I do not know now what I said any further than I was told the next morning Do you remember the Justice s clerk was here on the last trial -

Yes I do mean to swear it the officer fell down upon his knee he recovered again and the man struck at him again the man said if I cannot get it out from you I will throw it a-top of you and he took it and poured it over the excise officer and it ran down in this manner and he says to me what are you about cannot you assist me in my duty I went and took the cann off the man s head and saved about one half of the liquor then immediately he told him he had fire arms about him and he caught hold of him and said if he had not the liquor he would use him as he pleased the man made a blow at him the prisoner stood by and missed the blow and the pistol went off at that time Could not the prisoner if he had been determined to shoot at him have hit him - Yes Did Parry make use of abusive language to the prisoner - He did he d - ned his blood and said he knew he was an impostor he told him at first if he had not a permit he would seize it for the King when he found he could do no more he was determined to spill the liquor when the liquor was all running over it was not till then that he produced the pistol and even then Parry aimed a blow at him again he said d - n you if I cannot get it from you I will throw it over you he held it on his head and fell tapping it upon his head Mr Silvester Then he did not throw the cann down - No Then he threw the liquor over his head and the cann -

Richardson and Stephenson What passed at the time you met with Gastineaux - I went to dinner about a quarter I believe it was before two and when I came back Mr Richardson ordered me to take some brandy to Mr Gurney s when I got to Gurney s house I saw two men come after me into the house the prisoner is one and Gastineaux was the other I had not a permit with me I just turned my eye round and I heard somebody touch the cann with a stick and the prisoner asked me what I had I told him what he had no business with he said he insisted on knowing what I had I asked him particularly whether he belonged to the Excise and to shew his deputation and he said his name was in the Excise and was well known there when I insisted on seeing his deputation Gastineaux said he was an officer I was in the house I told him I did not care what he was he insisted on having the liquors and I told him I should go home with the liquors again to my master s for a permit I went up a passage in the house with an intent to go home and Gastineaux ran under my arm and stopped me and brought me back again to the place where I stood first I do not know what words passed particularly but some words passed I told him if he had a mind to seize the liquor on my head he might take it down he wanted me to put it down I told him I would not Gastineaux clapped himself a second time against the door and got hold of my collar and tore my jacket and then he gave a push against me till the cann fell down flat to the floor Did the cann fall down - The cann fell down You are quite sure the cann fell down - I am sure of it Was the liquor spilt - The liquor was spilled in the passage some of it fell in my shoes and some might fall on Gastineaux Jury All of it - No I should think not because it was in a five gallon cann Before this happened had you poured any of the liquor over any person - No I did not I could not say the liquor did not go over him the cann fell down by his pushing between him and me I had some of it over me and he might have some of it I did not pour the liquor wilfully over any person Did you by accident - I could not see the cann it might the cann being full the passage was narrow I was looking at the brandy and Gastineaux stood against the door and at that time I heard somebody behind me cry out mind I turned round and as far as I can tell I saw the pistol within a few inches of my body I never touched the pistol I dropped down on one side and in that instant the pistol went off and wounded my fore finger of my right hand Describe in what manner you dropped down - I turned round in the twinkling of an eye and dropped on my left hand flat to the ground and had this right hand up and the pistol went off and wounded the hand that I held up Is what you have told us all that passed before the pistol went off - It is Did you pour the brandy upon him - I did not Did you knock him to the ground - I did not Did you attempt to strike him - I did not I am sure of it and another thing that the prisoner said that I dammed his blood that is not true I am not a man given to swearing Court You swear positively that you neither struck him nor attempted to strike him - I did not Jury Nor had hold of his clothes nor any thing of that kind - Not to my knowledge How many persons were present - Several Did the pistol hurt any body besides yourself - It hurt one John Turner it lodged in his side I think he is gone to sea It would have hit you if you had not dropt down - Certainly Sir Did Gastineaux say any thing in the presence of that man after he had shot at you - I cannot say any thing to that You did not hear it - No Sir because I was not there after I took him to the tap room I went to my masters Court Are you sure that nobody took the cann from your head - I am sure of that the cann fell quite to the ground Did Gastineaux fall down at all - No Sir Are you sure of that - I am sure of it not before the pistol went off What made him fall down afterwards - I took hold of him and he fell down and begged of me not to kill him or something of that sort Before the pistol went off you made no attempt to strike at Gastineaux - I did not Did you say any thing when the cann fell down - I fancy I did say something to this purpose now you have done a fine job I had my head down looking at the brandy and it was something of those words Court to Prisoner Do you wish I should ask this witness any other questions - Yes Sir one half of the liquor I saved and is in the Excise Office now and if it fell off it is very odd I should Court to Parry What sort of a cann was this - A five gallon copper cann narrow at top and broad at the bottom as they have them at the distillers How high is it -

He was not I could not see in the passage because I was in the bar when I ran to the corner of the passage I saw him holding the pistol in his hand Could you have seen Parry attempting to strike him at the moment he fired the pistol - I certainly could at the moment he fired the pistol there was no attempt to strike him Immediately after this did you hear Gastineaux say any thing as to what he had done - Yes I went up to him and I said you have shot a man says he I did not intend to shoot the man I have wounded I intended to shoot the porter he has often used me ill in the streets sneered and laughed at me and bid me defiance the prisoner was present at the table in the tap room and heard it Court After the cann fell when you went to the corner of the passage and looked round what did you first see - I first saw the excise officer close to the porter and holding something to his side which I did not know was a pistol till I saw it go off PAUL PERRY sworn I was at Mr Gurney s on the 3d of May I came in just as the officer and the porter came in together I happened to hear some words from the officer to the porter I stood by them to listen by the porter I mean Parry the officer asked the porter what he had got there in his cann he said it was not material to him he said he would see and he tasted it with his gauging rule and he put the rule into the cann and said it was brandy well says he I shall seize it very well says Parry if you will go with me to my master s you may see the permit words passed they waited a little time one said I insist on having it and the other refused taking it down and said he should not have it then in a little time the porter attempted to go out at the door and told Gastineaux that he might go with him if he chose and Gastineaux made no reply but slipped by him and put his back to the door Parry desired to have liberty to go out of the door the other refused it there was not a single word passed by any person but themselves I saw them myself I stood in the passage and had a fair sight of them then I saw the pistol taken out and held in his hand then somebody that stood by me said he was going to fire Did any thing pass before you saw the pistol - Only the porter desiring to go out and the other told him he should not Was there nothing happened at all I do not mean words - Nothing at all then the man stooped and spilled some of the liquor the porter saw the pistol and stooped down to save himself then the liquor fell off at that time whether Gastineaux had a hand in it or no I cannot say the door has no glass in it Did the cann fall off his head or was it taken off his head - I could not see that the passage there has no light in it at least the shutter was up I could not see whether it fell or whether Gastineaux put his hand on and took it I heard a noise a kind of a bump it gave a rebound What passed when you saw the pistol produced - Nothing at all but only he fired a pistol as soon as ever he drew it I saw the porter stooping or otherwise he would have had it through the side of his head and he shot his finger there was a constable in the tap room he called out who fired this pistol Did you see Parry strike - There was no striking or any thing of the kind if Parry had struck I must have seen it I mean to say upon my oath he did not strike him nor attempt to strike him Did you see Gastineaux come down on the ground with one knee - I did not I am confident if Parry had attempted to strike him I must see it Did you hear Gastineaux say any thing afterwards in the hearing of this prisoner - Not any thing material in the passage M Gowan was th10e nearest to him he was the only assistant he had What did you hear Gastineaux say in the tap room - He said he fired the pistol he said he did not mean to wound or shoot any one that had been wounded but the porter Court to Parry I think you say that after the dispute about going out when the officer insisted he should not go out that you saw the officer take out a pistol - I did And if I understand you right you say that nothing happened between them except that dispute before he took out the pistol - No there was not Then you describe it as if the liquor had been spilled and the cann fallen or taken off when the porter stooped to avoid the pistol - It appeared so to me Did you see the pistol before the liquor was spilled - I did it appeared to me that the cann was on his head when the pistol was in Gastineaux s hands I saw the pistol before the cann was off his head You say you could not see whether the cann fell off or whether Gastineaux took it off - No I could not because there was no light but the reflection from the area Then there was but little light in the passage - Very little light And it is owing to that I think you said that you could not distinctly say whether the cann fell or whether he took it off - It was there were people stood there and one had a better opportunity one time than another How could you see whether Parry struck Gastineaux or not - Oh it was light enough to see all that the cann was on his head till the pistol was taken out then when it was held in this manner Parry stooped down I could see the cann on his head when he stooped because I was not four feet off it was the moment he stooped that the pistol went off and then the cann must fall and the liquor be spilled in the same moment Was M Gowan between you and him - No Where was he at that time - He was in the tap-room or by the bar which joins to the tap-room for there were nobody in the passage but Gastineaux and Parry I think you said he was near him as the person assisting him - That was when he first began to talk but in the passage there was nobody but Parry and Gastineaux M Gowan was near the bar but I did not see him in the passage Thomas Jones that was shot through the coat and we stood side by side he was shot through the coat and grazed his shirt Recollect yourself whether you are sure that that was at the time the porter stooped to avoid the pistol or at any other struggle - I saw no other struggle and I saw the pistol in his hand before the liquor was spilled You are sure there were no blows struck - No Sir nor nothing tending to it - You saw the whole of the struggle - Yes from the first word speaking I believe to the time the pistol was fired Prisoner Was you there from the time that we came into the house - I was Did you see the liquor spilled - Yes Did you see whether any body took the cann off the porter s head - I cannot say that I cannot say I did see any body attempt it I do not know whether they did or did not THOMAS JONES sworn I was at Gurney s at this time drinking a pint of beer in the tap-room with two or three people and after I had been there a little while I heard some words at the bar I went out to see what was the matter and I saw a porter stand with a can on his head that was Robert Parry two men were enquiring what he had on his head and they desired him to let them see the prisoner was one of the men and the other was the Excise-man he dipped in the rule to see what it was and I believe he said it was brandy there were more words I returned into the tap-room again to my company then I heard the porter say good bye to you or something to that purpose and he went out to the passage and went to go out of the house and went to pull the door open and the Exciseman got between him and the door the porter could not get out and the Exciseman caught hold of his coat and tore his coat and gave him a twink and with that struggle the cann fell down I am very positive the cann fell off his head I am quite sure nobody took it off Had you seen Parry pouring any of that liquor over Gastineaux before he took it off his head - No I did not I must have seen it if it had it fell off his head in that struggle the porter looked to the ground and spoke something I do not know what it was then the pistol went off some person cried out but I did not see the pistol till I heard the report the porter heard the person cry out and he looked at the Exciseman I saw the porter drop down the ball of the pistol went through my coat Did Parry offer to strike Gastineaux before this - No never I must have seen him if any blow had been struck or if he had been brought with his knee to the ground I do take upon myself to say that he did not strike him in the passage nor before the pistol went off nor even attempted to strike him Did you hear Gastineaux say any thing afterwards in the presence of the prisoner - I heard him say in the tap room when they were both taken that he was the person that fired the pistol and what he had done he could justify or stand by or something to that purpose How long might it be after the cann fell to the ground before the pistol went off - Almost directly after I suppose within a minute Did the cann fall down in the porter dropping to avoid the pistol or did it fall off before - It fell off in the struggle before as I said before with that jerk Then it was off his head at the time he dropped down - Yes How near were you - I do not know exactly within two yards Whereabouts was Paul Parry - I cannot say he was somewhere near me Had you light enough in the passage to see - Yes there was light enough to see any thing of the kind it was in the middle of the day about half past two in the afternoon Jury You are positive you saw the cann fall from Parry s head - Yes Court What became of the pistol ball - I do not know it lodged in the side of Mr Gurney s boy it was extracted I saw it afterwards in Gurney s hand it went through my coat Court Where is Tanner - He is gone abroad There was a witness one John Winkett - He is very ill at present Court to Jones Was you present all the time that they were together - Yes except that time I returned to the tap room when the porter said good bye and was going out of the house I came out of the tap room again and continued present till it was over Court to Prisoner Have you any thing to say in your own defence or any witnesses to call Prisoner How near was I to him - You was near the officer at the time of the struggle in the passage Was it the cask of vitriol that I had in my hand or was it the cann that fell Court to Jones Did you see the prisoner have a cask - Yes it was a little cask it was not that falling I am positive it was the cann the prisoner went out and took up the cann from the passage and carried it into the tap room Prisoner Every one that was there was against the excise officer so that I have no witnesses to call Court Have you any body to your charasher - I have sent for them but I do not know whether they are here or not there was one John Bailie The prisoner s witnesses called but none answered The prisoner then delivered in a written defence which was read by the clerk of Arraigns as follows May it please your Lordship your humble petitioner James M Gowan begs the indulgence of this honourable Court to attend to his situation and hopes as it is not in his power to pay a counsel he shall not suffer on that account he offers to your consideration all the particulars sworn to by the witnesses on the trial of James Gastineaux and you will then be informed from their testimony of his particular situation as an assistant to an excise officer should he be found guilty the prosecutor Parry cannot be prosecuted himself for obstructing the excise officer notwithstanding he considers himself prejudged by the verdict against Gastineaux and his committment on that trial and though he has to lament that Mr Fielding and Mr Garrow were prevented from fully cross-examining the witnesses on that trial and only one witness in part corroborates his testimony yet he now solemnly asserts his innocence in this honourable Court he is perfectly happy relying on the verdict of the Jury and had several witnesses to his character he thanks this Court for their indulgence and shall as in duty bound ever pray he begs leave further to add that when he was committed he was decent and clean but has been four months without any assistance but the gaol allowance which has reduced him to the greatest distress GUILTY Court to Prisoner You have been convicted on very clear and satisfactory evidence certainly of a perjury which in its nature must have been wilful and corrupt there is no doubt of it and arising from a desire that this man should have escaped the hands of justice the offence of perjury is one extremely dangerous in its nature and cuts up all the bonds of society by the roots takes away the confidence between man and man upon which the lives liberties and properties of all the subjects in the kingdom must depend and it tends directly to obstruct the course of justice and destroy the due administration of the law it has also this further mischievous tendency that when given in behalf of prisoners on their trial it tends to destroy the sanction of an oath and the confidence that a Jury ought to pay to fair and honest witnesses for all these reasons it is an offence extremely dangerous to society and the public therefore the sentence of the Court is that you be Transported for seven years Prisoner I hope you will take it into consideration the long time I have been in prison Tried by the London Jury before Mr RECORDER

He never did Q Did you ever rob him of any thing of assist in confining him - Never I had nothing to do with the recruiting business at all Mr Knapp You told my learned friend that you had nothing to do with the recruiting business derive no profit from it at all but of course the more recruits you get in the house the more profit as to the profit of the liquor - Certainly Q You was indicted and tried in September last and acquitted - I was Q And now you are a witness to convict him at the bar for perjury - Yes Q Your house was a receptable for recruits - It was Q And a place set apart where these recruits were to be taken - A room appropriated for their use Q My learned friend asked you whether he ever made any complaint of being robbed or beaten in your house you heard he made that complaint at Banbury - I understood he did Mr Knowlys I ask you on the oath you have taken was there a word of truth in that complaint - Not a single word Court Was this man at all stripped naked when they took him up in the ordinary way - I cannot say what they did with him there he was not in my presence Q Was any watch taken from him - Not that ever I heard of Q Clothes - Not that I ever heard of Q Money - Not that I ever heard of Q Handkerchiefs - Not that I ever heard of I never heard of any thing being taken from him till I came to Bow-street three weeks or a month after he left my house Q The surgeon when he comes he always examines to see that they are found in their limbs -

I heard him make no complaint he came in as a volunteer Q How long did he remain in the tap room - Till such time as the surgeon came to examine the men he was brought in about twelve o clock in the forenoon and the surgeon and adjutant always attends at two o clock regularly I did not see him go up stairs immediately because I was in the room he came into the room and pulled off his clothes and was examined by the surgeon Q Was there any violence used to him on that occasion - None at all the clothes he pulled off were regimentals the serjeant took them back again for they were his property they were Sir Thomas Dunlap s cloathing red jacket white waistcoat and breeches but Colonel Robinson in whose corpse he was enlisted was blue cloathing Q Did you see him while he was in that house frequently -

I see him drink frequently at the bar I see him drink gin myself several times Q Is that true that he was confined to live on bread and water - He spent all his five guineas while he was in the house he had every thing that he wished for Q Did he ever make any complaint to you of his having been robbed in that house either of clothes watch money or any thing -

No in different parts of the house Q Then there was not a room set apart for recruits - Not a room particularly set apart they had the liberty of the whole house the dining room was set apart particularly for their use Q Do they go up stairs or do they not when they come in Is there a room set apart merely for the recruits or is the whole house free for them to use - It is Q He came in a volunteer nobody with him - The serjeant came in with him Q He came guarded with a serjeant - He would not have known where to come to if the serjeant had not come with him he came in with the serjeant as all other recruits did to be examined by the surgeon and adjutant Mr Knowlys There was a roommore paticularly set apart for the recruits than for other people -

t17960914-112  569 JOHN ROYCROFT was indicted for wilful and corrupt perjury Mr Knowlys Gentlemen of the Jury you have had to execute your duty hitherto in the course of the present session in cases of felony and though felony is a crime of higher malignity than that which is imputed to the prisoner at the bar namely that of a misdemeanor I believe you will find in at ending to the case now before you that this case will not less deserve your attention than any case of felony that has been before produced for your judgment Gentlemen the crime imputedto the prisoner at the bar is the crime of perjury and when I call to your recollection that it is only upon the sacred sanction of an oath that you have already had to decide upon the lives and liberties of your fellow-citizens you will agree with me that unless the sanction of an oath can be depended upon the bands of society are dissolved at once and it would be impossible for man to depend upon man or that the purposes of society can go on it therefore highly behoves us that if the crime of perjury be brought home to any man upon fair and just evidence that crime should meet with the severest punishment the law can possibly inflict upon the defendant Gentlemen as I know perfectly well that in this observation I have just made every one of you must coincide with me it will become my duty to state to you the nature of the accusation against this man and the circumstances which I am told I shall establish in evidence before you upon which you will have to judge whether he is justly accused or not and whether in discharge of your duty you will turn him over to that punishment which the law inflicts upon those persons who are to the satisfaction of a Jury found guilty of that crime The crime of which the prisoner is accused is said to have been committed at Guildhall before Lord Kenyon The indictment states that an action was brought by a man of the name of Maclaughlin against a captain Benjamin Huntley that it became a material question whether the prisoner had ever said that captain Benjamin Huntley had given him a note of 150l and whether he had promised to make it up a thousand pounds or else that he the prisoner would hang him the said Benjamin Huntley and whether the prisoner now at the bar had not said that he would take that note to the wise of captain Benjamin Huntley and that she would pay that sum of 150l to save her husband from being hanged It states that upon that trial the prisoner at the bar swore to the following effect that he the prisoner never said to any body that captain Huntley had given him a note for 150l and that he would make him make it up 1000l or he would cause captain Huntley to be hanged and that he never said he would take the note to Mrs Huntley and that she would be glad to cash it to save her husband s life and gentlemen after having said that that was so sworn by him the indictment goes on to state that every particle and every tittle the prisoner had sworn on that occasion was directly false to the prejudice of captain Huntley to the total perversion of justice and to the ruin of every person who could be brought in to a Court of Justice Gentlemen having stated the nature of the charge it becomes my duty to state the circumstances of that action upon which the prisoner was called as a witness and to state to you under what circumstances I seek to ask your verdict of guilty against him Gentlemen the prosecutor of this indictment Mr Huntley was captain of the ship Friendship of London and on the 9th of June 1794 was on his voyage to Smyrna he was not only captain of that ship but owner of it and had proved to the satisfaction of many persons that he had insured that ship for a less value than the ship was of he had insured the freight to a less amount than the freight would amount to and in pursuing his voyage towards Smyrna he happened to descry a French fleet every thing that the resolution of an able skilful and an honest man could exert upon that occasion he exerted to escape from the enemy from the course they took they so hemmed him in that he was obliged to strike however they not sending their boats on board him as an enemy to the French and wishing to preserve his ship he altered his course and attempted to escape which but for the villainy of that crew of whom the prisoner was one he would have had a chance so to have done however they refused to co-operate and they were taken While they were in the French prison the crew insisted upon it that he should give them notes to a considerable amount or else they would one and all accuse him of having voluntarily and with a view to the prejudice of the country and to the commerce of the country to which he belonged voluntarily thrown himself into the power of the enemy and occasioned the capture but with the intrepidity and the honesty which belonged to a captain commanding an English vessel he set their threats at defiance and refused to accede to any such terms the prisoner at the bar with three or four more of that crew were exchanged and put on board a cartel ship and sent to England on board that ship unknown to them captain Huntley had been exchanged likewise and arrived in England Gentlemen the first step they took was to ruin the reputation of captain Huntley before they proceeded to any farther extremities the prisoner acting with them made his appearance in the town of Gosport and providentially for captain Huntley for the wicked are short-sighted and a wicked conspiracy against the life of any man will most probably by that good Providence which over hangs us and over fees use be defeated because falsehood does not hang well together he chose to make his vaunt of this and in a public-house called the North Country Sailor in Gosport he made his appearance luckily for the prosecutor of this indictment a Mr Birmingham an inhabitant of that place and a Mr M Ewen were present he stated that he was just come over from France that he hadbeen on board the Friendship commanded by captain Huntley but that captain Huntley like a scoundrel as he was had thrown himself in the way of the enemy and had given himself up a voluntary capture to the enemy which he stated in way that if it were true would have affected captain Huntley s life and captain Huntley would deservedly have suffered on the gallows he stated that he had insured his ship and freight far beyond their value and that therefore with intent to defraud the underwriters he had surrendered his ship that he might afterwards call upon the underwriters and fix them for a much larger amount than the freight Oh say they we have been with the captain in prison and to induce us to hold our tongues upon the subject he has given us every one notes to a considerable amount to prevent our disclosing it and he pulls out of his pocket in a vaunting manner a note for 150l apparently the drawing of captain Huntley in favour of him the prisoner Roycroft and says he captain Huntley not being in the way I shall take it up to Mrs Huntley and I know she will give me cash for it to save her husband s life and unless he makes it up 1000l I will hang him and then I shall retire to Ireland buy a cow and live comfortably These gentlemen were perfectly assured that the story he was telling was a lie and Mr Birmingham with a zeal which captain Huntley and the public must ever thank him for asked him to look at it he took the opportunity to withdraw and make a memorandum of the note upon which he found who was the drawer and in whose favour it was drawn he immediately wrote a letter to Mrs Huntley the captain s wife telling her of the soul conspiracy that was carrying on against her husband s life he thought it was his duty so to do That being the case it rested for that time however finding that the captain would not accede to their request application was made to the underwriters to refuse payment but to the honour of the captain be it spoken every one of those gentlemen whose interest and whose duty to the public calls upon them to dispute any claim of capture not founded in justice paid that for which they had underwritten except one who had not the power of paying it being insolvent-therefore for this time their scheme was defeated but they got into the hands for there are wicked hands enough in this town who will give effect for their own interest to any wicked conspiracy that may be entered into against any honest person of an attorney who said it was true they had failed in this instance but he would put them in a way of giving effect to their conspiracy though to a less amount he persuaded every one of these persons to bring actions against captain Huntley which actions if they had been founded in justice ought to have sent captain Huntley to the gallows The scheme was this that four or five of them for the rest of the crew had been impressed on board different ships of war should bring actions against the captain that they should alledge that he had voluntarily and negligently thrown himself in the way of the enemy by which they had lost their wages their cloaths and the little property belonging to them and had sustained a long imprisonment in the prisons of the French nation and that they should lay their damages at such extent as they in their moderation should think proper to lay them This scheme as you may suppose being proposed to them by a man who had the means of carrying it into execution was instantly acceded to by them in the room of enforcing the demand of the payment of that note by the exhibition of which they must die if it turned out to be a forgery This action was brought not by the prisoner because he could not be a witness in an action brought by himself the first action to be tried was an action brought by a person of the name of Maclaughlin a cook on board this ship and upon that action the prisoner at the bar appeared as a witness captain Huntley knew very well what he had been doing at Gosport the prisoner swore most positively to his throwing himself in the way of the enemy and proved the case of Maclaughlin very clearly as any witness may prove facts that are set down for him to swear but in this country thank God witnesses are submitted to cross-examination which is the true test of truth and upon that cross-examination it was that not suspecting that captain Huntley had heard of this conduct of his this question was put-Has not captain Huntley given you a note for 150l to hold your tongue upon the business - A No says he he has never given me such a note How can you go for this small amount of wages when you have 150l due to you - He denied that captain Huntley had ever given him such a note It occurred them to captain Huntley s Counsel to put the next question to him - Why have you never said that captain Huntley had given you a note for 150l to hold your tongue upon the occasion - No never says he totally unsuspecting that his wicked conduct at Gosport and his attempt to defame the character of captain Huntley was known - Why did you never say to two gentlemen whom they named to him that captain Huntley had given you a note for 150l and unless he made it up 1000l you would hang him - Gentlemen though warned of that circumstance he persisted in saying no it was a fact he could not he ignorant of if it passed - No I never said any such thing - Did you never say you wouldtake the note to Mrs Huntley and she would cash it to save her husband s life - No say he I never said any such thing Those two gentlemen whom I shall call before you as witnesses to-day were confronted with him upon the trial at Guildhall they swore then in positive contradiction to that man upon which the Counsel in support of the claim find it was a soul and wicked conspiracy to defame the character of captain Huntley threw up their brief with indignation Lord Kenyon immediately commanded him to be committed for wilful and corrupt perjury and he was instantly committed to the jail of Newgate Gentlemen if you can suppose it possible that a man could have made such declarations in September 1795 and forgot them in June 1796 you have my free will to acquit him if you think he could not have forgot it the only question for you to try is did he make use of such expressions To this I will produce the evidence of two as respectable men as can be produced upon such an occasion who can have no interest in the subject who cannot have imagined such a thing because Mr Birmingham the moment he heard it thought it so soul a conspiracy against the fortune and life of captain Huntley that it was necessary to acquaint Mrs Huntley with it the other gentleman who was in company will tell you the same If he said so is it possible for him to have forgot it he has upon his oath when he knew the importance of the matter denied that he had said so that constitutes the crime of which he is accused I shall prove that he did make use of these expressions and that when he found he could not support the cause of Maclaughlin a moment if he owned it he solemnly denied that he had said so The conclusion follows of course that he has been guilty of the foul and wicked perjury imputed to him and unless we can keep the channels of evidence pure there is an end of property there is an end of liberty there is an end of life and there is an end of the society in which we live because the sanction and obligation of an oath is the only thing by which society can be kept together If I prove these facts I think you must find him guilty the punishment must be with the Court any punishment short of death certainly cannot be too great for the man who has foully deliberately and with a wicked intent come into a Court of Justice to deliver that upon oath which shall affect the character reputation and ultimately the life of the man against whom he gives that evidence I shall call the witnesses and if you are satisfied that what he has sworn is false you will consign him over to the judgment of the Court and you will feel that not punishment can be too severe for so foul a crime Mr Samuel Wegener captain Huntley s Solicitor Richard Birmingham James M Ewen Michael Malone and captain Huntley were called who proved all the circumstances of the case stated by Mr Knowlys The prisoner put in a written defence which was read by Mr Shelton as follows Mr Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury The unfortunate prisoner at the bar is by trade a mariner and shipped himself on board the Friendship captain Huntley bound for Smyrna on the 1st of June 1794 the prosecutor had insured the above vessel for more than her value with intent to give her to the enemy On the 19th we fell in with the French fleet but had plenty of time to get out of the way had the prosecutor acted properly I being second mate told all hands if they would join me I would carry the ship back to England the prosecuter said the first man that offered to take the ship out of his hands he would hang at the yard arm The hands being all in confusion he said he only wanted to speak that frigate that was the Ambuscade which answered his end in quieting them till we had got into their hands I told him in prison I should acquaint the under-writers with his proceedings for I thought they were villainous when I had made my escape from the French prison I landed at Gosport and proceeded to my attorney s I was suing my prosecutor and afterwards saw the ship s husband who told me to go to the attorney and settle it as it would injure him I told him it must be settled by my attorney - The prosecutor finding I was determined to explain the whole affair found means to obtain two men to swear things I never said thought nor did and for what I stand indicted I am as innocent as the child unborn therefore I hope your Lordship and the Jury will take my case into consideration it is a piece of enmity through my endeavouring to explain the business to those who were defrauded even the French captain told my prosecutor that he had robbed the owners and merchants the prosecutor made answer the vessel was his own the French captain made answer and said the more is the pity that you should be master of a two-oared boat if they were all like you the war would have been over long ago I have pity for your men but none for you Mr Knowlys To Captain Huntley Q Your ship was insured - A Yes Q And have the under-writers all paid you - A Yes except one who was insolvent and he has paid 50l towards it Q I ask you upon your oath as a christian and as a man did you give that ship away or wasit taken by force - A Our force was only six guns of three and four pounders and there were three frigates in chace of us we surrendered to one of forty-eight guns of eighteen and twelve pounders there was no possibility of escape Prisoner Q Did I ever misbehave or disobey orders on board the ship - A No only at the time we were taken when the French began to fire over us the prisoner said lie down lads lie down or you will be all shot and then they flew from the helm and we were obliged to give the ship up GUILTY

he stated that he could not ask a verdict of acquittal at their hands but the best thing he could do would be to apply to the mercy of the Court as he was informed the defendant had been made the dupe of a man named Duggan whom Eagleton had said on her cross-examination she had seen with Dillon He would deliver in a statement written by the defendant himself and leave him to the mercy of the Court - read My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury I beg leave to state that my father has carried on an extensive business in the town of Derby for upwards of forty years as malt-ster miller and grocer and in his service I continued till he unfortunately became a bankrupt by becoming security for a friend and I was consequently obliged to leave Derby in pursuit of a situation I came up to London took lodgings at Mr Corderoy s in the Strand and was there for months until the little money I had was spent and I was in debt upwards of 5 l for my lodgings My landlord became very importunate for his rent and told me I must either pay or leave and detained my clothes for his demand I had now been in London nine months without being able to get a situation having been necessitated to pledge my watch to draw on my existence at one meal per day and was in great distress One morning as I was taking breakfast at a coffee-shop I became acquainted with one Alder and making known my situation to him he offered me a lodging at his house but humble indeed as it was a bed of straw even this was preferable to the treatment of my own lodging and which I thankfully accepted I had been here but a short time before I became a dupe to my landlord and his friends two of which viz Connell and Connor came to his house in Castle-court Strand One day in September he stated that a woman a tenant of Duggans s was accused of a robbery of which she was innocent and that he was afraid she would be found guilty owing to a gentleman Mr William Petlay being abroad in whose company she was at the time the robbery was committed Connel said if Petlay had been in town he could have proved an alibi very clearly and that it would be a very grievous thing for the woman to be convicted innocently In farther conversation they said this Mr William Petlay was a country gentleman and very like myself so much so that on their first seeing me they thought I had been the very person Soon after they invited myself and Alder my landlord to drink with them at their friend s house Mr Roach who keeps the Black Horse public-house in Wild-street We met them several times the conversation always turned on this woman - they said she was innocent and that there would not be the least harm in any one personating the said Mr Petlay which would be the only means of saving her from being transported They all agreed that I wasthe only person to do it as I was so very like Mr Petlay and that they Duggan and Connell were to come forward and substantiate what I had stated but they took care not to appear All the parties were entire strangers to me before the present transaction Being totally unacquainted with the nature of Courts of Law and its being a crime of such magnitude and from what they said believing the woman to be innocent I agreed to personate Mr William Petlay at their solicitations partly as a return for my landlord s kindness in supplying me with food and lodging and from their promising to get me a good situation I beg to state that my name is Francis Robotham and that I have supported an industrious honest character up to the present time I am now very conscious of the crime I have committed for which I have already suffered three months imprisonment in a dreary prison I now throw myself wholly on the mercy of the Court and this being the first time I ever offended against the laws of my country I hope and trust the Court will award a lenient punishment ISAAC PARSEY I live in Sydney s-alley Leicester-square and am a dealer in thread lace I have known the defendant four or five years -

it was a slouched hat Prisoner It is false that I was ever in the middle of the street - or said I would give charge of him Witness I am sure of it Prisoner s Defence All I have to say is that when I was here before I told the truth when I was at the office all the blunder I made was the watchman said it did not matter whether I said where I was going and at the office I said I was going for a pail of water but before you my Lord I told the truth The prisoner then handed in a paper complaining that she was prosecuted by a wicked set who were determined to have her life that they had come forward at the expence of 3000 l to prosecute her and had purchased witnesses against her that it was a conspiracy against her life that she considered herself entitled to the name of Alderson as she lived with Alderson on honourable terms JAMES M NIFF re-examined She was at the Seven Stars public-house two hours -

A He was asked whether he had a parcel to carry to Russell s warehouse - he said he had three to carry out that day the 1st of December 1820 that he received the parcel in question from Mr West Sir J Perring s clerk - that he went to the Swan-with-two-Necks and delivered the two others and then went to Russell s office with the third the one in question and got there not much after seven o clock in the evening - that the first person he saw there was a working man who loads the waggon he desired to be served first - laid down the parcel and came away - and was certain that the parcel he received from West was the same he delivered He was asked on cross examination Do you know a person named Nightingale - A Yes my Lord Q Is he a man with one arm - A Yes Q And very red whiskers - A Yes He could not exactly say how long he had known him not to be intimate with him - he first saw him about three years ago He is then asked Q He did not go to the waggon-office with you - A No Q I mean at the time the parcel was delivered by you at Russell s office was or was not Nightingale there - A No Nightingale was then called forward close to the witness and he was asked Is that Nightingale - A Yes Q Was he or not with you on the 1st of December when you went to the office - A He was not Q I understand you to swear positively that he was not at Russell s waggon-office with you - A He was not He stated that Nightingale was in the habit of occasionally visiting him at Sir John Perring s and taking tea with him He was asked by Sergeant Pell on cross examination Q You did not observe anybody in the office -A No Q If there had been you must have seen them - A Yes He said he observed nobody but the bookkeeper and two persons at the door He had before spoken of these two persons having called about a parcel Cross-examined by MR ALLEY Q Did you take down the re-examinations and all the cross-examinations - A Yes Q Is there nothing in them that will give any explanation - A No nothing that I recollect - WEST I am clerk to Sir John Perring - Messrs Shields & Johns were correspondents of ours they are bankers at Plymouth Dock - their notes are payable at Sir John Perring s On the 1st of December 1820 I made up a parcel of their notes to be transmitted to Plymouth-Dock It is usual on the 1st of every month to return all we have collected in the preceding month I produce a book which will shew what notes I packed up The entry is not my own writing I compared the sums with the entry but not the numbers The notes are paid daily and in the evening they are pinned together and entered in this book I compared the amounts I packed up in this parcel 1316 l and put Sir John Perring s seal on the parcel after tying it in cartridge paper and directed it to Messrs Shields & Johns Plymouth-Dock on the left hand side I made it up in the morning put it in the strong box and I think between half-past four and half-past five delivered it to Painter to be delivered at Russell s warehouse Cross-examined by MR ALLEY Q Are you certain it was between half-past four and half-past five o clock - I cannot say positively it might be something later - it might be near six I delivered him three parcels Q And after that he had to go with letters to the post-office - A It was his duty to deliver letters I believe he took the letters out with the parcels - it depends on his own arrangements whether he would go to the coach or waggon-office first his general custom was to take the letters and parcels together - I counted every note Q How long has the defendant been in the banking-house - A I have been there ten years and I believe he was there before me He was entrusted to receive large sums as receiving clerk and was scrupulously punctual in his accounts I always considered him strictly honest RICHARD TILLETT I am clerk at Sir J Perring s banking house It is my duty to enter the country notes paid at the counter I have examined the book and find entries of different notes of Shields and Co paid in Nov 1820 I deliver the notes I receive to Mr Vile who delivers them to West - we pin them together and enter the numbers in this book and pin them up in parcels I have here an account of all notes of Shields and Co received that month the whole amount is 1316 l and I find by the book that on the 5th of December 110 l 130 l and 50 l of the same notes were presented and repaid Cross-examined by MR ALLEY Q Are the notes given to you or handed over by another clerk - A They are paid by the cashier who puts them in a drawer - I compare them with the counter book to see that they agree and then enter them I find above 1000 l of the same notes were repaid before the 15th of December Cross-examined by MR ADOLPHUS Q Do you know whether all notes issued by Shields and Co are following numbers or whether old notes are re-issued - A I cannot say I only took the numbers not the dates I do not recollect ever seeing two of the same number AMBROSE COCK I am cashier of Sir John Perring s I pay the notes at the counter and have examined the book produced I find by my entry of 5th of December that I paid one lot of notes 110 l another of 130 l the numbers of which notes correspond with those put in the parcel On the 6th of December I paid 160 l more of them and most of the rest come from bankers at the clearing house Cross-examined by MR ADOLPHUS Q You cannot say from memory whether the notes you paid had been in before - A Certainly not only by examining the book I find the same numbers were paid I cannot say whether I have met with two notes of the same number JOHN CHASE I am clerk at Russell and Co s waggon office No 12 Friday-street and have been so nearly six years It is my business to receive parcels and book them On the 1st of December I recollect the defendant coming to the office with a parcel and knew him before He came about eight o clock in the evening - we have no dial in the office but I say it was near eight o clock because we were to have a supper that night at eight o clock He had a person with him whom I afterwards saw at Guildhall - it was Nightingale he had but one arm and very red whiskers I am quite sure he was with him Painter produced a parcel to me and paid 1 l 2 s 8 d insurance on it I locked it up immediately in an iron safe at the top of the warehouse in the counting-house I keep the key - there were four or five other valuable parcels there worth 1400 l or 1500 l together This parcel was insured for 450 l I put it in the waggon on Saturday afternoon about four o clock I had kept the key all the time and took it out of the safe about four o clock and locked it with the other valuable parcels in a strong box in the waggon and saw the goods loaded over it - there was 95 cwt put over it Q At the time Painter brought it did any thing pass between you - A Yes two persons came into the office nearly at the same time as him to enquire about a parcel from Bridport I referred to the weigh-bill and found no such parcel Painter blamed me for not attending to him first and asked if I meant to keep him all night he did not ask for any thing to drink though he generally did on other occasions and he used not to appear in a hurry - the waggon left our office at five o clock on Sunday morning the 3d of December - Willis was the waggoner and Bury the guard it arrives at Plymouth in about ten days there was nothing to be delivered till he got to Blandford where he would arrive on Wednesday the 6th I never heard any complaint of the loss of the other valuable parcels Cross-examined by MR ALLEY The parcel was brought about eight o clock in the evening - A Yes on Friday I did not say at Guildhall that it was about seven o clock it was between half-past seven and eight - I did not say the key hung on a nail that was the key of the strong box of the waggon I did not know either of the two persons who called about the parcel I never saw them afterwards - there were two people at the door named Hodder and Maize and who were examined at Guildhall MR WALFORD Q The key of the strong box would be of no use to any body - No it would take four or five men four or five hours to unload the waggon I did not leave it till it was loaded DANIEL HOLLAND I have been a porter at Russell s warehouse sixteen or seventeen years and I recollect the night Painter was there with the parcel I knew him before - I remember this night because we had a supper given us I am sure Nightingale was with him he has but one arm and very red whiskers I stood at the window at the time they were there and had seen Nightingale before There was a very bright gas-light in the office and outside too - they came about half-past seven o clock WILLIAM MAIZE I was groom to Mr Russell I had lived between two or three years there I knew Paynter and remember his coming to the office that evening on account of the supper being given us he came in with a person whose name I know to be Nightingale he had but one arm and red whiskers THOMAS WILLIS I am waggoner to Messrs Russell and drive from London to Blackwater which is thirty-three miles I drove on the Sunday morning and left at Blackwater on Monday morning about eight o clock - nothing was taken out while it was under my care ROBERT BURY I was guard and travelled with Willis nothing was taken out while I was with it JOHN HOARE I was waggoner to Messrs Russell for ten years I received the waggon at Blackwater and drove it eighteen miles to Wortling - it stops there to be taken by Frampton who comes from Andover nothing was taken from it while under my care I left it between four and five o clock on Monday evening DANIEL FISHER I am a horsekeeper at Worthing in Mr Russell s service and have been so four or five years I received the waggon and watched it till about three o clock in the morning when Frampton drove it away JOHN FRAMPTON I am a waggoner in Mr Russell s service and have been so twenty-three years I received the waggon from Fisher and drove it to Salisbury I got there at eight o clock on Tuesday night - nothing was taken out while I was there OLIVER VILE I am clerk at Sir John Perring s I receive the notes on the evening of the day they are brought in I deliver them to Mr West and did so with Shield s notes in November 1820 I am sure all the notes paid in November were locked up and afterwards delivered to West I never heard of two notes of the same number and amount - I have been twelve years in the house MR WEST re-examined I was present at the trial at Guildhall This was produced in the defendants presence as the parcel delivered at Plymouth looking at it it was shewn to Painter the seal on it is not the genuine seal of Sir John Perring it resembles it - the P S and Co on it but I can say it was not made by Sir John Perring s seal and the direction on the parcel is not my writing and it is not the cover which I put the notes in - I do not know whose writing it is The parcel produced contained nothing but paper JOHN CHASE To the best of my recollection this is the parcel delivered to me by Painter MR WILLIAM MACHINSON I was agent to the plaintiff s attorney when the case was tried This is the parcel produced at Guildhall Mr Alley addressed the Jury on behalf of the defendant JAMES PITT I live in New Broad-street city On the 1st of December 1820 my wife was ill I had been accustomed to leave a person named Nightingale to nurse her and went to Compton-street Clerkenwell after her I knew John Nightingale by having been to that house three or four times before for his mother I consider it to be about six o clock when I got there and my motive for thinking so is I usually take tea at five which would last about half an hour and I think it would take half an hour to go there it is a chandler s shop - Nightingale was in the shop I staid there about an hour and left a little after seven Q From the time you went in till you quitted the house had Nightingale been out - A I did not observe him out and think if he had gone out his wife must have gone into the shop I think it quite impossible that he could have gone to Friday-street MR WALFOOD Q Did you look at any clock or watch - A No I have three children one living in Whitechapel one at Cambridge and one at Sheerness Q At the hulks - A I am not bound to answer that question There is no family connexion between me and Nightingale MARY LILLY I know Mr Pitt and remember his coming to ask me to attend his father I do not recollect the day he came as near as I can guess about six o clock in the afternoon Nightingale my son was at home I had let my apartments the day before and had been robbed and went to consult him whether I should leave the house or continue in it I do not know what month it was but I was robbed the day before which was Thursday I went there about four o clock and staid till the shop was shut up about ten o clock Q Was he out of the house all that time - A Only in the shop and at the door and he went to the public-house to fetch the supper beer MR WALFORD Q Were you secured at Guildhall - A No I know my son is to be tried for something but what I do not know MR ANDREWS Q Your name was Nightingale but you have been married since - A Yes SARAH NIGHTINGALE I am the wife of John Nightingale In December 1820 I lived in Compton-street Clerkenwell and remember Mr Pitt coming for my mother On the 1st of December about six o clock my husband was at home then Pitt staid till about seven o clock or a little after - My husband did not go out that evening except for the supper beer and then he went about his coat MR WALFORD Q You know your husband is indict - ed A Yes I was not at Guildhall JURY Q What reason have you for recollecting the day Pitts called - A On account of my mother being robbed on the day before JOHN NIGHTINGALE I am indicted here for perjury On the 1st of December 1820 I lived in Compton-street my mother came to me on business and Pitt came that day for her to go to nurse his wife - he came about six o clock and staid an hour or an hour and a half I was not out of the house except going to the public-house till bed time MR WALFORD Q How long had you know Pitt - A About three years I had visited him at Sir John Perring s two or three times before the loss of this parcel but not since JOHN HARE re-examined Q How long did the waggon stay at Worthing before Frampton took charge of it - A Four or five hours Wortling is fifty miles off DANIEL FISHER The waggon arrived at five o clock at night and left between two and three o clock in the morning it was under my care at the time I was in the yard all the time GUILTY Transported for Seven Years London Jury before Mr Common Sergeant

she is rather older than Eliza I cannot mention every body who was present my father was there - he is dead my two sisters my brother-in-law O Carney - he is dead and there was Mrs Stapleton a cousin of mine Q Why could you not as well have told us at first that your cousin Stapleton was present -

about twelve months ago or less - I know it to be his writing I have seen him write at his lodgings at Westminster and I think it was in John-street - and at a public-house in Holborn he wrote a note to his attorney - and at Westminster he was copying something from a book and frequently gave it me to read to see if it was correct and when he practiced as a doctor he used to write bills to give to unfortunate women and he used to sign his name to them - I saw that often MR PRENDERGAST Q Look at these two documents are they in the defendant s hand-writing A In my judgment both are written by him - but only one bears his signature I have no doubt of that one CHARLES LANGDALE I am clerk to Mr Dawson of Camden-town attorney for this prosecution I took out a summons for the prosecutrix s solicitor at Mr Justice Holroyd s chambers and was at the hearing of it on the 14th at Guildhall This summons was here read - it was for the defendant to appear to shew cause why he should not be held to bail in a certain action of trover brought against him by Mary Lee The affidavit was here read in which the defendant swore that on or about August 1824 being a lodger with Mary Lee at No 2 Jewin-street he agreed to purchase of her certain articles of furniture which she declared herself compelled to part with and for which he paid her 44l in manner following -

that he continued to pay for his lodging at a reduced rent in consequence of the furniture being his own till the 12th of May last when she informed him her circumstances had become embarrassed and desired him to remove his furniture and to take the charge of hers which he consented to and removed some of her furniture on the 21st and 23d of May to No 26 Upper Rosamond-street Clerkenwell and that on or about the 26th of May she called on him there and took them away and that he had detained none except what he had bought of her MARY LEE I live in Shaftsbury-place Aldersate-street - the prisoner lodged with me when I lived in Jewin-street he came on the 20th of December 1824 and left on the 6th of January he had lodged with me once before - the furniture in his apartment was mine - I never parted with any of it to him he occupied the attic the second time he lodged there and paid 6s a week - he only had one room - the rent was never reduced I never had any conversation with him about selling any part of the goods - nor ever told him I wished to part with them for my subsistence - I never sold him any of the goods at all On the 20th of May 1825 a long time after he had left the lodging I informed him I was in embarrased circumstances and wished him to take an apartment for me to deposit my furniture in being apprehensive of an execution he very readily agreed to take an apartment for me and to superintend the removal - part of them were removed on the 21st and the rest on the 23d he told me he had removed them and they were safe - but never told me properly where they were gone he told me he had moved them into the Borough - but did not say where there - he had told me at first that he had moved them to Somer s-town but did not say where We had received some information that they were in Upper Rosamond-street - he said it was better for my sister and I not to know where they were under the circumstances of distress we were in I went to Rosamond-street on the 25th of May - I was in a coach in the street and could see part of my sofa as it stood across the first floor windows - I saw sufficient of it to know it - it stood on its feet under the window the defendant had given me his address at No 11 or 14 Margaret-street Clerkenwell - my sister went there for me as the coach could not get there and being a cripple I could not walk I saw the prisoner that day at my lodgings which he had taken for me at Somers-town I told him we had been about the goods - he was very angry - and said we had no business to go - that I had placed confidence in him and ought to have waited till he came without making inquiry I told him we went to consult with him but could not find him for he had given a wrong address he said he meant to move to the lodging where he had told us He went to Upper Rosamond-street about the goods - he said he had been there - and if we went to the house again to make inquiry we should be insulted and that he should remove the furniture he called next day and said he had moved them into the Borough where we could not find them as it was better for us not to know where they were for fear of the landlord following them I thought I had put myself in his power and dare not be otherwise than on good terms with him he frequently called and said they were safe - and on the 23d of June I applied to him for the keys of the apartment where they were deposited - he said he would talk to me at home in Jewin-street - told me to make the best of my way home and he would be there as soon as we were I and my sister went and waited about half an hour - he did not come - we went back to Clerkenwell Q When did you see him next time A I saw him pass the house in Upper Rosamond-street where the goods were but did not speak to him - and did not see him again until I went to Guildhall before Mr Alderman Cox to identify him after I had preferred this indictment which was in October He had not called on me and I did not know where he was - he never claimed the goods as his in my presence - but on the 25th of May he made a claim to the people of the house where they were When he went to take a room to move them to I gave him a sovereign to pay a week s rent in advance and while the van was at the door I gave him another On the 25th of May he made me out a bill of 3l 5s and I gave him another sovereign - here is the bill he wrote it in my presence This account was written in pencil and much obliterated - it contained a charge for rooms 8s 6d for men 3s 6d for two vans &c - the total sum was 3l 5s - I gave him a sovereign leaving a balance of 5s I paid him 7s for a lodging he had taken of a woman - but he said that when he took the furniture her husband would not let them in without a reference - that he sent them to Houndsditch for one and in the mean time the people next door took them in - this is charged in the bill He made me a bill on the 23d of June this is it looking at it - he did not deliver it himself - it is in his hand-writing he was to have met me that day in Jewin-street instead of which Mr Rushberry his solicitor sent me a letter and he sent me a letter requesting I would attend to Mr Rushberry s letter I tore that up I never sold him any goods whatever - nor ever received any money from him for any thing except lodging and money I have lent him at times The bill delivered to the witness on the 23d of June was here read - as follows Miss Lee Dr to G B Valois Instructing Miss L -

several of the articles which I have recovered from Margaret-street and which he swears I sold him in August 1825 I had not even bought at that time I bought the bedstead and mattress in April 1825 and many things which I cannot remember - nearly all the furniture in his attic was bought after August - I have the bills of some of them here - I bought the stair-carpet of Mr Barber in Henrietta-street Covent-garden the beginning of October - the bedstead of Mr Richardson of Fore-street and several of the kitchen articles I bought in September 1824 Q From August to February did he pay you any money for goods by weekly instalments or in any shape whatever A Never a shilling - here are the bills - some of the kitchen furniture was bought on the 25th of October 1824 - I have no bill of that The bills produced being referred to agreed with the dates mentioned by the witness Cross-examined by MR BARRY Q These goods I take it for granted have been paid for A They have not unfortunately I have paid for part of them - I have had some of it four years I first saw the defendant the latter end of July 1824 When he took me an apartment at Somers-town he said he was obliged to pass me as his sister or they would not let the lodgings but to single men but that was without my consent I believethe people took me for his sister for a few days I remember his telling me he was about taking a house in Jewin-street Q Do you remember saying any thing about the comfort and advantage there would be in you and him living together there A I do not I know he took a house in Upper Clifton-street Finsbury-square for he referred to me - I answered the reference nothing ever passed between us relative to marriage I never sold him any goods before I preferred this indictment I charged him with stealing these goods - he was tried here and acquitted on account of my placing confidence in him Q Do you mean to swear you saw your sofa in Rosamond-street A I do not - I thought it was mine having been told it was there I positively swear no money has passed between us for these goods for I never sold them Q Look at this paper without opening it - is that signature your hand-writing A It looks like mine - I think it is - I will not swear that it is or is not but I swear I never put my name to any paper given to the defendant but one I know he can imitate my writing I never but once gave him a receipt or any thing of the sort COURT Q You must know whether it is your handwriting or not A It is like mine - well I will say it is for it is very much like it No 1 I never gave him but one receipt MR BARRY Q Here is another No 2 is this your writing A I know they are not both mine - this is more like mine than the other - I can only speak to one and I think this one is my writing I never gave him but one document bearing my name - looking at another paper No 3 I think this is not my writing Q Now open all three of them and say are they your writing A No I swear that only one is and that is No 3 this was when he was in my apartment the first time this signature is mine and it is the only paper I ever gave him with my name to I recollect the document and dare say my sister will I admit putting my name to a document of this sort on the 16th of November 1824 I now say the signature to No 2 is not mine I never gave him a receipt when he left my apartment - nor is the signature to No 1 mine MR PRENDERGAST Q When you speak of your handwriting in the first instance you had not seen the contents A No when I see the documents I know only one can be mine and on seeing them recollect the one I did sign - I never signed the others the one I signed is a receipt for two weeks rent and it is the only two weeks he ever paid me at one time he wrote the body of it and I signed it I believe the body of all three are his writing but he writes two different hands he did not live with us at Somers-town HARRIET LEE I assisted my sister in Jewin-street I attended to the household affairs The defendant came to lodge there the second time on the 20th of December when he was there before he had the second floor at 11s a-week but afterwards the attic at 6s a-week his rent was not reduced - he left in January and called frequently afterwards One afternoon in April 1825 I think my sister asked him to take an apartment to deposit her furniture he said he would - I left the room and heard no more then I remember the goods being removed there was a stair-carpet a bedstead a mattress some kitchen furniture the drawing-room furniture and all that was in the house - there was a sofa and sofa table - some were moved on Saturday morning and the rest on Monday I had bought part of the kitchen furniture myself - it was long after August 1824 - I think it was in December I did not hear the defendant give any account where the furniture was placed - he would not tell nor give us the key he said he had moved it three miles off we went to No 16 Upper Rosamond-street and saw the sofa across the first floor window - we afterwards had the door forced open - it was not there then I went to No 6 Margaret-street and saw some of our furniture in a van which stood at the door I followed it to Fleet-market and recognized the whole of it to be my sister s The prisoner was there managing the removal I saw some of the kitchen furniture which I had bought in December in the van also the stair-carpet and bedstead this was about five weeks after it was moved from Jewin-street I am certain he had not bought it of my sister - he could not without my knowledge because I am in constant attendance on her as she is lame and unable to go about the house - he never claimed any of it in my presence He first took the apartment on the 2d of August 1824 and left on the 16th of November and on the 17th took his luggage away he gave up the key and made no claim to any furniture - The rooms were let afterwards to two or three people - the second floor was let till we left Jewin-street and the same furniture in it as when he was there he never interfered with it Some part of what he says he paid for was not bought by my sister till the end of March or the beginning of April the bedstead was bought on the 9th of April 1825 - here is the bill of it - I saw that bedstead in Margaret-street the kitchen furniture was not bought till December the prisoner never claimed the goods he sent a letter to my sister when we were going to law with him for the furniture - he then made a claim of debt but not of the furniture He professed to teach French but was not engaged at 10s a-day she engaged him for one quarter at a guinea but found him incompetent The Masters Staples learned French - I believe their parents paid the defendant for it I know he got two sovereigns from my sister and said Mr Staples was to pay her I saw her give him a sovereign when he took the first goods away to pay for the van Cross-examined Q You are sure the kitchen furniture was moved with the rest A Yes I knew all the furniture which was in the van The prisoner never had but one receipt for rent that was on the evening of the 16th of November when he left I never heard of his having any other memorandum - he said he owed her two weeks rent and would not pay her unless she sent up a receipt I never took particular notice of my sister s writing The witness was here shewn the three papers and stated she thought that numbered two to be most like her sister s writing but was unable to swear to either of them COURT Q When the defendant lodged in the second floor was he the only lodger A We had lodgers in the first floor and the back parlour Mr Hattersley and Mr Pearce lodged there I never heard a word about my sister s being married to him ELIZABETH SWEITZER I live in Rosamond-street -The defendant took a room there in May last I saw the furniture brought - a sofa was put by the window the prosecutrix and her sister came to inquire about it - the sofa could be seen from the ground I told the prisoner so and he moved it and put up blinds The sofa was taken away by the defendant at eleven o clock at night - The other furniture was afterwards taken away by Miss Lee s order I had told the defendant they had been to demand it - he said it was his and told me to tell them it was gone away I said I should not say so till it was gone and the sooner it went the better I wished him to stay as they said they should come on a certain day and take it by force he would not stay but said then that the property was theirs but he detained it for 41l 15s he called two or three hours after it was gone and said he should hold my husband responsible for it as Miss Lee owed him 41l 15s and he considered it worth that Cross-examined Q Then he did not claim it A He said they owed him 41l 15s not that he had paid that for it MR LANGDALE re-examined I received this letter which has been sworn to be the defendant s writing from a person acting as his attorney with the bill which has been read I saw the defendant at Mr Walter s in Fleet-market the latter end of June or the beginning of July he said the furniture was his - it was there then Letter read MR RUSHBURY - If you think it necessary that I should put in an execution for the furniture although I am in possession of it please leave a note stating the same this evening B G VALOIS MR BARRY addressed the Court on behalf of the defendant The three papers produced to the prosecutrix were then read No 1 was a receipt dated the 28th of December 1824 for 4l 10s for goods sold Mr Valois signed M Lee No 2 a receipt for 10s being rent due the 6th instant dated the 5th of January signed M Lee No 3 was a receipt dated the 16th of November 1824 for rent and acquitting him of all demands signed M Lee JOHN DAVIS I live at No 6 Margaret-street Spafields and am a printer the defendant took a first floor room at my house on the 23d of May at 7s 6d a-week and brought some furniture I saw Miss Lee about a fortnight after - she asked to see the defendant he was out she then claimed the furniture he sold the furniture in my house that day and it was taken away - DAVIS I am the last witness s wife The defendant took the apartment on the 23d of May and on the 25th I believe Miss Lee came and asked for Mr Valois - I said I knew no such person but recollecting myself I thought it might be him I followed and told her - she said she had pronounced his name as it should be in French which was the reason of my mistake I said he had brought some furniture and I was displeased at my husband taking him in as I did not like weekly lodgers she said what did it matter so that I was paid she did not say the furniture was hers she said he was a gentleman and would pay honourably she afterwards called and said he was a swindler - that he had robbed and injured her but never named the furniture I was not present when she claimed it of my husband DEFENDANT When I bought the furniture Miss Lee told me not to tell her sister of it I was to receive part of the rent arising from it while I was in the country and when I returned my rent was reduced to 6s a-week GUILTY Transported for Seven Years

t18311201-279  OLD COURT THURSDAY DECEMBER 8 Second Middlesex Jury before Mr Recorder 279 THOMAS HAGUE was indicted for perjury MESSRS ADOLPHUS and PHILLIPS conducted the prosecution The following Documents were put in and read -Two affidavits made by the defendant sworn on the 25th of July 1829 and the 4th of February 1831 in the cause of Hague against Drury - in the latter of which the defendant had deposed that George Vandepant Drury was indebted to him in the sum of 500l for goods sold and delivered by the deponent to the said George Vandepant Drury and at his request - a writ for 500l returnable on the 15th of April - and a warrant dated the 5th of February 1831 - the copy of a nonsuit - and the declaration which stated that the plaintiff Thomas Hague had become acquainted with various matters and things connected with the defendant George Vandepant Drury which if generally known would be very prejudicial to the defendant and that upon his undertaking not to disclose the same the defendant had undertaken to pay him a reward of 500l in another count it stated the amount to be due for work and labour - there were other counts stating it to be for money lent advanced laid out &c the plaintiff was nonsuited and to pay costs 32l 10s - the bill of particulars of the plaintiff s demand dated the 31st of May 1831 stated it to be for 500l pursuant to an agreement or promise made to or with the defendant in 1829 - another bill of particulars dated the 11th of June 1831 stated it to be the balance of an account as stated and settled with the defendant - DEVERELL I was attorney for the defendant in this action he is the prosecutor to-day - I attended a Judge of the Court of King s Bench upon the delivery of the second particulars of demand - the agent to the plaintiff s attorney also attended I said the general item as to the balance must be struck out unless the account was furnished to which the Judge agreed they delivered no account at any time but a third bill of particulars was delivered with that item struck out On the 15th of June Mr Justice James Parke made a rule to strike out that item GEORGE VANDEPANT DRURY ESQ I am the prosecutor of this indictment and am the grandson of the late Sir George Vandepant I spent the early part of my life in the East Indies till 1806 - I then returned to England and married a lady in Yorkshire I went with her to India and came back in 1813 - I resided at a place called Skelton in Yorkshire up to March 1830 being absent occasionally I first saw the defendant about thirteen years ago I saw him as any other person about my house - he then lived at Rawcliffe a village near me I was arrested at his suit for an alleged debt of 130l in 1829 - that was settled he afterwards commenced a suit for 500l I put in bail to that without being arrested - I never had any business transaction with him and never purchased any thing of him I swear that positively - I remember in 1824 his acting as agent to his mother who kept a little farm near my residence I purchased 5l or 6l worth of straw of her that year and he acted as her agent - I had no other dealings whatever with him I paid for that straw Q I need hardly ask you whether up to this instant you ever owed him for goods sold or delivered or for any thing the sum of 500l A I never did I swear so most positively I am living on my fortune the result of my service in India Cross-examined by MR ALLEY Q Do not you know that the defendant has a farm for which he pays 200l a year rent A He had nothing to do with the farm - it was his mother s she is now dead the defendant is a member of the yeomanry corps of the County which is commanded by Lord Grantham I have heard he was an overseer of the poor - the action for 130l was settled before the declaration was filed I paid the costs Q Was there not a receipt in full demanded of the defendant before the money was paid and did not he refuse to give it A Not before the money was paid I only know that from what I learned from those who were engaged in the business - I instructed my attorney to demand a receipt in full but never got it I had paid him money before the 130l in 1825 and 1826 under circumstances of threats I paid him various sums - I paid him 200l at Aberford in 1825 Q Did you happen to meet him on the 7th of November 1824 at a place not at your house A I did on the road to York in a field - I had a person with me I was walking - I had not been sitting down at all the person with me was the defendant s brother - he is now living I have not brought him here - I did not request the defendant to call at my house the next day my brother-in-law went to him with that request in consequence of the representation I made to him - my brother-in-law is not here I saw the defendant at my house on the afternoon of that day - nobody was present at the interview not even my brother-in-law Q Did you not request the defendant for God s sake not to repeat to any body what he had seen the day before but to keep it secret A I did not on my oath - I positively swear I did not tell him I must make him a friend and if he would keep it secret I would introduce him among gentlemen in the country Q Am I to understand you to swear you did not at that time solicit him to keep a secret for you A He obtained money from me - from the nature of his threats I paid him money I did not solicit him to keep a secret - nothing was said to him about keeping a secret I swear that positively there was a Bible in the room and it might be on the table - there were very likely other books there for the conversation was in my study Q Did you not at that time ask him to swear on the Bible that he would keep the secret A When he had received the money - he had received the money - I do not recollect whether it was before he had received it that I asked him Q Did he swear on the Bible A He might have done so - Yes he did he swore he would not mention any thing which of course would have affected my character Q Any thing he had seen the day before A Any thing he might devise for money he swore he would not make any more demands for money this was in November 1824 - my brother-in-law Mr Thompson was in the neighbourhood at the time the prisoner was there a very short time - I did not ask him to take some wine he might be treated hospitably as any other person by my servants he was not treated with cake and wine - he lived about three-quarters of a mile off I did not put any thing into his pocket - I put the money into his hand - I keep a butler footman and other servants Q Did you happen to leave home at that time for a few months A I was going a journey I went to Scarborough with a niece who was ill - I was there about two months I returned home for a few days - my niece asked me to accompany her to the South and I went on my return home I stopped at the Morris Arms Aberford a few miles from my house - it is the principal inn my lady and niece were with me - I did not send for the prisoner to come there to me I waited for him - I found him there I had not sent him word that I was coming home - I was not in correspondence with him Q Did he not come there in consequence of an invitation - no matter how it was conveyed A Yes - I saw him in the principal sitting-room my niece was walking in the garden my wife was present Q Did you not there in the presence of your wife request him to take an oath that he would still keep the secret A I made no request - he did take an oath the Bible might be in one corner of the room or probably it was on the table I did not promise to give him 250l and promise a further payment of 500l to him - I did not prosecute him for extorting the money in 1824 I had a little boy named Cooper in my service he is the son of a poor woman in the neighbourhood he lived with me about seven years and left to better his situation my wife is here On my oath I did not request the prisoner that if he should arrest me for 500l to say that it was for goods sold and delivered I did not see him and never said a word on the subject to him nor has any body by my authority - I have not seen him to speak to him for three years and a half MR PHILLIPS Q In what state of health is your brother-in-law Mr Thompson at this instant A In a most wretched state of health - he generally has very bad health I do not think he could attend here without considerable risk to himself in a case like this this is the receipt for the 130l - read King s Bench Hague against Drury - Received on the 9th of November 1829 of the above-named defendant by payment of Mr Russel 140l in discharge of the debt in this action brought to recover the balance of a promissory note drawn by the defendant for 250l Q Now on your oath had you ever given that man any promissory note whatever A No - before the receiptwas given a demand was made on the defendant to give up the promissory note if he had one I never received one Q You have been asked if you implored the defendant never to mention what he had seen - had you done anything that you was afraid of being seen or told of A Certainly not he had no secret to keep if he told the truth I gave him the money because I dreaded even the name of what he threatened which was to charge me with an unnatural crime with his Hague s own brother there is not the shadow of a foundation for such a charge I did not prosecute him as I acted entirely from beginning to end under the advice of a solicitor in the country looking at two letters these were received by Mrs Drury I know sufficient of the defendant s hand-writing to swear they are his - these other two are also his - read York 2nd of June 1829 To MR DRURY - The time has now elapsed which will render all further correspondence in private between you and me unnecessary you will find by the enclosed its meaning - I have been this morning to Mr Preston to prevent all unpleasant consequences but he has given me a determined refusal I have asked at your hands only a favor which I care not if all your family were witness to - I have no clandestine secret in view but what I care not if all the world knew I am sorry it comes to pass under your present family affliction but I must take care of myself - I shall expect a personal interview to-morrow coming to your house under present circumstances I do not wish unless compelled to do so THOMAS HAGUE Q What family affliction were you enduring at that time A My niece whom we had taken to the South had died we had numerous afflictions and some deaths in the family - the following letter was here read 2nd of February 1830 To MRS DRURY - Honored Madam - It is with the utmost reluctance I again address you particularly when I think of the handsome manner your generous conduct has been to me I have this moment received a letter from a corn-factor at Leeds remitting me 30l instead of 50l and our rent day being next Thursday I have no means of raising the amount without assistance it will greatly oblige me if Mrs Drury will add another obligation to those already conferred by the sum of 12l on or before Saturday at the post-office York till called for to see you is impossible for I cannot ask for it personally after what has transpired MR DRURY Mrs Drury has been subpoenaed here to day on the part of the defendant and is in attendance with the exception of 5l or 6l which I paid the prisoner for his mother s straw I never paid him any other money except under threats he obtained 120l at my house and gave a promissory note for the re-payment - I came here last Session prepared to prosecute this indictment the defendant from first to last has had some thousands from me under threats MR ALLEY Q Where is the 120l note of hand which he gave A It is mislaid it was given three years and a half or four years ago the letter written to my wife was not in answer to one written by her to him by my desire -

read To HENRY THOMPSON ESQ - Sir - I have this moment received a note from Mr Anderson requesting me to send him the letters I have in my possession from Mr and Mrs Drury to be at his office this evening at six o clock I think you know so much of this business it is possible to satisfy both parties without it coming into Court - if you will honour me with an interview before six o clock this afternoon I can give plenty of written demonstration to satisfy both parties an answer by your servant will oblige THOMAS HAGUE MR DEVERELL This letter was communicated to me by Mr Thompson about the middle of the day on Sunday I desired him to take no notice of it whatever and I believe none was taken - I went to York fully prepared to try the cause and delivered briefs to counsel upon going into Court in the morning it was to be tried the record was drawn by the plaintiff - here is a note written by the defendant the day after the record was drawn read Tuesday morning ten o clock 19th of July 1831 Thomas Hague begs leave to inform Henry Thompson Esq that a regular Bench-warrant has this morning been obtained against G V Drury I give Henry Thompson Esq the information to use his discretion accordingly MR DEVERELL I have searched and can hear nothing of a Bench-warrant or an indictment being preferred against Mr Drury -

the defendant had no appearance of being worth money he had two brothers and two sisters and what the mother left was between them - she had nothing but the farm and a little property left by Mr Ratey Cross-examined by MR BARRY Q Do you recollect one night in November 1824 the defendant calling when Mr Thompson was there A He frequently called in an abusive manner I and the other servants were about- I do not recollect Mr Thompson ever going and fetching him back I have occasionally carried letters to the defendant to the gate - when he has come with letters or messages I have brought him out the answer Q Did you not meet him when you were in a gig and tell him Mrs Drury wanted to see him A No I met him once he had borrowed some money of master and I went to ask when he was going to pay it RICHARD LAWRENCE I am in Mr Drury s service and have been so about thirteen years I have known the prisoner about that time -

t18320906-327  Second London Jury before Mr Recorder 2057 ANN NICKLESS was indicted for wilful and corrupt perjury MESSRS ADOLPHUS and PHILLIPS conducted the prosecution GEORGE TODD I am a clerk in the registery of the Consistory Court Doctors -commons I produce some minutes which were taken from the registery - Dr Daubeny and Dr Matcham were surrogates of the Court at that time and are so still I produce a citation in the cause of Ellen Kenrick against Thomas Kenrick in a suit of divorce and separation by reason of cruelty and adultery - with the allegations on behalf of Thomas Kenrick - the deposition of Ann Nickless on behalf of the defendant on the eighth article - the interrogatories to the witness examined on the eighth article - and the deposition of Nickless to the twelfth article Cross-examined by MR BODKIN Q Have you a book in which you enter proceedings in causes A Yes it is here the citation is the first proceeding - all the documents produced are originals I have the depositions of five witnesses in support of the suit they are Thomas and Sarah Burge James Ashley Charles Sinclair Bedford and John Wright - I have depositions on the other side of William Kenrick Ann Nickless Caroline Paris Stephen Moray Jane Mintle Elizabeth Sullivan Elizabeth White Elizabeth Mizen and Martha Moore MR WILLIAM PRITCHARD I am one of the examiners of the Court and took the depositions of the defendant they are attested by me - here is a deposition taken on the 3rd of June it was signed by the defendant after being read over by me - she was not sworn by me she has signed it as having been sworn - it was read over to her as having been sworn and she signed it afterwards she had been sworn to speak the truth - I then examined her and took the examination myself the examination appears to have been resumed on the 17th as a cross-examination on the part of the promoter of the suit Dr Matcham s name is signed at the end of the two examinations when she was repeated on the completion of the examination she deelared that the signature was hers and that the contents of the examinations were true by virtue of her oath and I have attested that repetition - that acknowledgement extended to the examination of the 3rd as well as the 17th of June I believe the defendant to be the person Cross-examined by MR BODKIN Q The party first goes before the surrogate and is sworn then to you to be examined and after that goes again to a surrogate and affirm the truth of the subsequent examination A Just so I could not of my own knowledge know she was sworn the proctor is responsible for that and the registrar certifies that she is sworn it is Mr Shephard s duty to attend the swearing of the witnesses or somebody for him and the proctors on both sides but not myself The defendant s deposition of the 3rd of June was here read in which she had deposed that she was housekeeper to Joseph Elder Esq livery-stable keeper of Foley-place from his wife s death to Christmas last - that Mr and Mrs Kenrick were in the habit of coming there Mrs Kenrick was afterwards in the habit of coming without Mr Kenrick to see Mr Elder- she at first came two or three times with Miss Paris and Mr Elder went out walking with them - that one Saturday after Christmas she came alone Mr Elder was standing in the stable-yard as if looking for somebody and on seeing Mrs Kenrick told her to run up staris to the nursery as fast as she could - she did so they were alone with each other and dined together Mrs Kenrick had called alone and dined with Mr Elder once before in the early part of the same week she came about two o clock just as dinner was ready and remained till nine at night - she told deponent she and Mr Kenrick were parted and he had turned her out of doors on the Saturday she remained till about one in the morning - nobody went into the room to her and Mr Elder on that occasion but deponent who went in when they wanted any thing they dined in the nursery - it is up stairs and not so public as the parlour Mr Elder s bed-room joins the nursery - he and Mrs Kenrick went into the bed-room twice to her knowledge on that day the first time was as soon as dinner was over deponent being in the parlour distinctly heard them both walking from the nursery into the bed-room and suspecting what was going forward having observed familiarities before deponent listened thebed-room is over the parlour and any person in the parlour could hear almost every thing passing in the bed-room - I plainly heard the noise of two persons getting in the bed and presently after that sort of breathing which left no doubt on my mind that that two persons were in the act of sexual intercourse with each other about half an hour after Mr Elder came down and sent me up for the glasses - I went into the bed-room Mrs Kenrick was there and the bed was tumbled and had the appearance of two persons having been on it - the blinds of the bed-room were down which was a very unusual thing Mrs Kenrick s face was very much flushed and at that time I was half a mind to tell her what I thought but I went down without saying any thing after tea the same evening I went up stairs for something and as I passed the nursery door I saw it ajar - I looked into the room and not seeing Mr Elder or Mrs Kenrick there I went very softly to the door leading from thence into the bed-room and peeped through the keyhole the bed was just opposite the door and I could see it very plainly and almost every thing else in the room - I saw Mr Elder and Mrs Kenrick laying on the bed together her petticoats were up and Mr Elder s small-clothes were down - they were in the very act of sexual intercourse with each other I do not remember Mrs Kenrick coming to Mr Elder s house and remaining alone with him any time after the Saturday of which I have been just deposing but she did so occasionally before that time he went out with her on the Saturday but did not return till after I went to bed I went to bed at twelve o clock and do not know at what time he returned - he went out with her often of an evening before that and returned alone he did so particularly on the Tuesday on which she dined with him - on those occasions they dined in the parlour the parlour door was closed at such times and they remained alone together an hour or two or sometimes not more than half an hour deponent often saw improper familiarites between them in the parlour but nothing criminal - any body might see their familiarities together even a stranger who had never seen them before for it was never concealed she could scarcely describe her behaviour but her way and manner to Mr Elder appeared very light and familiar they used to sit on the sofa together - deponent had sometimes seen them with their arms round each other s neck - at other times kissing each other at other times she was laying on the sofa and he was putting her clothes down or laying with her but there was nothing to induce deponent to say they had sexual intercourse with each other till the Saturday in question that one morning a few days before the Saturday Mr Elder had taken some of his late wife s clothes out of her drawers - Mrs Kenrick was waiting below Mr Elder said Poor thing I must let her have something to change herself with for she has nothing but what she stands upright in - that Mrs Kenrick took the clothes in a bundle with her that when Mrs Kenrick told her she had parted from her husband she told deponent if any body came to inquire for her not to say she was there or had been there for if Mr Kenrick knew it it would be the ruin of Mr Elder that Mr Kenrick would not mind giving deponent 20l if she let him know she was in the house - Mrs Kenrick used to wring her hands and beg her not to let Mr Kenrick know she had been there and said she loved Mr Elder s little finger better than Mr Kenrick s whole body she spoke in that way at different times - that on one occasion Mr Elder had in Mrs Kenrick s presence desired her if any body inquired about Mrs Kenrick to deny her and Mrs Kenrick added For God s sake be sure you say nothing deponent never disclosed these circumstances to Mr Kenrick till about six months ago when he called with his lawyer The deponent in answer to the interrogatories on the above depositions deposed among other matters that Mr Kenrick had promised to satisfy her for her expences in attending as a witness and had given her half a sovereign when she last attended as she was ill and had to pay coach hire that she had no expectation of receiving money for giving evidence that the nursery joins the bedroom and communicates with it by a door Mr Elder dined at five o clock on the Saturday - the nursery door was shut the first time but ajar the second when she went to it Mrs Kenrick was dressed in a black silk dress a velvet bonnet and veil there was no light in the bed-room that she remembered yet there might must have been - they had candles in the nursery and might have taken them into the bed-room but she did not remember noticing them there Mr Elder s bed stood in the middle of the room between the door and the window - it was in its usual place and could not stand otherwise there is but one window to the bed-room - I will take upon myself to swear the largest part of the bed could be seen through the key-hole of the door particularly the foot of it and it was across the foot of the bed that I saw Mrs Kenrick and Mr Elder laying at the time deposed the key was usually kept in the lock of the bed-room door but was turned round so that a person might look through the key-hole - I always kept it turned round to prevent its falling out ELLEN KENRICK My husband s name is Thomas Kenrick - I was a widow when I married him there were some differences between us and we agreed to live apart when I first left him I went to Brighton - that was in November 1829 I lodged there with Mr and Mrs May house-agents - I remained there till March 1830 I came to town by the mail on Wednesday the 30th of December remained in town on the 31st and went back on Friday the 1st of January 1830 I know Mr Elder - Mr Kenrick introduced him to me I had no acquaintance with him previous to our marriage which was on the 9th of May 1829 I did not see Mr Elder at all during the three days I was in town - I once met him at Brighton when I was out with Mr and Mrs May I never went out alone all the time I was at Brighton - when I came to town in December it was to fetch my son I did not come by a packet - I got into the mail on the 30th about half-past ten o clock at night got to town on the 31st in the morning and left about half-past two o clock on the 1st of January while I was in town I was at the Blossoms Inn City where the mail put up - I did not go out while I was in town when I arrived I sent to Mr Bedford my trustee and he wrote to Mr Kenrick to send my son and I took him out of town with me - he is my son by my first marriage Mr Kenrick brought him to me on the 31st about six o clock in the evening Q I need not ask you then whether you were dining at five o clock and staying till late at another part of the town A Certainly not - I never went out the whole time I was three Mr Kenrick stopped with me I suppose about three quarters of an hour - I took my son out of town next morning I certainly dined with Mr Elder one day before I went down to Brighton I cannot say whether it was on a Saturday we dined in a room up stairs - it was in November Q What was the occasion of your going to Mr Elder A I was afraid to go to my own family for they did not like my marriage I knew Mr Elder was a friend of Mr Kenrick s and I thought it best to go to him to ask Mr Kenrick to let me have my clothes and some money - he said he would think of it if I called again I did not dine there that day - I was there about ten minutes and saw him in the parlour it was in the morning I called againin a day or two as he desired - I think it was in the afternoon and believe I then dined with him we dined in a room up stairs I think it is called the nursery - the defendant waited on us nothing improper passed between us - we dined by candle-light - the room communicates with the bed-room I did not go into the bed-room at all that day - I have been there with my husband when Mr Elder has had a party and then went into the bed-room to take off my things with other ladies Q Is it true then that you and Mr Elder went into the bed-room that day laid on the bed together and that any thing improper took place A Certainly not I never went into the bed-room with Mr Elder - I took off my things in the room I dined in nothing improper took place between us I was too much flurried - the defendant did not come into the bed-room and find me there having got of the bed with Mr Elder I never was in the bed-room when she came there - I never was in the bed-room with Mr Elder I did not return to town after the 1st of January till Mr Kenrick fetched me home himself which was I think in March 1830 - I lived ten weeks with him and then we separated again Cross-examined by MR BODKIN Q What is your present age A Thirty I had been a window five months when I married Mr Kenrick I had known him in my first husband s life time I lived in the country with my first husband Q How then did you know him A Mr Yates my first husband hired a pheton of him and after my hushand s death I met him at Brighton where I kept a house my first husband died in Warwickshire - I went to Brighton a month or six weeks after his death Mr Kenrick was a widower - I do not know his age I suppose he is near sixty my first husband was twenty-nine when he died - I had been married to him four or five years my son is eight years old next February I was married to Mr Yates in 1824 in August I think - my son was born after my marriage to Mr Yates I cannot exactly say how long - it was not in the same year as we were married he was born in February - I have not other child we were married on the 12th of August my son was at school at Hampstead - I think he had been there half a year he was not at Brighton till I took him in December it was the vacation and I came up to fetch him - Mr Kenrick had got him down at the farm while I was in town I had all my meals at the inn Mr Elder was always Mr Kenrick s friend - I went to him in November to intercede with Mr Kenrick for my clothes and money he told me always to go back to Mr Kenrick Q Were you not aware when you called at Mr Elder s to intercede with your husband that it was his jealousy of Mr Elder that caused your separation A He was always jealous of Mr Elder but I never knew why for I have asked him why he did not shut the door against Mr Elder but he was always shaking hands with him and inviting him to dinner - we never had any company but Mr Elder I had a Miss Paris of Coventry a friend as I believed her at the time Q Had your husband before any person complained of your conduct towards Mr Elder A Never till the night I left Mr Kenrick - I then told him I should leave him he then scolded me before Miss Paris - he said There madam is my door leave my house he always used to say so that was before I called on Mr Elder - one day he began with me and I said Mr Elder it is through you Mr Kenrick is jealous of me and Mr Elder said he was very sorry he was the cause of any piece of work I never went out alone at Brighton - my trustee had put me under the care of Mrs May and told me never to go out alone I had no idea of calling on Mr Elder when I came to town from Brighton and did not call it was before I went to Brighton and why I called then was because I did not know a soul who knew Kenrick but Elder my family were shocked at my marriage and would not go to him I did not see any barm in calling to get him to interfare - I think I called two or three times on Mr Elder with Miss Paris and he took us once to see the King s horses Mr Kenrick never took me any where I never called on Elder alone except about my clothes he often called to see Mr Kenrick - I never knew when my husband was to be at Tattersall s sales he never told me any thing about business - I know nothing about Tattersall s sales - I do not think Mr Elder ever called when Kenrick was out he never saw me in his absence I am quite certain the defendant pretended to be my friend the night I called - I told her how Kenrick had abused me she pitied me because she said she had a husband that used her ill - I told her that I had left my husband Q Did you ever tell her not to mention that you had called on Mr Elder A I believe I did because I knew Mr Kenrick was jealous he was jealous of every one when I dined at Elder s I think I did not leave till near ten o clock - I went about half-past six - he had a bit of cold meat and pickle I think neither of us had any wine nothing but beer I think we did not dine for an hour after I got there - now I come to recollect I think it was the day Kenrick took me to Bow-street office to see if Sir Richard Birnie would part us he did not stay to see Sir Richard he saw Ruthven the officer who asked what he came about he said he came about a servant who had robbed him at Brighton - Ruthven said then he must go to Brighton that was in the morning and I know that was the day I dined at Mr Elder s Kenrick took me to Bow-street without a summons - I never went to public places of amusement with Mr Elder alone I went to Vauxhall but Mr Kenrick was with me - I have known nothing of Mr Elder lately I have seen him here the last two sessions he did not come here with me not go away with me last Sessions or this Mr and Mrs May came with me to-day I do not even know where Elder lives and have had no conversation with him respecting this charge - I do not wish to state where I now live as Mr Kenrick may be in Court I do not wish him to know I live in London and my trustee knows where Mr Kenrick has annoyed me at one of my lodgings and sent an anonymous letter to my landlord - I have been in my present lodgings a fortnight before that I resided in Great Marylebone-street where he sent the sister of the woman he kept to abuse me - my landlord turned her cut of the shop Q Are you prepared deliberately to swear that your child was born after your marriage to Mr Yates A Am I compelled to take my oath about that it was born in February - I cannot say what year in 1825 I suppose I thought Mr Kenrick would have spared me this but he is bad enough for any thing - if I must tell the truth it was not in 1825 but I did not like to say so - he was born in 1823 MR ADOLPHUS Q Did your first husband know you had the child when you married him A Yes and Mr Kenrick knew it before I married him I had not parted with Mr Kenrick when he took me to Bow-street - I was living in Gloucester-street by myself and he took me to Bow-street because I wrote him a letter telling him I was living there and wanted 50l and my clothes - he came to my lodgings and took me to Bow-street he gave me three sovereigns that day and not getting my clothes I went to Mr Elder to interfere having nothing but what I stood upright in- Mr Bedford the trustee under my first husband s will is a solicitor when I told Elder I had no clothes - he told me he had some things of his late wife s which he would send me if I would accept them he did not produce them to me - he sent them to my lodgings I never told the defendant I loved Mr Elder s little finger better than Mr Kenrick s whole body- I was a good wife to Kenrick and did every thing to make him happy - my son s schooling I believe is not paid to this day though Kenrick placed him there JOSEPH ELDER I live in Grantham-place Park-lane I was acquainted with Mr Kenrick and he introduced me to Mrs Kenrick - I frequently visited them while they lived together I was on familiar terms with Mr Kenrick up to the hour of their parting and afterwards I had known him for years as we both followed the business of horse-dealers but I was not intimate with him till the marriage I remember Mrs Kenrick dining at my house - it was in 1829 and I think about the middle of October I am positive it was before Christmas we dined up in the nursery - the defendant attended at dinner she was my only servant no unbecoming familiarities took place between me and Mrs Kenrick at any time - I did not take the slightest liberty with her I did not dine alone with her after that - she was never in my bed-room with me to my knowledge nor in any bed-room any where else - I never had sexual intercorse with her in any place whatsoever my bed has always stood in one situation in my bed-room - Mrs Kenrick told me she had no clothes but what she stood up in and I supplied her with some of my late wife s there was never any familiarity between me and her to give Mr Kenrick cause of jealousy - the defendant looked out the clothes for Mrs Kenrick I told her Mrs Kenrick had left her husband and was in that destitute state and to look out the clothes for her If any familiarities had taken place in my bed it is impossible it should be seen through the key-hole - Mr Beasley and others have taken a survey of my room Cross-examined by MR BODKIN Q You were not acquainted with Mr Kenrick except in the way of business till he introduced his wife to you A Only on speaking terms my wife had been dead three years then the defendant had been my only regular servant for three years - I am still a horse-dealer I was a bankrupt in October and obtained my certificate in February or March- I am sure the time I mention is the only time Mrs Kenrick dined with me she never supped at my house alone she was never at my house more than three times to the best of my knowledge and one of these times was in the same week as she dined there - the whole three times was within a fortnight of that time she called a few days before she dined in the nursery to solicit my advice to know if I had heard what her husband intended to do I believe the day she dined there was the last time she came - she took tea there the same day I think she had called twice before within a fortnight but cannot be certain it was two or three times I cannot say which - I think she came in the morning when she dined there I generally dine at two o clock I got nothing for dinner except what I should have myself - I sometimes have a roast joint and sometimes chops Q Your dinner hour is two was it before or after dinner she came A I cannot tell for I have had so many things in my head to perplex me since I am sure she dined there - I cannot tell whether we had candles but I rather think at two o clock we should dine by daylight Q Is it your belief that you dined at your usual hour A I have no doubt but what I did but I cannot say - I dine at all hours just as business will allow she did not remain in my house after ten o clock at night - I do not think it was so late as ten it was as late as nine we had candles lighted certainly - I frequently called at Kenrick s house while they lived together both by invitation from Mr Kenrick and without I called at different times morning noon and night - I mostly found Mr Kenrick at home when he has been out I have seen Mrs Kenrick and Miss Paris who was visiting there and generally the clerk Q Sometimes you called I suppose and found Mrs Kenrick alone A Very seldom I cannot tell how often whether it was once twice or five times or twenty times I have called and seen her alone - she was in the diningroom I never sat down in the room with her alone - I never staid ten minutes on any occasion I sometimes dine in my parlour and sometimes in the nursery - I had dined there for many days before Mrs Kenrick came I do not know whether the cloth was laid when she came there are three windows to my parlour - a door opens out of the side into a passage and then into the parlour the room is ten or twelve feet high - I never knew Mrs Kenrick in my bed-room except when Mr Kenrick and her dined with us and then the ladies went up to change their clothes the defendant had been three years with me and left on account of ill-health - she applied to me to be discharged but she was useless to me I only kept her out of charity - I was never charged with any thing criminal there was once a misunderstanding between me and a brother horse-dealer - I was taken to Marlborough-street on a charge of stealing horses and held to bail I did not know Mr Kenrick was jealous of me at the time Mrs Kenrick dined with me - I afterwards learned through Mr Murray a clerk of his an uncertificated bankrupt who robbed his creditors that he was jealous of me Mrs Kenrick never told me so to my knowledge - I never recollect her saying in the presence of her husband Why do you sit there making faces about Mr Elder when the quarrel took place between them I was playing at backgammon with Miss Paris and attending to the play and do not know what the quarrel was about - it was not about me to my knowledge only us four were present - I paid no attention to the quarrel I never interfere between man and wife MR PHILLIPS Q It did not come to blows A No Miss Paris was a clergyman s daughter from Warwickshire - I was never tried for horse stealing the man took the money for the horses - the Magistrate seeing it was a matter of account said that it should be settled when I called and saw Mrs Kenrick alone it was purely accidental - the dining-room windows have no shutters but muslin curtains and blinds which would prevent persons outside from seeing into the room I frequently dined with Mr Kenrick by his invitation after his wife had dined with me - when Mr and Mrs Kenrick and her sister dined with me I believe the defendant showed the ladies into the bed-room JAMES HENRY ST HILL I am assistant to Mr Beasley an architect and am an architect myself I have seen the premises where Mr Elder lived this model looking at it was made under my direction and is a faithful one if the door from the nursery to the bedroom was ajar a person putting their eye to the key-hole could not see the bed - it is impossible from the position of the bed I went into the parlour and requested a man who was in possession to go into the bed-room and call out - I could hear a sound but that was all - if he had breathed as hard as human breath could blow it would be impossible to hear him in the parlour here is a plan of the room which will show it was impossible to see any person on the bed Cross-examined by MR BODKIN Q The door opens into the nursery A Yes the hinges are on the side nearest to the bed - whether the door was shut or ajar the eye could not see the bed through the key-hole Q Suppose a person s eye to be close to the key-hole and the door in the slightest degree ajar would not that person see the bed by looking through the aperture caused by the opening of the door A Certainly but not through the key-hole MR ADOLPHUS Q When a door is open is that a convenient situation to peep through a key-hole A I should think not MR SAMUEL BEASLEY I am an architect and live in Soho-square I have seen this model and attended to the situation of the bed and door - if the door was shut I should think it utterly impossible for two persons on the bed to be seen through the key-hole nor if the door was open as the key-hole would be rather further removed I went into the parlour and sent my clerks up into the bed-room to talk - they told me they talked very loud and I could not hear them at all Messrs Clancey and Dunell were my clerks - I could not bear any thing they said Q Putting experiment out of the question do you from your professional knowledge think it possible that hard breathing could be heard on the bed above A I should think it impossible Cross-examined by MR BODKIN Q Was the parlour door shut A I really cannot say but should think it was open I do not know whether the bed-room door was open or shut CHARLES MAY I am a house-agent at Brighton Mrs Kenrick came to live at my house about the middle of November 1829 recommended by Mr Bedford she remained there till March except going to town on the 30th of December by the mail about half-past ten o clock in the evening she returned on the 1st of January between seven and eight - I do not think while she was at my house she hardly ever went out without either my wife or daughter being with her - that was in consequence of some directions from Mr Bedford Cross-examined Q You do not mean to say she never left your house without them A I do not think she went out without some part of my family - she was very particular about it I saw Mr Elder at Brighton twice - he was by himself when I first met him my wife and Mrs Kenrick were with me we talked to him a little while and then left him - he did not come to my house he called once but not then I think Mrs Kenrick was out with my daughter when he called - he was not there five minutes he merely called to ask how I was - I had met him once before which I named he asked after nobody but me -I did not know him till I met him at Brighton I saw him in the Court last Session and this - Mrs Kenrick was not with him she was with my wife when he passed I have had no conversation with Mr Elder about this prosecution MR ADOLPHUS Q He came to your house having met you a few days before and asked how you did A Yes and was there about five minutes - I never saw the least indiscretion in Mrs Kenrick s conduct MRS MAY I am the wife Mr May Mrs Kenrick came to live with us in November 1829 and left in March 1830 - she came to London on the 30th of December and returned on the 1st of January by the evening coach with her son who she went to fetch - she never went out without me or one of my daughters I never observed the least levity or misconduct in her THOMAS HORNER I am a waiter at the Blossoms inn I remember Mrs Kenrick coming there - she staid one night which was on the 31st of December and went away on the 1st of January - she was not out during her stay there to my knowledge - I waited on her at breakfast dinner tea and supper - she could not be out from five o clock to ten without my knowledge I remember Mr Kenrick bringing his little boy to her on the day she arrived he came in a chaise and the boy was left JOHN ROE I am a constable I took the defendant into custody and told her it was for a charge of perjury in the case of Kenrick - she said the only untruth she had told was respecting having seen them through the key-hole but the reason why she said so was because she did not wish her master to know how she did see them she said Mr Kenrick had promised to give her 20l but had never given her a farthing I am positive she said this Cross-examined Q Did she give you this as a running observation or at one time A No it was at once while we were in a coach - she said it in one phrase I did not take down her words but am certain I have not misplaced one word - she did not say the door was ajar MR PHILLIPS Q Did you next day take down her words A Yes MR BODKIN addressed the Court on behalf of the defendant and called WILLIAM MAYNARD I am a livery-stable keeper I was at one time foreman to Mr Elder and was in the habit of being about his yard - I have seen Mrs Kenrick come there and have seen her with Mr Elder and I have seen her there with Mr Kenrick I remember she once came about seven or eight o clock when I was going away COURT Q Have you seen Mrs Kenrick come with a lady A Yes with a young lady - I cannot swear she did not come with a lady at the time I speak of - I think it was about the 7th or 8th of November ELIZABETH MIZEN I was in the service of Mr and Mrs Kenrick My master was sometimes out on business on Mondays and Thursdays about sales of horses - he went out about ten or eleven o clock in the morning and came home at two or a little later I do not know Mr Elder only by seeing him at our house - he called once or twice a week in the morning or the afternoon he has been there when my master was out and when he was at home - he frequently called on Mondays and Thursdays and when he has come and knocked at the door he has asked if my my master or mistress were within - I have said my master was not but my mistress was and he has sometimes come up to the room where my mistress was my mistress has seen him - he did not come very often once of twice a week he has come on the days of sale - I only lived there three months when my mistress was there and after she had been from Brighton a fortnight is the first of my recollection of seeing the gentleman call - he called every week all the time I was there Cross-examined by MR ADOLPHUS Q When did you leave A Nearly three years ago these visits of Mr Elder were after my mistress returned from Brighton COURT Q I took you down as saying that it was about a fortnight after your mistress returned from Brighton A Yes my master and mistress went down to Brighton - they went and returned together it is nearly three years since I left I know a young lady named Paris - she was there on a visit I cannot say how long she was there - perhaps about six weeks Mr Elder called while she was there he was never in the habit of stopping long sometimes a quarter off an hour Miss Paris and my mistress used the same sitting-room LEWIS NORTON I am an attorney I know Mr Joseph Elder from my knowledge of him I would not believe him on his oath MR ADOLPHUS Q Did he obtain his certificate under the Commission of Bankruptcy A I did not get his certificate I never attended with the proceedings I have heard he got his certificate - I have no doubt of it I did not get Mr Alexander to sign it Mr McDuff was the attorney who got the certificate HENRY TODD I am clerk to Mr Norton I attended to the business of the commission against Elder I attended the different examination of the bankrupt respecting his property from the means I have had of judging of him I would not believe him on his oath Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q Was not your master opposing attorney to the bankrupt A He was endeavouring to trace out his property not to prevent his getting his certificate I know he was about getting his certificate Mr McDuff the attorney was endeavouring to get his certificate - I do not know that he has got it I have some doubt about it I should rather say he has than that he has not - I never heard that he got it I know there were great exertions made to get it I never inquired whether he got it or not - I never heard from my master that he had got it - I rather think he has got it I have not the proceedings here to-night - I have seen them I believe I attended the last examination if the last examination was when they were about to commit Mr Elder to Newgate - I was there I think I attended every one of the examinations - I have no doubt I attended the last examination but I really did not inquire whether he had got his certificate the proceedings will tell - they are outside I meant they were not in the Court COURT Q Is it not the duty of the attorney to attend the commissioners on their signing the certificate A Yes but I do not know of any such attendance MR BODKIN Q Do you know of any application to Mr Norton for that A No Mr Norton was concerned for the assignees The proceedings were here produced MR BODKIN to HENRY TODD Q How long is it since these proceedings left Mr Norton s custody A Two or three months I had no knowledge then of the certificate being obtained COURT Q Have you many proceedings in cases of bankruptcy A Yes but I do not look at the Gazette Q Look at the hand-writing of this part of the proceedings whose is it is it not your own A Certainly not I do not believe it is Mr Norton s nor any clerk in our office - I have no idea whose it is I have seen it before Q Where have you seen it A I never saw it before I thought I had but I correct myself - I never saw it before Q You know you put your spectacles on and looked anxiously at it and then said you had seen it before and now you say you never saw it before A I said I had seen it before but when I came to look into it I find I have not seen it before I was in an error - I merely looked at the writing before but did not read the words RALPH HOPE I am a clerk to Mr Nixon and one of the messengers to the commissioners of bankruptcy I attended a number of the private examinations of the bankrupt in this case and heard him examined - he is not a person I would believe on his oath MR PHILLIPS Q Do you know Mr Norton A Yes by his being solicitor to the commission he or his clerks attended the examination - I do not know whether Mr Elder got his certificate they may get it without our knowing it - I have seen Mr Norton write I do not think this is his writing HENRY TODD re-examined Q What is the general professional fee for attending the commission when they sign the certificate A One guinea Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q Is it not the duty of the attorney or his clerk to attend and fill this up A No the solicitor for the bankrupt often fills it up and gets the guinea MR NORTON This is a memorandum of the commissioners having signed the certificate but that is nothing till the Lord Chancellor signs it I do not know how it got into our proceedings - I think I was out of town and I think this is Mr McDuff s writing an attorney often borrows proceedings and signs it MR ADOLPHUS addressed the Jury in reply GUILTY - Fined One Shilling Confined One Month and then Transported for Seven Years 
t18360201-610  610 JOHN THEAK was indicted for wilful and corrupt perjury MR BODKIN conducted the prosecutor EDWARD HENRY BURRIDGE I am attached to Union Hall I produce a summons against Mr Cullingford for keeping his house open during divine service— the summons was here put in and read Cross-examined by MR DUNBAR Q Were you present at the hearing of this A Yes part of the time—the summons was dismissed—there is wirtten on the summons dismissed with costs MR EDWIN I am one of the clerks of Union Hall I have got the minutes of evidence which I took in the case of Thomas Stowell aganist Robert Cullingford— read John Theak of No 8 Union-place Newington says on Sunday the 6th of December a at twenty minutes before one o clock in the morning I was by the defendant s house—I saw two respectabel men go into the house and at the same time two men come out with pipes in their mouths and soon after a female came out with a mug of beer—I had a watch which I compared with Newington Church and found it correct Cross-examined Q What do you call twenty minutes past one o clock in the morning you call past twelve o clock afternoon A I should call it so—the name of the defendant s house is not stated in the deposition—I do not remember hearing the oath administered—the prisoner was ordered to pay the costs of the summons which were 2s or 3s I belive—the same defendant was brought up before but I cannot tell how long before I belive within six months by the same informer and the same witness—I belive the fine was 40s MR BODKIN Q What were the names of the Magistrates present A James Trail and Henry Jeremy THOMAS DAVID TAYLOR I am a solicitor and am concerned for Mr Cullingford—I attended on the 13th of December when this cast was heard at Union Hall before Mr Trail and Mr Jeremy—the prisoner appeared as a witness—he was sworn to tell truth the whole truth and nothing bot the truth—he was then examined and his depositions taken and road by the clerk—the Magistrate dismissed the summon with costs—I asked Mr Jeremy what costs I was to receive—he said 3s —I cross-examined the prisoner and while the Magistrate was speaking to me Mr Cullingford had paid 3s instead of my receiving it—I thought it was no matter Cross-examined Q Your client pleaded not guilty A Yes—the name of the house is written up Country Terrace Tavern but the right name is County Coffee-house—they should alter it—it is situated in the county Terrace New Kent-road JOHN HOWELL I am a tailor and live at No 108 London-road I know Mr Cullingford who keeps the Country Coffee-house—I work for him—on the Thursday before Sunday the 6th of December I received an order from him for a waistcoat—it was no done in time to be there before church began or the Sunday and I went to get there at the time church was over but I got there about ten minutes before one—I met Thomas Miles on the way and he walked with me—when we got here the door was shut—Mrs cullingford was in the bar-parlour—there is a window from there which looks into the street—I looked through and saw her there—I held the handkerchief that contained the waistcoat up to the window—she knew me and the door was opened by the boy who goes by the name of Henry—on going in Mrs Cullingford was just coming out of the bar-parlour into the bar apparently to go up-stairs I should Presume—the bar-maid was in the bar at the time—nobody quitted the house when I went in Q Could two men have left the house when you and Mr Miles went in with pipes without your observing them A Certainly not—nobody went in at the same time with Mr Miles and myself—I found no female with a mug in her hand as if served with beer—no female went out—I staid at the bar a minute and a half or two minutes and after that went into the parlor—I had a view of the tap-room—there were no people there—the door makes a very great noise when it opens—it is in a dilapidated state and tied at top and bottom—there is a stone flooring and the bolt shoots makes a noise—I might not have heard that door open if the parlour door had been shut but I had the parlourd-oor in my hand waiting for Mr Cullingford to come down stairs and in the situation in which I was placed I think the front door could not have opened without my seeing it—Mr Cullingford came down stairs shortly and we had some talk about the waistcoat—while we were talking the pot-boy came to the room door and told him it was near the time to open the house—I think he said it wanted about two minutes and a half to the time—Mr Cullingford said Go up and look what o clock it is and he went—Mr Cullingford said We will not open the door we had better be a minutes or two after than before the time —there is a window on the staircase which looks out on Trinity church clock—it would not he necessary to open the front door to see that—I and my friend stopped in the parlour a few seconds and then came out of the parlour—the door was opened—it was then minutes past one o clock Cross-examined Q Dues this house stand at the corner of a street A Yes—what is called St George s-road—there is no side-door—there are a pair of gates in the court which no one that I saw was admitted in or out at at which Mr Cullingford was in the habit of taking his beer and lumbering things in—the parlour is in front of the tap-room—I should think it was from ten to twelve feet from the parlour-door to the street-door—I spoke to Mrs Cullingford first—I looked into the tap-room—there was no clock in the tap-room—there is one in the bar which I presume was going as when I came out it was something like ten minutes past one o clock —I did not look at the church-cook then—the landlord did not say his clock was out of order—he sent the boy to look at the church-clock because he wished to be accrete through being falsely sworn against before—the people who swore against him saying that there were six people with pipes in their mouths came out of Mr Cullingford s—from that he was very cautious—he and I are on terms on intimacy and he has told me he would be cautious and make the boy look at that clock to see the time before he opened his door—I have heard him say he meant to have prosecuted the people who swore against him—the house is known either by the County-terrace Tavern or the County-terrace Coffee-house —I waited there five minutes before Mr Cullingford came down—there is no room between the tap-room and parlour—the stain come down and there are two doors—there is but one footway—door out of the house and no back way only those pair of gates—till Mr Cullingford came down I am sure no person could have come in or gone out without my hearing it and I should think not while I was talking to him because the boy came in and made this remark to him—I stood close to the parlour-door—I swear people could not come in or go out with our my hearing or seeing them and no one went out—I am sure they could not for I recollect that Mr Cullingford and I were talking and I told my friend that he had been fined a few weeks before and he was obliged to be a little cautions—he had got his waistcoat on then—I did not say I could not certainly say whether any body came in and went out I said I thought not and now from some circumstances I am sure they could not—the parlour door was not shut at all—we did not sit down—I had something to drink—I do not think I took any thing till church was over but I will not swear any thing at all about it—he did not pay me for the waistcoat—I think it was not one o clock—I will not swear whether it was before or after—I might call for it and leave it there—I took nothing at any other house that morning THOMAS MILES I met Mr Howell on Sunday morning the 6th of December and went in with him—he made motions to some one at the bar window and then a lad opened the door—no persons came out at the time we went in—I am sure no two men with pipes came out—the door was closed when we went in—I did not see any female inside with a mug getting beer—I suppose we remained in the house from twenty minutes to half an hour I cannot say—I do not remember any thing being said about the time—I did not see any people come in before one o clock nor the front door opened Cross-examined Q That was very good liquor you had A I had no liquor at all—we had some ale after he came down and he had the waistcoat on—I left about five or ten minutes after we had the als—I do not think Cullingford drank—Howell and I did in the parlour—we had no command of the passages or doors at all—people might have come in or gone out—there was no conversation in my presence about catching the people as the clock struck one Q When did you first hear you were to be a witness A About a fortnight or three weeks ago—Howell knew where I lived—he never told me I was wanted till after they were before the Magistrate—I was first applied to about eight or ten days ago—some person brought me a subpœns but I was not at home MR BODKIN Q Were you or Mr Howell nearest the door A I sat up by the fire-place and Howell stood nearest the fire-place—that is not near the door—the door was open and the fire-place is opposite it—the street door was closed while I was there ROBERT CULLINGFORD I am a licenced victuller and keep the County Coffee-house in the Kent-road It is larger than a beer-shop—I remember Sunday the 6th of December Mr Howell came to bring me a waistcoat at ten or twelve minutes before one o clock—my wife brought it up to me—I put it on and came down stairs and found Howell and Miles—the front door was shut then—on my oath it was not open from the time I came down till one o clock for no purpose whatever—my boy Jacobs came to me and stated it was one o clock—I told him he had better go up and look at the Trinity church whether our clock was right or no—he came and told me it wanted about two minutes and a half—I altered my own lock and then opened the door and let him out with his beer Cross-examined Mr Howell was there when you altered the chock A Yes he was in the parlour—the clock is in the bar—I said nothing to him about altering the clock—he heard the conversation—Howell had a glass of ale to drink—I think it was a pint of ale they had—when I came down stairs I did not look at the clock to see what time it was—I did not know where Miles lived till after this transaction—I called on him to give evidence I think the day before I was summoned at Union Hall—Mr Howell and I went—the boy went first I belive to see if Miles was at home and then Mr Howell went to him and saw him I believe but I did not—he lives about a quarter of a mile from my house—I did not attempt to bring him forward till about nine days ago EUNICE CULLINGFORD I was at home on Sunday the 6th of December Mr Howell came with a gentleman about ten minutes to one o clock—I was in the parlour adjoining the bar—it has a bow-window which looks into the street—the door was closed when Howell came—there were no people there for beer nor any with pipes—I directed the door to be opened for Mr Howell because he held the waistcoat up to the window that he was going to bring home for Mr Cullingford—the door was closed again directly they came in—nobody left our house with pipes in their hands or mouths—I remained there three or four minutes after they came in and then took the waistcoat up to my husband—I did not come down again till considerably past one—there was no female there for beer or any leaving the house with a mug of beer in her hand Cross-examined Q How many servants are there in your house A Four none of them have the liberty of serving or taking money except the bar-maid—I believe she was drawing the boy s beer when I went up with the waiscoat—it wanted about five minutes to one o clock then—there was no one in the bar besides but the pot-boy—a person in the parlour cannot see the bar unless they stand against the door—I did not come down till twenty minutes before two o clock MR BODKIN Q Was that a large quantity of beer that was sent out A About twenty pots I believe MARY ANN MARQUET I am bar-maid at the house in question I was there on the 6th of December—Mr Howell and Mr Miles came in shortly before one o clock—nobody left the house with pipes when they came in nor any women with beer—no woman came in at all Cross-examined Q Did you draw the ale for Mr Howell A Yes one pint—I was not in the same room they drank it in—they stopped till after the house was opened—my master alters the clock regularly every Sunday morning—I do not know who altered the clock that morning—whether it was Mr Banks or the man—he is a clock-maker—the clock always gets on a little in the week—sometimes it varies a minute—it is generally altered about half-past ten o clock in the morning and some body had altered it that morning COURT Q And there is a church clock A Yes Trinity church—our clock is regulated ever Sunday morning by that—I cannot tell whether Mr Banks did it or master HENRY JACOB I was in Mr Cullingford s service on the 6th of December—I opened the door to Mr Howell and Mr Miles by my mistress s order—she was in the bar—the door makes a noise—there are four bolts to it—you cannot open it without making a noise—no two men went out with pipes or without—no person came in or went out between Mr Howell s coming and the door being opened—I asked my master who was in the parlour with Mr Howell and Mr Milles if I was to open the door—he said not till one—we never open till one—we have got two clocks one in the bar and one on the staircase—that is an eight-day clock—I looked at the church clock first and the other afterwards—my master had good reasons for being particular because he informed against us once before—I looked at the clock and then told my master—nobody did any thing to the clock in the bar—it did not want any thing doing to it because it is always right and it is regulated every week—every Monday morning—I know the prisoner—I never said I would serve him out—I would have done him if I had caught him—we never risked ourselves in his hand to be informed against any more—he false swore against us the first time THOMAS DAVID TAYLOR re-examined The prisoner saw Mr Howell before the Magistrate and heard me examine him—he said he was one of those persons who went in—I sent Howell for Miles but he would not attend that day—I offered if the Magistrate would adjourn the case to produce him next day—the Magistrates said they were quite satisfied and dismissed the case GUILTY Aged 26 — Confined One Month and

t18360509-1137  1137 JOHN SHEERING was indicted for wilful and corrupt perjury MESSRS PRENDERGAST and PAYNE conducted the prosecution ROBERT BAYLIS I am one of the clerks of worship-street police-office I produce an original summons in reference to this case MR PHILLIPS Q Was there not a complaint lodged in writing A This is a summons and it says Whereas a complaint hath this day been made &c —I was not present when the previous complaint was made and know nothing about it MR PAYNE Q Do you know the practice of the office A Yes the informer comes with his summons and presents it for signature MR PHILLIPS Q Does not the person state to the Magistrate what it is he wants A No generally not—the summons is given to the clerk and the Magistrate signs it after the clerk has looked at it WILLIAM HERITAGE I am chief to the Magistrates at Worship-street This summons was issued from the office and has the Magistrate s Mr Broughton s signature—it was granted to Aaron Rawlings—I only know it by its being down here—it has my mark on it—I issued it myself—I know Aaron Rawlings—I will not say whether he brought it or not if a party wishes to lay an information and to convict a person he brings the summons ready filled up to me—It states all that is here stated with the exception of the Magistrate s signature COURT Q Do you afterwards require the appearance of the person whose name appears on the summons or do you not A We generally take them as matters of course but when they come to a hearing the alleged informer is required to be present Q Supposing the prisoner had brought this summons ready filled up and it had been signed by the Magistrate and at the hearing he had come in the absence of the person said to be the informer would they have proceeded A Certainly not—they invariably call for the informer MR PRENDERGAST Q Did you have that summons in your possession for some time A Yes—I think I might have it a fortnight or perhaps a month—I then handed it over to my son—it had been in my possession from the time of the complaint being heard till I handed it over to him Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q Where did you keep it A In my desk which is nearly always locked—I might go away for an hour or so and leave it unlocked—I am sure no one goes to my desk—our office does a great deal of business—a great many persons who belong to the office have access to the room where my desk is but they never go there—this summons was issued by the Magistrate—I entered it in the book and marked it to the officer that was to serve it—I only remember it by seeing my mark on it—all my summonses are marked—this is marked H for Hanley—Rawlings is very frequently at our office—I have understood that my son is conducting this prosecution—he attends at our office and would have an apportunity very likely of seeing Rawlings—my son is not engaged at the office but the pressure of business is such that two clerks cannot get through it—my son comes to assist me and I pay him—it is the custom for persons who are not informers to come and take summonses and we grant them—the person says Here are these summonses and I will be obliged to you to get them signed —I cannot be certain that Rawlings presented this WILLIAM HERITAGE JUN I occasionally assist my father at the office—I received this summons from my father on the very day or the day after the appeal was heard at Clerkenwell—it was in conseqence of some representation I made to my father that he produced it to me—I was present at the office when this summons was brought by Rawlings to be signed by the Magistrate—I was present when this matter was heard before the Magistrate and Aaron Rawlings attended as the informer—the prisoner was called as his witness—I saw the prisoner sworn but I forget by what officer—the Magistrates present were William Grove and Samuel Twyford Esqrs who are both Magistrates for the county of Middlesex—I heard what the prisoner said—it was not taken down—Mr Goodale was there—the summons was read to him and he was asked whether he was guilty or not guilty and said he was not guilty—this was on Wednesday the 25th of November—after Sheering was sworn he stated that on Sunday the 22nd of November last be went to the house of the defendant about half-past eleven or between half-past eleven and twelve o clock at the White Horse Hare-street in the parish of St Matthew Bethnal-green and found the door open—he went in and saw three women drinking gin at the bar—he called for a glass of spruce at the bar which the defendant served him and he paid twopenes for it he then went into the tap-room and called for a pint of porter and whilst there—he counted twenty-seven men and women many of them very drunk and riotous came in and the landlord served them with beer—that the house was most notorious for drunkenness—he staid there till about half-past twelve o clock and he then went to the parish church and found it was not over that he said to Mr Goodale as he went down the steps of the house Remember my name is Jack Sheering and you don t buff me out of this next Wednesday at Worship-street —that was all he said—Mr Goodale was then called upon for his defence—the magistrate convicted him—I was present at the hearing of the appeal at the Clerken well Session on the 17th of December—the prisoner was called as a witness in support of the conviction—I saw him sworn—I made a note of what he said on that occasion— Reads I know the White Horse public house in Hare-street Bethnal-Green—I was there on Sunday the 22nd of November last at three minutes before twelve o clock—I found the door shut and three drunken persons knocking outside—the defendant opened but the door and let them in I followed and had something to drink at the—the defendant served me—while I was there the defendant let in twenty seven men and women many of them drunk and very noisy—he served them with liquor and was carrying on a roaring trade—I staid some time and afterwards went to the parish church and it was not over —he was then cross-examined and asked what he was served with at the bar—he said A glass of gin —he also said he did not go into the tap-room—I heard him asked what he was by trade—he said he had been brought up to the bar—he was asked what bar—he said the defendant s bar—he was asked whether he had not been at the bar of that he would swear that—he said Yes —one of the magistrates observed perhaps he had been at the old bar of that court—he said yes he had—he was asked what he was there for—he said For rescuing a follow creature from the grave —he was asked whether it was not for stealing a dead body—he said Yes —he was asked How many times he had been at the bar—he said he did not know—I recollect at the hearing at the office when he stated that he had had a glass of spruce that Goodale told the magistrate he did not sell spruce—I have seen Aaron Rawlings to day in the gallery of this court—it was asked at Clerkenwell why Mr Goodale was not prepared with witnesses at Worship-street office the answer was that in consequence of the vague manner in which the summons was put out he did not know what he was charged with—I gave a notice to the magistrate to appeal—I have the copy of it and the original notice is here—I served it on the chief clerk for William Grove and Samuel Twyford in the usual manner and here is the petition also and the recognisance Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q Are you the person who conducts this prosecution A Yes for Mr Woolley—he very seldom attends to any criminal business—I am not a solicitor—I am merely Mr Woolley s clerk—I assist my father when I choose to go—my father pays me—they are always very busy—there is business enough for half a dozen clerks—I am remunerated by Mr Woolley for this prosecution—he has a boy in his office about thirteen or fourteen years old—he keeps only one—the whole burden of preparing the brief was thrown on me—I cannot tell the time of day when this summons was applied for by Aaron Rawlings but what brings it to my recollection is I laughed at the name of the publican being Goodale—it might be in the morning but the business is so great there that had it not been for the name I should not have remembered it—Rawlings has been on various occassions at the office—there is very seldom any evidence taken down in writing at our office—there has latterly but not in publican s cases I know the Judges have complained but not in consequence of not taking evidence down there have been complaints of the loose way in which the business is conducted at the office but not of taking evidence—Mr Goodale was asked whether he had any witnesses—he said no he had not a soul in the house except his own family—he made use of those words—I do not know what notice he had of this—the summons was taken out on the Monday and the hearing was on the Wednesday but the officers sometimes do not serve the summons until the night before—I have had a communication with Mr Goodale—he has not employed me—to my knowledge he has never seen Mr Woolley—I do not know whether this is carried on at Mr Goodale sole expense several friends have seen Mr Goodale on the subject publicans and others—I have seen this paper before looking at it —I was shown one once by Sheering—I know some of the people named here were publicans—Mr Cox is a butcher and Mr Godwin I believe is a corn-chandler—I have seen Mr Ronalds in this business and Mr Herdman—there may have been a publican of the name of Cox convicted at our office but I do not recollect it—it might have been twelve months ago—he may have been convicted on the very day Goodale was there and I forget it—if I see such an enormous case I remember it and I remember Mr Groves saying what a monstrous case it was—I said Yes if true —I was the attorney in the appeal at Clerkenwell—I drew the brief there and instructed the counsel and have done the same to-day—there was nothing to prevent my having it taken down in short-hand if I had known that the notes had not been taken by the Court I might have had it taken—of course I do not do the business for nothing—part of the costs go into Mr Woolley s pocket—there is an agreement between me and Mr Woolley—we do not exactly share the costs—I object to answer the question—he pays me what be thinks proper—I do not know what the proportion will be—I bear the expenses myself—I expect something for my services but there is no agreement between Mr Wooley and me as to what I shall receive—it does not depend on the result—it depends on the amount is large I shall get more than if it is small—there is an agreement that I shall receive something according to the amount of costs—if the costs were 100l I cannot say what I should receive—I cannot say how much I shall be out of pocket—I have assisted him before—I cannot tell whether I shall get the same proportion now—I may get a third or fourth or half—in small cases I have got half—he has paid me for the brief and money out of pocket—I cannot tell how many cases of prosecution I have had under Mr Woolley—some Sessions there may have been three or four and some none—I should think not so much as thirty in a year MR CHARLES PELLET ALLEN I am deputy-clerk of the peace for the county of Middlesex I produce the conviction on the 25th of November 1835 of James Goodale before William Groves and Samuel Twyford Esqrs —I was present during the examination of sheering—the evidence of the last witness is nearly correct—I do not recollect the cross-examination—he said nothing in his cross-examination qualifying what he had said—I only remember about the resurrection Cross-examined Q I suppose you would not undertake to repeat the evidence yourself A No I can repeat the substace of it COURT Q Do you recollect in what state the prisoner described the door of the house A He said it was shut and there were persons at the door when he got there—I think he said Goodale opened the door—I do not remember what he said he had to drink—I think he said twenty-seven persons were let in—I do not remember in what state he said they were THOMAS EAGLES I am a police-constable of Worship Street I remember Sheering giving his evidence against Goodale—he said he went and had a glass of spruce and afterwards went into the tap-room and saw about twenty persons I think—he came out and said My name is Sheering the informer you shall not buff me out of this Cross-examined Q What was it A That he went into Mr Goodale s house during morning service and called for a glass of spruce and was served by Mr Goodale—he then went into the tap-room and there were upwards of twenty persons—I do not remember the number and on coming out he said My name is Jack Sheering the informer you shall not buff me out of this —that is as far as I know every word—I waited to the end—I do recollect that he said where he went to after he left the public-house or what state the persons were in SIR WILLIAM CURTIS BART I was acting as chairman at Clerkenwell Sessions when Mr Goodale made an appeal from the police-office I took the greater part of Sheering s evidence in writing—there was no alteration that I did not take if there had been I should have put it down—I can undertake to say that he said every thing I have down—they are the exact words referring to notes —he first stated that he knew of the White Horse public house in Hare-street Bethnal-green—that he was there on Sunday the 22nd of November then last past—that it was about three minutes before twelve o clock when he arrived at the house—the door was shut—that he saw there two women and one man who appeared to be drunk desirous to get in and that Mr Goodale came and let them all in—that they drank at the bar other persons being in the tap-room at that time—that he stopped there till half-past twelve o clcok having had something to drink during the time—whilst he was there twenty-seven other persons entered and upon leaving the house he went to the parish church where service was still going on—he was then cross-examined and on a question put by the learned Counsel he said the defendant did not ask for time to bring witnesses—he was asked how often he had been in that court—he stated more than I recollect—he said something about being brought up to the bar—he said he could not recollect whether he had ever been tried in that court—upon being further asked he said I was charged with stealing a dead body —he gave an answer which excited some surprise and laughter but I did not take it down JAMES GOODALE I am a publican and keep the White Horse Hare-street Bethnal-green I kept it in November last I remember appearing at Worship-street on a charge brought against me by Aaron Rawlings—I remember the state of my house on the morning of the 22nd of November during church-time—I think I can distinctly recollect what Sheering swore against me at the office—when he got into the box the Magistrate told him he was drunk—he said he was not he had got a bad cold—the Magistrate said he was very drunk and he would not hear his evidence—but Rawling stepped up and said he had but one case which would not last five minutes—and then he was put to his oath COURT Q Do you mean that the Magistrates examined the witness after they said he was drunk A Yes MR PAYNE Q Was it after he said he had got a cold that they swore him A Yes—it is not true that Sheering had a glass of spruce served him by me at my house on Sunday morning—I do not keep such a thing—I swear he never was in the house at any time that day—I served a man with half a pint of beer eight minutes before one o clock—I have every reason to believe my clock was right—the man said it was one o clock—there was not one person let in barring my own family—I did not serve any one from without with any liquor on that Sunday during the hours of Divine service—at half-past eleven o clock my door was shut and it was never opened till a few minutes before one o clock when I opened it to serve that person the half pint of beer—there were not three women drinking gin at the bar—Sheering did not go into the tap-room and call for a pint of beer and remain till half-past twelve o clock—it is not true that he said his name was Jack Sheering and I should not buff him out of that at Worship-street—myself wife and children servant-maid and nephew were the only persons in the house—I requested my case might he postponed that I might produce witnesses—I spoke to the Magistrates but they did not seen to notice it—I had no witnesses for the thing—the man swore no one saw me serve the man with the half-pint but myself—I thought that was the charge—it is not true that three myself before twelve o clock that day when my door was shut three drunken persons were knocking outside Cross-examined Q You heard Sheering swearing at Worship-street against you A Yes—I thought it was for the half-pint and when I got there I found it was a different thing—I said I could bring witnesses to prove against what they swore to if they gave me time and that on Sheering s charge I had no witnesses—my nephew was in the house—I could have brought him but I went to answer for the half-pint—they asked if I had brought any witnesses—I said no barring my own family—I did not say I had not a soul in the house at the time and I had no witnesses—when Sheering was sworn I told the magistrate I was sure that it was a mistake that was not my case at all—I cannot say whether the Magistrate asked me if I had any witnesses after Sheering had given his evidence I said I had brought no witnesses—I did ask for time after Sheering was heard—I did not say I had no witnesses and there was not a soul in the house—I expect I am at the sole expense of this prosecution—I have employed Mr Woolley—I have seen Mr Woolley s clerk Mr Heritage—I did not see Mr Woolley but I employed persons to do it—I employed Mr Heritage—the prosecutor appeared to me to be drunk JOSIAH POMEROY I am the prosecutor s nephew and am a watchmaker On Sunday the 22nd of November I was at the prosecutor s house a few minutes before eleven o clock—when I first went the house was open it wanted a quarter to eleven o clock when I left my own house which is about five minute s walk from the prosecutor s—I do not know whether church had begun but I heard the churchbell strike out—the house was shut up before eleven o clock my Mr Goodale—I remained there till a quarter past one o clock—I was in the bar and took a lunch—I amused the children from eleven to one o clock from the bar to the tap-room and the parlour—there was not a soul in the tap-room but myself and the children—I saw the servant-girl cleaning the pots some were drying in the bar and the tap-room—there was no one drinking in the tap-room no one was served at the bar—the prisoner never entered the house that I saw—he could not be sitting in the tap-room with twenty-seven persons—I do not know whether my uncle keeps spruce—there were no drunken men or women served at the bar—I did not hear any one knocking at the door—the prisoner could not have come in with two people and I not know it—there was no noise or noisy people—all the noise was with me and the children—they are all young COURT Q What time did you go away A About a quarter-past one—I have business to attend to in the week and I wanted to see my uncle as he had been very bad MR PRENDERGAST Q Was there any circumstance that brings that day to your remembrance A Yes—it was my nephew s birth-day—I went to tea with them that day—I dined at my own house and then went to tea—I heard about the summons on the Tuesday after—I gave evidence at Clerkenwell Cross-examined Q Do you know Worship-street A Yes—it is about three-quarters of a mile from Mr Goodale s—I should walk it in ten minutes—no one came into the house during Divine service—they could not without my seeing them COURT to MR GOODALE Q Who was the person you served with half a pint of beer A I don t know—I think it was about eight minutes before one o clock—he knocked at the door and said Why don t you open you neighbours are open I don t know where Pomeroy was—I did not see him at the moment—he might be in the kirchen—I went on the Tuesday and asked him about it—he said he did not see the man come in MARY BEADLE I was in the service of Mr Goodale I remember the Sunday before he went to Worship-street—the door was shut at eleven o clock that morning—I cleaned my pots and dried them in the tap-room and bar—there were not twenty-seven persons there drinking and making a noise—Sheering did not come in at all—there was no one but my master and mistress and Mr Pomeroy and the children Cross-examined Q Did nobody at all come in A No one at all—I was not absent from the bottom of the house five minutes—I was not absent from half-past twelve till one o clock—my master could not have let any one in without my seeing it—he could not have helped any body at all—The house was kept shut till one o clock—at eight minutes before one o clock Mr Goodale said he let a person have some beer but I did not see him—he could not have let any person in till one o clock without my seeing it and I did not see it COURT Q Where were you at eight minutes before one o clock A Upstairs with the children—I was not absent two minutes—directly I came down I heard the door shut—it then wanted seven minutes to one o clock—I looked at the clock in the bar—I said no one could come in without my seeing because I was not absent five minutes at a time—they could not have come except during the five minutes—I was frequently taking the pots in and out COURT to J GOODALE Q Where was it you let the man in A He came in at the street-door and drank the beer and I drew down the shutters directly imagining my clock had lost eight minutes as the man said so—I do not think the man was standing near me—I did not shut the door after the man—I opened the house directly—I do not think Beadle could hear the door because I never shut it JURY Q Do the shutters make a noise A Yes a dreadful noise more noise than the shutting of a door MR PRENDERGAST Q Sometimes public-house doors open with a weight so that there is a sort of spring A There is a spring but no weight to my door—there are weights to the shutters—the door always shuts itself—she might hear the door shut too DAVID GRIFFITHS I am a coal-dealer and live in Hare-street Bethnalgreen I reside four or five doors from Mr Goodale but my stable is under the same roof there is a hole in the wall of my stable like a crack it goes into Mr Goodale s yard close to the tap-room window—I can bear there what takes place in the tap-room—I had a horse who showed symptoms of the gripes and I was there two or three times perhaps twenty minutes or half an hour at a time I spent the greater part of the morning there from seven to twelve—I went home for warm water and for a mash—there was no noise in the tap-room or I must have heard it—I left about twelve—my man comes between twelve and one—I passed the public-house door from the stables and it was closed—after eleven I wanted something myself and house was closed—I tapped at the window and got no reply—the man came to go to his horses between half-past twelve and one—and I went with him the house was shut and very quiet CHARLES ALEXANDER CHRISTIE I am a beadle of Bethnal-green It is my business to see in what state the public-house are kept during Divine service—on Sunday November 22 I went to the White Horse in Hare-street at a quarter before twelve the house was quiet and orderly not a soul there I looked into the tap-room—I did not go in—I heard no noise—I should think there could not have been any while I was there—I went up Hare-street and from thence to Slater-street which I suppose took me till a little after twelve—I passed the house again the door was closed—I shoved my came against it and it was fast Cross-examined Q Why did you put your came against it A Because sometimes the doors are shut but not fast—I do it generally to all the houses—there are panes of glass over the door but the door was not open the first nor the second time—it is about seven or eight minutes walk from worship-street GUILTY Aged 33 — Confined Fourteen Days and Transported for

t18390408-1423  1423 JAMES CHARLES CLIFFORD was indicted for wilful and corrupt perjury MESSRS JAMES and GIBBS conducted the Prosecution — SCARLETT I am marshal to Lord Abinger I produce the record on which an action was brought on a bill of exchange—this is the bill which was produced at the trial—I have had it ever since GEORGE FREDERICK HUDSON I am a solicitor and live in Bucklers-bury I was concerned for the present defendant in 1835—he sent for me to the Queen s Bench Prison where he was in custody and gave me a memorandum of his demand against Lady Parker—the paper I have in my hand I believe are the written instructions he gave me—they are his handwriting— reads — Lady Fanny Parker to J C Clifford —1836 March 11 Bill 40l June 30 ditto 21l 15s 8d up to July 13 ditto 1l 6s Total 63l 1s 8d —I lodged a detainer against Lady Parker—60l I think was the amount sworn to—I proceeded in the action—these are the particulars of it— looking at some papers —the cause came on for trial and the cause and all matters and differences were referred Q Is this the order of reference handing a paper to the witness A This is a copy I rather think—I am not certain it is a copy—I believe it is the original Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q On your oath are you prepared to swear positively that it is the original A No I would not—I believe that it is Q Look at this paper read that on the back — reads —A Clifford versus parker Copy Order of Reference MR JAMES Q What is the ordinary practice are there two originals made out on paper one for each party A I believe there are COURT Q When a case is referred at Nisi Prius there are two parties the plaintiff and defendant and do you not know that there are two papers given A I believe there are Read — 12th December in the seventh year &c This cause and all matters and differences including the rule now pending between the two parties are hereby referred to John Busby Esq Barrister-at-law to order what he shall think proper to be done Witness I or my clerk took up the original award but I have not got it as I have since delivered all my papers to Mr Clifford s then attorney Q In February 1837 was any money paid to you by Mr Austin in respect of that action A There was—this is the receipt I gave him for 128l 10s in full for the debt and costs—the debt was 40l and the rest were the costs—I never saw Mr Clifford after I gave that receipt—I sent him the balance due to him which was 26l —there were 14l the costs of a rule due from Clifford to me and I think these were costs out of pocket—I deducted all that was due to me and sent him the balance—I never saw him again on the subject of tins action Q From the time the action commenced till the settlement was any thing ever said to you by Clifford about two bills A I believe there never was—he said nothing to me at that time except about one bill— looking at a bill —I believe this to be the bill on which I brought the action COURT Q What do you mean by the word believer A It is now three or four years ago one does not like to speak positively MR JAMES Q Have you a moral certainty in your own mind that that is the same bill A I have I must have had it at the time I took the instructions or shortly after—my attention was not called particularly to it more than to any other transaction—the prisoner was in the habit of tending from the Bench to me—I have received letters from Mm in his handwriting by French—I sent the money to the prisoner I think by my clerk in February—and in March 1837 I received a communication from him and I sent him by French the bill on which the action was brought and some cheques—I believe I sent the bill on which the action was brought—I had no other but I have said that I am not certain that this is the bill Q Is it your belief to the best of your memory that yon sent back this bill of exchange with the cheques by French A I cannot speak any other way than to the best of my recollection—not having seen the document for three years I will not speak to it more positively—I believe that bill had no indorsement beside Clifford s—that bill was in the same state as this except that it had not Gibbs s indorsement which it now has—to the best of my recollection this is the bill certainly Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q Have you not sworn you were not certain that it was the bill A I am not certain other than to the best of my belief—I will not speak to the certainty of a document I have not seen for three years Q You said you had a moral certainty what did you mean by that A I will give you my definition of it—that while there is a possibility of its not being so from some exact imitation of it still as there is no ground for believing it has been imitated I believe it to be the same—when we see a bill we sometimes see it only once—I saw that perhaps half-a-dozen times—I believe there was no other indorsement on it—I will not say my recollection of it must have been very slight—the reason I will not swear positively to it is because I have not seen it for three years COURT Q The bill was produced before the arbiter A Yes I had the bill there—the signature to these two affidavits are the prisoner s writing and this paper of instructions is his writing read In the first affidavit dated 13th September 1838 the defendant deposed that Lady Parker was not detained in the King s Bench on or about the 14th July 1836 on the 40l bill on which the present action was brought but on another bill of the same date and amount which the said Lady Parker had accepted in addition to the first—in the second affidavit dated 20th October 1838 he deposed that when he first instructed his attorney Mr Hudson in 1836 he delivered to him a bill of exchange for £40 on Lady Parker and that he never bad the said bill back from Mr Hudson nor had he to the best of his recollection ever seen the same since LADY FANNY PARKER I am widow of the late Sir Hyde Parker—I reside in Park-lane—in the year 1835 I employed the defendant as cook—I was then in the King s Bench—I was indebted to the defendant for cooking—he applied to me for money about December 1835 and I gave him a bill on the 16th of December—I think Mrs Grimes was present when the defendant made his application for money—I said I expected money from a verdict against Lord Lake and that I could not give him any money then—40l was the amount I then owed him—I think to the best of my recollection he delivered me an account at the time he made the application for some money—I then offered to give him a bill and a bill was brought up to me to accept which I did accept in presence of Mrs Grimes—the amount was 40l —this is the bill I accepted at that time—I did not accept two bills only this one COURT Q Did you at any time accept two bills of the same date and for the same amount 40l A No that I am sure of—I swear the prisoner made no application to me for payment of a second bill of 40l MR GIBBS Q Did Clifford after that bring an action against you for that bill A Yes sir in 1836 I think—the amount of that bill the debt and costs in that action were paid by Mr Austin my attorney—this is an affidavit I made in the cause—the signature is my hand-writing and the contents of it are true— read —This affidavit was dated the 6th of September 1838 in which the deponent swears that on or about the 14th of July 1836 she was detained in the Bench at the suit of Clifford and that the particulars of the plaintiff s demand 88l 10s and bill 40l was about the 20th of February paid to the plaintiff s attorney and that she never to the best of her recollection had any other transactions or accounts with Clifford and that she never to the best of her recollection or belief accepted any other bill for 40l but the one mentioned in the declaration Cross-examined by MR LORD Q It was in 1835 you employed the prisoner as your cook A Yes I went there in 1833 But it was not immediately after that I employed him—I did not give him the money when be first applied—I gave him one bill for 40l that was the whole of his claim on me at that time—I owed him no more money whatever—he did not give me a bill at that time to my recollection—I am sure no account was delivered to me at that time—I gave the bill on the 16th of December in the large room in the state-house—Mrs Grimes was present—the prisoner had had a cheque or two of mine two I think they were duly paid—every thing was paid at that time but that 40i —I had had frequent negotiation with him before this bill—I paid him generally in cash in small sums—I never accepted a bill before—I hive never given him a cheque since that time and all the cheques I gave him prior to that time have been duly paid to the prisoner—I know this cheque for 9l 4s 7d this was included in the money Mr Austin paid—it was all paid at that time—I am sure this was included—it is prior to December 1835—when I gave the bill Mrs Grimes was present—I don t know whether she read the bill—she was close to me it was at breakfast time about ten or half-past ten o clock—I am quite positive there was no other bill that I signed—I never gave any cheque as late at 1836 MR GIBBS Q Was this one of the cheques you gave previous to the 40l bill A Yes it is in October 1835—it was paid at the time of the reference to Mr Busby COURT Q Has Mr Austin indemnified you for the expense of this A No DANIEL EDWIN AUSTIN I paid the sum of 128l 10s to Mr Hudson—I had not a bill of exchange in the action Clifford versus Parker returned to me by Mr Hudson nor did I ask for the award—I have never had the bill from Clifford—I applied to him and Mr Hudson for it COURT Q You never received the bill of exchange on which this action was brought and which was the subject of the case referred A No the order of Nisi Prius was for all matters in difference—there was nothing said about another bill of exchange for 40l if there had it would have been embraced in the order GEOROIANA BEATRICE GRIMES I am a widow I reside at Blackheath—I resided with Lady Parker while she was in the Bench merely as her friend—I don t remember from what time I think it was about 1833 or 1834 I was there at the latter end of 1835—I remember the defendant calling on Lady Parker for the payment of his bill—I was present—I don t remember that I saw the amount of his claim—her ladyship gave him a bill of exchange to the amount of 40l —I saw Lady Parker write upon the bill—she did not give more than one bill—after that bill became due I saw the defendant upon it—he did not state to me then that he had two bills on Lady Parker to the same amount Cross-examined by MR LORD Q When the prisoner came to Lady Parker for this bill did he state what the amount of his claim was A I don t recollect that he did—he asked for the amount of his bill but dm not state the amount that I recollect—he did not talk long about the bill I don t think he was there ten minutes—he asked her if she could pay him his bill—she said she could not because she had an action pending against Lord Lake and till that was settled she could not pay him—he then asked her to give him a bill—she said yes—he went out and returned with the bill which I saw Lady Parker sign—I did not read the bill but I heard him say it was for 40l —he did not say there was more due—Lady Parker never gave any other bill that I know of neither before nor after—she has frequently given cheques—I don t know how she generally paid the prisoner THOMAS PROTHEROE I am a clerk in the Exchequer Writ Office—I produce an affidavit of debt in the cause of John Rafter against Fanny Parker—the writ is annexed to it JOHN THOMPSON I was articled to Mr Kirk Mr Clifford s late attorney He was solicitor in the cause of Rafter against Parker—the signature to this affidavit is the signature of Rafter—I think both the prisoner and Rafter came to the office to give instructions to pursue the action—the prisoner was repeatedly there—I cannot say whether he advanced any money to Mr Kirk I believe not Cross-examined by MR LORD Q Was Mr Kirk concerned in either of these actions A Yes he took Mr Rafter s retainer—this bill was often spoken of—I saw Mr Hudson repeatedly—in preparing the brief it was necessary to have all the papers—he stated he had a faint recollection of two bills but he had seen only one he thought the other one was about 10l —it was a small amount—I think two or three cheques had been given to the prisoner by Lady Parker after the award JAMES BUCKINGHAM I am an engineer and live in Camden-town I am a client of Mr Austin s and know him—in consequence of what he wished me to do on the 17th of January last I saw the prisoner I think it was in Braddam s-row Newington Causeway I believe it was his house or lodgings—I had received instruction that he was to be found there—I had never seen him before—he asked me if I was aware for what purpose I had come— he expected me to come to be a witness on the trial as Rafter s action was then going on —Mr Thompson took me there and introduced me to the prisoner as Mr Buckingham—the prisoner asked Thompson if I was the person whom he Thompson had mentioned to him—Thompson said Yes and that I was a friend of his and I had come relative to the matter of which they had been speaking—I asked the prisoner what it was he wanted me to do—he said I want you to swear that you went with Thompson to Pitt-street — it afterwards transpired that Rafter lived there —he said I must swear that I went with Thompson and presented the bill at Drummond s at Charing-cross—that I was to swear that the bill was not paid—that I then accompanied Thompson to lady Parker s house which he afterwards told me was No 13 Park-lane—he told me that was all he wished me to swear—he then addressed Thompson and told him that he must not only swear what I have mentioned he told me but that he went afterwards to the King s Bench by himself bringing the bill which had been dishonoured back to Lady Parker and that it was presented at Lady Parker s in Park-lane for payment—after seeing the prisoner in Braddam s-row I saw him at a coffee-shop in Newcastle-street Strand on the 28th of January—I had appointed to meet him there through Rafter whom I had met the previous morning—I was at the coffee-house before the prisoner was—he came in and wished me to accompany him to Mr Kirk who I believe was his attorney and was bringing that action—I was to go to have the evidence taken which he had detailed to me and he gave me this piece of paper as instructions to swear—he brought the paper written and I indorsed it within a few minutes—a person of the name of Jenkins was at the coffee-shop for the purpose of detecting this scheme—I read this paper over several times and asked the prisoner particularly if it was his writing—he acknowledged it to be his writing and said that was what he wished me to swear—he had previously said he would give me 10s if I would swear in the Court of Exchequer what he had stated and when he gave me this paper he said he would give me 14s The instructions were as follows — Went with Mr Thompson to Drummond s the bankers at Charing-cross to present bill of exchange 40l three months drawn on Parker paid to Mr Clifford endorsed over to Gibbs and paid to Rafter—have been at Rafter s house in Pitt-street have seen Gibbs there several times and know his hand-writing Cross-examined by MR LORD Q By whose request did you go to see the prisoner A Mr Austin s—he stated what he wanted me to go for—I had known Austin some time but never saw the prisoner till the 17th of January—I went to the house with Thompson and asked to see Mr Clifford—Thompson told me it was Mr Clifford and he assented to it—I neverperformed such a duty fox Austin before nor any one else—I asked the prisoner if I was to swear what he required what was I to have—he looked at Thompson and said I suppose we must give him the same at you have and then Clifford said he would give me 10s —I said it was very little and asked him when he should require me—he said the trial would come on on Monday and he should require me to be at the Exchequer in the City—I said I suppose Mr Rafter will pay me —Rafter was sitting there at the time—I asked who I was sitting in company with and the prisoner said That is Mr Rafter —I said Let me look at you stand up in case I should be asked I shall be able to recognise you —I said What is your height —he said Five feet six inches and three quarters —no money was paid me—I did not agree to perform this office I said If I did it —I never went by any other name than Buckingham—I have been an engineer four or five years under my own patent—I have lived in Camden-town since 1834—I was an agent before I was an engineer—I was never charged with any offence in a court of justice EDWARD JENKINS I am an appraiser and broker and live in Southampton-street I do the business of Covent-garden parish—I went at the request of Mr Austin to a coffee-shop in Newcastle-street but I cannot say when—I went by myself and met Mr Buckingham there—after he had been there some time the defendant came in and sat in the next box—the purport of my being there was to overbear what passed-a conversation took place between Clifford and Buckingham respecting a bill of exchange which Buckingham was to swear he had protested and Buckingham wanted to know what he was to be paid—Clifford said 10s —he said that would not pay him he must have more and Clifford agreed to give him 14s —he gave him a paper of instructions on which was written what he was to do—this is the paper—Buckingham read it over and said This I understand is what I am to do —Clifford said Yes —Buckingham then went out and I went immediately after—I was in Court when the cause came on to be tried and I heard the defendant deny that this paper was his writing most distinctly or that he had given it to any one Cross-examined Q Were you in the same room A Yes there were only us three—it is a small room—I did not speak at all—I was there half an hour—it was about eleven or twelve o clock—Thompson was not there I am certain For the defendant MR LORD called JACOB CASTELL I know the prisoner—I have seen him write but I do not know that I should be able to swear to his handwriting exactly- looking at the instructions —this paper looks like his writing—I have been employed by him to make out accounts occasionally—I have drawn several bills for him—I drew two bills between him and Lady Parker on the 16th of December 1835—I only drew the body of the bills—they were for 40l each—I put in the dates—the reason I drew them for Clifford was because his hand shook so—this is one of the bills— looking at it —I did not see the bill after it was drawn till it was shown to me before I was subpoenaed on the trial of Rafter against Parker—I was subpoenaed on the part of Rafter and gave evidence—I saw Mr Buckingham and had some conversation with him on the Monday evening four days before that trial—a person of the name of John Thompson came to my room and he took me to the Brace and introduced me to Buckingham—Thompson said This is Mr Buckingham he is going to corroborate my evidence on Thursday and we are all to be of one mind —I said I did not know what they were going to prove all I knew was I was the drawer of the bill that had been shown me and I was going to prove it—I said I drew two bills but whether they were accepted or not I did not know MR JAMES Q You drew two bills did you A Yes—the whole of this bill is my hand-writing except the signature of the drawer—I wrote the direction—Clifford did not sign it in my presence—I did not see it after it was drawn—one of the bills I drew that any was on a wrong stamp a stamp that would not carry the amount GUILTY — Confined One Month in Newgate and Transported for Seven Years

is a glass-cutter in Holborn—I owed him about 26l on the 27th of May—I have not dealt with him since—he sent me more than one lawyer s letter before the 27th of May—I cannot tell how many—everything has been turned out of my house and I cannot find anything to refer to—I think I received three letters—they were lawyer s letters from a Mr Eyre—I had dealt with Tucker many years—if he sent for money I sent what I could Q When did you first hear proceedings had been taken against you A The 17th of June was when the officers came to my house—I had been to Mr Tucker after receiving the lawyer

Tucker after that—I did not pay the money—I went to see Mr Eyre for the first time after the execution was put into my house—I did not after receiving the lawyer s letter expect to have a writ served

it before or after the officers came to your house that you first went to Mr Tucker and his lawyer A After—I had written to Tucker several times after receiving the lawyer s letter and told him my circumstances but did not see him before the officers took away my goods and did not till then know he had issued a writ against me BENJAMIN GOODMAN I know the defendant very well I have frequent seen him write and know his handwriting—I believe the signature R Shearing to this affidavit to be his handwriting also this other In the first affidavit dated the 4th of June the defendant deposed that on the 27th of May he personally served Collins with a true copy of a writ of summons at the suit of William Henry Tucker in the second affidavit on the 21st of June he deposed that on the 27th of May he went in company of William Eyles of Parker-street Little Queen-street with his horse and cart to Bushy and in company with the said Eyles applied at the house of Collins and saw a young female who said Collins was not at home but would be about eight or nine o clock in the evening and that about a quarter to nine a person was pointed out to them as Collins who was coming home that he in the presence of Eyles addressed the said person as George Collins asked if that was his name and served him with the copy of the writ which he took and put into his pocket saying They may do as they like that he and Eyles followed the person and saw him go into Collins s house that on the 8th of June he served Collins with a copy of notice of declaration being filed in the cause by delivering the same to a female who he believed to be Collins s wife at his house that he asked her if Collins was at home to which she replied that he was not upon which he gave her the notice open desiring her to give it to Collins immediately on his return ELIZA COLLINS I am the wife of George Collins and live with him—I never saw the prisoner In the latter end of May my husband was engaged at Mr Delahunt s—the

saw the prisoner in my life before to-day Cross-examined Q What makes you recollect the 27th of May at all A I call it back to mind—when the officers entered the house they told me that was the day the writ was served by counting the days back—I made an affidavit with my husband before the Judge—I knew my husband was in difficulties—there were not several applications for money—I do not know that I received any letters to give to my husband my May—I will swear that on the 8th of June I did not receive any letter for him—there might or might not be a letter on the 7th of June—I cannot swear there was none on the 6th—I might have received a letter for him on the 9th of May—I am sure I took none in on the 8th nor any thing of the kind—I always open his letters if he is out and if he opens them I know the contents—we have no servant—I can swear I never had a letter delivered to me about that time and never saw the prisoner—I remember being at home on the 8th of June—I am always at home except on Sunday—my second daughter is about nine years old MR JONES Q You and your daughter are always at home A Always—my second daughter and the other children never take letters and papers in—I or my eldest daughter always go to the door—I am quite sure the prisoners never left any paper EMMA COLLINS I am the prosecutor s daughter and live with him at Bushy My mother or myself always take in letters or papers brought for my father—my little sister and brothers have nothing to do with them—I do not know the prisoner at all—I never saw him at my father house—he made no inquiry about my father nor gave me any letters or papers for him GEORGE HENRY DENHAM I am apprentice to Mr Collins of Bushy and live in his house I remember master begning engaged on a job at Mr Delahunt s—I worked with him there on the 27th of May—I am sure he Was engaged there that day and had been working there before—this was The last day—I remember leaving leaving master s house with him that morning About five o clock and we went to Mr Delahunt s—we remained there till between seven and eight that evening—it is about a mile or more from master s—we came straight home together—he was not out of my sight for any time that day nor as we were coming home—our breakfast was brought to us and our dinner we took with us—we had what we eat at Mr Delahunt s—I walked home with master—I did not see any body give him a paper or writ and can swear they did not as I was with him all the while—they could not do it without my seeing it nor when we got to the house—when I got home I had supper and went to bed—master did the same—I have never seen the prisoner before to-day and am quite certain he did not serve my master with a write or paper on the evening of the 27th of May as we came home Cross-examined Q Is your apprenticeship out A No—I cannot say when I was first told I should be wanted a a witness—I think it was in the course of June I was told I should be wanted here—I was not told what for—master told me I should be wanted—he said there had been a person who said he had served him with a writ on the 27th of May and he had not—master mentioned the 27th of May and asked if I remembered that day and said We were obliged to finish Delahunf house that day —I remembered it perfectly and have ever since—I did not leave master all that day nor in the evening to go any where—we had tea when we went home between eight and nine o clock—I have made an affidavit about this before BENJAMIN GOODMAN re-examined I live at No 82 Cornwall-road Lambeth and am a general agent—I have known the prisoner three or four years and knew one Hathaway about the same time—Hathaway used to be in the office of Mr Beetham No 1 New-inn St Clements s—he practised occasionally as an attorney but had not a certificate In June last I received a letter from Hathaway by post—I went next morning in conesquence of that to the Sugar Loaf Bell-yard I think it was on the 25th of June it was Saturday—I there saw Hathaway-Sheanng came in a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes with Mr Ashley who is in Court now—I have also seen Hathaway here-Shearing said he wished to see me privately—he looked into the parlour—there was a lad cleaning some lamps—he said This will not do we must go into another room —he looked into the tap-room—there being no person there he said This will do and said to me I have got an affidavit Goodman that I want you to swear to I may as well put 5s into your pocket as any one else s and produced a written paper which was the draft of an affidavit— he took it away—I handed it back to him —I read it three times over—the outline of it was that I had driven him down in my horse and cart and saw him personally serve Mr George Collins with a writ of summons at Bushy in Hertfordshire—it went on to say that he did on a particular day serve Collins &c —I asked him if he wished to get me transported because that was the right way to do it if I made any such affidavit—he said Oh well if you won t earn 5s I must get some one else for it must be done this particular day and reading over the affidavit enabled me to carry in my recollection the name of the defendant Collins—I returned him the paper writing —I then left Hathaway Ashley and Shearing drinking—I saw they were very much chopfallen at my refusal Q Who was A Ashley—I believe he practises as an attorney occasionally in the name of somebody not caring who I believe—I first knew Ashley from being on an Election for East Surrey—I left them and wrote Collins a letter the same day giving him information of what was to be done and he called on me on Monday—I do not know Eyles and had nothing more than a casual acquaintance with the defendant—this is the letter I wrote to Collins— looking at it Cross-examined Q How often have you seen Collins since the Monday A Not more than two or three times Mr Garey of Chancery-lane was his attorney—I did not know Garey until I called on him with Collins—we went there together with his wife—I attend to various sorts of business nettling people s private affairs—when a man is in difficulties he wants an agent—I never put a man in difficulties—I have occasionally served writs—I do not think I have served above ten or twelve in my life—I served one in the cause of Ashley against Somers—I was in the Exchequer before Mr Baron Parke to prove the service and I did prove it—I beg pardon—I did not serve it in that case I employed a man to do it—I was not called to prove the service—Marks served the writ—if I said I proved it it was in the hurry of the moment—I have been examined in Court on two civil cases never in a criminal Court—Ashley and Somers was the last—the jury did not say they would not believe a word I swore—the verdict was the other way—the action was for bill of costs and the doubt was whether they were not entitled to part of the costs—I did not hear Mr Baron Parke say it was a question whether they would believe me—they did not say they did not believe what I said—I swear that to the best of my knowledge—I never heard it said to the best of my recollection—I was in Court when they returned their verdict—I was in the case of Loyson against M Carthy—I was examined by Mr Coe as to what evidence I could give—I do not recollect telling him I could prove no partnership existed or anything of the kind because I knew them to be partners—I have no recollection of calling on Ashby at Searle s-place Chancery-lane—I do not know such a person—I did not go and say the plaintiff had not kept his word by giving me a guinea a day—I swore that a partnership existed—Layson and all the parties wanted me to swear to the contrary—they offered me 5l or 10l —Coe himself offered me 5l —I never swore a false affidavit in my life—I never had such an offer before—I have good friends if I want a guinea I can hare it and have good property at least my father has—my father is in the deeds now for contempt of the Court of Chancery in not assigning the deeds of his property he will ultimately recover the whole—he has been in the Fleet three years and ten years in confinement altogether—I swear it is not twenty nor fifteen years—he does not support me—I support myself—I do his business preparing his petitions and taking him up by habeas and pleading his cause which I have done many times before the ViceChancellor—I do not receive money from him—he can pay 20s in the pound but got involved in various suits—I never said I was a tar-barrel merchant—I said I had bought some casks for one Blenkenhall MR JONES Q Have you ever been indicted for perjury or charged with false swearing A Never in my life The order of the Court of Exchequer on reading the affidavit That the defendant s application to set aside the appearance &c in the cause be refused with costs was here put in ELIZA COLLINS re-examined Q Did any man deliver to you on the 8th of June or any day after the 27th of May an open paper desiring you to give it to your husband on his return A No nor did I promise any man to give a paper to him on his return MR BALLANTINE to GEO COLLINS Q When did you prefer this bill A Last sessions—I have not since applied to the Court to set the proceedings against me aside—I have made no affidavit since last Session—I do not know that my attorney has applied to set the proceedings aside GUILTY —Aged 42 Confined One Month and Transported for Seven Years

book in which the entries of the judgments appear—there has been a judgment signed in the cause of Watts against Wittenbury on the 27th of Aug 1842 it was signed on a Judge s order and has since been struck out by a Judge s order—I have the order here—S H Williams appears to be the attorney Cross-examined by MR HORRY Q That is merely a book in which you make memorandums of judgments A That is the only book in which judgments were entered at that time MR CLARKSON Q Is that the proceeding upon which the plaintiff was at liberty to issue execution A Yes certainly—after an order was made to erase it it would be impossible to make out a judgment-roll SAMUEL GIBBS I am one of Mr Justice Cresswell s clerks—I produce an order of Lord Denman in the cause of Watts and Wittenbury —it was ordered to be impounded by Mr Justice Cresswell before whom the case was heard on a motion to set aside the judgment—on hearing the proceedings he ordered the summonses orders and affidavits to be impounded which I produce The documents being read were as follows —An order dated 26th of Aug 1842 stating that upon hearing the attorneys or agents on both sides and by consent upon payment of 5l due from the defendant to the plaintiff together with 3l agreed costs forthwith all further proceedings should be stayed that in case of default the plaintiff should be at liberty to sign final judgment with all costs —A summons of Mr Justice Patteson dated the 5th of Sept 1842 for the plaintiff to attend chambers to show cause why the judgment should not be set aside the said order having been fraudulently obtained &c &c —Also an order of Mr Justice Cresswell dated the 16th of Sept 1842 on hearing counsel for the plaintiff and the attorney or agent for the defendant and reading the affidavits directing

Cross-examined Q You have no recollection of any of the parties who attended the summons A Yes—I do not know Mr Williams the attorney I saw his clerk—I cannot say whether I did or did not see the prisoner—I can only speak to two gentlemen one of whom was very much pockmarked and the other gentleman I see here now MR CLARKSON Q Do not you recollect Mr Horry attending for the plaintiff A Mr Hony did attend during the vacation—I do not know whether it was in this case or not GODFREY FIRSBY City police-inspector I have known the prisoner three years—he was in my division of the police about ten months—I have seen him write and believe this affidavit to be his handwriting Cross-examined Q Where have you seen him write A In signing the pay-sheets when I have paid him his salary—he signed two sheets a week—I paid him every other week—sometimes persons do receive money for other parties but then they sign their own names as receiving it for the person—I have seen him sign his name—that is my only meant of knowing his writing—I should say the signature to this affidavit was his The affidavit of the prisoner which was dated the 13th of Sept deposed that on the 26th of Aug he accompanied Wittenbury whom he knew to the office of Samuel Hanson Williams No 5 Charlotte-place Woolwich and that he the prisoner delivered a summons to stay and pay forth with when he saw Williams and hit clerk which Mr Williams agreed to and indorsed on the summons such consent accordingly together with 3l costs—that he the prisoner and Wittenbury went to London drew up the order and served the same at the

builder and live at Blackheath—I bought a horse of a person named Watts—I paid for it but there was 5l left to see whether the horse turned out right and if it did I was to pay it but it turned out very bad indeed and I never paid the 5l —I was served with this copy of a writ of summons on the 16th of Aug —I handed it next morning to my attorneys Messrs Forsyth and Rivolta to defend the action—I ascertained from them that by the practice of the Court of Queen s Bench no proceedings could be taken on that writ of summons until after the 24th of Oct —I never heard one word either of or from the plaintiff or his attorney from the time I received the copy of the writ of summons until my person was taken in execution by Joshua Morris the sheriff s officer—in order to prevent my being detained in prison I paid the amount 12l 10s to the officer for which he afterwards brought me a receipt—next morning I instructed my attorneys to search the office and ascertain how this had happened and to take out summonses to set aside the judgment—I was present at the hearing of the summons on the 16th of Sept before Mr Justice Cresewell—Mr Horry appeared for Watts—the affidavits of Junes Simmers and Williams were read—I do not know whether there was say affidavit of Watts—I never saw the defendant until I saw him in this Court to-day—he never accompanied me on the 26th of last Aug or at any other time to the office of Mr Samuel Hanson Williams—I never saw William to my knowledge—the prisoner never did in my presence or to my knowledge either on the 26th of Aug or on any other occasion deliver any summons in the action of Watts and Wittenbury to Williams to stay and pay forthwith or my summons of any sort or kind whatever—this copy of the writ of summons is all I received—no such interview took place—Williams did not in my presence or to my knowledge aft my request of with my consent agree and consent to any such summons in that or any other action nor did Williams to my knowledge at hit office or in my presence indorse on the summons such consent—I never was at his office—I lever agreed to pay the amount of the debt and 3l or any sum of money for costs in the action I never accompanied the defendant or went out of his company to London and drew up any order in that action to stay and pay forth with or any other outer—I never went with or without the prisoner nor did any person to my knowledge serve any order whatever at Williams s office on his clerk or any other person either at has office or any other place at that or any other time—I never in the prisoner s presence or absence expressed to Williams his clerk or any other person my gratitude that the case was settled or say that the amount should be paid that night—I never used any expressions to that effect either there or anywhere else—Friday is the market-day at Chelmsford—in Aug last I was engaged in erecting a pump-room and other buildings for Mr Forsyth at Hockley in Essex which is thirty-six miles from White Chapel church—on Wednesday night the 24th of Aug I slept at the White Hart at Hawkwell which is the adjoining parish to Hockley—I returned on Thursday night to sleep at the same place—on Friday morning the 26th of Aug I breakfasted at the White-hart at Hawkwell with Mr Parr the lands lord and after breakfast I accompanied Mr Parr in his cart to Chelmsford—we got there about twelve o clock—we dined together at an eating house in Chelmsford about half-past one—after dinner we went into the market about buying some sheep—I left Chelmsford to come to Leaden shout half past four by the coach that goes to the train—Mr Parr accompanied me to the coach—we never parted company the whole day—I came by the coach to Brentford and then by the railway—I got to London about half-past six—I have never had any communication whatever either before or since my arrival in London either with the prisoner or Williams or Simmers his clerk Cross-examined Q I believe you have indicted Simmers A Yes and Williams separately for perjury—I was present at the hearing of the summons and saw you there—I do not know Williams—I saw a person who answered to the name of Simmers sign his name on the back of the summons—I do not know hew many affidavits were sworn on my part—I only swore to my own—Mr Eager chief clerk to Messrs Forsyth and Rivolta was present and he explained to the Judge—I cannot say whether an affidavit of sis was read—I do not know whether it was or not—I saw the Judge read mine—I saw my name on it—he looked at several affidavits besides mine affidavits that you brought I suppose— On reference to the order it appeared to be drawn up on reading the affidavits of Wittenbury Williams Simmers and the prisoner —John Watts is the person who sued me as I suppose—his name is on the copy of the writ of summons—I was taken in execution on Monday the 29th of August and I immediately paid the sheriff s officer three 5l notes—he did not have me in custody more than a quarter of an hour—I was taken at my own house at Blackheath sitting at tea with my family and I went next morning before ten o clock to Messrs Forsyth and Rivolta—I intended to go before the Judge directly with the clerk and the matter was put off for a week on a something about filing affidavits at the request of the other side—I went into Essex on the Wednesday morning by coach from the Bull Inn Aldgate—I have a very large job at Hockley and generally go there once week—the job has been in progress about three months and a fortnight from the present time—I have been there several times since the 26th of August but not so often lately because the job is drawing to a close—I went frequently before the 26th—I did not always go on one particular day in the week—it depended on what business I had there whether my employers the architect or the foreman of the works wanted me there—I always slept at home when I was not on that job that being the only country one I had then—I went there on the Wednesday in question in consequence of a letter I received from the architect Mr Lockie of No 19 Southampton-street Fitzroy-square to meet him there—I have the letter at home in my iron chest—I saw it yesterday—I looked at it specially—I mostly have letters when I go down—I had been down the week before in consequence of a disturbance with my men—I should say I had been down every week from the beginning of the job—I do not keep a diary—my book will show the days I go down into the country—I have not got it here—it is kept at Hockley and when I go down I sign my expenditure—I have not shown that book to anybody else—I have since looked at it COURT Q Did you look at it to refresh your memory as to the days on which you were down there A Yes MR HORRY Q When did you do that last A About a fortnight age—when I go down I square the accounts with my foreman and that bears the date of the day on which I come down and the day on which I return—that book would tell me the days I was there and when I departed—I know a person of the name of Munyard—I never saw him but a few times in my life—it was Munyard that served this notice on me—I never spoke to him before that—I have not indicted him for a conspiracy—I have casually heard that he is indicted here JOSEPH FREDERICK COLEMAN re-examined The Judge attends in Chambers two days in the week Tuesdays and Fridays from eleven o clock until the business is disposed of—that sometimes happens to be as late as four or half-past four or it might be five o clock CURRY I am one of the officers of the Lord Chief Justice of the Court of Queen s Bench This order is dated the 26th of August—at that time I should think none of the Judges of the Queen s Bench were in town—the summons would have been attended at eleven o clock in the forenoon in vacation—the order in this case would have been by consent consequently they would not have gone before a Judge—they might be before a Judge as late as half-past three—we are very seldom so late as six—the Chief Justice very seldom attends so late—I should say they could not be before a Judge later than half-past three or four Cross-examined Q Sometimes one Judge attends at chambers and sometimes another during the circuit A Yes—we are never certain of any Judge in particular—I should say Lord Denman was not in town at this time—he certainly was not at chambers—half-past three o clock is the usual time of leaving JAMES M MILLAN I attend from the office of the Sheriff of Kent I produce a writ of summons dated the 16th of August 1842 issued at the apparent instance of Watts against Wittenbury—it was lodged at the office on the 27th of August last—I took it in—I forwarded the writ ca-sa issued upon that to Joshua Morris the officer by post JOSHUA MORRIS I am one of the officers of the Sheriff of Kent I arrested the person of Mr Wittenbury by virtue of a warrant on that writ which I produce on the 29th of August at his own house—the writ was satisfied by the payment of 12l 11s according to the endorsement on the writ—the charges were 10l 15s the levy a guinea for officers fee 10s 6d poundage and 4s 6d discharge money—that was paid to me at once—I afterwards attended the Judges chambers on the hearing of this summons to set aside the proceedings—I saw the prisoner for the first time at the chambers that day—in consequence of the Judge s order I afterwards paid back the 12l 11s I had received to Messrs Forsyth and Rivolta Cross-examined Q I do not understand you to say that you saw the prisoner before the Judge A No not in the apartment where his Lordship was but in the hall of the chambers—I do not know Mr Samuel Hanson Williams of Woolwich—his name is not very well known about Woolwich—I never heard his name—he does not live at No 5 Charlotte-place—Mun-yard lives there—I know Munyard perfectly well—he was before the Judge the second time—I do not know that he was there the first time COURT Q Then are we to understand that Williams does not live when he describes himself to live but that Munyard does live there A Munyard lives at the place named in this writ and I never heard of Mr Williams residing there at all—I did not see Munyard at the chambers at the time I was ordered to repay the money—I know his person very well—Mr Williams was not there—Simmers his clerk attended for him—I never saw the prisoner till I saw him there and never afterwards till he was brought in before his Lordship to be committed on the warrant for this indictment—I happened to be at chambers that day—I saw him in conversation with Simmers in the hall when the order was made by the Judge to discharge these proceedings—Mr Eager was there and Mr Wittenbury STEPHEN PARR In August last I kept the White Hart at Hawk well in Essex—I know Mr Wittenbury—I recollect his going to Chelmsford market with me perfectly well—it was on Friday the 26th of August—he had slept at my house the night before Thursday and also on Wednesday night—he dined with me on the Thursday at Rochester market—he breakfasted along with me on Friday morning and after breakfast we went together in my horse and cart to Chelmsford market—we got there about eleven o clock and dined at an eating-house close by the Black Boy at Chelmsford—after dinner we went into the market together and did business—I bought eight sheep—I do not believe Mr Wittenbury was absent from me ten minutes all day till I saw him on the coach—I am not able to say the name of the coach but I went to the coach-office and saw him go off by the coach that went from Chelmsford about half-past four o clock as near as I can guess—I do not remember his being away from me all day—I do not believe he was absent from me ten minutes—he went to market with me and continued with me Cross-examined Q Does Mr Wittenbury always sleep at your house when he comes down to that part A He always did at the time I had the house—I have known him ever since he has been building Hockley Spa not longer when he came down to see after his men—I am not able to say how often I have seen him in the course of a month—I forget whether or not he was at my house the week before—he was there in Sept —I was not there in Nov —I left the house then—he did not send me word when he was coming down—he used to come down to see after his business—I never kept any particular account of his coming or going but that day the 26th of Aug I noticed his going to market with me and doing business there which my market-book will show—he has been with roe at other markets but never at Chelmsford market except that one day—I did not make a memorandum in my book that he accompanied me to Chelmsford market that day—I have frequently done business at Chelmsford market—at different times—I cannot say whether or not he has been at my house on other market days besides the 26th of Aug —I know he was with me on the 26th—he has been with me at different times before and since then—I have here a copy from my market book of the purchase of cattle I made that day—I cannot say when I was first applied to to become a witness—I think it was about a fortnight ago—I had a subpoena and was not able to attend—I had received notice of this trial before that—I recollect some time in Sept Mr Wittenbury asking me what day of the month it was that he went to Chelmsford market with me—he never said anything at all about his being arrested—I went and looked at my market-book and said On the 26th of Aug sir —he said Very well I don t know whether I am likely to get into trouble or not abort that day and that was all he laid to me about it—I was not applied to to make an affidavit at that time MR CLARKSON Q Do you recollect sending up to Messrs Forsyth and Rivolta a statement of what you could prove A Yes—this is it— looking at a paper —it is not my writing but this is my signature to it—it is dated the 39th of Sept —that was about the time Mr Wittenbury first communicated to me GUILTY — Confined Six Months and Transported for Seven Years 
t18430130-589  589 HENRY SIMMERS was indicted for wilful and corrupt perjury MR CLARKSON conducted the Prosecution WALTER KERTON I am a clerk in the Judgment-office of the Court of Queen s Bench I produce the book in which judgments are signed in the Court of Queen s Bench—I have an entry of a judgment signed in an action of Watts against Wittenbury on the 27th of August 1842 MR PRENDERGAST Q Did you make the entry A No Mr Barlow the first clerk did—I can swear to his handwriting—I am the second clerk MR CLARKSON Q Are you always present at the signing of judgments in the judgment-office A I am in no other office—I am in the habit of signing judgments—I am always in the habit of being in the office when they are signed unless I might be called out—Mr Barlow is now in attendance at the office—I can fetch him—this judgment has since been set aside on a Judge s order dated 16th of September—this is the order—I did not sign the reversal of the judgment—it was struck out by Mr Barlow—I will not undertake to say that I was present when it was struck out—it is very likely the judgment-paper might be signed by me Cross-examined by MR PRENDERGAST Q Supposing I want to sign judgment at your office I bring with me a piece of paper called a judgment-paper do I not A Yes in this case it would be necessary and we copy from the judgment-paper into the book—the book is a copy of the judgment-paper—we make the entry from the judgment-paper—a judgment-roll is also brought—we merely require an incipitor on that—we stamp the judgment-roll—the contents of the judgment-paper and the judgment-roll are identical—an incipitor on the judgment-paper and an incipitor on the judgment-roll is all that is required—we sign judgment on that—we always ask for the judgment-paper—that is our authority because we write on that—we stamp the judgment-paper—we mark the day of the month—we stamp the judgment-roll with the same stamp that we stamp the judgment-paper with—the impression is Queen s Bench Judgment-office —it is the stamp of our office—we make the entry in the book from that paper we take care to have it correct from the judg-ment-paper—they do not always go to far as the amount on the judgment-roll —the judgment-paper contains all that there is in this entry—I do not think it contains more generally speaking—the entry would be a copy of the judgment-paper—it is copied from it—in the body of the judgment-paper they do not always have the name of the town attorney therefore we take the name of the attorney who signs the judgment—when final judgment issues we should give a number—we want that on the judgment-paper—we do not care about its being on the roll—the number-roll is asked for and the number is placed on the judgment-paper—we have a docket-roll and the attorney would ask for a number-roll I write his name over the number and he takes the judgment-paper—every term we have a docket commencing with No 1 and going up as high as 5000 that enables me to get at these records afterwards—to the best of my knowledge executions are issued in ten cases out of twelve without the judgment-roll being filed—I believe in order to procure execution it is requisite to produce the judgment-paper but I do not belong to that office—it is not necessary to produce my book to get execution COURT Q Because you have already stamped the judgment-paper A Yes MR PRENDERGAST Q The judgment-roll in the first place has the seal of the Court of Queen s Bench on it before it is written on A Yes before it is completed—judgment-rolls are sold by a particular stationer named Dun-combe—I believe he is appointed to sell them in order that they may be all of one size—he sells them to different stationers—I should not stamp them unless I saw his mark on them at the time which is Delivered by Dun-combe or something to that effect—I do not recollect exactly but I know it so well seeing the name of the gentleman it is so constantly under my eye—the Exchequer-rolls are very much larger and have Exchequer-office on the top MR CLARKSON Q Did you produce this book the other day in the Queen s Bench A Yes—here was an objection made to it COURT Q What is the name of the office in which you are concerned A The Judgment-office and this book is called the Judgment-book—we are appointed under the masters of the Court of Queen s Bench Q What is the act done which is called the signing judgment A The production of the judgment-paper and the judgment-roll our entry is that book the writing on the judgment-paper the stamping and taking it away and that is considered judgment signed MR CLARKSON Q You are asked what is the act of signing judgment A Why the entering in this book COURT Q After the production of the judgment-roll and paper A Yes which are severally stamped by the office seal of the judgment-office—this judgment was signed on the 27th of August I think—the entry is London John Watts against James Wittenbury for 8l —35s —set aside by J O which means Judge s order dated the 16th of September —then there is the number of the roll the attorney s name and the fee 7s MR CLARKSON Q Is this proceeding at your office on the authority of the judgment-paper and roll what is in the profession termed the act of signing the judgment A Yes the whole proceeding MR PRENDERGAST Q How is the record made up A I do not know that is not my office—it is not made up from the roll—they take it from some form—that would not be on the judgment-paper—it would be copied from some books COURT Q To whom are the judgment-roll and papers delivered after this entry is made in your book A To the plaintiff s attorney immediately to the party signing the judgment—the judgment-paper is prepared by the party signing judgment—it is prepared on the part of the plaintiff—it is returned to the plaintiff s attorney to enable him by that voucher to show to the Seal-office that judgment has been signed in my book—the master marks the costs in the judgment-paper and that is the authority to the sealer—the signing judgment is the entry in my book—the judgment-paper is returned to the party signing judgment—they would require it to issue execution—it is my certificate that judgment is signed in my book SAMUEL GIBBS I am clerk to Mr Justice Cresswell I produce an original order of the Chief Justice of the Queen s Bench ordered by Mr Justice Cresswell to be impounded MR PRENDERGAST Q Were you present when it was signed by Lord Denman A No MR CLARKSON Q Did Mr Justice Cresswell hear the summons for setting aside this order A Yes—I also produce the summons purporting to be issued by Mr Justice Patteson—that was heard before Mr Justice Cressswell—this order of Lord Denman s bears Mr Justice Cresswell s endorsement to be impounded C C which means Cresswell Cresswell —the endorsement on this order Order Judgment set aside with costs C C is also his Q Then it appears that Mr Justice Cresswell heard the summons because he has made an order on it A Yes and there is a previous endorsement adjourned for a month —the last on which I acted was this Order Judgment set aside with costs C C —it was on that the order to impound was made—this is the original order of Mr Justice Cresswell—it is the order that followed the hearing of the summons—it is my own handwriting— This was dated 16th of Sept 1842 on hearing the counsel for the plaintiff and the attorney or agent for the defendant and on reading the affidavits of Wittenbury Egan Watts Williams Simmers and James ordering the judgment to be set aside with costs also the writ of ca sa issued upon the said judgment and directing that the Sheriff of Kent should pay back to the defendant the sum of 12l 11s levied by virtue of the said writ Cross-examined Q Were you present when the summons was heard before Mr Justice Cresswell A I was not—Mr Coleman was—the order was brought out immediately to me and put into my hands JOSEPH FREDERICK COLEMAN I am clerk to Mr Justice Cresswell I was present on his lordship directing that order to be made—I was present when this case was heard on the summons of Mr Justice Patteson—I was not present the whole time—I was in and out of the room—the endorsement by Mr Justice Cresswell on Lord Denman s order to be impounded was written in my presence given to me by his lordship and carried by me to Mr Gibbs directly upon which he drew up the order which I produce JAMES CURRIE I am one of the clerks of Lord Denman This is an original order of his—I drew it up—I cannot say whether I delivered it out—the 26th of Aug was in vacation time—Lord Denman would not be at chambers then—the clerks stay till about three o clock not later—sometimes we keep the orders by consent not always—I should say we have not kept any by consent in this case—I have made due search and have found none—there must have been some consent in writing produced to me purporting to be the defendant s consent—such an order as this would not be granted by any representation exparte Cross-examined by MR PRENDERGAST Q Did you fill up this order A I did—it was not actually signed by Lord Denman—it is a seal—it is sanctioned by his lordship—Lord Denman authorised this—I am not prepared to say how he authorized it—I am not his private clerk and never have communication with him—Lord Denman was not in town at the time—the order is my writing Q Just see whether that 3l agreed is your handwriting or not A I should say not now I look at it—I drew the order but I do not think I put in these words—I should not like to swear it—I do not believe the word agreed to be my writing COURT Q What are the words you doubt about A 3l in figures and the word agreed —the following words together with costs are in print—I believe the 3l is not my handwriting but I could not swear it—I speak more particularly to the word agreed —it appears to me to be a different ink thicker and darker—the g is rather of a peculiar form—that is the reason why I doubt it to be my writing—I should say it was not MR PRENDERGAST Q Lord Denman was not present nor knew any thing at all about this proceeding A Certainly not—he never was cognisant of it—he is very seldom at chambers—it is not customary for him to draw up orders and sign them in the presence of parties by consent—I never understood that it was necessary that the Judge should be present at the time of signing the summons or by consent—he sometimes signs consent orders in blank—orders of this description are not signed by his lordship—he does not personally attend to any such order as this—his lordship was not acquainted with the fact at all not being at chambers MR CLARKSON Q Does this bear the impression of my Lord s stamp kept at chambers for the purpose of stamping orders of this description A Yes—it has been duly issued out of his chambers by me COURT Q Have you authority to issue such an order bearing his stamp without consulting him on the merits of the application A I have always given them as a matter of course—I have no communication with his lordship personally—I always understood I was acting on sufficient authority when I gave orders on these forms—I am not the principal clerk MR CLARKSON Q You do not seem to be quite sure whether this word agreed was written by you A I am not sure—I believe it has been added by somebody since—I should not like to swear it Q And the striking out of the words taxed and do you believe that to be your striking out A If I inserted the figures 3l I should have struck those words out—it would then have stood with 3l costs to be paid instead of taxed and to be paid —I rather think the 3l is my writing but the word agreed has been introduced by somebody else—I draw up perhaps forty or fifty orders by consent at chambers in the course of a week—they are all drawn up in the same way stamped in the same form quite irrespective of the fact whether my lord happened to be in chambers or not—I am authorized to swear affidavits—I am a commissioner and administer an oath COURT Q Look at that again and say from the knowledge of your own handwriting whether you have now any doubt whether that word agreed was written by you A I have a doubt as to the word agreed but I should not like to swear it—it is not the usual character of my handwriting—I should not suffer any one else to introduce writing into orders drawn up by me—I should not like to say that the word was introduced since the order was issued but yet I have a doubt—I should not like to say positively—on looking at it more closely I believe that the figures 3l are mine—I have a doubt as to the word agreed —I am not positive—I do not know that I should have entertained a doubt had not my attention been drawn to it—these orders are printed forms leaving a portion in blank to be filled up—it is the only form of order we have for this purpose—these are what we call orders to stay on payment of debt and costs—that is not the only order we issue we have many others Q Do you issue any order except an order that purports to proceed on consent of the parties without consulting the Lord Chief Justice A Yes on affidavit of service and non-attendance—they are orders which are deemed matters of course on certain forms being complied with—we keep printed forms for such purposes with Lord Denman s signature attached by a stamp which is a fac-simile of his handwriting Q The chambers of the Lord Chief Justice are considered as an office and on complying with certain forms such orders would be issued A Yes—I have known orders of this description to be issued from his lordship s chambers as a matter of course for five or six years and orders generally for ten years within my own knowledge—I cannot say how long we have issued these orders—I have always understood that the signature was stamped upon them by his lordship s approbation and that I was acting under his authority in issuing them or I should not have given them—I think this form of order has been placed in my control about five or six years—Mr Thornton his lordship s private clerk gave me the orders for the purpose of being issued from time to time MR CLARKSON Q If his lordship were at chambers and the parties before him would an order of his by consent be drawn up on a paper bearing his stamped signature A I should have done so and have done so when his lordship has been at chambers—such orders as these are never granted but by consent—I do not know the date of the Act legalising these orders— This order was dated the 26th of August 1842 and stated that upon hearing the attornies and agents on both sides and by consent upon payment of 5l due from the plaintiff to the defendant together with 3l agreed costs all further proceedings should be stayed and that in default the plaintiff should be at liberty to sign final judgment with costs THOMAS BARLOW I am first clerk in the Judgment-office—the act of signing judgment consists of copying the venue the plaintiff s and defendant s names the sum judgment is signed for the costs if there are any at the time and the attorney s name who signs the judgment who is the plaintiff s attorney—it is copied into this book which is called the day-book of the office of the judgments and other entries—it is generally called the judgment-book—I signed the judgment in the cause of Watts against Wittenbury—I afterwards struck it out by virtue of a Judge s order—this is as it originally stood London John Watts against James Wittenbury for 8l debt and 35s costs Judgment on promises pursuant to order —London is the venue—Watts and Wittenbury are the plaintiff s and defendant s names—it is signed by S H Williams on the 27th August 1842—I struck out the words pursuant to order —that was entered by authority of a Judge s order—we do not copy the Judge s name—the words I wrote before I struck them out are J T a that is for assumpsit either on promises or the case p for pursuant t o for to order —that imports that the plaintiff s attorney brought a Judge s order at the time—the judgment was signed on the responsibility of the plaintiff s attorney—all judgments are signed on the responsibility of the plaintiff s attorney—I have since then struck out the whole of that with my own hands because they gave me the order to look at and the order said it should be struck out—I have no doubt this is the order on which I struck out that judgment—we took possession of the order and filed it in the office—I did not put any mark on it when I executed it—we kept the original—perhaps the plaintiff s attorney may have borrowed it with an undertaking to return it to tax costs Cross-examined by MR PRENDERGAST Q You filed the order whatever it was A I did—I have no doubt that we took possession of it at the time—we put them into a pigeon-hole and when the pigeon-hole is full we file them—that order would be got from my custody on the plaintiff s attorney applying for it and giving an undertaking to return it—I cannot say whether or not that order is in our office now—I heard that the clerk was subpœnaed to bring the order with him and I left it to him—he told me that they wanted the book but said nothing about the order—I do not know that the order has ever left the office COURT Q Did you or not strike out this judgment by some Judge s order A Yes—I should not have done it without an order was produced MR PRENDERGAST Q How can you tell it was a Judge s order A Because I read it before I struck the judgment out—signing the judgment consists in the person s bringing a roll and a judgment-paper—this is a Queen s Bench roll—it is stamped by the stationer—he delivers them by order of the Court of Queen s Bench—it is stamped and delivered by William Duncombe stationer Lincoln s-Inn—I make my entry in the book from the judgment paper—the judgment-paper has the damages that judgment is signed for on it—it is longer than the roll in that respect—the damages could not be on the judgment-roll without they completed the roll—it could not go so far as that—this is an incipitor on it—it contains the venue the plaintiffs and defendant s names and the nature of the action—there is the same in the judgment-paper with the addition of the damages—there is every thing on the judgment-paper that there is in my book—my book is copied from it—my book does not contain anything of the pleadings nor does the judgment-paper—the judgment-paper contains the venue the plaintiff s and defendant s names the nature of the action and the damages—after making the entry I put the seal to the judgment-paper—that is the last thing I do except taking the money—I put down the number of the roll—the judgment-roll is afterwards made up and goes into the Treasury COURT Q How long have you been in the Judgment-office A Thirty years—I have always considered that the entry which I make is what is termed in the profession signing judgment MR GIBBS re-examined I produce an original affidavit which wm deposited with me and has been filed with me ever since MR COLEMAN re-examined I swore the party who made this affidavit—I cannot undertake to swear it was the prisoner—the affidavit must have been used or Mr Gibbs would not have had the custody of it JOSHUA MORRIS I know the prisoner and know his handwriting—I believe the signature to this affidavit to be his handwriting Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q How often have you seen him write A I saw him write this paper— producing one —that is not the only thing I saw him write—I have seen him write perhaps two or three times—I compared this signature with this paper and on comparing them together I believe it to be his handwriting—I have no doubt in the world of it—I have acquired a knowledge of his handwriting by seeing him write that MR CLARKSON Q By seeing him write two or three times do you mean you have seen him write different things or seen him write his name A Different things—I have seen him write his name—I have known him three or four years—I have seen him write from time to time—without any comparison I have acquired a knowledge of his handwriting so as to enable me to speak to my belief of it—I have no doubt at all of this being his signature—I believe the body and all of it to be his handwriting Affidavit read — In the Queen s Bench between John Watts plaintiff and John Wittenbury defendant —Henry Simmons of No 5 Charlotte-place Woolwich in the county of Kent managing clerk to Mr Samuel Hanson Williams of the same place attorney for the above-named plaintiff in this cause maketh oath and saith that on the 26th of August last the defendant who the deponent is well acquainted with called at the office of deponent s employer situate as aforesaid accompanied by a person of the name of James who stated that they had been to London and taken out a summons to stay tod pay that the said defendant agreed to pay in this action the sum of 3l for costs of the said action which the deponent endorsed on the summons that the defendant then said We will go up Mr James to London and draw up the order and come down again and serve it as the money must be paid this evening that in consequence of the defendant not having paid the amount he the deponent did on the 27th of August last sign judgment on such order and duly entered an appearance in the proper office of this honourable Court &c &c &c JAMES M MILLAN I attend from the office of the sheriff of Kent I produce a testatum ad satisfaciendum—it was filed at the sheriffs office—it was given to me in the sheriffs office by the prisoner on the 27th of August 1842—I made out a warrant on that writ to Joshua Morris the officer— read JOSHUA MORRIS re-examined I produce the warrant that I received to execute on this writ—I took Mr Wittenbury in execution on the 29th of August—I was present at the hearing of the summons before Mr Justice Cresswell and saw the prisoner there—I received from Mr Wittenbury on his being taken 12l 11s —I gave him this receipt for it—after the hearing before the Judge in pursuance of his lordship s order I returned back that sum to Mr Rivolta Mr Wittenbury s attorney Cross-examined by MR PRENDERGAST Q Where did you arrest Mr Wittenbury A In his own house at Blackheath-hill—I did not see the prisoner at that time—I saw him on the day the writ was brought into the office JOHN BAILEY I am clerk to Mr Justice Patteson The summons produced by Mr Gibbs is an original summons issued from Mr Justice Patteson s chambers by his authority—it is signed by me Cross-examined by MR PRENDERGAST Q Are you the gentleman that swore to Mr Justice Patteson s writing in the Queen s Bench lately A Yes—I know this to be my handwriting—I do not know whether I made a mistake the other day about Mr Justice Patteson s handwriting—the Judge said it was his writing and I said it was not—he had some doubts about it—I was not present at the time—I saw by the newspapers that the thing I said was not his handwriting he said was—the Judge did not tell me it was his handwriting—the Judge s signature here is my handwriting—it purports to be the Judge s signature but it is my writing—it was written by his authority—I never knew a Judge sign a summons—I am authorized to do so—it is the practice of the chambers—I consider I have authority to do so—I have done so many years The summons was dated the 5th of September 1842 calling on the plaintiff s attorney or agent to attend the chambers of Mr Justice Patteson to show cause why the judgment should not be set aside having been fraudulently obtained without consent of the defendant his attorney or agent also the writ of ca sa issued on such judgment why the sheriff of Kent should not pay back the sum of 12l 11s levied by him on such writ and why the plaintiff should not repay the same MR COLEMAN re-examined This is the summons on which the cause was heard before Mr Justice Cresswell MR GIBBS re-examined This is the summons on which I drew up the order—it has been in my custody ever since JAMES CALEB WITTENBURY I am a builder and live at Blackheath In August last I knew a person of the name of Watts—I had dealings with him for a horse—I think I was to pay 16l for it—I reserved 5l of it in order to see whether the horse was free from vice—I found him not free from vice and did not pay the 5l —I was served with a copy of a writ of summon on the 16th of August last by a person with one arm named Munyard—I went to my solicitors Messrs Forsyth and Rivolta of Jewin-street next morning—I learned from them what is the practice of the Court on proceeding in vacation—I left the writ with them—on Monday the 29th of August I was taken in execution by Morris—I was not aware of any step having been taken in the action between the time of my receiving this service and being taken in execution—I saw the prisoner at Mr Justice Cresswell s chambers on hearing of the summons to set aside these proceedings—I never saw him before to my knowledge—I never called at the office of Mr Samuel Hanson Williams an attorney at 5 Charlotte-place Woolwich accompanied by a person named James—I never was at that place in my life with or without any person—I do not know where it is Q Did James ever state or did you in his presence that you and he had been to London and taken out a summons to stay and pay forthwith A I never saw James in my life till I saw him at this dock when he was tried—I never used those words or did James in my presence in Williams s office—I never authorised a person named James or any one else to call on Mr Williams on my account in this action—I never stated to Williams that I had been to London and taken out any summons of any kind whatever—I never saw Williams in my life to my knowledge—I never offered to pay Williams 3l or any other sum for costs in the action COURT Q The transaction never occurred A Never MR CLARKSON Q Did you ever say to Williams or authorise James or anybody else to say to Williams We will go up Mr James to London and draw up the order and come down again and serve it the money must be paid this evening A Never—I never saw Williams or James on the subject of any summons of any kind whatever or touching the payment of any sum of money—I never heard a breath of these proceedings till I was taken in execution by Morris—I afterwards appeared before the Judge on a summons and after the summons had been heard I recovered back the 12l 11s —the man James made an affidavit—I indicted him and he was tried and convicted here on the 12th of December—I have been for some time engaged in building a pump-room and other buildings for Mr Forsyth at Hockley in Essex—on Wednesday night the 24th of August last I slept at Mr Parr s at the White Hart at Hawkwell which is close to Hockley—on Thursday the 25th I had occasion to purchase some cement at Lea in Essex and I slept that night at the White Hart at Hawkwell—on Friday morning the 26th I breakfasted with Mr Parr at his house and then went with him in his own cart to Chelmsford being market-day—I staid there till half-past four o clock and came up by coach to Brentwood and then came by the railway to London—I got to London about half-past six—I was not in London that day until half-past six—I was with Mr Parr and we never parted company until half-past four Cross-examined by MR PRENDERGAST Q What have you done with this horse A Sold it at Dixon s—I got but a trifle for it—I supposed the action was brought against me for the 5l —I paid the 5l and costs when I was taken in execution by Morris Q Have you not since the proceedings have been set aside paid the debt and costs of the action A I have not myself—I cannot be answerable for what my solicitor does—my solicitors had full instruction to do just as they pleased with the case—my solicitor said it would be best to pay the thing rather than risk an action—I told him to do as he pleased—I thought it was better to pay whatever it was than to pay more—it has been settled in that way for any thing I know—I cannot tell how much was paid—my solicitor told me it was 5l —he thought I had got into bad hands and I had better pay it than lose more—that I had got into the hands of a gang of swindlers—I said well I thought I had better pay it—Mr Forsyth it my solicitor—I had a great deal of business in his hands—I do not settle with him above once a year perhaps—he has the management of ray property and if I say do this or that I do not know the exact sum for the end of a month or so he does it and when he brings in his bill I pay it—I cannot tell what the amount of the costs was—I have not paid my lawyer yet—he did not tell me I had better pay the 5l and coats he said I had better pay the 5l —I am positive he did not say the costs—he did not tell me the amount of the costs—I told him it would be the best way to settle it as I had got into bad hands MR CLARKSON Q Did you learn from your solicitor that after that Watts had paid back the money for the second time A I did STEPHEN PARR I kept the White Hart at Hawkwell in Aug last and know Mr Wittenbury—he was engaged on some works at Hockley in Aug —on Wednesday night the 24th of Aug he slept at my house and also on Thursday night the 25th—he breakfasted with me next morning and we went together to Chelmsford market in my horse and cart—I drove—he dined with me at Chelmsford—I parted with him to the best of my knowledge from a quarter to half-past four o clock and he went by a coach from Chelmsford—I accompanied him to the coach Cross-examined by MR PAYNE Q What makes you know that this was Friday the 26th of Aug A Because I did business on that day—Mr Wittenbury frequently came down on his business—I believe there is a market at Chelmsford every Friday—I never was at Chelmsford only on a Friday—I keep an account of my own private business at the market—I do not make a memorandum of where 1 go on particular days—I bought some sheep at the market—I have frequently bought sheep before—I know this was the 26th of Aug because I particularly know that Mr Wittenbury was with me when I bought this stock and some time in Sept when Mr Wittenbury was at my house he rang the parlour bell I went in and without telling me that there was any thing amiss he said to me Do you know what day you drove me to Chelmsford market —I said I could tell if he would allow me five minutes to look at my market-book—I went and looked at it went back to him and said On the 26th of Aug Sir —I have that book here— producing it —from looking at that book I am satisfied it was the 26th of Aug because Mr Wittenbury was with me when I made the purchase—I remember that perfectly well COURT to JOSHUA MORRIS Q Do you know the name of Samuel Hanson Williams of Woolwich A No—no such person lived at No 5 Charlotte- place—a man named John Munyard lives there and I never knew of any other person living there—I think I should have known if Williams had lived there MR PRENDERGAST Q You know a person of the name of Williams carries on business there A No I do not indeed but I know of his having had not only this but other warrants endorsed with the same name at the same place MR PRENDERGAST called THOMAS HAWKER I am a tailor and woollen-draper and live at No 11 Bell-yard Temple-bar I have known the prisoner three or four years—I employed him when I lived in Blackfriars-road to collect a deal of money for me at times—he was a person of good moral character and as regards speaking the truth I always found him to be a truth-speaking honest man—he never deceived me in any way COURT Q Where did you know him to live A believe he lodged up by Clerkenwell—I cannot say where he was living on the 26th of Aug —he did not collect my debts then—I know Samuel Hanson Williams and I knew his father for years at Cheltenham before I set up in business—he was a most respectable builder—Idid not know Williams at Woolwich—he is an attorney—I knew him when he lived in Blackfriars-road—I did a deal of work for him at No 205 Blackfriars-road not at Woolwich MR PRENDERGAST Q Do you know that he had a place of business at Woolwich lately A I have heard so I cannot say—I have not seen him for three or four months—I suppose he is gone out of the way—I do not know what he is now but he was a most respectable young man and his friends most respectable—I have known him fifteen or twenty years—I knew him when he was a boy—I knew him when he was a householder GUILTY Aged 32 — Confined Three Months and Transported for Seven Years

office A Personally MR PHINN Q When did you serve the summons A On the 28th of Sept 1844— These documents were admitted and taken as read FREDERICK WEST In 1844 I was managing clerk to Mr Thomas Lott of Bow-lane—he was the solicitor of Messrs Hackblocks the petitioning creditors On the 5th of Oct the day fixed in the summons I attended at the Court of Bankruptey on the return of this summons—the defendant did not attend on that occasion nor was any application made on his behalf—I made an affidavit— produced —here is a copy which I made myself of the original summons which was served on the

adjudication on him on the 15th of Oct 1844—I went down to take possession of his premises under the fiat but found he had none—I went to what were formerly his premises but they warned me off and told me I was a trespasser—I did not take possession I only seized a bundle of invoices ALFRED WILLIAM WALMSLEY In 1844 I was clerk at the Court of Bankruptcy I cannot say that I recollect the defendant surrendering himself to the fiat but I produce hi surrender which I attested—I saw him sign it while Mr Commissioner Williams was in Court—he also signed the consent to the adjudication and I attested it—it was gazetted forthwith FREDERICK WEST re-examined I produce the appointment of Mr Turquand as official assignee signed by Mr Commissioner Williams and also the London Gazette containing the adjudication and the advertisement of the meetings—I purchased it at the Gazette Office—the first meeting is advertised for the 30th of Oct 1844 at half-past eleven in the forenoon—the prisoner attended that meeting at which Mr John Hackblock and Mr Isaac Emsworth of the firm of Emsworht and Kebble were appointed as the creditors assignees—I produce the appointment with the signatures of Messrs Hackblock and Emsworth and the Commissioner—the meeting for the last examination was fixed for the 5th of Dec 1844—I attended that meeting—it was before Mr Commissioner Goulburn—the defendant attended that meeting—I have his balance-sheet—it is not signed by him he not having passed—it was filed—I am not aware whose writing these items are—it is on the proceedings—it was filed ten days previous to the meeting—I should imagine it would be brought by the bankrupt s accountant—that is the course of proceeding—this is the balance-sheet that was used in Court at that meeting in the defendant s presence and to which his examination referred—I was present during his examination—this balance-sheet was referred to and he was examined upon it—he saw it there—I heard him sworn—the oath administered to him was You shall true answer make to all questions put to you by the Court you shall speak the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth —that was a peculiar oath that was admininstered in Mr Commissioner William s Court—I have taken it some dozens of times myself—this meeting took place in Mr Commissioner William s Court although it was before Mr Commissioner Goulburn—I took down the defendant s examination in writing—after it was taken down I read it over to him—Mr Commissioner Goulburn was very particular—he made me stand up in Court and read it aloud and he put this initials to any alterations that were made—the defendant signed it—this is the statement he made The examination of the defendant was here read — Joseph Willett of Coggleshall in the county of Essex being sworn and examined says he denies that he has ever paid Mr Bickmore the sums named in the account furnished by Mr Bickmore and I deny the statement made in the letter of Mr Bickmore marked A signed by me namely that I did not hand over to him a sum of 92l on the eve of the trial and being asked the question Do I mean to represent that I did hand over to Mr Bickmore the sum of 92l on the eve of my trial I will swear I did I gave it him in Court when I stood at the bar and I will swear it was 92l I gave it him after I was convicted by the Jury of the assault he told me to give it him as in case I had any money about me and I took it to prison it would be taken away from me I took the money into Court with me when I was tried and had it in my pocket when I was in the dock I brought it from home it was the produce of goods sold by me I owed when I came from prison debts to the amount of 300l odd I think I could furnish the names of the parties to whom I owed it &c The money I handed over to Mr Bickmore was in a canvass bag MR PHINN Q Is the signature of Mr Commissioner Goulburn attached to that A It is—I have the adjudication upon that examination—some portion of its is my handwriting and some in the commissioner s—the Commissioner s signature is attached to it—it is merely adjourning the meeting until the 21st of Jan to produce Mr Bickmore and Mr Smoothey the accounts being unsatisfactory—Mr Commissioner Holroyd adjudicated upon the 21st of Jan —I have that adjudication signed by him—it adjourns the bankrupt s examination sine die— looking at the London Gazette produced by Mr Watts I find here another meeting fixed for the 4th of May 1846—I attended that meeting—if was before Mr Commissioner Fontblanque—the bankrupt was present he also appeared by counsel—I produce a declaration signed by the bankrupt on that day— this being read was a declaration in substitution for the oath previously administered made by the defendant to give true answers to all questions proposed to him respecting his property and to make a full and true disclosure of all that had been done with it —that was signed in my presence both by the defendant and the Commissioner—witnesses were than called by the bankrupt in support of his statement—a man named Wiltshire was called on that occasion and the bankrupt himself was examined and cross-examined as to his previous statement—I did not take down in writing what he then said—there was great confusion in Court and as the statement he made was to the same effect as his other statement I did not think it necessary to take it down on the proceedings—he was being examined by his counsel as to the transaction and Mr Phinn who then appeared on behalf of the assignees got up and said Then do you still mean to swear that you did hand over the 92l to Mr Bickmore and he said he did—there was a deal of examination and talking with the bankrupt but I am quite certain as to that part—I should not like to swear as to the other parts of his statement—I produce the adjudication of Mr Commissioner Fontblanque upon that occasion again adjourning the examination sine die and ordering the bankrupt to pay the costs of the assignees—the examined copy of the record of the defendant s trail at Chelmsford on the 17th of July 1843 is in Court—I examined it with the original record—he was convicted of an assault THOMAS LOTT I am a solicitor I was solicitor for the creditor s assignees of the bankrupt—they are the prosecutors of this indictment—I was present at the bankrupt s examination which has been read—I heard him make the statement with reference to the 92l — Mr Ballantine here admitted the accuracy of the statement —I was present on the second examination on the 4th of May last year—the bankrupt on that occasion produced some witnesses—Wiltshire was one of them and a man named Johnson—the bankrupt was himself asked some questions with reference to the 92l —that was not taken down in writing—I have heard Mr West state what then passed—he has truly stated the whole of it—the bankrupt s balance-sheet was produced and referred to on that occasion Cross-examined by MR RYLAND Q Do you conduct this prosecution A I do—I first received instructions to commence these proceedings some months ago—I cannot speak positively to it—Mr West was my managing clerk at that time and he conducted the whole matter—I was present at both examinations on the 5th of Dec 1844 and the 4th of May 1846—I believe Mr Bickmore was present on the 5th of Dec 1844—I cannot say that I recollect it—the matter was conducted by Mr West—he communicated with Mr Bickmore and conducted the matter—I did not communicate with Mr Bickmore personally—I do not think I ever did—my clerk has subpœnaed the witnessees here to-day—Mr West is now in practice for himself but he has given me his assistance still in this matter—he subpœnaed some of the witnesses FREDERICK WEST re-examined by MR BALLANTINE I was in communication with Mr Bickmore before the 5th of Dec 1844—I have had occasion to write to him since—I think I have subpœnaed three of the witnesses—I have subpœnaed Wiltshire on the part of the prosecution MR CLARKSON Q Was Wiltshire the man who was called and examined by the bankrupt on his second examination A He was in Jan 1845 that was the day of the adjourned examination—he had been the bankrupt s servant—I have seen him in the bankrupt s shop acting for him—both the bankrupt and Wiltshire have sworn to the fact of his being in the bankrupt s service and that the bankrupt owed him a sum of money for wages THOMAS LAKE BICKMORE I am a solicitor practicing at Kelvedon in Essex and was so in 1843 I was employed by the defendant to defend him on an indictment for an assault—Mr Smoothey was associated with me in the defence—previous to the trial the prisoner paid me 20l for counsel s fees and so on—I have here a memorandum in a book which I made at the time—it was in two payments of 14l and 6l on the 18th and 19th of July 1843—the trial took place on the 20th of July 1843—I was in Court during the trial and after the Jury returned their verdict—I was there at the time they returned their verdict—the prisoner was in the dock—I had no communication with him in Court after the verdict—I do not recollect that I had any communication with him whilst the Jury were deliberating—directly after the verdict was returned he beckoned to me—I stood under the dock I think—be merely called to me—there was no conversation—I think he touched me on the shoulder or beckoned me in some way—I approached him and he handed me over a little canvass bag—I directly put it into my pocket—I do not think I examined its contents before I put it into my pocket—I examined it as soon as I got back to the inn—that might be an hour and a half after—I then found in it twelve sovereigns—there was nothing else in it—Mr Smoothey was in the room when I examined the contents of the bag—I cannot say whether he saw me examine the contents—I communicated the amount to him—I made a memorandum of the contents when I got home that day—I have it here—about two months after I received this letter from the prisoner—it is his handwriting— read — Springfield Gaol Sept 6th 1843 —Friend Bickmore Sir I have one favour to ask you will you oblige in sending me two sovereigns in few day for when I delivered my purse left me with only few shillings The reason I ask you this favour my father intended to send for me with a carriage and four horses and there is to be twenty men to draw me in Coggleshall for Mayhew has reported that I shall never come to Coggleshall no more I do not like to send home for that amount I hop to pass through Kelvedon between the hours of one and three o clock on Saturday the 16th of Sept If you inclose that money do not write that way that I have written to you for this letter is sent out by a friend Sir if you think you will be at home about that time I will call on you friend Bickmore and I hope you will oblige me with that little sum Sir you know that I wish to make Mayhew ashamed of himself These few lines leave me middling according to the situation I am in I will make all things right when I come home and long laugh at my enemies From yours Joseph Willett Q When did you first see Willett next after the trial A I should think it was about two months—he was imprisoned for two months and after the expiration of that period I have a recollection of seeing him return home from Chelmsford—that was after I received this letter—I think that was the first time I saw him after the trial—perhaps I might have seen him once before—now I come to recollect I think I saw him in Springfield gaol in the early part of Sept —I do not think anything passed then as to my account against him or as to the sum of money that he had handed over to me—I do not think I ever made any demand upon him for my bill after he came out of gaol—he made nodemand upon me for any money given me by him none whatever either by letter or by word of mouth—I had a very small balance due to me taking into account the 32l —the first I heard of the 92l was by a communication from the official assignee in Nov 1844 I think—I answered that— looking at a letter —this is the second answer I made to the official assignee—it is dated 4th Dec —my first answer I think was on 4th Nov about a month before—I was present on three or four occasions at the Bankruptcy court while the defendant was passing his examination—I think I was present on 5th Dec 1844 but I am not sure or whether I was there on 21st Jan 1845—I was examined there twice once in May last year and once in 1844 or 1845—it must have been in 1845 that I was examined the first time I think—I do not think I was present at any time when the prisoner was being examined and when I was not examined Cross-examined by MR RYLAND Q Have you any doubt that you were present on 5th Dec 1844 the first time that Willett was examined A I really cannot swear that I was present that day—I will not swear I was not—I was examined there on two occasions—I heard him state on both occasions that he had given me the 92l —I think the first time I heard him state that was in 1844 the second time was in 1846 I think—the bag he gave me contained twelve sovereigns and nothing else no memorandum or note—I was not in the dock when he gave it me—I stood under it—I went into the dock afterwards or to the back of the place where they took him to after his trial—that was after he had given me the bag—he gave me the bag over the dock as I stood on the floor of the Court—I had made no demand of him for money on that day—I had asked him for money the day before and the day before that—he had given me the 14l on the first day the 18th and the 6l on the 19th according to my book—I put it down at the time—he gave me this 12l without any request on my part after the trial—I have no doubt I had had some conversation with him that morning before he surrendered—I did not tell him he had better hand over to me whatever property he had to take care of for him—nothing of the sort—he was indicted for felony—I knew that if he was convicted his property would be forfeited—I swear I did not tell him the day before that he had better hand over to me whatever money he had in case of his being convicted—I said nothing of the sort to him—I talked to him on the morning of the trial about the business about the indictment and so forth and his defence to it—I do not recollect anything particular—I might have talked about property—I cannot recollect what I said but I distinctly swear I said nothing to him about handing over the money to me—I did not tell him that morning that if he was convicted his property would be forfeited—it must have been some time before because he had been advised to make over his property in case he was convicted—he was so advised by Mr Smoothey and myself—the conversation I had with him on the morning of the trial was a general conversation—I cannot pin my recollection to anything about it—I do not know what it was—I swear I did not ask him for the 12l to take care of nor did I tell him he had better deposit with me any money that he had in case he was convicted of the felony—I gave him no advice about depositing money with me—Wiltshire was not in the dock when the prisoner gave me the purse—I did not see him he might have been in Court—Johnson might have been in Court—I do not recollect seeing him about that time—he was not in the dock when Willett handed the purse to me—I do not know where he was—I did not see him at that time nor Wiltshire—they were about the Court—I examined the contents of the purse as soon as I got away from the bustle of the Court—I cannot say whether it was an hour an hour and a half or two hours after I received it—I had been nowhere during that time only about the Court—I did not see after the money matters much till I got to the inn or the bank—I do not say I was about the Court for two hours it might have been two hours—I was about there some time—I went and spoke to the defendant where he was placed after leaving the dock Q What did he give you the money for A I expect he gave it me to take care of for him being about to be taken away—I distinctly swear that I had not advised him that morning to give me what he had to take care of for him—he never applied to me to give an account of the money—his brother John Willett has never applied to me about it—I swear that—the first intimation I had of it was more than a year and a quarter after from the official assignee—I might have gone to the prisoner s premises afterwards—I went and ordered goods I believe—I think I saw his brother John and his mother—they did not both apply to me to give an account of the money that Joseph had deposited in my hands—I swear that—I had not been concerned as attorney for the family for some years—I had been concerned for his father—I do not think I had sold any property for the father—I did several things for him and had an unsettled account with him—there are unsettled accounts still—there is a small balance also due to me from the defendant—my bill against him for the prosecution was 33l 13s and he paid me 32l including the money in the purse—he owes me a balance of 1l 13s on that business—I had another bill against him and his brother John of I think 11l 7s —I think it was a joint affair—they carried on two or three trades—it was for professional business MR CLARKSON Q Were you ever present at any meeting at the Bankruptcy Court at which the bankrupt made any statement that he had given you 92l except the two occasions that you have mentioned when you were examined A No I never heard him state it except on those two occasions—there was an adjournment from the 5th of Dec to the 21st of Jan to examine me—I do not recollect the bankrupt stating that I had received the 92l from him before I was examined—I had never heard it until I heard it from the official assignee FREDERICK SMOOTHEY I am attorney and live at Braintree in Essex I was first applied to by the defendant s brother to defend him—Mr Knight an ironmonger called upon me afterwards and in consequence of what he said I went to Coggleshall at the time the defendant was had up before the Magistrate—it was not to assist Mr Bickmore in the defence—he was not at home—I attended the assizes in the summer of 1843—after the trial I was at the inn where Mr Bickmore put up—I am not sure that I saw him produce the canvas bag—I heard him counting the money—I do not know that I saw it—he told me what there was—after the defendant came out of prison I saw him at Braintree—it was some time about the Christmas of 1843—I asked him when he intended to pay my bill for his defence— Mr Bickmore had not attended before the Magistrate—I believe he came in late in the evening but I attended alone—I had an account against the defendant in respect of that prosecution and when I met him in Braintree I asked when he intended to pay my bill —he said he would pay it sometime in the middle of Feb —he said he did not consider that he owed Mr Bickmore much as he had paid him 20l previous to the trial and had handed him a bag containing twelve sovereigns after he was convicted Cross-examined by MR BALLANTINE Q There were two persons indicted were there not A There were—I defended them both in conjuncttion with Mr Bickmore—the defendant was to pay the expenses of the other party also who was his servant—the other was acquitted—I have known Mr Bickmore fourteen or fifteen years—I do not think that this charge of having received 90l odd at all affects his credit in the County—I cannot say how long it was after the trial that I got to the inn—it might be a quarter or three quarters of an hour—it is impossible for me to say so many years ago—I do not think we went together—I think I was in the room when he came in—I cannot say how long but to the best of my recollection it was about half-an-hour—we were in a private room there—there was another person there whom I was talking to—I cannot give you his name—I believe it was a gentleman from Harwich—I was not talking to him about this transaction but about some other business—he was not connected either with Mr Bickmore or myself—I believe he was present when Mr Bickmore came in—I was talking to him while Mr Bickmore was counting the money—I have not made any inquiries about him or endeavoured to ascertain who he is—I have never seen him since—I am not certain as to the party—I only speak to the best of my recollection—I had no curiosity to know what Mr Bickmore was counting—he told me there was 12l in the purse—I never asked him any question—I do not know that he called my attention to it—if he did I might have turned round to see it he merely said that—when I met the prisoner in Braintree it was in the street as I was coming round the corner of Sparrow s Bank near the railway—it was an accidental meeting—nobody was present but ourselves—he was in his cart—it was then he told me that he had handed over the bag containing twelve sovereigns to Mr Bickmore—I had said nothing to him about it—I had not seen him from the time of his conviction—I made no reply when he said this to me—I might have said I knew it very well—I do not know whether I did or not—I recollect asking him when he would pay my costs—I might have had other conversation with him but it was very short—I was not the first person to mention the bag he mentioned it himself—I had seen him hand something to Mr Bickmore in Court but I did not know what it was at the time—the amount of the costs he owes me is between 40l and 50l —there has been no question about the amount of money that he handed to me—I have never had a sixpence from him—at the time of the trial Mr Bickmore I think gave me about 7l for the payment of the Court fees or briefs or something of that sort—that is all I have never received—I have sent in my demand and have never been able to get it—I have not proved my debt in bankruptcy—I brought an action for it previous to his being a bankrupt but did not proceed in it after he became a bankrupt—I have not got my bill here or the items of which it was composed MR PHINN Q Had you communicated with Mr Bickmore previous to seeing him at the inn as to an advance of money by the prisoner for the costs A I had FREDERICK KNIGHT I am an ironmonger living at Bocking near Braintree—I knew the defendant for several years previous to 1843—I Communicated with Mr Smoothey as to his defence—I saw him I think about six or eight months after he came out of prison either in my own shop or in his—I asked if he was not going to pay Mr Smoothey—he said No that he had paid Mr Bickmore I think he said 40l and handed over to him on the day of the trial a bag containing 12l or 14l and Mr Smoothey must get it of him—it might contain 90l I do not know but that was what he said—he did not state in what coin it was COURT Q Do you mean that he said it might contain 90l A No he did not say so Cross-examined by MR RYLAND Q Then what makes you think it possible that it might contain 90l A It might I did not see it—nothing passed be-between us on the subject of 90l or about notes—he did not say for what purpose he had given Mr Bickmore the bag containing the 12l or 14l —he did not say some of it was gold and some notes—he said he gave Mr Biokmore the money to keep for him to return again that he might live rather better when he was convicted in Chelmsford Gaol than a common felon and that if they had behaved better to him he would have paid Mr Smoothey—he complained of Mr Smoothey and Mr Bickmore keeping him without the money so that he was obliged to live poorly in gaol—he did not tell me that he had handed over to Mr Bickmore all he had in the world—nothing of the sort FREDERICK WEST re-examined The entry in the balance-sheet relating to the 92l is as follows — Amount deposited with Mr Bickmore of Kelvedon solicitor on 20th July 1842 to be accounted for to my estate 92l —he credits himself with that in his general balance-sheet Witnesses for the Defence BENJAMIN WILTSHIRE I am now a master-currier at Coggleshall in Essex—I was at one time in the defendant s employment—I remember his being tried at Chelmsford—I was present at the trial—on the morning of the trial I saw him at the Spotted Dog—he was out on bail—he showed me the money he had got in his pocket—it was in a canvass-bag and consisted of notes and gold—I did not handle the notes or notice the amount of any of them—he counted out 92l notes and all—I could not tell exactly how many sovereigns there were—I should say there were more than twelve—after counting out the money he put the money in the bag and put it in his pocket—I think this was about ten o clock in the morning—I believe he was waiting for the trial to be called on—he said something to me at the time he put the money into his pocket—I left him against the Spotted Dog in company with Mr Bickmore who met him there—I do not recollect how soon after that the trial began—it was no great while after—while the Jury were considering their verdict I saw him hand over the purse to Mr Bickmore—I am not certain whether it was before the verdict was given or after—I think it was after—I did not notice the purse in particular when he handed it to Mr Bickmore—I cannot say whether it appeared the same in bulk as when I had seen it previously MR PHINN Q How long had you lived servant with the defendant A About four years—before that I had been working in the trade for another man—I had failed in business—at the time the defendant counted out the money he owed me 26l 10s —no I think it was 36l 10s —that was it to the best of my belief—I am wrong I made a mistake—at the time of the trial he paid me none—I was thinking you meant what he owed me at the time of his bankruptcy—at the time he counted out the money he owed me 72l —he has paid me some since his trial—I did not apply to him for payment at that time—I knew he was going to be tried—I saw each note as he counted it—I cannot say whether they were Bank of England notes or provincial notes or whether they were fives tens or twenties—there were three different number I believe—I do not think there was a 20l note among them—I was within two or three yards of him at the time he was counting them—we both sat at the table—I cannot say how many sovereigns there were—there were not fifty—there were more than ten—I cannot speak to there being twenty or thirty—the 72l he owed me was for money lent Q Where did you get the money to lend him you say you had failed in business some time before A Some I had saved and some I had given to me by my wife s family—part of it I had saved in his service—I cannot recollect how much—I had had about 80l given to me I think—that was at the time I was in his service—must I say who gave it me —it was given to me by my wife s grandfather whose name was Addy—I was examined at the Bankruptcy Court— looking at the examination —this is my signature— the witness s examination being read stated I saved 70l as a journeyman currier in four or five years but it contained no mention of the 80l being given to him —I did not say anything on that occasion as to the 80l having been given to me—I said I had saved part of the 70l as a journeyman in four or five years—what I stated then was true enough—I cannot call to my recollection whether I stated that I had saved 70l in four or five years—my wages as a journeyman were about 30s a week—I lived out of the house—during those four or five years I paid a good deal of what I owed my creditors little monies round about—I cannot recollect how much I paid my creditors in those four or five years—I was examined as a witness for the defendant on his trial—I do not know that I went to prove that he was not the person who committed the assault—I do not remember what I swore at the trial—since the trial I have been charged with assisting the defendant in removing his goods to get them out of the way of his creditors—I did do so—he employed me to do it—I hid a quantity of leather in a false ceiling—I saw Mr West the day before yesterday—I told him that part of what I had stated before the Commissioner of Bankruptcy was untrue for I had been led into it by my master unawares Q Will you swear that you did not tell him that the whole of what you had stated about seeing your master count out the 90l was untrue A I believe not—I said it was false—I believe it was false that Mr Bickmore had it through what I had heard since the last hearing—my master has told me that he did not give Mr Bickmore 92l —he told me he gave him 12l MR BALLANTINE Q Then in point of fact you have been in communication with the clerk to the attorney for this prosecution A I was with Mr West—he subpœnaed me to attend here to-day—he did not serve me with it—Mr Mayhew served me—the conversation that I had with Mr West was at Mr Lott s office—I went there by appointment—it was written on the subpœnaed that I was to be at Mr Lott s office at such a time and I went there accordingly—nothing was said about prosecution me for concealing this property or about my saving myself from prosecution—I did not tell Mr West what I should say in particular if I was called as a witness—he did not ask me in particular what I should say—he told me that he did not know whether they should want me or not but he thought the others would and it would be about the 92l —I said I was sorry for it I did want to say anything about it but if I was called I should tell the truth about it—nothing else passed—I was to be at the Court at such a time and not to be away from my time—he said he thought they should not want me but the other side probably would about the 92l —I do not recollect that he said anything more EDWARD JOHNSON I am a shoemaker living at Coggleshall—I know the defendant and was present at his trial at Chelmsford in July 1843—I saw him give Mr Bickmore a canvas-bag or purse—I believe it was after the Jury had given their verdict—it appeared to contain something—I should not like to form an opinion as to how many sovereigns it might contain—Wiltshire was there at the time—I saw the defendant and Mr Bickmore talking together at the time the bag was given—I did not hear what they said Mr PHINN Q How far were you from me and the dock A Something like a yard I think—there was nobody between me and the dock—I should say that some conversation passed from the position they stood in but I did not hear anything not to understand what was said—Mr Bickmore stood below the duck and Willett in the dock and he leant over and had some conversation with Mr Bickmore I suppose I did no hear what was said—I am no enemy of Willett s—I am a friend of his as far as knowing him all my life JOHN WILLET I am the brother of the defendant and am an ironmonger living at Coggleshall On the 16th of Sept 1843 while my brother was in prisoner I went to Mr Bickmore s office—that was by my brother s orders—I saw Mr Bickmore and told him that I was going to Chelmsford after my brother—Mr Bickmore asked me what time we should return from Chelmsford—I said between one and two o clock—Mr Bickmore said he should not be at home between one and two o clock but between five and six o clock he should be at home—he told me that he had received a large sum of money of my brother and he said Do you tell your brother to cell then I will settle with him of the monies —I had not said anything to him about what he had received—on returning from Chelmsford I called at Mr Bickmore s between five and six o clock—I saw a servant up at the chamber-window and inqured if Mr Bickmore was at home—I did not see him or hear him—about the Nov or Dec following I saw him at my father s shop—he said I understand your father intends to have his business settled and I should like to settle it —I asked him if he had brought my father s account and my brother s account and the account of the money he had received—he said that he and my brother would not fall out they would make it all right one day—I asked him whether it was 92l or whether it was more or less—he said Your brother and I shall not fall out but will make it all right one day —I said nothing on that—I thought he would settle—about March 1844 I saw him again at my shop—my mother was present—Mr Bickmore selected some goods—my mother asked him for her husband s account and my brother s account and the account of the money that he had received—he said he should see my brother and make it all right one day—he wanted to purchased a stove—he looked one out but we did not send it—we did not say anything to him about it MR PHINN Q Is your ironmongery business carried on under the same roof as your brother s curriery business was A Yes it was carried on separately—I was not accused of helping to remove hi goods to conceal them from the assignees—I did not assist my brother or Wiltshire to conceal his goods from the assignees—I was examined privately at the Bankruptcy-court but not regarding the 92l or my interview with Mr Bickmore—my brother never brought me to the Bankruptcy-court when he was examined about the 92l —I believe I was present once when my brother was examined but I was not examined—I heard Mr Bickmore there state that no application had been made to him for the money by my brother—my brother did not then ask me to be a witness for him—that was in the year 1843—it was in the autumn I think—I was not there when Mr Duncan was my brother s counsel nor when my brother was examined about the 92l on a previous occasion—I was there in Nov or Dec I think—he was then examined about the 92l —I think Mr Bickmore was examined the same day—I was not examined as a witness then—when I saw Mr Bickmore while my brother was in goal I commenced the conversation by telling him I was going to Chelmsford after my brother—I did not ask him anything about money before he spoke about money to me—he told me had received a large sum of money from my brother and when my brother returned he would see and settle with him—he did not say what the sum of money was—I did not ask him to give my brother some money to help him to come out of prison—I called on him again in the evening with my brother but did not see him—I think I next saw him in Nov that was before my brother became bankrupt—I think it was in 1843 the same year in which he went to prison—I then had the conversation with him that I have stated—Mr Payne was my brother s attorney in the bankruptcy—I saw him in Court about the time the discussion was going on as to the 92l —I did not sate to him the conversation I had had with Mr Bickmore—I never had any conversation with Mr Payne—I told my brother about it when he came home—I don t know that I said anything particular about it to any one but my brother MARY WILLET I am a widow and am the mother of the defendant and of last witness In March 1844 my husband was living—but my son John carried on the business as an ironmonger at Coggleshall—I know Mr Bickmore—about March 1844 he came to our shop for some goods—he locked some out and I think he had them—my son John was there—Mr Bickmore asked me if Joseph was at home—I said No and I asked him for my husband s account my son Joseph s account and the account of the money he had received and I asked him was it 90l or 92l or what was it—he said Your son Joseph and I shall not fall out but we shall make it right one day —that was all the answer he gave—I said nothing more to him Mr PHINN Q I believe you were examined at the Court of Bnkruptcy A Yes—I don t recollect the Commissioner threatening to commit me for not answering properly—I was not present on either occasion when my son was examined about the 92l —I knew on both occasion that he was going to London to be examined about it but I did not come forward GUILTY — Confined One Month and then Transported for Seven Years Before Mr Justice Maule 
t18510203-546  546 JANE PARNELL was indicted for wilful and corrupt perjury MESSRS RYLAND and LOCKE conducted the Prosecution WILLIAM HERITAGE I am managing clerk to Mr M Fane an attorney I was present at the trial of George and Edith Hopwood in the adjoining Court on 10th Jan they were acquitted—I produce a copy of the record I have compared it with the original in Mr Clark s office it is a true copy read DANIEL RICHARD HARKER I am one of the ushers of this Court I administered the oath to the prisoner on the trial in question in the presence of the Lord Chief Baron and Mr Justice Talfourd JAMES DROVER BARNETT I am a short-band writer I attended in the Old Court at the trial of George and Edith Hopwood on a charge of cutting and wounding Jane Parnell with intent to murder and took down the evidence— This being read as set out in page 381 was to the effect that Jane Parnell was assaulted in Ramsay-street on 2nd Dec between six and seven o clock in the evening by a man and woman with masks on that the woman drew an instrument across her throat and that Mrs Hopwood was the woman GEORGE HOPWOOD I am a backgammon-board maker On 2nd Dec I lived at 34 Ann s-place Hackney-road I now live at 45 Baltic-street St Luke s—about two months before Christmas 1849 I lived in West-street North Mile-end and employed the prisoner there about six months—an intimacy took place between me and her after I and my wife had agreed to part and we cohabited together about five months—she said she was married to a sailor Parnell I knew of his coming home he came to my place—I had bought her furniture of her as she wanted money—he claimed it and gave me in charge for stealing it—I was locked up for it—I gave the things up—she had given me a receipt for the money—about six weeks or two months after that I ceased to cohabit with her because I saw that I was being robbed and my things were being destroyed and I took my wife home and have lived with her ever since—after that the prisoner came to my house to annoy me I caught her once breaking the windows and sticking a bill up on the door—I gave her in charge but the policeman would not take her because he did not see her—there were a good many disputes between us and assaults—I went before the Magistrate and was bound over to keep the peace—my house is about a mile and a half from the prisoners—she chargd my wife before the Magistrate—the insulted her three or four times and had been up to Worship-street before I went up for the warrant against her for breaking the windows and sticking the bill up—they-said there was not evidence enough to grant me one—I went before the Magistrate on the warrant she got against my wife—she was bound over to keep the peace towards my wife and my wife was bound over also that was on the Saturday before this took place on the Monday and I heard no more of her till Monday evening 2nd Dec —on that day I was in my back-shop at work from five o clock in the morning till the policeman came at night about half-past eight—my wife was in the shop with me we were both working together Frederick Field Edward Hopwood and John Kneller the errand-boy were there—Mrs Field was in the house she has to answer the front door and lives up-stairs—she saw me from time to time that day coming in and out of the yard—the shop is in the yard—there is no way of going out except through the door that Mrs Field has the care of—she cannot say for those who go out but she must open the door for anybody to come in it opens into a passage—the policeman took my wife into custody but not me I followed to the station—the inspector told me to go out I said I would not for I was there to see my wife righted—he said then I might stop—I had been there about a quarter of an hour and then he said You are my prisoner and took me into custody—my wife was not out that day except when she went out to get a pound of candles before it got dark at ten or five minutes to four—she was away only six or eight minutes—I was not with her in Ramsay-street at any time that evening—I was never outside my door Cross-examined by MR RIBTON Q When were you married A I have been married about four years—I lived with my wife about three years before I lived with the prisoner—I did not know for certain when I went to live with her that she was married I had heard it—my wife was then away from me living in Lower White Cross-street upon 8s a week which I allowed her—the prisoner was working with me about five months before I commenced cohabiting with her—she used to come at eight in the morning and left at eight or nine at night—she and my wife were not in the habit of quarrelling till the prisoner came and drove my wife against the railings and used disrespectful words to her and then my wife struck her and she got a warrant EDITH HOPWOOD I am the wife of the last witness I was taken on 2nd Dec between eight and nine in the evening on a charge of assaulting Mrs Parnell—the policeman found me at home we had been at work—I had been out at a few minutes to four o clock that afternoon for a pound of candles at Goldsmith-row ten or twenty doors off—I was away about eight minutes with that exception I was not out of the house or absent from my husband from the first thing in the morning till I was taken into custody—the errand-boy went out about three o clock to the City be returned about six or it might be a little before Cross-examined Q When did you know the prisoner first A She was never any acquaintance of mine—a man that works with us first brought her and she always professed to be a friend to me and said what a bad husband I had—she used to come to work in the morning—she had her meals there and sometimes she would go away at night with a young man named Anderson who she said was her brother but it was a man she cohabited with—I did not know for two months that she was living with my husband—he had turned me out of doors and my two children for the sake of this woman—he assigned no reason for turning me out—I found them living together at Brown s-place Hoxton about two months afterwards—I had no altercation with the prisoner while she was at my house—she was quite a stranger—I never associated with her and had not the slightest idea of it—I bad no quarrel with her after I found they were living together I never saw her except down at Worship-street—she came down to my house and insulted me several times—she ran away and the policeman brought her back but I had no quarrel with her—I did strike her when she pushed me against the palings and used several words to me—I did not strike her on more than one occasion nor have I had any angry words with her except then down to the time she was given into custody—my husband knew that I went out that afternoon I went out for candles because it was getting rather dark—we had our tea about five o clock or a little before—when the errand-boy came back from the City about six we were sitting at tea in the shop—we have our dinner in the shop to save time MR RYLAND Q When you went out for the candles did you go into Ramsay-street A No I was not there at

husband—no man visited me there—four married persons with families lived in the house COURT Q Where were your children on this day A I hare buried one since I have been away from my husband—I had one in the shop that day—he lay on some leather and a shawl in the shop till the policeman took me FREDERICK FIELD I am in the employ of George Hopwood On 2nd Dec I was working with him at 24 Ann s-place Hackney-road in the workshop—I live in the house—I commenced work at seven o clock in the morning and worked till between eight and nine in the evening when the policeman came—Mr and Mrs Hopwood Mr Hopwood s brother and the lad John Kneller were at work with me—the child was in the shop part of the day—Mr Hopwood did not leave the shop all day but about four or a few minutes to four his wife did—she staid away about seven or eight minutes with that exception she had not been out the whole day till the policeman came—she went to get some candles because there were none in the house—we were busy that day we had got a shipping order—I never left the shop except when I went up to my meals—the errand-boy went out between two and three and came back as near as possible between five and six with that exception he was there the whole day Cross-examined Q What age is he A About sixteen—I went up-stairs to my dinner about twelve o clock—Mr and Mrs Hopwood dined in the shop—I was at dinner about an hour—I was up-stairs at torn about half an hour—I saw Mrs Hopwood in the shop the moment I came down—I remember the day by the policeman coming SARAH FIELD I am the wife of the last witness and live in Mr Hopwood s house—I had a room up-stairs in front of the house—I was there all day on 2nd Dec except about twenty minutes or half an hour in the morning part somewhere about one o clock—I work up-stairs—I occasionally go into the shop down-stairs and also attend to the door—I saw Mr and Mrs Hopwood continually that day—Mr Hopwood was not out all day long Mrs Hopwood went out for a few minutes just before four in the afternoon—I let her in again—if he had gone out I must have let him in—I have been out sometimes twenty minutes when I have forgotten to take the key—I afterwards let in the policeman Cross-examined Q How do you recollect that she returned at five minutes past four A Because a few minutes before that I went down to call my husband up to his tea—I have a clock in my room and there is one in the workshop—I looked at my clock before I went down—I stated last Session for the first time that Mrs Hopwood returned at ten minutes past four—from four till the policeman came I was up-stairs in my room at work—I did not go down unless occasionally a knock came to the door—the front door is always kept shut—there is but one key allowed to it and that I had because the landlord s boy used to let them in when they went out—I am confident she had not got a key of the street-door—I saw her in the workshop from four till the policeman came EDWARD HOPWOOD I am the brother of George Hopwood In Dec last I boarded and lodged with him and worked for him—on 2nd Dec the day Mrs Hopwood was taken I was at borne at work all day—I did not go outside the door—I took my meals in the shop—ray brother did not go out at all that day—Mrs Hopwood went out about four o olock for a pound of candles—she was gone about eight or ten minutes as near as I can recollect—that was the only time she was out that day—I was at work in the shop when the policeman came about eight or half-past—he said I want you for cutting a woman s throat I did not hear him say where—her husband was there Cross-examined Q How long had you been working there A About three months before that I always have my meals in the shop—I remain in it every day the same as I did on 2nd Dec —I go out when I want only J happened to be in the shop all that day—there were a great many other days that I was just as attentive to business—it frequently happens that Mr and Mrs Hopwood are in the shop all day—Mr Hopwood always works in the shop and Mrs Hopwood too except when she gets the meals ready JOHN KNELLER I am errand-boy to George Hopwood On 2nd Dec the day Mrs Hopwood was taken up I was at home in the morning and I went to the City between two and three o clock and returned between five and six—I looked at the clock when I came in—while I was at home Mr and Mrs Hopwood were both at home at work in the back shop—Mr and Mrs Field and Mr Hop wood s brother were there Cross-examined Q When did you first say it was between two and three o clock when you went to the City A I told Mr Hopwood the time just before I went out because he told me to make haste back—there was a clock there—he asked me what was the time and I told him I am sure of that—I stated that when I was examined last Session—I looked at the clock when I came home I always do so—Mr Hopwood asked me the time and I told him—he was at work—I am in the habit of working in the shop with Mr and Mrs Hopwood—it is quite common for them to work there all day—they frequently have their meals there several days in the week—I have lived with them nearly six months—during that time I have seen them working together for several days and Mr Hopwood never leaving the shop except for a short time MARY ANN DORMER I and my husband occupy the house 18 Ramsay-street Mrs Dearn is a lodger of ours she occupies the front parlour On 2nd Dec I was in my room up-stairs—some one called me and I went down—the street-door was open—I looked out but saw no one—I locked the door and was going up-stairs again but heard Mrs Dearn unlock her door—I stopped—she opened it and asked me to come in—I hesitated knowing that a woman frequently came there in liquor—she said Do come in it is not the woman you think it is —I went in and saw the prisoner lying on the floor leaning her head against a bed-stead—Mrs Dearn said some one had cut her throat—she appeared insensible—I asked her who did it—Mrs Dearn said Mrs Parnell can say —she said I struggled hard —Mrs Dearn asked me if I would stop while she went and fetched some one—I said Yes —I looked at her throat and saw three or four scratches and a little blood smeared over them—I asked her to tell me who did it but she made no answer—she appeared quite insensible—just after that two men came into the room and Mrs Parnell fell from the bedstead where she was leaning under the table and said George Hopwood I never did you any harm —George Hopwood was not one of the men that came in—it was mentioned in her hearing that a policeman was coming—she appeared insensible but I do not think she was because she kept speaking between whiles—I was just outside the door in the passage and heard her say she wanted to speak to the policeman—a policeman came and went in—I heard her telling him where Mr and Mrs Hopwood lived but did not notice the direction as it did not concern me—it was in Ann s-place I know—I saw the policeman taking it down Cross-examined Q Were you alarmed when you went into the room A I felt rather alarmed I examined her throat because Mrs Dearn told me it was cut—I do not know how long Mrs Dearn had been in the Toom—I saw no blood about the prisoner till I lifted up her chin and looked at her throat—I had never seen Mr and Mrs Hopwood before they were let out on bail—I gave evidence for them last Session—I did not count the scratches on Mrs Parnell s throat but there must have been four or five—the blood that was smeared over them had come from them but there was no blood running at the time—she remained at the house till the next night lying on the bed with her clothes on—I do not know whether any one sat up with her I did not—I heard no screams in the street that night or any noise HENRY STUBBS I am a velvet-weaver at 25 Sale-street Bethnal-green adjoining Ramsay-street—I produce an instrument called a trebat used in weaving velvet—it cuts the wire out which we work upon—it hat got a groove in it—it has to be regulated to a great nicety BENJAMIN VALE I am a surgeon I examined the prisoner s throat on 2nd Dec and found three parallel incisions on it as near as possible equidistant—they were slight skin deep—there was a redness of the skin on the anterior portion of the front of the throat like a band by pressure on the part it was not blood—I consider it was done by a guarded instrument—I suggested it might be a scarificator something like a cupping instrument— here had been an instrument equally as sharp as this used it could not have been made with the hand—it might decidedly have been caused by this trebat but then it must have been passed across the throat three times which would account for the redness—one bad gone a little over the other—it appeared to me to be done with a fork it was an incised wound ME LOCKE Q They were three parallel lines could they have been occasioned by a person who was-struggling with the prisoner at the time A It might have been but I think it would not have been so parallel if there had been much struggling—the whole of that neighbourhood is surrounded with weavers—I found the prisoner on the bed unable to speak the front part of her dress was covered with blood—I took no means of ascertaining whether her insensibility was feigned or not because I thought it was real—I dressed the wound with strapping—I saw her again at nine o clock and again next morning—she was then removed to her lodging in Underwood-street and was better but was still in bed—I attended her occasionally until last sessions first for about five or six days running and then only every other day Cross-examined Q Would the appearance of her neck be an adequate cause for her insensibility A Yes from the wounds being inflicted and from the excitement—I found a small red coral necklace on her neck—blood might have been on it without my noticing it—the wounds were sufficient to warrant my visiting her again that evening at nine o clock or I should not have gone—she was not insensible then because she spoke to me—she was not entirely recovered COURT Q Do you mean she had not entirely recovered her senses A She had her senses but being in a debilitated state from previous excitement she required some time to think before she answered a question—I considered she was in such a weak state as to require stimulants—there was a great deal of hysteria about her—alarm will cause that—I called next morning at ten o clock or half-past I made it my first visit—I found her in bed and re-dressed the wound she was very hot and feverish with a very excited and rapid pulse—she appeared to be in a weak state and I thought it would be unsafe for her to attend at the police-court and gave a certificate to that effect—she was removed to Underwood-street that morning and I visited her there next day—the wounds took about a week to heal—hysteria would account for a person speaking a few words while she was insensible but she would not be able to carry on a conversation—she would be likely to make a pertinent remark in the midst of hysteria—hysteria can be assumed and frequently is but I was called suddenly in and my impression was that she was insensible from real causes—I saw no symptoms but what might result from weakness and excitement—I do not think she could have inflicted the wound herself unless she was left-handed but in a struggle it is difficult to say—in my judgment it was done from the right to the left GUILTY Aged 26 — Transported for Seven Years

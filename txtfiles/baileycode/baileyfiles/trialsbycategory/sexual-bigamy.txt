A I believe it to be her hand-writing Q Is she sometimes called by the family Susannah - A That is her name I believe she altered it to Anne to suit the prisoner s purpose GUILTY aged 26 Transported for seven pears Second Middlesex jury before Mr Common Serjeant

read ROBERT BLACKMORE I am an attorney and am acquainted with the hand-writing of the prisoner I have seen her write three times and have numbers of her letters in my possession the first time I saw her write was in December last - I have a sufficient knowledge of her writing to swear to it I believe the signature M A Ducket to this register to be her writing Cross-examined by Mr LAW Q Are you not engaged as the solicitor in this prosecution A Yes I never saw her writing till December last Q Do you believe the other name Thomas Lloyd to be her hand-writing A No - there is certainly a great similarity the a is turned over in the same way but there is a difference The only time I ever saw her write was when she came to agree upon the terms of separation from Mr Truss - I saw her sign the deed but I have letters which came from her DAVID JACKSON I was a painter I remember the prisoner and Thomas Lloyd but I did not know him before he was married I was at the Yorkshire Stingo tea-gardens about 1812 and saw the prisoner whom I knew as Ducket s daughter as I had lived opposite to her - she spoke to me and asked how I did and said she was married I asked to whom - she said to Lloyd the baker - I think she said that day but I cannot be positive while I was talking I heard somebody say Mr Lloyd there is Mr Jackson joking with your wife - will you stand that I turned round and saw three bakers standing together but I did not know Lloyd he was pointed out to me afterwards Lloyd is now in Court pointing him out I do not know where they lived afterwards nor do I know that ever I saw them walking together I cannot say whether this is the man I saw at the gardens Cross-examined Q You say you have seen that man since A Yes - but I do not think I ever spoke to him JOHN YATES I am a cooper and live in Wade-street Poplar I know the prisoner - she took an apartment of me about October 1822 by the name of Bligh there was a seaman with her of the name of George Bligh they lodged with me about a week They both came again the following year after he had made a voyage to the East Indies - they then staid a fortnight or three weeks She came there again the following year and went by the name of Bligh I have seen her write frequently and know well the character of her hand-writing I think her present writing is much better than that in this register but as far as I can judge I think this is her writing - I believe this letter to be her writing looking at one I believe Bligh was mate of a ship - I was given to understand that after he went to sea the first time she was a companion to a lady of the name of Truss in Claremont-place she said that she was companion to her on account of her being deranged Cross-examined Q Upon your oath is there not a considerable difference between the hand-writing you have sworn to and the hand-writing in this book A I think her hand considerably improved but I still think it is her hand-writing I did not know any thing of her writing till 1822 I do not know whether she did live with a lady of the name of Truss or not she went by the name of Bligh only when I saw her write Mr BRODRICK Q Did she say she was going back to this woman A Yes Mrs YATES I am the wife of John Yates I have seen the prisoner write I think the signature in the register is her writing I believe this letter to be her writing I have seen Bligh - he appeared to be a respectable man - he was mate of an Indiaman Cross-examined Q Is not her writing a much better hand than that A Yes it is now the name I saw her write was Bligh - there is no similarity in the names I had no knowledge of her writing in 1814 I think this name Thomas Lloyd is her writing COURT Q Does she write a better hand now than she did at the date of these letters A Yes I think she does - her present hand-writing is much better than this in the book THOMAS STEVENS I am a baker and live in Weston-street Southwark I have known the prisoner fifteen years - I knew her by the name of Ducket - I lodged in her mother s house - they lived in John-street Mary-le-bone I remember Thomas Lloyd coming to court her - he stood godfather to a child of mine I believe they were married in May it was at the time of Yorkshire Stingo fair - after that day she went by the name of Lloyd - they lived together as man and wife and many a time I have heard her come and ask for her husband - I saw them together a good while they lodged together as man and wife in the father s house - the last time I saw them together was about two years after they had lived together at a house in Rathbone-place - the prisoner was sitting on the knee of a sailor of the name of Bligh who had come from sea with her brother - we drank together and called for half a pint of gin Lloyd then said in her presence If you like the sailor better than me you had better go with him the sailor then threw 5s on the table and he and the prisoner went off together and left me and Lloyd to drink the gin Cross-examined Q There was 5s thrown down by the sailor a fellow of the name of Lloyd took up the money and the sailor took the lady A Yes the landlord took the money - I think that is ten years ago ROBERT DAVIES I am a sawyer I knew the prisoner s father - his name was George Ducket - I worked for him - this signature in the register is his hand-writing - he has been dead about twelve years Cross-examined Q Did you live in his house A Yes I was apprenticed to him I did not see him when dead COURT Q How long is it since you last saw him A Above twelve years I heard by his wife that he was dead - I have lived in the neighbourhood since Mr ANDREWS Q How near did you live to George Ducket A In Stevens -buildings just by - I have lived just about there ever since - I have never seen him since I heard he was dead - I was quite a different way at the time I had worked with him three or four years before his death I have not the least doubt of this being George Ducket s hand writing MARY ANN PEARSON I live in North-place Back-road Islington I once lived in the prisoner s father s house I recollect her by the name of Ducket and Lloyd courting her I recollect their going out one day and coming back again after which she went by the name of Mrs Lloyd I had before heard her say she was going to be married they lived together as man and wife in her father s house I lived in the house for three or four months - I have heard her mention Lloyd as her husband about three or four years ago she called at my house very handsomely dressed and said she had married a gentleman named Truss - this is Lloyd pointing him out WILLIAM HENRY TRUSS I hold a situation in the India House I married the prisoner at St Pancras Old Church on the 28th of March 1822 by the name of Betty Wood Louther Bligh she called herself the widow of a Captain Bligh I first became acquainted with her in 1820 and parted from her in December last I cannot say at what time I determined to separate from her - I agreed to allow her one hundred and twenty pounds a year Cross-examined Q Have you ever paid her one shilling A No we lived together for two years before we were married and after we were married for four years we lived very comfortably for the two years but not so afterwards our acquaintance first commenced in the street - we first lived in Chalton-street and afterwards at the Polygon in Somers-Town I did not know but that she was the window of Captain Bligh - I did not know a person of the name of Bligh I have not taken any proceedings in Doctor s Commons my object in bringing forward this prosecution is not merely to get rid of the marriage Re-examined Q When was the settlement made A In the latter end of last year - I had not till after the deed was executed the slightest reason to believe that she had deceived me - she conducted herself properly before our marriage and it was her solicitation that induced me to marry her she represented herself as the daughter of Mr Graham brother of Sir J Graham who was first cousin to the Lonsdale family - she mentioned Lady Styles and Mr Bosanquet as relations on her mother s side - she spoke of a rich aunt of the name of Hearn but did not say what her expectations were - it was not my proposal but her urgent request that I should marry her she frequently went away from me on visits - the trustee for her under the settlement was Captain Atkinson the commander of the schooner St Helena - he frequently visited at our house after the marriage ROBERT BLACKMORE I produce an extract of the marriage register of St Pancras I examined it with the original -

I had one child by him he never treated me very well - I was afterwards separated from him he threatened it several times I have the child still - I did not learn he was married till about seven monthsafterwards I charged him with it - he denied it at first but afterwards admitted it I remember signing a paper which he wished me to do he took the paper - I married him in the name of John Lloyd I cannot tell exactly when I learned that his name was Heath - when he left me he took the greater part of the furniture away I should not have signed that paper had it not been for him - I have no means of subsistence now he would not maintain the child or I would not have proceeded against him - I told him so but he still refused to give me a shilling for the child Cross-examined Q How long were you acquainted with him A About two years - I knew him all that time by the name of Lloyd I never inquired for him by the name of Heath - I was at home with my step-father the prisoner was introduced to me at home - I am sure of that it was not at a dance - that was afterwards I wrote what Mr Lloyd told me and signed it - this was in Devonshire-street six or seven months after we had been married to the best of my recollection I do not recollect when I dated the paper - I believe he had it dated backward I wrote the date - I got about 80l that was laid out in the purchase of a milk-walk which I carried on while he was at the attorney s office the money did not all come into my hands he took the gold and I was to keep the silver - I continued the milk-walk about three months I took it in October - I signed the paper after that he did allow me 15s a week - he did not say if I would leave off drinking and improper company he would continue to allow it but if not he would only allow me 8s I never kept improper company -

the milk business was carrying on there a little girl was there when I called and I asked her for Mr Heath - she went in and Margaret Evans came out and said Mr Heath I suppose you mean Lloyd I said very likely it was Lloyd and I left a note for him MR CLARKSON Q Was their milk business going on A I saw utensils about - I will not swear it was in 1826 it might be before or after Prisoner s Defence I was introduced to the prosecutrix in September 1824 at an assembly in Ship-yard Temple-bar in consequence of unpleasant domestic occurrences I occasionally spent my evening from home and not wishing my friends to know I frequented so low a place I took the name of Lloyd there the prosecutrix did not know any thing relating to me till several months afterwards though she resided in Devonshire-street and I within half a mile of it - I mention this to shew the impossibility of my living there and her not knowing how I was situated previous to Christmas 1825 I told her my residence name and every circumstance I know it took place previous to Christmas 1825 because her residence was then turned into a milk-shop and told her while the front was being taken down she knew this though she comes to day and swears she knows nothing of it - it is for nothing but to extort money from me THOMAS LLOYD I lived in the same house as Heath - he shewed me this paper on the 17th of September 1826 the day but one after it bears date read DEAR LLOYD - You may rest satisfied I will take no advantage of your having a first wife living if we are married 16th Sept 1826 MARGARET EVANS Q You remember this paper being shewn you A Yes and I took a note of it in a memorandum-book -

he desired I should remember it in case any thing should happen I did not say the paper will speak for itself - here is the date on it I read it but did not ask why it was shewn me - I believe I told him it was felony to have a second wife I do not know what he said MR CLARKSON Q You were desired to notice the date of it A Yes MR ADOLPHUS Q Were you at Mr Health s mother s in 1826 A Yes all the year - I saw Margaret Evans there in May that year - there was a child there very ill and who is since dead she asked if that was Mr Heath s and expressed great sorrow at its illness GUILTY Aged 24 Transported for Seven Years

my conversation with his wife was the first that brought the subject to my recollection I only saw the prisoner twice before I saw him at the Police-office - we have seven or eight hundred banns published at Liverpool in the course of twelve months I saw the prisoner about ten minutes when he put up the publication of the banns it is from that circumstance I speak to him and I have no doubt the woman I saw at Liverpool was the person I saw married to him COURT Q Do you clearly recollect her as the person who was married to this man A Yes MR PHILLIPS How long did the marriage ceremony last A Perhaps a quarter of an hour and I had then an opportunity of seeing the prisoner MATTHEW WHITRIDGE I am a tea-dealer I have known the prisoner since 1828 - he then lived with a friend of mine and in 1829 he came to live with me - there was an application from his wife in Liverpool I believe to have some money from him I asked him if he had been married and why he had been married in the name of Machenery I think this must have been in the early part of 1830 he said it was his mother s name and he had frequently gone by that name in his youth and that he was married in that name - I only knew him by the name of John Lillis I believe he was a native of Ireland but I do not know of what part - the conversation took place in consequence of some person calling at the shop and asking for Mr Machenery - they saw him in the shop in my presence and they applied for some money JOHN BARNETT I live with a grocer in Charles-street Manchester-square I have known the prisoner for abouttwelve months last Christmas I have seen him write a great many times I believe this letter No 2 to be his writing also the name of John Machenery to this other No 1 and the signature to these marriage instructions Cross-examined Q You have seen these letters before A Yes - I have not compared them with any writing I speak from my recollection of his writing - he frequently came to the shop where I was to fetch the money sometimes I gave it him and sometimes another young man in the shop - the prisoner signed his initials and frequently when he was there he would write on some paper in the shop he has written his name at full length and my name also and on one occasion I was there every day for a month - I never saw him write Machenery in full but he would frequently write James M Hooper and from the M and the John and the other letters I believe this to be his writing I have seen him write small and large letters and though these signatures are different letters I believe they are his EDWARD BURRIDGE I am an officer of Marylebone-office I apprehended the prisoner on the 9th of July at Calvert s brewhouse I told him it was on a charge of marrying a person named Draper he having a wife living - he said It cannot be me it must be a mistake I said Is not your name Lillis he said Yes I said Did you ever go by any other name he said No I said Did you never go by the name of Machenery he said No I never did I brought in Mrs Machenery unawares - she reproached him with his heartless conduct and said he had robbed her he made no answer but appeared to wish to shun her MARY DRAPER I keep a public-house in Oxford-street I married the prisoner JOHN BURGE I live in Perry-terrace Brewer-street Somers -town - I have known the prisoner about two years- I know Mary Draper I was present at the church of St Pancras on the 24th of October last when the prisoner and her were married I signed my name in the book as a witness - THISTLETON I am clerk of St Pancras -This is the register of marriages there On the 24th of October 1831 John Lillis and Mary Draper were married it is signed by John Burge and several others MR LEE to MR WHITRIDGE Q Can you tell what age the prisoner was in 1828 A He appeared very young at that time I should think he was from twenty to twenty-one - I think it was in August 1829 he came into my service I am quite certain it was not so early as February 1827 COURT Q Did any thing further pass then his saying that he had gone by the name of Machenery A No only that he had used that name in his youth - the person came from Liverpool and asked for Mr Machenery he was at the back of the shop and came forward himself THOMAS DRAPER I am a licensed victualler I brought these letters from Liverpool I received them from Mrs Machenery at the Neptune hotel in the presence of her master and mistress - letters were here read No 1 91 Cheapside London January 26 1829 MRS MACHENERY - I received your letter this morning and in return have to inform you that I have resolved that no alteration shall take place in my first intention respecting the settlement of the money I possess I am much surprised that you should have employed an attorney to endeavour to obtain the money from me as you must be perfectly aware that there is no existing law which can compel me to part with it - when I promised the person who called a few days ago to forward the money it was upon the understanding that I should be totally free from all demands from you in future but I find upon reference to competent authority that that cannot be the case - you seem to insinuate that I possessed myself of the money and then left you but you know perfectly well that I never received it until a long period after my marriage with you and consequently the free act was your own although as your husband the law saw in me the rightful possessor of it - I disclaim all intention of wronging or injuring you but I cannot allow myself to become the dupe of any one whom you may choose to employ against me the money is quite safe in the hands of the person who at present holds it for me and there I am firmly resolved it shall remain - but if at any future period you should be in want of money or assistance you may depend that I will withhold neither from you I am charged with having changed my name from Machenery to Lillis - but although Lillis was the name in which I was brought up Machenery was my father s and consequently the name in which I was compelled to be married and do not think that because I withhold the money from you now that it is my intention to squander it away without your having any prospect of deriving any ultimate advantage from it as it will be my first care to save up all my earnings to increase it with the hope after a short lapse of time of being comfortabley settled with you the reason I have not more money now is that when I was in Scotland I was taken ill which compelled me to part with a great deal of it - I shall always he happy to hear from you and will answer all your letters until I see you again I remain your affectionate husband JOHN MACHENERY To Mrs Machenery Neptune Hotel Liverpool No 2 London 8th January 1828 DEAR WIFE - I take the opportunity of writing these few lines to you hoping to find you in good health thanks be to God which leaves me at present I am about getting a good situation and will save all the money up and will be able to make it up again please God dear wife when I was down in Scotland I had the scarlet fever and I had like to die but now thank God I am quite well - I hope you will forgive me and if you should like to leave you will come up to me or else to go live with my friends I am very sorry that I left but if you would keep your situation I would write to you every three weeks or a month regularly - I hope your master and family are in good health likewise John and family - if you will send me an answer I will write and you would get a situation in London a gentleman I lived with in London had 30l of mine and put it in the savings-bank and I put 8s a week with it - send me an answer by return of post as soon as possible no more at present from your well wisher JOHN MACHENERY Direct No 94 Cheapside London - Please God I will make you happy for the time past JOHN MACHENERY H Machenery Neptune Hotel Clayton-square Liverpool Prisoner s Defence Mr Whitridge has known me nearly five years -

she is still alive and was in court two or three minutes ago Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q When did the marriage take place A On the 2nd of March 1827 I was then about 12 or 13 years of age - I had never seen the prisoner before - I am not mistaken in his person youthful impressions are more lasting than others - I hadbeen present at a great many marriages but not at many soldiers marriages - I cannot say how many soldiers marriages I had been at - they were not married in the church but in our house between two and three o clock in the afternoon - there was no one came with them but a little girl six or seven years old a relation of Miss Smith s - and when the parties did not bring sufficient persons with them my father called in two of his own family and on this occasion he called in my mother and me - my mother is still living but she is not here - the servant was present but she don t remember anything about it - there was no clerk there - it is the parish of Garbals in the county of Lanark JAMES M LEAN I am the last witness s brother - my father is dead - I produce the book of the register of marriages at Garbals it is in the writing of the Clerk of Kirk Session it is here stated that Hierum Holmes of the 9th Lancers and Margaret Smith were married by Dr M Lean on the 2nd of March 1827 Cross-examined by MR CHURCHILL Q Is the Clerk of Kirk Session alive A Yes but he is eighty-five years old WILLIAM SEYMOUR I am an officer in the 9th Lancers - Margaret Smith was a sister-in-law of mine - the prisoner married her without my consent I was at Glasgow with the regiment at the time - I sent Margaret Smith home to her parents but the prisoner afterwards lived with her at Newcastle-upon-Tyne ELIZABETH ABBOT SLEE I lived at Clarence-place Gravesend with my father and mother I was twenty-two years old last month - the prisoner made an acquaintance with me and I was married to him at Gravesend church on the 31st of March last but he married me in the name of Edmund Holmes and my name was put Eliza instead of Elizabeth Abbot I had it altered and we were married again at Gravesend church on the 3rd of April I had when we were married £500 in the funds and he had had £230 of me before our marriage the reason of my advancing this was that when he took me from home he had no money and he asked me for what I had which I gave him and then I sold out some more we were then living at the Nag s Head in the Borough but I had no intercourse with him we lived only as brother and sister I let him have £200 to buy furniture against our marriage and two or three days after we were married he had the rest as he said he had some bills to pay - the broker objected to let me have it and I asked my mamma for a letter to the broker which she gave me and I took it all out I asked the prisoner for it again and he refused to let me have it he said if I did not let him have it he would leave me - I went with him to Gravesend and he then told me that if I lived there I should live on his sister s charity Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q If you did not live with him A No he said I might go home to my mother again if I liked but if I stopped there I should live on his sister s charity - up to the present moment I have been merely as a sister to the prisoner nothing more - his father never told me that the money should be returned - I was not told that the prisoner was a married man previous to our marriage - I was not told so till I went to my mother s about four months ago - I pressed him to marry me after we came to London but not before I came to London with him on the 17th of February last Q Now recollect yourself did you not press him to marry you before your visit to London and did you not frequently write to him in 1832 soliciting him to marry you A Not till after he promised me marriage I did not write to him till he wrote to me - he told me on the night I left home that his father consented to our marriage - I did not state to him that his father would not suffer me into his family - I never intimated that to him to my knowledge - this letter is my writing - read Edmund December 11 1832 I am quite surprised at your strange behaviour to me after professing so much towards me - you certainly have not acted like a man I wrote to you twice and had no answer therefore I sent a friend of mine down thinking you might be ill and when I heard the result I was quite astonished not only astonished but very much hurt to think you have acted so deceitfully towards me after what you said the last time we met I am quite convinced you never meant a word you said although you know what I have gone through for you my friend took the trouble to call on you twice and the second time you sent your father out instead of coming out like a man that showed how guilty you was or else you would not have got your father to have spoken for you Your father told my friend I was not worth coming into your family but it is not because my family bear the name they do that I should for I consider myself as respectable as you in every respect Edmund do not think that by writing this letter to you I ever wish to renew this correspondence again to such a worthless man as you but although you have acted as you have towards me I wish you all the happiness this worth affords and whenever you marry I hope the lady will make you a better wife than I should Hoping when this meets you you will be quite well I for the last time shall bid you farewell With every mark of respect I remain your sincere friend - E SLEE To Mr Edmund Holmes No 2 Windmill-street Gravesend Kent Post paid Witness He had told me that his father was angry with him but he should not mind that - but he afterwards told me his father had given his consent - up to the 10th of December he had not received any money from me - I have preferred an indictment against him for stealing this money MR ADOLPHUS Q Had you heard that he had a wife before you were married to him A No I asked him and he said he had not - he told me that his father had given his consent to our marriage and he went with him to take the license - I saw them go out of the house to get it - the money found at the prisoner s was in the identical bank notes which I had from the stockbroker COURT Q Are we to understand that he courted you as a single man A Yes and I believed he was single and able to marry me legally ROBERT DUKE I am an officer I took the prisoner in Back-lane in the parish of St John Hackney in the county of Middlesex - I found on him a purse with this £10 note in it and in a writing-desk I found these other eleven £10 notes fourteen silver spoons and some other things Prisoner s Defence written My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury - Conflicting as are the feelings which weigh heailyvupon me in my peculiar and unhappy position - and which in their attack upon every nerve wildly contend for mastery I cannot hope with any degree of self-command to be able to address you - and must therefore appeal to your indulging forbearance while entering upon that justification of my conduct which will I firmly and sincerely believe dispose you to declare me entitled to a release from the opprobrium and danger of my present situation High and ardent as were the hopes which painted the happiness of a wedded life and which attended me during my courtship and marriage with the object of my most sincere and heartfelt attachment they were doomed to be severely and speedily crushed by the proceedings of the immediate guardian and protector of the lady - who the moment the ceremony was performed declared it illegal - effected our immediate separation It were a painful and almost useless endeavour my Lord and Gentlemen to attempt depicting the anguish and desolation caused by our final and complete separation To be most decidedly and peremptorily told that my imagined legal claims were unequal to oppose the parental authority which separated us and to reflect with bitter regret upon the peculiar regards which the world would extend towards her from the connection which had subsisted between us - all these of necessity pressed heavily upon me and rendered me in the very dawn of manhood a mere wreck - a solitary and broken-hearted being Would not the deep love my Lord and Gentlemen which characterised my regards have prompted me to seek by legal means the restitution of my connubial rights Assuredly yes But fully convicted of the illegality of the union and impressed with a conviction of my total inability to substantiate my claims I considered that such a course would be but futile and resigned myself in silence to my fate The lapse of some years soothed the keenness of my regrets and I permitted myself upon an introduction to the lady by whom these proceedings are instituted to regard her with feelings which I solemnly declare would never have been encouraged had I considered my first marriage legal or binding Circumstances however effected a change in my sentiments towards her and by the advice of my family I discontinued my attentions Far be it from me my Lord and Gentlemen to attach the slightest stigma to this lady yet I state but the strictest truth in saying that her imprudence in suffering her name to be mentioned with mine in an equivocal manner rendered herself and family improdence on the subject of our marriage It was in vain I assured her that the love which should attend the wedded state was not an inmate of my breast It was in vain my father amid the various obstacles he opposed informed her of my former marriage All was useless - and at length after considerable hesitation and scarcely conquered reluctance I was hurried into an act the commission of which is now attempted to be converted into a crime - and upon which my ruin and disgrace is carefully and unrelentingly planned That I wilfully erred most solemnly do I deny Even after so great a lapse of time some lingering doubts as to the alleged illegality of my first marriage still existing in my mind I took the advice thereon of a respectable solicitor resident in my neighbourhood upon whose given opinion I entered upon my second marriage without the slightest suspicion of acting wrong or contrary to the utmost strictness of the law I have thus my Lord and Gentlemen attempted an outline of the facts and feelings which have been my prompters during the whole of this unhappy train of complicated ills That I should be an object for pity rather than for punishment I do unfeignedly conceive In neither instance did I harbour the remotest thought or intention of effecting a moral injury or legal wrong And now most sincerely - most earnestly do I look foward to your decision which will I firmly trust direct my acquittal and will gladly assure me that the intense hopes I cherish of being restored to the world with honour are not of things to perish GUILTY Aged 26 -

my house and about three weeks after he left this country—I followed him to Sweden—he had married my daughter in 1826 and then went to the Brazils—I followed him to Sweden and bought a farm there for their use and left them there for nearly two years and a half—I went over to Sweden again in August and assisted them with 200l more—I went over again a third time as I heard he was desirous of selling the property—I found he had attempted to make a sale of two small portions of it—they had at that time two children—he was not in circumstances to support my daughter and she returned to London with him afterwards and remained in London for some time—I saw her in 1829 in England—the prisoner came with her to London and lived with her until the beginning of 1831 when she returned to live with me—I do not know what become of him then—my daughter has been under my protection ever since—she has three children—I saw her last on the 24th of September alive Prisoner You represent that I destroyed the estate—you bought it from Ross and said it would be better to buy it in your name—I never tried to sell any thing—the estate was bought in your name and nobody could sell any thing from it—you say you came over and gave me 200l —did you give me 200l Witness When I went over I drew for 200l which was spent on the estate—he attempted to sell two portions of the estate and I was obliged to sanction the sale C L WILLS I was present at the prisoner s marriage with Miss O Donovan at Saint Saviour s church in the borough of Dartmouth Devonshire on the 19th of October 1826—I have

church—I have not seen her since March as I live in London HENRIETTA BABBER I first became acquainted with the prisoner on the 30th of July—I was living at Hornsey at that time—he was teaching French in the family where I was visiting—our acquaintance went on and a marriage was contemplated between us—inquiries were made on the 13th of September about a former marriage—before those inquiries my friends were favourable to the marriage they afterwards changed their opinion and forbid my continuing the intercourse—the prisoner said something about divorce that he had obtained—my father and brothers spoke to him about it—I was not present when it was first mentioned—I heard my father say he should decidedly object to a divorced husband whether the divorce was legal or not and I should not see him—I was induced to disregard that and married him on the 17th September at St Clement Danes—it was with out the knowledge of my parents—I am twenty—three years old WILLIAM BOYLE I am parish clerk of St Clement Danes I produce an examined copy of the register of marriage in that church—I have compared it with the original—I was present at a marriage between the prisoner and the last

Barber is my youngest daughter—she became acquanited with the prisoner—after my daughter said he paid his addresses to her I went and called on him—he represented himself as a widower and that he had some property in Sweden but said if my daughter remained in England with her friends he should wish to remain in England and would then apply himself to get his living by industry—he said he had estates which Lord Dundas had offered him 2000l a year for but he had refused it and he was trying the question in the house of Lords—I said I must have respectable references—he referred me to Lords Eldon and Dundas the Dukes of Wellington and Buccleugh but instead of going to them I made application to the Swedish ambassador and in consquence of what I heard there I went to the prisoner and told him I had applied for legal determination about his divorce but that I had higher authority than Lord Brougham which was the 19th of Matthew which said that a man shall not put away his wife but for adultery and said Has your wife committed herself —he said No she was as virtuous a woman as ever lived —I told him the divorce was illegal and that that was the result of the advice I had taken—I told him this on Monday the 13th of September—he understood what I said to him—I said the divorce was not available in England—he said it was available all over the world and said Well I am a single man in the eye of the law and can marry who I please —I forbad my daughter having any thing to do with him but they were married without my consent—I then wrote to Mr O Donovon and about a week after I went to get my daughter away—Mr O Donovan went to her and saw her—the prisoner came to our house and threatened not only to shoot me but to shoot through the window and behaved very violently—I got a policeman to secure the house and got a warrant for him Prisoner s Defence My present means hinder me from the assistance of a lawyer but from a pure conscience and an English Jury I do not fear any thing—still I must notice the means adopted by my enemies to injure my reputation and character by circulating false statements representing me as a pretented nobleman and a villain daily looking out for English ladies to entrap them into marriage in this country and divorce them in another country—I hope you will banish that from your minds—such malice will prove its own poison—I am the eldest son of Admiral Bruce of Sweden and as such a peer of that country—I was married to Miss O Donovan in 1826—with this marriage I had three children two born in Sweden and the youngest in England—on the 19th of April 1831 my first wife left me with the children to pay a visit to her parents and by her father s persuasion she never returned having sworn never to see me more—the Baron - - wrote to Mr O Donovan to know why he kept my wife from me but I never could get an answer—in January 1833 I was over in my country—I had written to my wife many times to come over but without an answer and in the criminal court of Stockholm I sued her—a warrant was served on her on the 11th of March by two witnesses—the service was duly acknowledged by her own signature and afterwards attested—at the same time there was an exchange of mutual relinquishments of the conjugal rite duly signed by the two witnesses—she did not appear at the court as required by the warrant and the marriage was disannulled with the privilege to appear in three weeks at the Court of High Justice which I wrote to her to do but she did not and it was duly dissolved but by the law she could come before the divorce was dissolved in the Ecclesiastical Court but I got no answer—on the 22nd of April 1834 the marriage was again lawfully dissolved by the Bishop and in September 1835 I was married to Miss Barber—I presume she is in

&c MESSRS CLARKSON and BODKIN conducted the Prosecution REV JOHN MUCKLESTON I am a clergyman of the Church of England and am the brother of Ann Muckleston My sister became acquainted with the prisoner in the year 1826—my father was sub-chanter of Litchfield Cathedral—he and his family were then residing at Wellesbourne in Warwickshire but at the time the prisoner became acquainted with her they were at Leamington—that acquaintance led to a marriage between the prisoner and my sister which I performed at the church at Wellesbourne in Warwickshire—the parties were the prisoner and my sister Ann—I have not been living from home lately—I last saw my sister about three or three and a half years ago—she was residing with my father just before the marriage—I was not part of the family—I was living in Litchfield—I saw my sister in London—it might be about four or five weeks after the marriage—I believe they were married on the 15th of June 1826—I saw her again about a couple of months after the marriage—she has remained under my father s roof from that time—my father has not remained in the same place from that time till now—he has been from ill health travelling from place to place and is now in Devonshire—my sister has lived under his roof where he has been—if any body inquired at Wellesbourne there was no difficulty in finding if she were alive—her family were perfectly well known—in consequence of circumstances after this marriage a divorce was obtained at the instance of the family a mensa et toro and we lost sight of the prisoner from that time to this—we had no certain intelligence of him since two or three months after the marriage—my sister returned home very ill Cross-examined by MR DOANE Q Had you known the prisoner much before the marriage A Very little—I was resident elsewhere—I had seen him before but only for a short time—I came to perform the ceremony—he had been known to my father and sister for perhaps three months—this marriage took place at Wellesbourne Church in Warwickshire—my father has been living in various parts of the country—he went to Bangor where he was resident for three years subsequent to the marriage and from thence to Tenby in South Wales and was there four or five years and from thence to Teignmouth where he is now resident—I cannot say what distance that is from Wellesbourne—perhaps it is 150 miles he has been residing from 1826 at these three places—I have not seen my sister for three or three and a half years—my father was present at the ceremony also two other sisters and Mr Grenville now he was a Mr Hughes then—the prisoner is the first husband my sister has had—he was married in the name of Battersby MR CLARKSON Q How old was your sister A Nineteen or twenty—my father has been in a bad state of health for twenty years—if any inquiry had been made for him in Wellesboume in Warwickshire there would not have been the least difficulty in ascertaining where he was—if any inquiry had been made of me by the prisoner or any one I should certainly have told them—I was living at Litchfield and have been ever since—the prisoner knew that I was there—I was sent for from there to marry them—that is forty miles from Wellesbourne—the prisoner never made any inquiries of me as to where my sister was THOMAS MOSS I am in the service of the Rev D Muckleston I have lived with him sixteen

of my sister— these are them —I examined them with the several registers and ascertained that they were true copies Cross-examined Q How did you examine this certificate A By the church books—it was first copied by the clerk and signed—I did not see it copied—I tested it by the books—I read in the original register of marriages in that church and examined this with the book to see that it was correct—no one read it over to me—I compared them line by line—the clerk produced the register—I believe he had copied it out—the curate gave me the book—I examined every line of this with the register—it is correct— the following certificate were here put in and read — Wellesbourne Church 15th June 1826 Arthur Battersby and Ann Mucklestone both of that parish married by licence — St Michael s Chapel in the parish of St Martin-in-the-fields 14th August 1837 Henry Napier Disney and Mary Ann Stovin both of full age married by licence — Paddington Church Middlesex Nov 18 1837 Henry Napier Disney batchelor and Sarah Ann Stovin spinster MR CLARKSON Q Did you think it necessary to call on the prisoner on the 16th of August last A Yes—he was lodging then in the Strand—I had some conversation with him about his views—he did not say one word to me of his having married my sister—I am sure this was after the 14th of August—I met him in the street about a month ago I then gave him in charge of the officer—he had quitted my sister some time—I believe it was on the 29th of November—I have taken my sister under my protection—the least mention of the subject has been bakery to throw her into fits which she has been very subject to ever since the occurrence—she is not in a fit state to be brought into Court or give evidence on this subject—I have been obliged to call in a person used to the care of insane people recommended by Dr Monro—that was done under the advice of the medical men who have attended her Cross-examined Q When you first met the prisoner you were not then aware he had married your sister A No I was not—I was aware of it I believe two days afterwards—I believe I did call on him after I knew he was the husband of my sister—I certainly did call on him frequently—that was at the house of a Mrs Lewis who lives at No 51 Manchester-street Manchester-square—they were there perhaps three weeks—they afterwards removed to a cottage in Dudley-grove—I visited them there—I saw Mrs Lewis there once or twice—I have most likely conversed with her about the prisoner—I of course have spoken to her on that subject as well as others—I was at that time on terms with the prisoner—upon my oath I did not know at that time he had a wife living—I once taxed him with a report which I heard but it was afterwards flatly contradicted and I gave no farther credence to it—that was before my sister went to reside in Manchester-street—my sister resided is Charles-street but the prisoner never resided there—my sister was a ward in Chancery and did not wish to have the marriage known till the became of age—she became of age before they were married the second time and then they lived together in Dudley-grove—I know my sister s handwriting I believe this is her writing— looking at a paper —I cannot twear to it MR BODKIN Q At the time you taxed him with the rumour about his former wife what answer did he make A He flatly denied having tham another wife living EMILY DRUMMOND I was present at the marriage of Miss Stovin to the prisoner at the Chapel of Ease in Berney-street on the 14th of August—the prisoner is the person who was married to her ABRAHAM NEWLAND I have been acquainted with the prisoner for some years—he began to call himself Disney about nine years since—he was doing nothing at that time in town and I lost sight of him for many years—I never knew him in the army—in July 1835 I happened to meet him in London near Hungerford-market—I think he went by the name of Disney then—I met him again in 1836—I saw him on two or three days on one occasion he alluded to his wife s family—he merely said that some member of his wife s family was residing in the country at a place he mentioned—I think it was Litchfield—he did not mention his wife s name—it was the conversation of a moment—he did not ask what I thought of any thing he was about to do—he was over here I understand on leave of absence—he spoke of returning to Spain and making purchases for officers who were there—he said at the conversation before that it was probable he would go to Litchfield or the place he mentioned where some member or branch of his wife s family resided—he said he was very much attached to Miss Stovin and he should be very sorry that any allusion should be made to the previous circumstances to his previous marriage—this was after the marriage—he said her property was not as large as the papers represented it by any means Cross-examined by MR PHILLIPS Q Were you before the Magistrate A No I was subpoenaed last night—I was in Whitecross-street prison—I asked the prisoner for money when I became acquainted through the means of the papers that he was about to be married—I sent to him to try if he would relieve me from my difficulties—I did not name any amount I asked him to relieve me from my difficulty—that would be getting out of prison—I was in there for 120l or 150l —I mentioned the amount to him but never demanded any sum from him—I sent a person to ask a loan—I do not recollect that I named any amount—I said a mm of money 600l or 700l —I never named any sum to him myself—I did not solicit any myself—I do not recollect asking him for more than that—my messenger was a person of the name of Becker of Vine-cottage Charlton-place New-road—I did not name any sum—I said he ought to give me 600l or 700l on account of my knowing all the circumstances of the case—I did not send any message by Becker—he knew all the circumstances before—we talked them over and we then said that I was labouring under very great difficulties and very much distressed and I said to Becker if he went there he might get some money that would relieve me and assist him—I had no claim upon the prisoner Q Was not this conveyed to him that if he did not come down handsomely you would turn round upon him A No that was not sent—it was said that we knew the circumstances of the case and he had better give 600l or 700l —we did not get the money and I am here as a witness but the business had become known to the prisoner s friends before I said any thing—the thing could not have been known except through me or the prisoner—I expected he would have given me 600l or 700l—I founded that on his fear that I would come against him—if I had got this money I should have been silent on the subject—I gave no information all the family knew it—Mr Becker brought Mr Stovin to me after the prisoner refused the money—I did not know that Becker was going to Stovin s—he met Mr Stovin accidentally—when Becker told me that the prisoner would not give 600l or 700l I said perhaps he would give something less—I said if he will give enough to release me from prison—from 120J to 150/ —I did not say We will come down a little lower —I did not say D—the fellow we will appear against him —I said we would not do any thing we would be silent—I would have been silent under all circumstances Q How much was Becker to have had of the spoil A He was to have had a portion according to what we got—if 150l was got he was to have had half but if 700l was got he was not to have 350l —we were to share the money but he was not to have half of the large sum—I do not recollect what he was to have of that—I remember an advertisement which I drew up—it is lost—it was an advertisement drawn up for the purpose of showing to Disney that we might get the money—it was relating to his former marriage—it was an advertisement which I and Becker threatened to put into the paper exposing the former marriage of Disney and I told Becker to threaten him with it but I told him never to do it—I did not intend to do it—I would not have done it—I would not have injured him to that extent Q How much was the money or the acceptance you demanded of him for the purpose of keeping that back A 600l or 700l was the most I ever asked of him—I know there was an acceptance spoken of—the former I forget but the latter was 150l —I do not recollect the amount of the acceptance I first demanded—to the best of my recollection it was not 1000l—I will not swear it was not mentioned but I do not recollect it—I mentioned 3000l to Becker but I never intended that he should ask that Q If he had got the 25 000l as mentioned in the papers you would have had no objection to have fleeced him of 3000l A I certainly would have asked him for it—Mr Becker was in prison—I met him there—he was there before I went—he is not there now—we were in the same ward—I had not known him before—I saw him this morning and we had some conversation but not in reference to my evidence nor on reference to any message but on the subject of the trial MR BODKIN Q At the time you were carrying on this sort of attempt were you aware that the man s first wife was alive A I did not know that she was alive—I supposed she might be alive—I have been an acquaintance of the prisoner s for some years—I did not know Mr Stovin nor any of his family before this circumstance General de Lacy Evans M P gave the prisoner a good character GUILTY —Aged 30 Transported for Seven Years

t18420131-848  848 RICHARD LIGHT was again indicted for bigamy MR CLARKSON conducted the Prosecution SUSAN HUGHES I was in Shrewsbury in 1832—I knew the prisoner at Mr Eaton s—the prisoner asked me to go to church—I said Ann Davis would rather go —he was often talking of that marriage—the account I gave in the last case is correct WILLIAM BARNES I produce a copy of the marriage register and it is correct—the prisoner called on me and said he was married at St Chad s on the 16th of July 1823 to Emma Fox a dress-maker by whom he had three children that one was dead and that he left his wife and two children in Manchester GEORGE TURNER I am parish clerk of St Peter Walworth in St Mary Newington I have the marriage register in which there is an entry that on the 18th February 1840 No 284 Richard Light and Hannah Butlin of full age widower and spinster by trade a grocer were married in this church Witness GEORGE TURNER ANN BAILEY ANN BAILBY I live in Upper Thames-street I was present at the prisoner s marriage in 1840—he was married to Hannah Butlin—they lived at our house after that—they might have lived two or three months there COURT Q How old was she A I cannot say—I believe about twenty-five Cross-examined Q Did you know her very well A I knew her when she came to our house to lodge—she was a servant—I have not heard that the prisoner got any money with her-—I have not seen her since she left our house which is nearly two years GUILTY Aged 42 — Transported for Seven Years 
t18420822-2503  2503 STEPHEN ALDHOUSE was indicted for bigamy MESSRS CLARKSON and BALLANTINE conducted the Prosecution GEORGE YARROW I am parish clerk of St Leonard Shoreditch I produce the original register of the marriages of that parish—on the 21st of January 1824 I find a notice of the marriage of Mr Aldhouse— reads — Marriage solemnized in the parish of St Leonard Shoreditch Stephen Aldhouse of this parish bachelor and Frances Morse alias Montague of St Giles s Norwich spinster and minor married by license by consent of— 21st January by me Robert Crosby curate —It is signed by Stephen Aldhouse and Mary Morse in the presence of Christian Appold Mary Baker and John George Appold I have not got the license—it is generally rolled up and thrown away in some corner or other—it is not preserved Cross-examined by MR CHARNOCK Q When people are married by license the license is deposited in the chest is it not A In some parishes they give it back to the parties in our parish we generally detain them in the iron safe—I never looked there for this license—I do not know whether it is there or not—it is a thing that is never required JOHN GEORGE APPOLD I live at No 22 Wilson-street Finsbury I know the prisoner—I remember his being married in 1824 at Shoreditch church—I am one of the subscribing witnesses to the register—he and the lady he married went to the church to be married from my father s house—I had not known her previously—I think they remained at my father s house about a fortnight—the bride squinted—I do not know whether I am the only one of the subscribing witnesses alive—I do not know whether Mrs Baker is alive or not GEORGE MORSE I live at Cathurst in Norfolk I know Frances Morse she is an illegitimate daughter of a half brother of mine by a person named Montague—I saw her alive last about a month ago—I am one of her trustees—I have been in the habit of paying her her income since my brother s death which was in April 1833 down to this time but not personally—she squints—this letter looking at one is in the writing of Mrs Aldhouse Frances Morse that was Cross-examined Q You say this lady s name is Montague A No I never knew her by that name—I cannot tell that she is the daughter of a Miss Montague—she is known to me by the name of Morse—she is the illegitimate daughter of my brother by a person named Montague—I cannot say How long it is since this marriage took place—I never saw this lady in company with the prisoner—I am unable to say whether she has been abroad—I do not know that she has been at Madeira——I pay her her money through Barclay s bank I was living in one place and she in another—it is derived from the funds—it is about 92l half-yearly—she has been in the receipt of the property since my brother s death or soon after—I never paid her anything before then—stamp receipts were given by my specific directions at Barclay s banking house and transmitted to me at Messrs Gurney s of Norwich who acted as my bankers—I was always directed to send her a notice to a Mr Hodges in Change-alley saying the money was lying in Barclay s bank on her application for it—she never came to me for it except a month ago—I had not seen her from 1833 to 1842—I have never sought to find her otherwise than by letter in short I never sought her at all she has sought me to ask for her dividend and occasionally she applied to me for money in advance which I have sometimes complied with—it is a month or five weeks since I saw her—it was ten or twelve years before that since—I had seen her perhaps more—I have known her from her childhood—I have not seen her since her marriage in 1824 to my recollection—I have been applied to by the prisoner by letter—I am unable to say when I was first written to by him—I had a letter from him in the year 1837 but that was not the first certainly—when the others came I cannot tell—I have had several letters from him they are destroyed or taken no notice of—I neither answered them or took any care to keep them—they were destroyed to the best of my belief—I cannot form a conception whether the first was five or seven or ten years ago—I had one in 1837 and one or two I daresay before—I had not one in 1833 at least I should say if I had one in 1833 it must have been in the latter part of it because my brother was alive in 1833 and I had nothing to do with the affair then—the prisoner in his early letters to me was constantly asking me to tell him where his wife was—I did not inform him—the question whether the was in existence or not was never put—I never answered any of the letters except the last—he pursued the inquiry in the different letters to know where his wife was—to the best of my belief I never answered any of them—the last letter was in 1837—that letter is in existence and I believe is in Court now and also my answer to it—I never answered any of his letters but that to the best of my belief—that last letter referred to an advertisement which the prisoner had put into the paper but I believe no others did—I will not swear it but I believe it—to the best of my recollection the prisoner s former letters did not refer to an advertisement respecting Mrs Aldhouse offering a reward of 20l to any person that would give information of her—I cannot recollect any thing about it because I took no notice of the letters—I do not of my own knowledge know of any place Mrs Aldhouse has lived in—she has never told me that she has been to Madeira—Morse was the only name she went by—I never knew her by any other name—she never adopted her mother s name—I never had any communication with any of the family till my brother died WILLIAM WEBB I am parish clerk of St James Clerkenwell I produce a register of the marriages of that parish—on the 4th of January 1838 it appears a marriage was solemnized between the Rev Stephen Aldhouse widower clerk in holy orders of No 33 Red Lion-street and Hephziba Roberts widow of Albion-terrace Wandsworth-road Cross-examined Q Was this marriage by licence or banns A By license—I have not got it with me HEPHZIBA ROBERTS I was married to the prisoner at St James Clerkenwell—I was at that time the widow of John Roberts a publican— the prisoner stated himself to be a widower—he said his former wife had died from excessive drinking that she had drowned herself from excestivt drinking and that he and her father identified her body—I have two children by him—I have been separated from him for two years and I think seven months—at that time I had heard of his former wife being alive—I was not able to satisfy myself of the fact at the actual time of my leaving him—my mind was in doubt on the subject—I know a person of the name of Mrs Pool—she has been represented to me as a sister of the prisoner—I once showed this letter to the prisoner and asked him if he knew the handwriting—he said he did not but he believed it to be that of Mrs Aldhouse s sister a lady of the name of Hill who had got his eldest child—I do not know whether I asked him if it was his wife s handwriting Cross-examined Q When did your husband die A On the 17th of March 1837—I was married in the January following—I was in weeds the whole of that time—the prisoner can give the best reason for my not waiting the year out—I had known him about seven months previous to our marriage—he was living at No 33 Red Lion-street Clerkenwell—he was not performing duty anywhere to my knowledge—I heard him preach once during the period at Woolwich church—he introduced himself to me at my own house in Lower Whitecross-street City—at the time I married him I was residing with my father at Albion-terrace Wandsworth-road—I know the prisoner s family—I have seen his father and his two brothers and his sister Mrs Pool—I did not go on a visit to them previous to my marriage—I saw them at my own house—I do not know whether he stated to them that I was his intended wife—I was received by them and treated kindly—I cannot say whether Mr Aldhouse ever represented me to them as his intended—nothing passed between the prisoner s father and brothers and me as to his approaching marriage—I do not recollect that the subject was ever introduced by the father—none of the family attended the marriage—his father has visited me once since our separation but not while we lived together—Mr John Aldhouse visited me once during our stay at Gravesend—Mr Aldhouse s father was a guard to a mail-coach—he resides at Norwich—I was down there three years ago this month I think—I was received by his family very kindly—I went down to ascertain the fact whether the real Mrs Aldhouse was alive therefore it can hardly be said that I went down as his wife—the prisoner s relations were not received at my father s at all—the prisoner s youngest brother visited me at my house in Whitecross-street—that was before the marriage—I never consulted him on the subject of the marriage—he was there frequently before the marriage—I cannot charge my memory How long before—I saw Sir William Forster when I went into the country and received some information from him—I went down to Norwich with that intention—I told him what Mr Aldhouse had told me that his first wife had drowned herself—he said it was a falsehood and if it was true somebody must be humbugging him by receiving the money that was constantly paid to her—he said he had never seen Mrs Aldhouse he did not personally know her—I believe he is one of her trustees MR CLARKSON Q How did the prisoner introduce himself to you A He called at my house in the first instance and asked if I would allow a lady who accompanied him to sit down—he called the following day with a walking-stick and asked my permission to leave it there to which I consented—he called again and again and it ended in this—my eldest child by my former marriage is just six years old—my eldest by the prisoner if turned three and the youngest two COURT Q How long before you separated from him had you a suspicion that his former wife was still alive A My mind was in doubt on the subject from the month of September till March following—I went to see his sister who had never been to see me since my marriage and I had not been in her presence half-an-hour when she told me that his wife was living—I asked her what proof she had of the fact and her reply was at near as I can recollect that her brother had no proof of her death—I immediately went home to my father and stated the circumstance to him and he said in the event of my not being able to prove it I was in duty bound to believe him innocent but if I could prove it there was a home for me to come to—that was one ground of our separation—there were other causes—this letter which has been produced was given to me by Sir William Foster ELIZABETH JOKES I live at Egham in Surrey The prisoner lodged with me ten or eleven years ago—he came from Mr Kingbam s on Englefield-green and took my lodgings for a month—he did not tell me why he took them—he left me about the end of the month suddenly and said he should come back again—he left a deal box behind him—he afterwards returned—he then told me that he had gone away because a sheriff s officer had come from Kingston—he was sitting in the parlour at breakfast and he said if any one came I was to say he was out and he went down the passage into the garden—I told him on his return who it was that came in after him and he said it was for some debts that his wife had contracted and he would not meet them—he said nothing more about his wife—he did not speak of those debts as having been contracted some time before—he did not say any more than that—I told him it was very unpleasant having a person call like that—he said it was some debts that his wife had contracted and he was not able to meet them RICHARD HENRY GEORGE I am son-in-law of Mrs Jones—in 1891 I was living at Egham—I saw the prisoner there and became acquainted with him—he told me he was resident at Egham for a short time owing to some law proceedings that were pending at that time brought on by the extravagance of his wife—he made some remarks respecting an elder child of his—he said if his wife was I think he said a more serene a more quiet woman he should be much more happy in his mind but it is so long ago I almost forget the word—it is eleven years since—it was in June I think Cross-examined Q I suppose you did not make a memorandum of this interesting conversation A Certainly not—whether he said serene or any other expression I would not swear—he said something about debt and something about a wife MR BALLANTINE Q Was it something about a wife living or dead A About a wife living I should conceive because he stated that his wife did not allow him to see his first child or have his first child—of course I concluded that his wife was living MR MORSE re-examined by the COURT The purport of all the letters I received from the prisoner as far as my recollection goes was to know where his wife was—speaking of her as my wife and what has become of her —an annuity was paid to her after her separation and has been up to this day—it would not have become his if she had died—it was willed to her by my brother to her sole and separate use during her life and afterwards it goes to her children Q Might not his inquiries have been to know whether there was anything to which he was entitled under the impression that she was no longer receiving it that she was dead A It never appeared so to me—the last of those inquiries was in 1837—I cannot recollect when the first was—they might have come at various times—there were none as early as 18 30—I never had anything to do with the property until my brother died which was on the 6th of April 1833—I have no objection to state my motive for keeping him ignorant of the place of her abode—I returned no answer except to the last letter—that was in 1837—I did not tell whether she was or where she was—I had every reason to believe from various histories that I had heard that his motive was not a good one—and as far as relates to his inquiries as to where his wife was I was in total ignorance of her residence—I could not have told anybody where she was—I could not tell myself—I tried to discover in various ways—I merely corresponded with her about her money and my letters were always desired to be addressed to a Mr Hodges in Change-alley Cornhill—that correspondence was with her—she wrote merely Address to me at Mr Hodges No 20 something Change-alley Cornhill —she studiously kept her residence concealed from me as she has more than once stated to me fearing I should tell her husband where she was—she was not living at Norwich to my knowledge—she was born there and it was her home until she married—she was always called Morse—my brother did not educate her as a child—the mother lived in a separate house—he visited the mother constantly and always brought her sister and two sons up in the same name—I was not at the christening of any of them—I never heard her called by the name of Montague nor do I believe she ever was—I was not present at the marriage—she invariably bore the name of Morse—Sir William Foster is my co-trustee for the children and co-executor—she never resided where Sir William Foster lived—he never saw her at all I believe at least not to know her—he could not have given any information about her Q So that all inquiries would have been baffled if the prisoner had made them most diligently to find her out A As far as we were concerned but in his letters to me he always asked me to tell him where his wife was—I understood from her when I saw her a month ago that they have been separated nearly thirteen years—since her separation I have always understood she has been attending to the education of her two daughters and keeping them as far as possible concealed from the family entirely eluding inquiry—she has the interest of a little more than 5 000l in the 31/2 per Cents —I should suppose it was his interest in a pecuniary point of view to have lived with her and that always appeared to me to be the motive for his letters—I have never seen her since her marriage until a month ago—I did not see her when she was married—I know her before she married—she has always gone by the name of Aldhouse since her marriage—I have directed letters to her and she has written to me—the prisoner s inquiries were after that person as his wife—I was the half brother of her father COURT to R H GEORGE Q Your conversation with the prisoner was as far back as 1831—was there anything to draw your recollection to the precise language that passed A Why he was stating that his partner in life was not a very comfortable one he could not live with her—I understood that he was involved in law proceedings—probably it was on account of a by-gone transaction of his wife s—my impression is that he spoke of his wife as then living—he was not a stranger I had met him several times on the same ground—my impression at the time was that his wife was living—he stated it in that way—he did not positively say his wife was living—he said his wife would not allow him to see his child—that he particularly spoke of and it was a child for whom he had some fondness apparently—he spoke of that precise time—that is my impression—I am confident it was in 1831 because I came to Egham in April 1831—I was at Wandsworth before the Magistrate but was not called Q What led to this familiarity between you and the prisoner that he should talk of his affairs to you A He frequently took the same walk that I took in the evening and from the number of times I saw him we came into conversation with each other and from his dejected manner I took the liberty of asking him the cause of his appearing so dejected—I am confident of the time from letters which I have at home ELIZABETH JONES re-examined The prisoner left a deal box behind with me—about a year and a half ago my son-in-law took the hinges off it—Mrs Aldhouse came down and I gave all the letters up to her—I do not know How the box came to be left behind—he had nothing more to take away—I did not know but that he was going to return—he only lodged with me a month and I think it is about ten years ago—I am sure it was not in 1829—it was about May I think—George was not my son-in-law at that time—he worked at Egham as a saddler GUILTY Aged 40 —Recommended to mercy having lost sight of his first wife for so many years and no attention being paid to his inquiries respecting her — Transported for Seven Years The prosecutrix stated that the prisoner received 100l from her father on her marriage that the prisoner had represented to her that he was appointed head master of a proprietary school at Gravesend and unless married he should lose it instead of which he was merely endeavouring to establish a private one and that she had submitted to a continued series of ill-usage from him

the 20th of May 1825 by William Knight rector in the presence of Sarah Quested and Sarah Haynes —I know that a marriage between two persons of these names took place at that time—I do not know the persons—it is a common occurrence with us—I was the witness to this Cross-examined by MR PRENDERGAST Q You do not remember any marriage taking place A Yes I do sir—I am not the registrar of the

margin of this license is the writing of Mr Wright the rector—he was the rector then and is so now and has been ever since 1816 JOHN WILLIAM WOOD I live in Priory-road Wands worth-road I know Mrs Cook—her name before she was married was Sophia Ann Thomas—I married her eldest sister Mary—I knew Mrs Cook I think eight or nine years before she was married—she usually went by the name of Sophia only—I always called her so and all her friends called her so—I know the prisoner—while I was courting my wife I was in the habit of seeing him there frequently in Judd-street in the parish of St Pancras—that was in the beginning of 1824—I continued to see him there till I married in April 1825—after my marriage I saw him and the person who once went by the name of Sophia Thomas—they were then living together as man and wife—I think the last time I saw Mrs Cook was in Sept last—I have not seen the prisoner write but I have received letters from him and have acted on those letters as coming from him—I have seen him afterwards on those letters—this signature in this register is his handwriting Cross-examined Q What do you mean by acting upon those letters A I think I replied to one letter he wrote to me—I have had about four letters altogether—I have not talked to him about them when I saw him—I have seen him after the receipt of his letters—I think the letters have not been the subject of conversation on any occasion—in the last letter he asked me to go down and dine with him in the neighbourhood of Claremont—I wrote him an answer and declined it COURT Q Have you had any communication with him on the matters contained in any of those letters A No I think not—his letters to me were respecting Mrs Cooke and I handed those letters over to her but I did not reply—Mrs Cooke the prisoner s wife was at that time in Sloane-street MR DOANE Q Are you acquainted with Mrs Cooke s handwriting A Yes—this name Sophia Thomas in this register is her writing I am sure—I think the last time I saw the prisoner and his wife in company was in the spring of 1844—I think that was the last time I saw them together MR PRENDERGAST Q His wife was called frequently Sophia A Yes—I knew her name was Sophia Ann and so did all her relatives—my name is John William Wood—they generally call me John COURT Q Was she in the habit of writing her name Sophia A Yes I have seen her write it so MR PRENDERGAST Q Have you seen her write Sophia Ann A I think not—I cannot recollect it—I saw the prisoner and her together when they called at where I now reside—they remained with me perhaps half an hour—I had seen them from time to time before that—she was called Mrs Cooke—she was not called by the name of Alvinza—I believe she went away from him not very early after the marriage—there was a child born and some little time after she left him—she did not go by the name of Alvinza at that time—she has been known by that name within the last year or two—the other names she has gone by have been Thomas and Cooke—I do not know that she has gone by the name of Thomas since her marriage—I have not heard of it—she has not gone by the name of Winthorp—she has a daughter—I do not know that her daughter has gone by the name of Alvinza—I never knew her called so—she is seventeen or eighteen years old—I do not know that she writes her name Alvinza—I never received a letter from her—Sophia Thomas is now in France—my wife has received letters from her from France—she has frequently called at my house before 1844 but I think I had never seen the prisoner with her then—she is now learning music—I do not know that she is entered at a school by the name of Alvinza MR DOANE Q Do you know of your own knowledge why Mrs Cook took the name of Alvinza A She never told me—I believe she assumed that name in France WILLIAM ROBERT ELLIS I live in Park-place Villas Maida-hill I know the prisoner I know Miss Hannah Mary Chapman I was at the parish church of Norwood in Middlesex on Monday the 26th of Aug last when a marriage was solemnized with her and the prisoner—I am a barrister—I received a letter from the prisoner—I wrote to him in answer to it—I can positively swear that this is the letter—it is signed by the prisoner—this letter contains a proposition to settle on Miss Chapman 916l 3s 6d and one-third of two shares on the Barnsby Canal—when the proposal of marriage with Miss Chapman was made Lady Ellis stated he should have 500l with her—she said she would give 250l and she could answer that her father would give 250l —this letter was written after that—I paid the prisoner either 85l or 100l a few days previous to the marriage—I believe he received altogether 250l but I cannot speak to my own knowledge Cross-examined Q You have never seen the prisoner write A Yes I saw him execute the settlement—I saw him write once in a formal stiff hand—I can swear to the best of my belief that this is his handwriting because I have had conversation with him on the subject of this deed— letter read — Southall Park Aug 12 1845 My dear Sir —I thank you for your kind offers of assistance in any matters relative to your dear cousin and myself There is one little affair in which you can most essentially serve me and I am sure you will not refuse When I first addressed dear Mary I assure you it was not with the most remote wish or thought that with her I should receive one sixpence fortune however from Lady Ellis s kindness and consideration this will not be the case and as I do not like to be altogether thought insensible of appreciating her ladyship s liberality and also as I wish to provide in the best way I can although but a humble one for dear Mary s future comfort will you but I know you will give me your opinion upon the following proposal Under the will of her mother my late wife was entitled to 916l 3s 6d I think the shillings are right I know the pounds are payable on he death of her father now sixty-eight and also to one-third share of two shares in the Barnsby Canal present price each 280l This of course is mine at the death of Mr Armstrong I propose that you would draw out a deed expressive that the above properties should be placed in the hands of trustees I submit that yourself and Mr Henry Wood should be named if you both will undertake the office the interest for our mutual benefit daring our lives and at the death of us both that the principal should be divided equally amongst as many children as may be living I should also wish that a clause should be inserted saying that upon the consent of myself and dear Mary and the two trustees that it shall be possible to give up to us 500l of the sum—I will just explain my reason for this wish As far as we can see at present prosperity is with us in the world but God only knows what is in store for us it may be that hereafter misfortunes may occur and I think that with that sum at our command we could by perseverance and industry perhaps redeem our lost position Now will you candidly tell me have I put my wish in a manner likely to suit the interests of dear Mary any suggestion from you to alter the plan believe me I will receive most thankfully my only object is to make a provision against possible though I trust not probable adversity One favour in addition I have to ask your perfect silence on the subject I have not as yet told Lady Ellis I may or may not but to dear Mary I mean it to be an unexpected marriage-gift when I place the deed in her hands on our return from church If you will let me know how much the stamps will cost I will send or call with the amount the sum altogether will be nearly 1100l not much of a settlement you will say but my only excuse is that it is the best I can do Perhaps you will be good enough to let us hear from you in a day or two at your convenience I mentioned to Lady Ellis that I was about writing to you and she desired me to say that little Willy is very well and happy and has expressed his intention of going with her ladyship to chapel on Sunday I fear my long letter must have tired you so with every wish and prayer for the health and happiness of yourself and family request you to believe me most faithfully yours RICHARD COOKE Witness In consequence of this letter I prepared this settlement and it was executed by the prisoner—I believe the signature to this marriage register to be his handwriting—I believe the signature Richard Cooke to this letter to be his handwriting Cross-examined Q You would hardly venture to speak to this handwriting A I have not a doubt of its being his handwriting GEORGE WYTHE DANIELS I am a surgeon and live at Southall Park—that is an establishment now carried on by Lady Ellis and was formerly by Sir William Ellis—the prisoner was in my service there for some time—he came in the early part of 1845 and was with me some months—during that time I had occasion to become acquainted with his handwriting—I was an attesting witness to this deed—I saw the parties sign this deed—I believe this signature Richard Cooke to this register of a marriage is the prisoner s handwriting—I believe the signature to this letter to be his handwriting— letter read — 21st March 1844 Dear Sir —I yesterday addressed a letter to your son with proposals to bring to a close our present unfortunate situation and my object in writing to you now is that you will kindly lend us your assistance towards the accomplishment of such a desirable event You will perhaps think it rather a bold request on my part after the letters I have addressed to you but I trust that you will in your goodness forgive the part as I assure you that nothing but downright starvation staring us in the face could have prompted me to such a measure on my part I am willing to repeat any apology you may suggest or sign any one you may require I will inform you the terms on which I rely on your interference and favour in our behalf I have written to Mr C Armstrong begging that he will not prevent Bessy raising 200l upon her reversionary interest at your decease The manner in which I propose expending it is as follows 150l in the purchase of a business which I can complete under most favourable circumstances at Cobham in Surrey 50l to be paid to your son which he advanced us since the disposal to him of Mrs Buosseto s legacy and the remainder to purchase whatever stock may be wanting and necessaries attending our removal In return for this I propose that Bessy shall settle the whole of the remainder of her property both in possession or which hereafter she may be possessed of to heir or heirs and you in trust for the benefit The day after this deed it signed I will marry Bessy and then I trust an end to all our troubles The business at Cobham is a most excellent one and the purchase-money includes shop fixtures a bottle stock not very large and a good portion one sitting and two bed-rooms full of household furniture The 200l I propose paying off at the rate of 50l per annum so that in four years we shall be free The rent is only 26l a good house shop with every convenience for business and no opposition with 2 300 inhabitants with my attention and qualification for business I think I can appeal with confidence even to you—as to my success in Bath it will prove what my assiduity and patience effected You may say on reading this letter if my intentions are honourable why not marry Bessy before this settlement is made I will tell you—owing to my insolvency were I to do so my former creditors could claim every sixpence of Bessy s property in liquidation of their debts to the amount of 3 600l This I am sure you will see with me is best avoided Now sir that I have pointed out to you the bright side of our prospects I will state the dark side To rescue us from our late distressed and dreadful condition we are determined to do something If your son refuses his sanction to the mortgage Mr Binns has a purchaser for the whole of the reversion with all its faults for 466l and with a full knowledge of the consequences Bessy will sell it In every money transaction with you and your son I have taken from Bessy a written consent and authority for the act indemnifying me from all consequences We have laid the whole case before counsel and are aware that if you and your son can prove that you were not aware of our living together unmarried we are liable to be indicted but the greatest punishment that would be awarded would he six or twelve months imprisonment Now sir this for the sake of hereafter providing for ourselves and poor children three and another coming we are prepared to undergo you can only punish us once and then Mrs Bousfield s legacy will also be Bessy s Now sir I implore you to pause before you consign your child and me to a dungeon and my poor old mother and the poor children to a workhouse For your child s welfare I am sure I need not plead as her affection for you has ever been in the extreme and her love for you even now greater than for any one on earth As to myself I believe I was not mistaken when I reckoned upon you as my best friend with your son and I was only sorry that I could not do more to prove my gratitude than lay in my power We throw ourselves upon your and your son s power and may the Almighty God incline you to be merciful towards us If not do not think that we shall shrink from our purpose—we shall not for imprisonment will be far far better than the penury and wretchedness we have suffered the last eighteen months In case your son should not believe my statements I have sent him the agreement for the sale of the business to me and the authority sent to Bessy by Mr Binns for the sale of the reversion In conclusion let me beg and pray of you to grant us your interference and favour and in the hope that you will write to me by return of post I am dear Sir yours &c R COOKE Bessy desires her kind love to you and Mrs Armstrong Addressed to Mr Armstrong The marriage settlement was here read by which the prisoner proposed to convey to trustees for the benefit of Hannah Mary Chapman his intended wife and their children 916l 3s 6d which he was entitled to under the will of Dorothy Armstrong also one-third of two shares in the Barnsby Canal JAMES CHILD I am an artist and live in Bedford-street Covent-garden I have known the prisoner about twenty or twenty-one years ago—I think it must be before his marriage—he came for a picture of himself and a lady who was with him—I know the lady—I have frequently seen her since—the last time I saw her was the last week in Sept or the beginning of Oct 1845—I think she was first introduced to me as Miss Thomas and I always knew her afterwards as Mrs Cooke—I dined with her last year in a lodging-house at No 8 Cecil-street with her sister and her daughter Cross-examined Q She was not living with the prisoner A No—I have known her by the name of Cooke—she was living by the name of Alvinza in Cecil-street—I think I have known her by Chat name two years—I think not three years—I never knew a Mr Alvinza—I saw Mrs Cook in Sept —I have not seen the prisoner in her company since they quitted me in 1825 or 1826—I have seen Mrs Cooke many times since—I think for eight years I never saw her at all—I understood she was abroad—I have generally seen her at my house and once I called on her in Sloane-street—she was living there in the name of Alvinza and her daughter was called Miss Alvinza—I have known her by that name MR CLARKSON Q Did you know Mrs Cooke by the name of Alvinza except from her own representation A No—from all I know of her I have every reason to believe her to be a person of the most perfect respectability—she told me she went by the name of Alvinza COURT Q Did she give you any reason for taking that name A That she was in some measure intimidated by Mr Cooke CHARLES EDWARD ARMSTRONG I have a daughter named Elizabeth—she had property to the amount of 916l and she has it still by the will of her grandmother—my wife s name is Dorothy—my daughter was never married to the prisoner—she is still alive CHRISTOPHER RICHARD PALMER I am a solicitor and live at Ware in Hertfordshire In 1844 I knew Mrs Cook who was Miss Thomas—in consequence of seeing her I was afterwards in communication with the prisoner—a separation by deed was alluded to and his marriage was alluded to incidentally—he mentioned that he had been married at St Michael s Bristol and I think the year was mentioned but I am not certain—1825 I think—I know the prisoner s writing intimately from the communications I have received I have no doubt whatever that the signatures in this marriage register of Richard Cooke and Sophia Thomas are the writing of the prisoner and Mrs Cooke—the first communication made to me was in Feb 1844—I did not see the prisoner subsequent to Feb or March but I saw Mrs Cooke through the rest of the year COURT Q Did you communicate with him A Not with him—I had corresponded with his solicitor MR CLARKSON Q Did you procure a copy of the register of marriage at Norwood in Aug last year A Yes—I examined the copy with the register—Richard Cooke is described as a widower GUILTY Aged 41 — Transported for Seven Years

was alive last Saturday Cross-examined by MR PRENDERGAST Q She was not only alive but rather lively was she not A I do not know anything about that—I do not know whether she had had a child or two—I do not know whether she has lived with somebody—I do not know what name she goes by—I found her out by inquiring for Ann Warwick—I think she does not go by the name of Sinclair—I saw one child which might be four or five years old—I knew the prisoner before he was married—he was seaman—he was about seventeen or eighteen when he was married—I knew Ann Warwick perhaps two or three years before she was married—I know nothing about her being loose in her morals—she did not appear to be walking about the town—it is immaterial to me how she got her living—I do not know what her parents were—I do not know whether she and the prisoner were lodging in one house when they were married—I never knew her parents—I do not know what age she was when she was married JANE WELLS I am living in Queen-street Ratcliff with my mother who keeps a shop for the sale of nautical instruments—I became acquainted with the prisoner by his coming to the shop—I married him at Christ Church Rotherhithe on the 26th of Oct 1845 Cross-examined Q I believe you married privately that your friends should not know anything about it A Yes he wished it to be private and I consented to it—he came to me as a single man—his sisters told me that he had been married and that he had been tried—I am not now engaged to a gentleman—a gentleman paid me some attention but when I told him this circumstance it was dropped directly—no one knew that I was married and therefore it was likely that any one might pay me attention—I was married before and was a widow without children—the first time I married it was without my friends knowing anything about it—I told them of if about twelve months afterwards—I made my brother acquainted with my having married the prisoner about three months afterwards—my friends

I married him about six weeks after they gave me that information—he was just on the point of going to sea when I married him—he told me that Judge Cress-well who tried him told him he was a free man and when he went to get the license the proctor told him he was all right—I did not take his sister s advice I took his advice—I lived in the same house with my mother when it occurred—I went out to be married and returned to my mother s MR BALLANTINE Q Before his sisters said this did he say he was married A No he always said he was not—after I had received this communication from them I spoke to him about it—he said he was married but had never seen his wife from the hour he was married—he afterwards said Justice Cresswell tried him and he said he was a perfectly free man—I believed that at the time I married him—I kept the marriage secret because my friends were opposed to it and he wished it to be kept secret—he told me at one time that he had been to a proctor and he told him it was illegal unless he took me to the continent—a gentleman has made proposals to me since but I immediately told him of this the same hour GEORGE MALLANDINE I am a clerk in the library of the Bank of England I remember the time when the prisoner was paying attention to Mrs Wells—he and I were on board the Duke of Manchester and I had a communication with him on the subject of his first wife being alive—I argued the question with him about the impropriety of his marrying again—he said he thought he could be married again—I told him I thought it was quite illegal and if he was so situated that he could not live without the lady he had better go to sea and see if anything turned up that his former wife might die and then the obstacle would removed Cross-examined Q Your notion was that if a man were very warm in love a sea-voyage might do him good A Yes—he told me he thought he could legally marry he thought his first marriage was done away with but I thought not—before we parted he was inclined to my opinion that it was better to wait—this was said on board the Duke of Manchester the vessel in which he had just returned form the West Indies—Mrs Wells sent me down there to see him—I

to handcuff him—he nearly threw me into the Dock if there had not been a barrel there I must have gone in—I have a certificate of his marriage at Rotherithe Church—I got it at the minister s house—I saw it extracted and examined it with the book Cross-examined Q The prisoner said you had no right with him at all A Yes he did say so and when I got to the station he said I might get a committal but not a conviction—he said When you have charged me I shall be done with MR PRENDERGAST called JOHN HOLLAND I live at No 2 Oval-cottages Hackney-road I have known the prisoner since he was a boy—we were boys together—he has been a decent respectable person—I knew him in Liverpool about seven years—he was captain of a large vessel called the Sarah of about 600 tons—he conducted himself as a respectable man—he raised himself to his present situation by his good conduct MR BALLANTINE Q Did you hear that he had been tried and convicted and sentenced to twelve months imprisonment A Yes certainly I heard it—I know it from report—I cannot say anything about it—I suppose I must believe it—I merely state that I knew him in Liverpool for six or seven years and during that time he was a respectable man—I am merely speaking of the time I knew him there—I believe he married in Liverpool but that wife is dead—I do not know exactly when that was—I knew him well but I did not know when he married—I did not know a Mrs Fenwick of Newcastle—I had heard that he had a wife alive but I had nothing to do with it—I merely speak of his good character MR PRENDERGAST Q Did you know of the marriage at Liverpool till after it had taken place A No —that was the person whom I understood he was indicted for marrying—apart from that circumstance I believe him always to have borne the character of a respectable man—that is the character I have always heard of him FREDRICK PELHAM I produce a certificate which I got from the Crown-office of the Country Palatine of Lancaster—
